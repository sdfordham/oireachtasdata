That review has been completed and on 27 January 2017, the then Minister signed the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2017. These regulations focus on tenant safety and include new measures covering heating appliances, carbon monoxide and window safety. With very limited exemptions, these apply to local authority and voluntary housing units as well as private rented residential accommodation.</p><p>All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with the regulations.  Responsibility for enforcement rests with the relevant local authority.</p><p>The purpose of the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2017 is to provide a basis standard for decent, safe and secure accommodation.  Policy measures relating to radon detection and remediation are primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  At this stage, I have no plans to amend the regulations to introduce mandatory radon testing in rented accommodation but I will keep the matter under review.</p></reply>

In December 2017, the Government approved the commencement of work on a General Scheme of a Water Environment (Abstractions) Bill which will govern the abstraction of water in a proportionate and efficient way.</p>  <p>  I intend to return to Government in the coming weeks with a draft General Scheme of this Bill.  A public consultation process will then be launched and the outcome of that consultation will inform the further development of the Bill.</p>  <p>  While no decisions will be made on any proposals in this regard until the public consultation is complete, I expect that a proportionate abstraction control regime can be developed that will effectively manage abstraction risks and pressures without imposing an unnecessary regulatory burden.  Ireland has relatively low abstraction pressures with 6% of water bodies nationally having had abstraction pressures identified by the Environmental Protection Agency as potentially posing a risk to the bodies' environmental objectives. I expect that any control regime will focus on the most significant abstraction volumes and pressures, recognising that the Directive does not require the registration and licensing of private wells serving individual domestic dwellings.</p></reply>

Under this approach, rents are set at levels to recover the construction costs and to facilitate the management and administration of developments, but with only a minimal profit margin included. </p>  <p>   A pilot project is currently being progressed by D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, at Enniskerry Road in Dundrum, in conjunction with the Housing Agency and Approved Housing Bodies, using land owned by the Agency. </p>  <p>   Learning from the initial experiences in the pilot scheme, my Department is working with the European Investment Bank and other key stakeholders with a view to developing the first major cost rental project in Dublin city. Initial feasibility analysis is underway with a view to identifying a major project for immediate progression, with a broader programme of cost rental projects across Dublin and other cities to follow. </p>  <p>   I announced new measures in January of this year that are specifically targeted at delivering more affordable homes to households generally with maximum income of &euro;50,000 for single applicants and &euro;75,000 for joint applicants. The income criteria for access to a cost rental scheme will take into account the broader policy development on affordable housing.</p></reply>

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of homeless accommodation and related services rests with individual housing authorities. </p>  <p>  The March homelessness report published last week shows that 2% of the 6,035 adults accessing emergency accommodation during March were aged 65 or over. While the proportion of homeless adults who are in this age category has remained relatively static since we began collating this information in 2014, numbers have risen overall, in line with increases in presentations across all demographics, and there are now 49 more people over 65s in emergency accommodation than there were in December 2014.</p>  <p>  The long-term housing needs of families and individuals, including the elderly, who are in emergency accommodation, will be met through a range of social housing supports such as the Housing Assistance Payment scheme and through general social housing allocations.  Significant progress is being made and in 2017 4,729 individuals exited emergency accommodation into independent tenancies, a 54% increase on the 3,079 recorded in the previous year.  </p>  <p>   It is a priority for me and my Department to continue to reduce the number of people experiencing homelessness. In addition, the issue of housing for older people more generally will be addressed in a joint policy statement between my Department and the Department of Health, which will be published this summer.</p></reply>

In particular, the PPG envisages the submission of a report to Government and the Oireachtas on potential measures to boost local government leadership and accountability, and to ensure that local government funding, structures and responsibilities strengthen local democracy. </p>  <p>  Proposals to address a number of the PPG requirements have been the subject of consideration by Government. Among the issues addressed in this context is municipal governance, including the questions of town or borough status and local electoral areas, as referenced in the PPG. Following recent consideration by Government, a paper on this matter has been referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning, and Local Government, for consideration.</p>  <p>  The draft paper contains proposals for enhanced urban governance in the local government system, including strengthening the role of the relevant municipal district members in areas such as financial and budgetary matters, economic, social and cultural regeneration and development of towns, and co-ordinating and prioritising investment in that regard. I understand that the Joint Committee will consider this and other papers on local government matters pursuant to the PPG at a meeting on 31 May.</p></reply>

They set out the Government&rsquo;s broad framework for the delivery of housing for people with disabilities through mainstream housing policy and were developed as part of a coherent framework, in conjunction with the Government&rsquo;s mental health policy, <i>A Vision for Change</i>, and the <i>Congregated Settings Report</i>. The partnership approach adopted under the Strategy recognises that the provision of suitable housing is only one element in supporting people with disabilities to live fully inclusive lives. </p><p>Implementation of identified actions in the <i>National Housing Strategy for People with a Disability</i>is being driven primarily by the Housing Agency, through a dedicated sub-group comprising representatives from my Department, the HSE, Department of Health, local authorities, the Irish Council for Social Housing and various disability representative organisations.  Through that forum, a Steering Group was established last year to progress actions in relation to meeting the housing needs of people with a mental health disability.  Following completion of a final review of a pilot project trialling a tenancy support officer for a number of individuals transitioning from HSE owned mental health facilities in Laois/Offaly, in January this year my Department approved a funding contribution of 50% towards tenancy sustainment costs to support the national roll-out of this project over the three year period 2018 to 2020.  The remaining 50% of costs are being funded by the HSE, with the approval of the Department of Health. My Department will continue to work with the HSE on housing needs for individuals experiencing mental health issues and for those who require additional housing supports.</p></reply>

While there is no single universally accepted definition of housing affordability, the widely used internationally accepted benchmark is that households, particularly low- to moderate-income households, should ideally not be paying much more than one third of their disposable income on accommodation costs.  </p><p>Of course, affordability and access to affordable housing are significantly influenced by the supply of homes to buy and rent and competition in the market. Therefore, the Government has taken significant action to increase housing supply through the <i>Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness</i>. This is having a significant impact, particularly for those on lowest incomes, with nearly 26,000 households having their social housing needs met in 2017, significantly ahead of target.</p><p>More generally and in order to increase overall house-building at scale, a suite of actions are underway, including, for example, actions to fund infrastructure, streamline planning, and reduce building costs. There is evidence that these measures are working with housing planning permissions and commencements growing by 27% and 41% respectively on an annual basis, based on the latest published data. </p><p>There is also evidence of large-scale residential developments securing planning permission through the new fast-track Strategic Housing Development (SHD) process in An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p><p>The Government is committed to ensuring that housing is affordable for households on low to moderate incomes. Recognising that people want a choice of affordable purchase and rental, depending on their stage of life and circumstances, we are progressing both through a range of initiatives.  </p><p>I announced new measures in January specifically targeted at delivering more affordable homes to households generally with maximum income of &euro;50,000 for single applicants and &euro;75,000 for joint applicants. Based on initial estimates, the initiatives have the potential to deliver more than 3,000 new affordable homes to buy or rent, with a target delivery of at least 10,000 new affordable homes in the medium term. The emphasis initially will be on delivering affordable homes from the public land bank, particularly in urban areas where affordability issues are greatest. </p><p>Recognising that there are enabling infrastructure requirements on some sites, I am also providing Exchequer funding of &euro;25 million, over 2018 and 2019, as a key contribution towards the delivery of more affordable housing from local authority land.</p></reply>

These reports are based on data provided by housing authorities, produced through the Pathway Accommodation &amp;amp; Support System (PASS).  The reports are collated on a regional basis. </p>  <p>  During the compilation of the March Homeless Report, in the course of examining data from local authorities, my Department established that a number of local authorities had miscategorised individuals accommodated in houses and apartments, owned or leased by the local authorities, including in some instances people renting in the private rented sector but in receipt of social housing supports, as being in emergency accommodation.  As these issues have not yet yet been fully addressed, I am not in position to provide a complete account of the extent of such practices. My Department is writing to local authorities as part of its continuing examination of the matter.</p>  <p>  However, I can say that a total of 247 adults and 331 associated dependents, residing in houses and apartments, were categorised as being in emergency accommodation in the Dublin, South- West, Mid-West, North-East and South-East Regions.  These categorisations were corrected prior to the publication of the March report.  I flagged the issue that had arisen very clearly when publishing the March figures and was also clear that the figures would have been higher had the corrections I referred to not been made. </p>  <p>  My priority as Minister is to ensure that families and individuals are moved from emergency accommodation, such as hostels, hotels and family hubs, into housing.  I am satisfied that individuals and families who are being accommodated in publicly funded houses or apartments, whether it be social housing or homes leased from the private rented sector, should not be considered as living in emergency accommodation.  </p>  <p>   The issues which have emerged indicate clearly to me  that we need improved reporting in this area in order to accurately reflect the numbers of households in emergency accommodation so that we can measure our progress and target our further policies and actions.  My Department is examining the current reporting arrangements with a view to ensuring that the best possible data is available to support policy making. No decision has been taken on amending the existing arrangements at this stage.</p></reply>

To this end, details of some 1,700 hectares of land in local authority and Housing Agency ownership were published on the Rebuilding Ireland Housing Land Map, with the potential to accommodate some 42,500 homes nationally. The map also includes details of some 300 hectares of land in the ownership of other State or semi-State bodies, with the potential to deliver a further 7,500 homes. All of the mapped sites can be viewed at the following link: <i>. </i></p><p>To date, State-led residential construction has been primarily aimed at helping to meet the needs of households in the lowest income brackets, i.e. for social housing. With increased Exchequer investment to deliver 50,000 new social homes by 2021, the significant expansion of the social housing build programme is evident in the <i>Quarter 4 2017 Social Housing Construction Status Report</i>, which was published on 19 April.  The programme includes 850 schemes (or phases) at the end of last year, delivering over 13,400 homes, a very substantial increase on the 8,430 homes in the programme a year earlier. The full report can be accessed at<i>. </i></p><p>In relation to the delivery of affordable homes, I am re-introducing an affordable purchase scheme, under the relevant provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, and I am determined to establish a substantial cost rental sector, in order to close the affordability gap in housing on a sustainable and long-term basis. </p><p>Local authorities are already progressing a number of large mixed-tenure developments on their sites, encompassing large volumes of social, affordable and private market housing. For example, Dublin City Council has two sites, at O'Devaney Gardens and Oscar Traynor Road, being developed on the basis of a 30% social; 20% affordable and 50% private market housing mix, with capacity to deliver over 1,200 new homes. South Dublin County Council is also progressing one of its major sites at Kilcarbery, capable of yielding almost 1,000 new homes on a 30% social and 70% private tenure mix. </p><p>In order to aid local authorities further in delivering affordable housing from their sites, I am providing funding of &euro;25 million, over 2018 and 2019, to unlock local authority-owned lands specifically for affordable homes to buy or rent. Overall, initial estimates suggest that around 3,000 new affordable homes can be made available through a range of schemes and initiatives, with the long-term ambition for some 10,000 additional affordable homes to be provided for sale or rent, as the full range of initiatives are rolled out. </p><p>In addition, in order to relieve critical infrastructure blockages and enable housing developments to be built on key local authority and private sites at scale, total funding of &euro;266 million is being allocated under the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF). To date, I have given final approval for 30 projects under LIHAF, at a cost of some &euro;195 million, which will activate supply of almost 20,000 homes. Grant agreements in respect of those projects have been signed. A second call for proposals will be issued shortly to invite eligible applications for the additional funding.</p><p>Finally, from a longer-term strategic perspective, as part of <i>Project Ireland 2040</i>, the Government announced on 16 February its intention to establish a new National Regeneration and Development Agency, which will have a role in managing the State's wider publicly-owned land bank to ensure that overall development needs, including housing, are met.  This will involve working primarily with the relevant local authorities, other public bodies and the private sector, with the scope to assemble and rationalise land holdings, whether they are publicly or privately owned, in order to enable the re-purposing of lands that may not be currently used optimally, with regard to wider and long-term public policy and planning objectives.</p></reply>

These actions are focused on encouraging those in mortgage distress who have not been able to engage, to reach a long term debt resolution and avoid repossession if possible.</p><p>The Mortgage to Rent (MTR) scheme introduced in 2012 and administered by the Housing Agency on behalf of my Department is targeted at those households in arrears who are eligible for social housing support, whose mortgage is unsustainable.  The MTR scheme is an established part of the overall suite of social housing options and an important part of the mortgage arrears resolution process.  </p><p>A Review of the Mortgage to Rent (MTR) Scheme, published on 8 February 2017, introduced a range of amendments to the eligibility criteria and administration of the MTR scheme in order for it to work better for borrowers.  The Review, available at the following link:<i></i><i><font color="#0000FF">/</font></i>, explored the avenues and impediments to participation in the scheme and recommended a number of actions to make the scheme work better for borrowers.  My Department and the Housing Agency are working with all stakeholders to ensure that the actions set out in the Review are being effectively implemented to benefit a greater number of households.  I am providing an additional &euro;5m for the MTR scheme in 2018, which will support at least 250 additional MTR cases to be completed by AHBs working together with lenders using the MTR scheme. Additional resources can be made available to the Scheme in 2018, if required. </p><p>The MTR Review also concluded that the current financial model of the scheme may not, in its current configuration, be capable of delivering the scale of successful cases that could benefit from the scheme over time.  In order to test the operability of alternative funding models for the scheme, the Housing Agency initiated a call for Expressions of Interest from bodies other than approved housing bodies (AHBs) interested in participating in a new MTR pilot scheme.  Two submissions were received by the Housing Agency in response to the Expressions of Interest request.  The EOI process is still on-going and I expect to be in a position to announce the outcome in the near future.</p><p>It is important also to highlight that there are no changes to the rights or obligations of a customer whose loan is sold by a bank. The Government introduced the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015 to ensure that borrowers whose loans are sold retain the same protections which they had prior to the sale. In addition, as credit servicing firms servicing loans on behalf of unregulated entities are required to comply with the statutory  Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA), all protections under the CCMA are unchanged.</p></reply>

This review had regard to targets contained in the local authority Traveller Accommodation Programmes and actual units delivered, the current status of accommodation funded and funding provided for accommodation maintenance and other supports.  </p>  <p>  Following its consideration of the review, the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee agreed to the establishment of an Expert Group to examine and make recommendations on issues regarding Traveller accommodation policy, strategy and implementation.  The Committee also recommended that a review of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 should be undertaken as part of the work of the Expert Group.  I welcome and support such a review given that the Act is operational 20 years this year.  </p>  <p>  The Committee played a key role in determining the terms of reference for the Expert Group which have recently been finalised.

Under this mechanism, acceleration is delivered both by the use of the Design and Build services of these contractors and reduced construction time periods due to considerable off site fabrication. This framework is available for all local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to use.  </p><p>While the framework, or indeed off-site construction, may not be suitable for all developments or sites, my Department continues to encourage and support local authorities and AHBs to consider the rapid delivery mechanism in the interest of accelerated delivery. In this regard my Department has organised information seminars for local authorities, as well as visits to rapid delivery projects under construction. Local authorities have been asked to consider, in particular, schemes which are suitable for early commencement, particularly in terms of their approved planning status.  </p><p>In addition, Dublin City Council is developing a volumetric rapid build housing programme of apartment developments. This could yield in excess of 700 homes and my Department is working very closely with the Council to prioritise some of the larger apartment schemes, given the current demand. </p><p>Updated details in relation to the programme of rapid build projects are included in each Social Housing Construction Projects Status Report, which are published on a quarterly basis on the Rebuilding Ireland website; the most recent report setting out the position at end-2017, is available at the following link:</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>The progress evident in this report, together with new build social housing achieved through Part V, ensured that 2,297 new build social housing homes were delivered in 2017, over three times the delivery in 2016 and very close to the 2,434 target set for 2017.</p><p>My Department will continue to work with local authorities to maximise delivery and harness appropriate opportunities to deliver on additional build units over the course of the Rebuilding Ireland Plan, including through rapid delivery schemes.</p></reply>

In that context, the focus is on meeting the housing needs of those in the lower-income categories, particularly those in need of social housing supports and other households that are most challenged from an affordability perspective, such as first-time buyers.  The significant progress being made in these areas is outlined on the Rebuilding Ireland website at <i>www.rebuildingireland.ie.</i></p><p>In Budget 2018, the social housing allocation was increased to over &euro;6 billion for the lifespan of <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>, with a target of 50,000 social housing homes to be delivered by 2021, and some 87,000 households to be supported through the Housing Assistance Payment Scheme and the Rental Accommodation Scheme.  In 2017, almost 26,000 households had their social housing need met, significantly ahead of the target set.  </p><p>I recently wrote to all local authorities, including Laois County Council, setting out their individual social housing targets across build, acquisition and leasing for 2018 and also for 2018-2021. Details of these are available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link:  <i>.</i></p><p>In respect of social housing build targets for 2018, a strong pipeline is already in place for local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies to deliver on these targets. The 2018 build target is for the delivery of 4,969 additional social housing homes, including 3,819 local authority and AHB build units. The <i>Quarter 4 2017 Construction Status Report</i>, which is available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link <i></i><i><font color="#0000FF">/</font></i>, provides details of projects on a local authority by authority basis. </p><p>I announced new housing affordability measures in January of this year. We are targeting both affordable purchase and rental units to be delivered initially from local authority housing land-banks, with the potential to deliver more than 3,000 new affordable homes to buy or rent initially, with a target delivery of at least 10,000 new affordable homes in the medium to longer term.</p><p>Delivery of affordable homes will require local authorities to maximise the potential delivery of new homes from their land bank. This may include mixed-tenure developments on appropriate sites and my Department will continue to work with Laois County Council and all local authorities with regard to any social and mixed-tenure housing proposals that they bring forward, in order to maximise delivery and also harness appropriate opportunities to deliver on additional build units in 2018.</p></reply>

The circular also highlights that planning authorities, when making their decisions, are restricted to considering the proper planning and sustainable development of the area concerned.  </p><p>The circular indicates that, while the <i>Development Management Guidelines</i>issued to planning authorities under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, recognise that elected members may be informed by planning staff of factual matters relating to particular planning applications, the provision of such information is intended to inform elected members who may wish to make substantive comments on planning applications by way of formal written submissions or observations to the planning authority. </p><p>In this regard, the circular points out that discussion of the merits of individual planning applications at Municipal District and Area Committee meetings or at full Council meetings does not form part of the statutory process for the consideration of planning applications, and that the practice could be viewed as an attempt to undermine due process and exert undue influence on the planning authority to make a decision that would not be in the interests of the proper planning and sustainable development of the area concerned. The circular also states that the practice of discussing planning applications at relevant Council meetings could convey an erroneous impression to the public of the role of elected members in the statutory process for deciding on planning applications.</p></reply>

A further 28% will have a LIHAF related cost reduction from their normal open market value.</p><p>I published details of the 30 approved projects on 28 March 2018, including estimates of unit numbers and indicative prices for the areas, as submitted to my Department by local authorities.  This information is available at<i>.  </i></p><p>It is not possible to give the Deputy specific details on units in the price range requested, particularly as many of the projects are still progressing through the planning system, and exact details on the breakdown of unit types across projects are not yet available.

A wide range of delivery mechanisms and a funding commitment of &euro;6 billion over the lifetime of Rebuilding Ireland have been put in place to support the achievement of these targets. </p><p>Rebuilding Ireland is modelled on blended delivery across the main programmes of build, acquisition and leasing.

On completion of the 6-month occupation, the tenant is entitled to specific protections under the Residential Tenancies Act as long as the tenant complies with their own obligations. One of the protections relates to the tenant&rsquo;s entitlement to remain in occupation for up to 4 years from the commencement of the tenancy, where the tenancy commenced prior to 24 December 2016, and for up to 6 years, where the tenancy commenced on or after 24 December 2016. </p><p>Section 34 of the 2004 Act provides that a landlord must state a reason for the termination of a tenancy in any notice served.</p><p>It is important to note that, where a tenancy is terminated for the purposes of substantial refurbishment or renovation, if the property is complete and available for re-let within 6 months of the termination, it must be offered for letting back to the original tenant.</p><p>The landlord must confirm that the existing or current tenant has the option of commencing a new tenancy in the refurbished or renovated dwelling, if it becomes available within 6 months from the end of the notice period given (or if there is an RTB dispute on the validity of the notice, within 6 months of the end of that dispute). The duty to offer a new tenancy arises where the tenant has provided contact details.</p><p>Where a tenant considers that their tenancy may have been terminated under false pretences, such as, for example, where the reason cited is that the landlord intends to substantially refurbish/renovate, yet the tenant sees the dwelling subsequently advertised for letting with no obvious works having been completed, or is not offered first refusal of the rented dwelling within 6 months of the termination having supplied up-to-date contact details, they can take a case to the RTB.  Section 56 of the Residential Tenancies Act provides for the award of damages for abuse of the termination procedure, and the RTB can make a direction that a landlord pay an amount by way of damages for the deprivation of the tenancy and/or may make a direction that the tenant be permitted to resume occupation of the premises.</p><p>On 23 November 2017, the RTB published a comprehensive set of guidelines on what constitutes substantial refurbishment or renovation for the purposes of a section 34 ground for tenancy termination.

Under the Act, planning authorities are empowered to apply an annual vacant site levy of 3% of the market value of vacant sites, exceeding 0.05 hectares in area, which, in the planning authority&rsquo;s opinion, were vacant or idle in the preceding year, in areas identified by the planning authority in its development plan or local area plan for residential or regeneration development.</p>  <p>  As announced in Budget 2018, it is proposed to increase the rate of levy from 3% to 7% of the market valuation of relevant sites with effect from January 2020 in respect of sites included on the local vacant site registers in 2019. Legislative provision for this increase along with amendments to other relevant provisions will be tabled by way of Seanad Report Stage amendments to the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016, which has recently completed Seanad Committee Stage.  </p>  <p>  In addition, with a view to addressing the issue of land hoarding, a number of other amendments have been tabled to the Bill, during its passage in the Oireachtas.  In this regard, the principal amendment is to provisions relating to the extension of duration of planning permission.  The amendment proposed would permit the extension of the duration of a planning permission only where substantial works are carried out during the initial duration of the planning permission and allow for a maximum of two extensions of the duration of a permission, the combined duration of which would not exceed 5 years.   This proposed amendment is part of a package of measures which are aimed at combatting land hoarding.</p></reply>

In September 2017, arising from the review findings, I announced a number of measures to further strengthen the effectiveness of the rent setting and rent review laws, including the implementation of a change plan to develop and strengthen the role of the RTB, particularly with regard to enforcement.</p>  <p>  These measures include the intention to make it an offence to increase rents in contravention of the legislation and to provide the RTB with the necessary powers and resources to protect tenants from illegal rent increases. These changes will strengthen the impact of the Rent Predictability Measure and should contribute to a further slowing in the growth in rents, in tandem with increasing supply.  </p>  <p>  The Government has given priority to the drafting and early publication of a Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill to address these and other urgent reforms in the residential rental sector.</p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies Board&rsquo;s latest quarterly Rent Index Report for Q4 2017, which was published in March, shows reductions in the rate of rental inflation across both national and Dublin rents.  The slowdown in the quarterly growth rate in Dublin rents to 1.1% in Q4 2017 is particularly noteworthy, bringing the annualised growth rate over 2017 to 5.2%, a drop from 8% in the year to Q3 2017.  Significantly, this 5.2% increase for Dublin is the lowest annual growth rate since 2013.  This latest quarterly index provides evidence that the introduction of the RPZs, in December 2016, is having a positive effect on rent inflation, particularly in Dublin.</p>  <p>   The RTB Rent Index Report also includes a summary of the data used as the criteria for designating Rent Pressure Zones in relation to all Local Electoral Areas in the country. This allows everyone to see exactly where their area stands in relation to average rent levels and increases and possible designation.  </p>  <p>  The Housing Agency continues to monitor the rental market and may recommend further areas for designation. Where, following the procedures set out in the Act, it is found at a future date that additional areas meet the criteria, they will be designated as Rent Pressure Zones.  However, at present, I have no plans to expand these measures further.</p></reply>

This is a sub-committee of the County and City Management Association (CCMA) with representatives from the CCMA, local authorities, the Housing Finance Agency, as well as my Department. </p>  <p>  The scheme has applied to all house purchase loans approved by local authorities after 1 July 1986. One of the conditions of the scheme, which is a group policy, is that it is obligatory for all borrowers who meet the eligibility criteria to join the scheme. Altering this condition would have a negative impact on the scheme and increase the cost for all existing borrowers.</p>  <p>  The insurance scheme is subject to periodic review and competitive tendering in accordance with the terms of EU Directives relating to the award of public service contracts. This is to ensure that the most appropriate cover at the best value for money is secured for local authority borrowers over the entire life of their mortgages.</p>  <p>  The most recent public procurement competition for the provision and administration of this MPI scheme was conducted by the Office of Government Procurement. The new contract resulting from this open tender competition came into effect from 1 January 2017 for a period of 3 years.</p>  <p>  The local authority MPI is a group scheme and is designed to provide an appropriate level of insurance cover to those who wish to avail of the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan. It offers a number of additional features over and above the standard MPI products available on the market. Standard MPI products are individually priced, based on a member&rsquo;s age, amongst other factors, whereas the local authority MPI scheme is a group arrangement, offering  a single group rate per &euro;1,000 sum assured to all participants in the scheme.</p>  <p>  The scheme also provides other benefits over standard MPI products. These include the payment of mortgage repayments if there is a valid claim as a result of disability; an additional payment of &euro;3,000 in the event of a member&rsquo;s death, separate to life cover; and members are also covered for death up to age 75 rather than 65 as is the case under standard MPI cover.</p>  <p>  Regarding the information available to prospective applicants on the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan website, I am aware of issues concerning the inclusion of the cost of MPI in the on-line calculator. I have recently met with the Chief Executives of the two main agencies involved in its implementation, the Housing Agency and the Housing Finance Agency, and I have directed that they address a number of issues to improve the operation of the scheme. One of these involves amending the on-line calculator in order to take the cost of mortgage protection insurance into account. This will therefore give potential applicants a clearer indication of the amount that they could be eligible to borrow under the scheme.</p></reply>

Individuals with a housing need, who in the past were reluctant to avail of full time work as they would lose their Rent Supplement support, can now move to HAP and avail of full-time work and retain their housing support, with an adjustment in their differential rent.</p>  <p>  HAP has been rolled out on a statutory phased basis since September 2014 and became a national scheme on 1st  March 2017 when the nationwide rollout was completed. The phased nature of the HAP rollout has allowed for significant learning with new HAP authorities benefiting from the experience of those authorities where the scheme has been previously operational.  </p>  <p>  At the end of 2017, over 31,200 tenancies were being supported by the HAP scheme, including 17,916 additional households in 2017. There are now 20,000 separate landlords and agents currently in receipt of monthly HAP payments. </p>  <p>  As HAP is a social housing support and consequently households are not eligible to remain on the main housing waiting list, Ministerial directions have issued to ensure that, should they so choose, HAP recipients can avail of a move to other forms of social housing support through a transfer list. </p>  <p>  In addition, guidelines on Inter-authority movement were introduced in 2017, to allow for local authorities to facilitate movement of HAP households in cases where a tenant, currently on a local authority waiting list, wishes to access rented accommodation with HAP support in another local authority area, subject to conditions.</p>  <p>  In relation to specific HAP supports available to homeless households, the Homeless HAP Place Finder Service operating in the Dublin local authorities, and in Cork City Council, is a targeted support for homeless households who are finding it difficult to secure HAP tenancies. The Place Finder Service has been successfully utilised by the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive (DRHE) across the Dublin local authorities since February 2015, with more than 2,000 households currently being supported by the Homeless HAP scheme. A similar service began operating in Cork City in 2017. In order to further assist homeless households in exiting emergency accommodation the Homeless HAP Place Finder Service, is now available to each of the 31 local authorities, with the options to pay deposits and advance rental payments for any households in emergency homeless accommodation, in order to secure accommodation via the HAP Scheme.</p>  <p>  I continue to keep the operation of HAP under review but I am currently satisfied with how the scheme is operating and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting current housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme set out in Rebuilding Ireland.</p></reply>

Following receipt of such a proposal, the Minister requests the Director of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) to conduct an assessment of the area to establish whether or not it meets the criteria for designation and to report to the Minister on whether the area should be designated as a Rent Pressure Zone. For the purpose of the Act, &lsquo;area&rsquo; is defined as either the administrative area of a housing authority or a local electoral area within the meaning of section 2 of the Local Government Act 2001. There is no provision for any other type of area to be designated as a Rent Pressure Zone.</p><p>For an area to be designated a Rent Pressure Zone, it must satisfy the following criteria set out in section 24A(4) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as inserted by section 36 of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016):</p><p>(i) The annual rate of rent inflation in the area must have been 7% or more in four of the last six quarters; and </p><p>(ii) The average rent for tenancies registered in the area with the RTB in the last quarter must be above the average national rent (the National Standardised Rent in the RTB&rsquo;s Rent Index Report) in the last quarter (i.e. &euro;1,054 per month in Q4 2017).</p><p>On 21 March 2018, the RTB published its Rent Index Report in relation to Quarter 4 2017, which includes a summary of the data used as the criteria for designating Rent Pressure Zones in relation to all Local Electoral Areas in the country. This allows everyone to see exactly where their area stands in relation to average rent levels and increases and possible designation.  </p><p>Rent reviews outside of Rent Pressure Zones are restricted so that a landlord can only review the rent once in any two-year period. However, similar to within Rent Pressure Zones, where there is a substantial change in the nature of the accommodation provided, for example through a major refurbishment of the property, a landlord may review the rent before the two-year period has ended and therefore many of the principles in determining what is classified as substantial change are the same. The existing requirement that the rent set is not above the market rents for similar properties still applies in designated Rent Pressure Zones and in non-designated areas.</p><p>The Housing Agency continues to monitor the rental market and may recommend further areas for designation. Where, following the procedures set out in the Act, it is found at a future date that additional areas meet the criteria, they will be designated as Rent Pressure Zones.</p></reply>

My Department is currently processing draw-down requests for Q1 2018.</p>  <p>  While there was an underspend by local authorities in 2017, funding for LIHAF is ring-fenced within the overall housing budget and through proactive management of the broader housing programme, any LIHAF underspend was diverted to other housing activities, ensuring that the funding available in 2017 was fully applied to housing priorities.</p>  <p>  The low level of the draw down to date by local authorities reflects the stages which these infrastructure projects are currently at. The expenditure incurred during the design, planning and tendering stages is significantly lower than that at the construction stage so a major increase in draw-down will arise as projects progress through construction. </p>  <p>  While I am anxious for the infrastructure and the housing to be delivered as fast as possible, I recognise that local authorities must observe proper design, planning and tendering procedures. My Department will continue to monitor progress on these sites and ensure that every effort is made to secure the timely delivery of the infrastructure involved.</p></reply>

On foot of a detailed process of engagement since then between my Department and individual local authorities, I have now advised local authorities of the social housing targets for 2018 and also for the multi-annual period to 2021.</p>  <p>  Under the targets announced, a minimum of 40,700 homes will be delivered during the 4 year period to end-2021, including over 7,800 this year alone.  Taking account of the progress already made in 2016 and 2017, this will ensure that the 50,000 social housing home target under Rebuilding Ireland will be met. In addition, the Housing Assistance Payment and Rental Accommodation Schemes will continue to play an important part in meeting social housing needs, with approximately 18,000 households targeted for support under these schemes in 2018.</p>  <p>  My Department's focus, and that of all delivery agents, will remain on implementation and delivery to ensure that the range of objectives and targets set are achieved. A wide range of delivery mechanisms and a funding commitment of &euro;6 billion over the lifetime of Rebuilding Ireland have been put in place to support the achievement of these targets. </p>  <p>  While it is recognised that the pace of delivery, particularly under build activity, may vary from local authority to local authority, the range of delivery options available provide the necessary resources for local authorities and I expect all stakeholders to be fully mobilised towards meeting the target for 2018, and subsequent years. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the genuine challenges that arise with construction projects of all types, we need to ensure that progress is made to ensure delivery as quickly as possible and we are also keen to harness appropriate opportunities to deliver on additional build units in 2018, including through turnkey schemes.</p>  <p>  In direct response to the housing challenge and in order to support housing authorities deliver on their responsibilities and obligations, a number of dedicated structures have been put in place to support Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) and Local Authorities to maximise their delivery potential and to harness the best that is available in their functional areas, including for example:</p>  <p>  - A dedicated Housing Delivery Office established within my Department to support local authorities, AHBs and all stakeholders involved in the delivery of key elements of the ambitious private and social housing targets in Rebuilding Ireland; and  </p>  <p>  - The AHB Services Unit, established in the Housing Agency, to support and facilitate AHBs by co-ordinating on a number of key areas. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department has worked with local authorities to review the processes and procedures for the approval of social housing construction projects and has agreed an overall target programme of 59 weeks for progressing typical social housing construction projects from initial project conception through design, planning and procurement up to contractors going on site.</p>  <p>  More detailed guidelines have been prepared in relation to submissions to be made to my Department.  The single-stage approval process for projects under &euro;2 million has been revised and my Department is working with local authorities to increase take-up. Rapid build approaches are also increasingly being used, which can save time in relation to design, procurement and construction of new social housing.</p>  <p>  My Department also has continuous contact with local authorities around all forms of housing delivery, including regular technical meetings to review progress in respect of social housing projects and to clear any blockages, as swiftly as possible. </p>  <p>  The delivery of more affordable homes, to buy or rent, is a major priority for Government, focusing in particular on the cities of Dublin, Galway and Cork, where people are facing the greatest affordability challenge.  New measures announced in January 2018 are specifically targeted at delivering more affordable homes and have the potential to deliver more than 3,000 new affordable homes to buy or rent initially, with a target delivery of at least 10,000 new affordable homes in the medium to longer term. The emphasis initially will be on delivering affordable homes from the public land bank in urban areas where affordability issues are greatest. Recognising that there are enabling infrastructure requirements on some sites, I am also providing Exchequer funding of &euro;25 million, over 2018 and 2019, as a key contribution towards the delivery of more affordable housing from local authority land.</p>  <p>  In terms of affordable purchase, the new Scheme will be based on the relevant provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, which will be commenced shortly, and enabling regulations which are in preparation. At that point, the elected members of each local authority will be responsible for determining the order of priority to be accorded to eligible households, in line with the national scheme's framework. In the meantime, Dublin City Council has a number of major ready-to-go sites being advanced through procurement.  The elected members of the City Council have determined that 20% of the homes on sites at Infirmary Road and Oscar Traynor Road will be made available to eligible households for affordable purchase.  Proposals are also advancing for the redevelopment of the St. Michael's Estate site in Inchicore.</p>  <p>   In addition, against the background of the affordability pressures which currently exist in the rental market, the Government is determined to make cost rental a major part of the Irish housing system, similar to the role it plays in many other European countries.  Under this approach, rents are set at levels to recover the construction costs and to facilitate the management and administration of developments, but with only a minimal profit margin included. A pilot project is currently being progressed by D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, at Enniskerry Road in Dundrum, in conjunction with the Housing Agency and Approved Housing Bodies, using land owned by the Agency. </p>  <p>  Learning from the initial experiences in the pilot scheme, my Department is working with the European Investment Bank and other key stakeholders with a view to developing the first major cost rental project in Dublin city. Initial feasibility analysis is underway with a view to identifying a major project for immediate progression, with a broader programme of cost rental projects across Dublin and other cities to follow. </p>  <p>  While the development of any residential land in housing authority ownership is in the first instance a matter for the local authority concerned, including its elected members, I want to see local authorities realise new social and affordable homes from their lands without delay, with particular emphasis on prioritising those sites with the greatest potential to deliver housing at scale, in the short to medium term.</p></reply>

I have asked the Agency to centrally compile figures of the numbers of applications that it has assessed. To date, it has received a total of 660 valid applications for assessment from local authorities. Of these, 479 have been assessed and 46% of the applications which have been assessed by the Agency have been recommended for approval.  It is then a matter for the relevant local authority credit committee to ultimately determine whether a loan application is approved, having regard to the Agency's recommendation and other relevant factors.</p></reply>

Under the Act, planning authorities are required to establish a register of vacant sites in their areas, beginning on 1 January 2017. Planning authorities will be issuing notices to owners of vacant sites by 1 June 2018 in respect of vacant sites on the register on 1 January 2018, indicating that the levy will apply to those sites on 1 January 2019.</p>  <p>  Planning authorities are empowered to apply an annual vacant site levy of 3% of the market value of vacant sites, exceeding 0.05 hectares in area, which, in the planning authority&rsquo;s opinion, were vacant or idle in the preceding year, in areas identified by the planning authority in its development plan or local area plan for residential or regeneration development.</p>  <p>  As announced in the Budget 2018, it is proposed to increase the rate of levy from 3% to 7% of the market valuation of relevant sites with effect from January 2020 in respect of sites included on the local vacant site registers in 2019. Legislative provision for this increase along with amendments to other relevant provisions will be tabled by way of Seanad Report Stage amendments to the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016, which has recently completed Seanad Committee Stage.  </p>  <p>  To ensure consistent application of the levy provisions across all city and county areas and to facilitate the sharing of best practice, my Department has provided guidance and advice  and also organised a workshop last week which was attended by every local authority.</p></reply>

There are currently some 370 personnel deployed to the mission. </p>  <p>  My recent visit to Lebanon in March coincided with the official UN commemorations in Naqoura to mark the 40th anniversary of the UNIFIL mission's establishment.  It was an occasion to pay tribute to the tens of thousands of UN peacekeepers who have served together with local communities for peace in South Lebanon.  It was a great honour to be present while a veteran Irish Peacekeeper delivered a poignant and emotional tribute to fallen peacekeepers at the ceremony.  The respect and high regard that is held internationally for the professionalism displayed by our Irish Peacekeepers was clearly evident.</p>  <p>  Appropriate commemorative events are being planned to mark this year's important milestones in the history of Ireland's participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations by the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  A State ceremony will take place in Dublin Castle on Sunday 24th June 2018.  Arrangements are currently being finalised and details will shortly be announced.  It is intended that the ceremony will be an occasion to show our pride in those who have served in our name with the U.N. while also calling to mind those who surrendered their lives so that others might know the gift of peace.  </p></reply>

The majority of the estimated cost is the pay of those individuals being trained and the pay of their training staff.

These negotiations are focused on all outstanding issues in the draft Withdrawal Agreement, including the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, as well as the future relationship.</p><p>The UK has agreed that a backstop solution for the border will form part of the legal text of the Withdrawal Agreement, in line with paragraph 49 of the Joint Progress Report agreed last December.  The UK has also agreed that all the issues identified in the EU draft of the Protocol will be addressed to deliver a legally sound solution for the border.</p><p>Prime Minister May confirmed this in her letter to President Tusk of 19 March, in addition to reiterating the UK's commitment last December to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and the gains of the peace process, including the overarching guarantee on avoiding a hard border. </p><p>The Government has always maintained that the backstop will apply unless and until another solution is found.  While we share Prime Minister May's preference to resolve these issues through the wider agreement on the EU's future relationship with the UK, it is crucial that we have certainty in all scenarios on the commitments already made on Ireland and Northern Ireland. </p><p>It is also the case that the UK&rsquo;s repeatedly stated positions, including its wish to leave the Single Market and the Customs Union, limit the depth of the future partnership and have consequences for the ability of the EU-UK future relationship agreement to deliver on all the commitments and guarantees provided by the UK with regard to protecting North South cooperation, the all island economy and the Good Friday Agreement, including avoiding a hard border. </p><p>Negotiations are ongoing, including detailed discussions between the EU and the UK on issues relating to Ireland and Northern Ireland.  Significantly more progress is needed on agreeing the Protocol, including the backstop on avoiding a hard border, ahead of the June European Council.</p><p>The EU has always made clear that <i>&ldquo;nothing is agreed until everything is agreed&rdquo; </i>and that negotiations can only progress as long as all commitments undertaken so far are respected in full.  The European Council is therefore continuing to follow the negotiations closely and will return in particular to the remaining withdrawal issues, including the Protocol, and to the framework for the future relationship at its next meeting in June.  It is essential that real and substantial progress be made by the June European Council meeting.</p><p>The objective of the negotiators is that the full legal text of the Withdrawal Agreement, and a detailed political declaration on the framework for the future relationship, should be concluded by the October European Council.  This limited timeframe underlines the urgency of the work ahead in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Our meeting offered an opportunity to take stock of the current state of play in the negotiations on both the future relationship and the draft Withdrawal Agreement, including progress on the draft Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. </p><p>There was agreement at the meeting that significantly more progress is needed on the Protocol, including the backstop on avoiding a hard border, ahead of the June meeting of the European Council.  Recalling the European Council Guidelines of 23 March 2018 and the principles that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed and that negotiations can only progress as long as all commitments undertaken so far are respected in full, there was also agreement that there can be no Withdrawal Agreement without a satisfactory agreement on the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. </p><p>The backstop for avoiding a hard border, as contained in the draft Protocol, seeks to maintain full alignment with those rules of the Single Market and Customs Union that are necessary to protect North South cooperation, the all-island economy and the Good Friday Agreement, which includes the overarching guarantee of avoiding a hard border.  Mr Barnier reaffirmed the importance of this in his address to the All-Island Civic Dialogue on the same day.</p><p>Furthermore, this alignment is in the context of the recognition in the Protocol that it is necessary to address the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland through a unique solution.</p><p>It was not necessary at the meeting to enter into detail on the draft Protocol.  Ireland fully supports the Commission&rsquo;s view that it will be necessary for all the EU rules involved to be listed in annexes to the Protocol.  The rules in question would essentially be those dealing with customs, the free movement of goods, and sanitary and phytosanitary measures relevant to agricultural trade and the movement of animals.

These motions call on the British Government to allow access by an independent, international judicial figure to all original documents relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, as well as the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973, the bombing of Kay&rsquo;s Tavern in Dundalk and the murder of Seamus Ludlow.  </p>  <p>  I want to acknowledge the tireless work of Justice for the Forgotten and of members of this House in supporting and advocating for victims and survivors of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings and their families.  I met with Justice for the Forgotten on 17 April last to hear their views and update them on the progress of the request to the British Government.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to actively pursuing the implementation of the all-Party D&aacute;il motions, and has consistently raised the issue with the British Government.  </p>  <p>  I am actively engaged with the British Government on an ongoing basis on this issue, as are officials from my Department.  I recently raised the issue directly with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Karen Bradley on 16 April last. </p>  <p>  I have underlined to the British Government that the D&aacute;il motions represent the consensus political view in Ireland that an independent, international judicial review of all the relevant documents is required to establish the full facts of the Dublin-Monaghan atrocities.  I have also advised that the absence of a response from the British Government is of deep concern to the Government and indeed this House, and I have emphasised the urgent need for such a response.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to engage with the British Government on the request in relation to the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, and pursue all possible avenues that could achieve progress on this issue, consistent with the request made by this House.</p></reply>

At the Second Brussels Conference for Syria and the Region, Ireland pledged &euro;25 million in humanitarian support for 2018.  This brings Ireland&rsquo;s support since 2012 to over &euro;100 million &ndash; our largest ever response to a single crisis. Our funding provides supports to those in need inside Syria, as well as Syrian refugees and vulnerable host communities in the region.</p>  <p>  Given my responsibility for International Development, I led Ireland&rsquo;s delegation to the Conference and met with key EU, UN and NGO humanitarian and political partners.  These included EU Commissioner Christos Stylianides and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi.  At these meetings we reiterated our concerns about the deteriorating humanitarian and protection situation and our commitment to a peaceful resolution of the conflict.</p>  <p>  Ireland is also concerned with supporting longer-term responses for Syrians and host communities affected by the crisis.  To this end, we also made a commitment to provide multi-annual, predictable assistance in response to the Syria crisis beyond 2018.  In particular, support for learning and protection of young people is an issue that Ireland is committed to do more on.  I was honoured therefore to join the Political Champions for Education in Conflict initiative, spearheaded by the Malala Fund and the Education Cannot Wait Fund, at the Conference.</p>  <p>  Humanitarian assistance alone will not address the root causes of this crisis however.  A comprehensive, sustainable, Syrian-owned and Syrian-led resolution is urgently required to provide lasting relief to the Syrian people.  UN Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura is leading political negotiations to end the conflict based on the 2012 Geneva Communique and UN Security Council resolution 2254.  Ireland and the EU fully support this process.  The EU provides direct assistance to the UN-led Geneva peace talks and has launched, in coordination with the UN, an initiative to develop political dialogue with key actors from the region to identify common ground.  At international level, we use every opportunity to highlight our deep concerns in relation to the Syria crisis.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade discussed the situation in Syria with his EU counterparts at their informal meeting on 15 February and again at the Foreign Affairs Council meetings on 26 February, 19 March and 16 April.  At their most recent meeting, EU Foreign Ministers reiterated their support for the UN-led political negotiations to end the conflict, and the urgent need to reinvigorate the political track.</p></reply>

The SCA&rsquo;s claims management objective is, while acting in the best interest of taxpayers in matters of personal injury and property damage litigation, to act fairly, ethically and compassionately in its dealings with people who have suffered injuries and/or damage and who take legal actions against the State or State bodies, and their families.  In cases where the SCA investigation concludes that the relevant State authority bears some or all liability, it seeks to settle claims expeditiously and on fair and reasonable terms, while seeking to in no way exacerbate the suffering of those citizens. If it considers that the State is not liable, the SCA&rsquo;s policy is to defend the claims.</p>  <p>  Individual cases are managed by teams of claims managers within the SCA.  The Director of the State Claims Agency (SCA), Ciaran Breen, has oversight of all functions within the SCA.</p>  <p>  The State Claims Agency&rsquo;s mandate for managing personal injury claims on behalf of DSAs is established in legislation.  When managing cases on behalf of DSAs, the State Claims Agency (SCA) engages with DSAs to carry out investigations and to establish the facts of the cases. The SCA engages with DSAs on an on-going basis in this respect.  The SCA is statutorily mandated to determine the claims management strategy on the claims it manages on behalf of DSAs.  The SCA engages with DSA&rsquo;s throughout a case.  The SCA provides regular information to DSA&rsquo;s in respect of their claims&rsquo; portfolios.</p></reply>

The application may be in the form of a letter of claim, an InjuriesBoard.ie application, or a written/oral request.</p>  <p>  One particular exception to a settlement not being subject to a confidentiality agreement is a claim where mediation is entered into.  Part of the process of mediation is that the parties are bound by a strict confidentiality provision contained in the mediation agreement. In the very rare case that the Agency agrees a confidentiality proviso, it is usually because of some extremely sensitive, controversial or disputed element of a claim which may be requested by either party.</p>  <p>  The SCA also advise that it does not formally record, on its IT system, the fact that any individual settlement is bound by a confidentiality clause; therefore this information is not readily available.</p></reply>

Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland has the power to direct insurance companies on the pricing or provision of insurance products.  Indeed, the EU framework for insurance expressly prohibits Member States from adopting such rules.  The provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter for insurance companies and is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept and adequate provisioning to meet those risks.  These are considered by insurance companies on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>Motor insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply.  Factors include, for example, the age and type of the vehicle, the age of the driver, the relevant driving experience, the claims record of the driver, the number of drivers and how the vehicle is used.  Their own previous claims experience in this area will also be a relevant factor.</p><p>Finally, as the Deputy may be aware, under the terms of the Declined Cases Agreement (DCA), which is adhered to by all motor insurers in Ireland, if a consumer is unable to secure a quotation on the open market, he or she may be in a position to avail of the Declined Cases Agreement (DCA) process.  Under the terms of the DCA, the insurance market will not refuse to provide insurance to an individual seeking insurance if the person has approached at least three insurers and has not been able to obtain cover from them.  In this regard, there are further details available on the Insurance Ireland website while Insurance Ireland also operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance.

Where other qualifying conditions are satisfied, stamp duty will only be paid to the extent that the value of the land that is purchased exceeds the value of the land that is sold.  A reduced rate of 1% will be charged on the excess, if any, of the purchase value.  If the sale takes place before the purchase, then relief will be given at the time of purchase.  However, if the purchase takes place first, then stamp duty will have to be paid but can subsequently be refunded when the sale takes place.</p><p>A number of qualifying conditions must be satisfied before the relief can apply.  The most important condition is that Teagasc must issue a certificate stating that a sale and purchase or an exchange of farmland was made for farm consolidation purposes.  This is the certificate that is currently required in relation to the capital gains tax relief.  The criteria to be used by Teagasc for this purpose and the information to be supplied to Teagasc are contained in guidelines published by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine:</p><p><i>().</i></p><p>A purchaser of farmland must retain ownership of the farmland for a period of five years and must use the land for farming.  Where any part of the land is disposed of before the end of this five-year holding period, the stamp duty relieved can subsequently be recovered by Revenue, or partly recovered as appropriate.</p><p>The measure will apply to all transactions which took place after 1 January 2018, so farmers who consolidate their holdings prior to the commencement of the relief will still be eligible.</p><p>I understand that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has recently made an application to the European Commission for State Aid approval of the measure and that their response is awaited.  Therefore, at this point, no definitive date for the commencement of the relief can be provided.  I would again wish to emphasise that, subject to state-aid approval and commencement, any eligible consolidation that takes place on or after 1 January 2018 and on or before 31 December 2020 will benefit from the consolidation measure introduced in section 68 of Finance Act 2017 (No 41 of 2017).</p></reply>

Once this is done the likely timeline for payment will become clearer, including the payment of the additional 35% to those who have settled their claims and have already received compensation of 65% of their claim subject to the limit outlined above.</p>  <p>  It is however important to note that only claims which have been settled can be included in applications to the High Court for payment from the ICF.  The process of settling claims is still ongoing and is subject in some cases to complex negotiations between all relevant parties.  It is hoped that by the State taking steps to ensure that third party claimants are compensated in full, this will encourage the settlement of all outstanding claims as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

I have been provided with the following information from both AIB and Bank of Ireland:</p><p><b>AIB</b></p><p>&quot;This is an area of strategic importance for the economy and the Bank.  AIB is strongly supportive of the industry and we are ready and willing to increase our support as the industry grows.</p><p>We are the main bank to many of the largest developers but we also have a strong focus on mid-sized developers.  We created a new dedicated team in 2017 to serve mid-sized development groups following feedback from the industry that they struggled to get the attention of mainstream Banks.  This new Mid-Market team is active across the Country.</p><p>Overall, we more than doubled the size of the Bank's Development Lending Team over the last 12-months.  This was done in anticipation of a marked pick-up in residential development activity in Ireland.  Consequently, we expect to double our residential development lending in 2018.</p><p>On Social Housing, we are backing a number of specific developments which are being sold to Approved Housing Bodies and we have ring-fenced a &euro;100 million Fund to further support this aspect of the market.</p><p>Regarding Student Housing, the Bank has been very active and is funding over 1,500 beds which will help the overall housing market.</p><p>Finally, we are providing on-site presence at weekends to assist mortgage seekers to get loan approvals to purchase new homes which in turn helps developers get units sold. &quot;</p><p><b>BOI</b></p><p>&quot;Supporting construction and development has always been a core part of Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s strategy.  The Bank plays a key role in supporting our customer and clients' ambitions and projects, and has a &euro;1 billion fund for construction and development - approximately 80% of which is targeted to Ireland.  This supports the development of houses, apartments and student accommodation.  We are currently financing 3,500 housing units and 1,600 student beds in Ireland.</p><p>We are well positioned to increase our output this year.  Our strategy for house-building is to fund the acquisition of land that is &ldquo;shovel ready&rdquo; &ndash; supporting Irish Government policy by encouraging house-building and discouraging land hoarding.&quot;</p></reply>

Over 3,300 staff members have applied for mobility since its launch. As a matter of policy for the scheme, applicants are queued by date of application in the first instance, and length of service in the second instance.</p>  <p>  It was open to applicants to enter a legacy date on their initial Mobility application from 13/11/2017 until 07/02/2018. This was to facilitate the inclusion of legacy dates from previous transfer applications made through legacy transfer lists (including the Central Applications Facility, Central Transfer Lists, and Internal Regional Transfer Lists) on a voluntary opt-in basis.</p>  <p>  A legacy date is applicable to each public service branch (PSB) in a Mobility Zone, and requires verification from the respective owner of the legacy transfer List. Once the legacy date has been verified for a PSB in a zone, it can be applied to all of the other PSB&rsquo;s within that zone. There is a period of 20 business days allocated for legacy date verification.</p>  <p>  An applicant may see their waitlist position drop in the following circumstances:  </p>  <p>  - The legacy date which they entered on their Mobility application has not been verified within the time allocated for this; in such cases their application date will revert to the date of entering their application on the Mobility system; </p>  <p>  - Where an applicant goes on a leave of absence, they may see their placing on the relevant waitlist drop if their length of service drops below that of another officer with the same application date; </p>  <p>  - Where an officer&rsquo;s Mobility applications have been cancelled through no fault of their own, and not in accordance with policy, they are subsequently re-entered with the original application details. When an application is re-entered, it can result in other officers on the same waitlist(s) dropping in position; </p>  <p>  - Amendment to an officer&rsquo;s application date has been allowed through specific policy provision. Examples include:</p>  <p>  - The legacy date entered by an applicant on their initial application has not carried to all of the PSB waitlists in a zone due to a technical error which was present on the system for a number of days during the legacy date application period. When this is found to have occurred, the application is amended to reflect the legacy date entered by an applicant in good faith; </p>  <p>  - Where an officer entered a legacy date which was later than that they were entitled to on the basis of erroneous information from the Central Application Facility; </p>  <p>  - An officer has made an individual appeal to Mobility Policy to have their Mobility application(s) amended to include an earlier application date, and this has been facilitated.

Details surrounding the consultation process have been published on the Department&rsquo;s website <i>(</i>).  </p><p>In relation to career guidance for 16-18 year old persons attending special schools, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for determining the appropriate staffing levels in special schools. Enhanced pupil teacher and Special Needs Assistant (SNA) ratios are provided to special schools to support them in dealing with pupil&rsquo;s educational and care needs. Special schools are staffed based on their actual current pupil profiles and the disability category of each pupil, as opposed to primarily by school designation, in recognition that many special schools now enrol students from disability categories other than those provided for by their original school designations. This process means that it is for school authorities to determine its staffing requirements in accordance with the requirements of the cohort of students attending the school which includes how best to use that resource to cater for curricular content.</p></reply>

This decision is based a recommendation contained within a professional assessment in consultation with the NCSE.</p><p>Students enrolling in specialised placements must have a report from a relevant professional or team of professionals stating that:  </p><p>- S/he has a disability (in line with the designation of the special placement in question) and </p><p>- S/he has significant learning needs that require the support of a specialised setting and the reasons why this is the case.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible for organising and planning provision for children with Special Educational Needs, including the establishment of special classes in mainstream primary and post primary schools. </p><p>Since 2011, the NCSE has increased the number of special classes from 548 in 2011 to 1,304 for the 2017/18 school year. 1,048 of these are ASD special classes.</p><p>125 special schools also provide specialist education for those students with complex special educational needs, including students diagnosed with ASD.</p><p>With regard to Co. Dublin in particular, there are 37 special schools and 218 special classes attached to mainstream schools. Of these, 18 are ASD early intervention classes, 124 are primary ASD classes and 36 are post primary ASD classes. The number of ASD special classes in Co. Dublin have increased from 66 in 2011/2012 to 178 in 2017/2018.</p><p>The NCSE is aware of emerging need in Dublin from year to year, and where special provision, including special class provision, is required, it is planned and established to meet that need. This process is ongoing.</p><p>The NCSE has informed my Department that they intend to establish approx. 18 new ASD Special Classes in Co. Dublin for 2018/19 school year to meet currently identified need.</p><p>Parents/guardians who may need advice or are experiencing difficulties in locating a school placement should contact their local SENO who can assist in identifying an appropriate educational placement for their child.

My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools and it does not maintain details of waiting lists in schools.</p><p>Accordingly, the NCSE advises parents, to seek to enrol their child, by applying in writing, to the school/s of their choice as early as possible.</p><p>Where parents have been unsuccessful in enrolling their child in a school placement, for the 2018/19 school year, they should update their local SENO to inform the planning process.

For the academic year 2016/17 there were 19,440 undergraduate and postgraduate students who qualified for this grant rate. If the grant was increased by &euro;1,000 and a similar number of students qualified, the cost would be &euro;19,440,000. </p>  <p>  The current standard rate of full maintenance grant (adjacent rate) is &euro;1,215. For the academic year 2016/17 there were 16,759 undergraduate and postgraduate students who qualified for this grant rate. If the grant was increased by &euro;1,000 and a similar number of students qualified, the cost would be &euro;16,759,000. </p>  <p>  Students on part-time courses are not eligible for SUSI grants. As such, my Department has no means tested statistical data available to determine the number of part-time students who might qualify for student grants. The latest statistics from the HEA for the number of part-time students in publicly funded institutions, record a total of 21,988 undergraduate students and 15,645 postgraduate students. If the full maintenance grant (both adjacent and non-adjacent) were extended to part-time students, then the cost would be &euro;4,025 or &euro;2,215 per qualifying student. </p>  <p>  Approximately 20% of full-time students qualify for the full maintenance grant with circa 54% on the non-adjacent rate and circa 46% on the adjacent rate. Applying these percentages to the number of part-time students would indicate that circa 4,065 students would qualify for the non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant at a cost of &euro;16,361,625 and 3,462 students would qualify for the adjacent rate of maintenance grant at a cost of &euro;7,668,330. However, it should be noted that qualifying full-time students also receive a fee grant of up to &euro;6,270. If this was provided to part-time students then it could potentially add a further &euro;47,194,290 to the costings. </p></reply>

The Summer Works Scheme (SWS) is designed to allow schools to carry out small and medium sized building works that will improve and upgrade existing school buildings.</p><p>The Summer Works Scheme (SWS) is a multi-annual Scheme.  Over 1,650 schools, nearly 50% of schools, applied for inclusion under the current round of the scheme which reflects a very high demand. </p><p>Almost &euro;80 million has been approved under the current round of the Scheme, in respect of 635 school projects, 464 primary and 171 post-primary schools,  for Gas, electrical upgrades, mechanical, sanitation and roof improvement works..  Details of the successful school applicants, are published on the Department's website  <i>www.education.ie. </i></p><p>In relation to the Summer Works Scheme 2018, over &euro;25 million will be spent on summer works projects in 2018.  This expenditure will enable the remaining approved improvement works for 178 schools nationwide to be completed. These works will be carried out by the schools themselves on a devolved basis mainly over the summer months, so the disruption to students, teachers and other school staff will be kept to a minimum.</p><p>Furthermore, the Department intends to engage with the relevant education partners in relation to giving schools a better lead-in period for planning and delivering projects under the summer works scheme from 2019 onwards.  While the Summer Works Scheme is hugely successful in enabling small scale refurbishment works to be done on a devolved basis, the Department considers that the operation of the scheme could be improved by providing a better lead-in period for schools rather than in Quarter 2 as in previous years.  This will also help ensure that works done under the Summer Works Scheme fit better with any wider refurbishment/energy retrofit plans that may be done at schools under the increased funding provided in the National Development Plan. The engagement with education partners will commence shortly and will assist in developing a better timeline for the planning and delivery of summer works projects for 2019 onwards.</p></reply>

To enable this development, my Department will be carrying out an assessment of the number of prefabs being used in schools to deliver the curriculum. This will also determine whether or not individual prefabs need to be replaced in the context of the long-term accommodation needs of each individual school. When completed, this assessment will quantify the number of prefabs to be replaced.</p>  <p>  It is intended that this assessment when finalised will enable the replacement of such prefabs to commence in 2019.

Where an outside organisation is engaged by a school, they should be engaged in the context of delivering a planned and comprehensive programme in the school. They must not be brought in to replace the schools delivery of the curriculum but to enhance it. Interventions and external inputs should be evaluated by the school principal and teachers in terms of the content, approach, methodology and proposed learning outcomes.</p>  <p>  National and international research has consistently shown that the classroom teacher is the best placed professional to work sensitively and consistently with pupils and that s/he can have a powerful impact on influencing pupils&rsquo; attitudes, values and behaviour in all aspects of health education in the school setting. </p>  <p>  Every school is required to adhere to the Department&rsquo;s 'Child Protection Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools' and must ensure that it meets any Garda vetting obligations that arise in respect of persons who work with pupils in the school. My Department provides guidelines to schools on the use of external providers for SPHE in particular. The guidelines were issued to schools in circulars 0022/2010 and circular 0023/2010 for primary and post-primary schools respectively.</p>  <p>  In the context of the work my Department is undertaking to develop a Wellbeing Policy Statement for Schools, the guidelines to schools will be revised to provide more comprehensive and strengthened guidance to schools on the effective use of external programmes and facilitators relating to all aspects of Wellbeing.</p></reply>

These works will be carried out by the schools themselves on a devolved basis mainly over the summer months, so the disruption to students, teachers and other school staff will be kept to a minimum.</p><p>Furthermore, the Department intends to engage with the relevant education partners in relation to giving schools a better lead-in period for planning and delivering projects under the summer works scheme from 2019 onwards.  While the Summer Works Scheme is hugely successful in enabling small scale refurbishment works to be done on a devolved basis, the Department considers that the operation of the scheme could be improved by providing a better lead-in period for schools rather than in Quarter 2 as in previous years.This will also help ensure that works done under the Summer Works Scheme fit better with any wider refurbishment/energy retrofit plans that may be done at schools under the increased funding provided in the National Development Plan. The engagement with education partners will commence shortly and will assist in developing a better timeline for the planning and delivery of summer works projects for 2019 onwards.</p></reply>

I am very conscious that the judicial process should not be a source of further trauma to anyone involved, with respect to both the rights of victims and accused persons.</p>  <p>  Much work has already been done to protect complainants in sexual offence cases from any additional trauma arising from the criminal process.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have begun a programme of establishing Divisional Protective Services Offices with specially trained staff to investigate these difficult crimes.  The Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017 has also significantly enhanced protections for victims of crime, including victims of sexual offences.  The Deputy will also be aware that complainants in sexual offence cases can currently access legal advice in certain limited circumstances.  This is given effect through the Legal Aid Board which provides a legal advice service free of charge to complainants in prosecutions for certain rape and sexual assault cases.  A person seeking this service is not required to undergo a means test or to pay a financial contribution.  A legal aid service is also provided in certain rape and sexual assault cases where the complainant&rsquo;s prior sexual experience has been raised by the defence in the course of the trial. In these instances the Legal Aid Board will appoint a solicitor and a barrister to represent the complainant when the issue of previous sexual history is being raised and this service is also available without a means test.</p>  <p>  Since announcing my plans for a review of the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences, I have been conducting a series of consultations with key stakeholders representing those affected by rape and sexual assault, including the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, the Rape Crisis Network Ireland, Women's Aid, the National Women's Council of Ireland and One in Four.  I invited these bodies to share with me their views of the current protections in place for victims, and where they have identified a need for further supports, including what, if any, further legal supports may be needed.  The information they have shared with me is being collated in my Department and will inform the development of the Terms of Reference for the review, which I intend to finalise shortly.</p></reply>

Issues of community identity and numbers of potential participants on GYDPs in the area will be key considerations here.</p>  <p>  The provision of GYDP services in all parts of the State has obvious advantages, particularly in terms of providing services for significant numbers of young people who cannot currently access them. In this regard, an independent evaluation report of the operation of an integrated approach to delivery of GYDP services within County Kerry, commissioned by my Department is expected to be finalised shortly.  This report will help with the further development of GYDP services in the context of the Call for Proposals.</p>  <p>  GYDPs deliver valuable services for young people who have committed a crime or may be at risk of offending as well as providing important support for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at local level.  I can assure the Deputy that in the context of the Call for Proposals my Department is committed to ensuring continuity of service for participants on GYDPs and maintain a community driven approach to their operation, as well as minimising any disruption for workers and service providers. In this regard, and in line with the overall objective of providing GYDP services to all children and young persons who require them, I am advised that the Call for Proposals will require applicants to provide for continuity of GYDP services for young people currently participating in the service.  Furthermore, the Call for Proposals process will facilitate existing service providers forming consortiums, which could apply to provide services under the new comprehensive approach that is being developed. </p>  <p>  GYDPs provide an effective and essential support to the operation of the statutory Garda Diversion Programme by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The principal focus of GYDPs is on young people who receive a Garda caution under the Diversion Programme for involvement in criminal or anti-social behaviour and are referred to a local GYDP (primary referrals).  GYDPs also accommodate a certain proportion of young people who are considered to be at risk of involvement in offending or anti-social behaviour (secondary referrals).</p>  <p>  In relation to secondary referrals, it has to be considered if, in principle, it is appropriate to refer a child to a Garda project where no criminal act has been identified.  For some, a better option might be referral to available mainstream youth services that could appropriately support them.  That being said, it is accepted that referrals to GYDPs must take account of local needs and issues in relation to access and availability of mainstream youth services.  Following the Call for Proposals process, GYDP services will still accommodate a certain proportion of secondary referrals and the proportion of these may vary from area to area depending on identified local needs.</p>  <p>  My Department is very much aware of the range of concerns expressed in relation to the Call for Proposals process.  I can assure the Deputy that careful consideration is being given to all issues raised by stakeholders involved in GYDPs, including those of independent service providers, as part of the extensive consultation process which is currently ongoing.  This process includes arrangements for an extensive series of meetings with community based organisations and project workers which will facilitate closer communication and exchange of information in relation to these matters.  In addition, the consultations will include arrangements to hear the views of young people, including participants or former participants on GYDPs.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the new approach to GYDP provision which is being developed in preparation for the Call for Proposals will not reduce the level of service that already exists, or the importance of community involvement in its delivery.  On the contrary, the intention is to build on, update and improve a very valuable service so that it is available to every child or young person in the country who requires it.  This improvement to the service will have benefits for significant numbers of young people in the State who cannot currently access GYDP services.  While certain aspects of the new service model have been determined, work is ongoing to complete the full details to be included in the Call for Proposals, which is expected to issue in the second quarter of this year.  I am convinced that community ownership and participation of the projects is an essential dimension that must be preserved and strengthened in the working out of this process.</p></reply>

A high-level Steering Group comprised of senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission and the Courts Service, together with the Director of the Decision Support Service, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service (DSS) and this work is ongoing. </p>  <p>  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) Order 2016 (S.I.

They will have had a negative first instance decision which determines that they have not demonstrated that they are in need of international protection.  If they remain as applicants for the years in question, they are likely to be exercising their right to appeal either to the International Protection Appeals Tribunal or to the Courts for Judicial Review.  Applications remain live on the system while the Courts determine the cases presented.  </p><p>On 31 December 2016, the International Protection Act 2015 (IPA 2015) was commenced, providing for the introduction of a single application procedure for people seeking international protection in the State.  The 2015 Act replaces the previous sequential application system with a single application process, for asylum, subsidiary protection and permission to remain in the State, bringing Ireland into line with the processing arrangements applicable in other EU Member States.  However, the Act also contained transitional arrangements which has put further pressures on processing.  The main challenge now faced is the need to quickly process the substantial number of cases on hand many of which were carried over from the previous system.  </p><p>As of 27 April 2018, there are a total of 5,300 applications for international protection pending in the IPO.  Some 2,200 applications were made before the commencement of the 2015 Act but were not finalised by the former Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) and the former Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT) by that date.  These applications reverted to be processed by the IPO under the transitional provisions of the 2015 Act.  Notwithstanding the increased caseload arising from the transitional arrangements, over 87% of applications are in the system for less than 3 years.  This is a major improvement from the situation when the McMahon Working Group reported on the matter in June 2015. </p><p>The challenge of clearing this additional caseload is being addressed by deploying increased resources and a continued review of efficiency and effective use of those resources, having due regard to the requirements of the 2015 Act, in order to maximise quality output, produce impartial decisions and ensure value for money for the taxpayer. In this regard, it is planned to increase the strength of the IPO Processing Panel over the coming months following public advertisement and interview.</p><p>The following Table provides a breakdown of the numbers of applicants 3 years and more being dealt with by the International Protection Office (IPO) and the International Protection Appeals Tribunal (IPAT).  It is of note that approximately 40% of the applicants in the IPO figures were returned from the RAT under the transition arrangements under the Act.  In addition, over 80 cases included in the overall figures in the table are the subject of Judicial Reviews, usually instigated by the applicants. <table><tr><th>Timescale since first application </th><th>No. cases in the IPO</th><th>No. cases in the IPAT</th></tr><tr><td>3 years - 5 years</td><td>447</td><td>176</td></tr><tr><td>5 years - 7 years </td><td>17</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>7 years or more</td><td>51</td><td>23</td></tr></table></p></reply>

While the Citizenship Division endeavours that most straightforward cases are processed to a decision within six months, this has to be seen in the context of the work involved in dealing with volumes of applications, some of which can be very complex in nature, and the need to ensure that each applicant fulfils the statutory conditions for naturalisation.  The nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases can take longer than others to process.  In some instances, completing the necessary checks may take a considerable period of time.</p><p>Processing timescales can often be impacted due to further documentation being required from the applicant, or payment of the required certificate fee is awaited, or the applicant has not been engaging with the office.  In some instances delays can arise at the final stage of the naturalisation process, for example, where additional information comes to light which requires to be considered.  In other instances the applicant themselves may request that a hold be put on their application, for example, where they may have returned to their country of origin for a prolonged period, to facilitate them in making arrangements to return to reside in the State, or where they have difficulty in obtaining satisfactory evidence of their identity or nationality.</p><p>The final stage requires the applicant to attend at a citizenship ceremony.  Citizenship ceremony days take place periodically throughout the year, at which up to 3,500 candidates for citizenship make their declaration of fidelity to the Irish nation and loyalty to the State, give an undertaking to uphold the laws of the State and to respect its democratic values and receive their certificate of naturalisation. The organisation of a citizen ceremony day involving over 3,500 applicants, together with their family and friends, is a significant logistical exercise usually taking a number of months to organise.  The next citizenship ceremony day will take place on 21 May 2018; persons in respect of whom the Minister has indicated an intention to grant a certificate of naturalisation are in the process of being invited to attend.  A very small number of persons whose applications were only approved in the very recent past cannot be accommodated at this ceremony and will be invited to attend the next ceremony. </p><p>INIS devotes a considerable amount of its overall resources to the processing of these cases. It also operates a dedicated phone helpline and email helpdesk available for all applicants interested in the progress of their application, details of which are available on the INIS website at<i><i>www.inis.gov.ie</i></i></p></reply>

The whole of Government effort to deliver on these objectives is supported by the annual Action Plan for Jobs. </p><p>The CSO estimates that between April 2016 and April 2017, 27,400 Irish emigrants returned to Ireland. As the economy continues to grow and the economy approaches full employment, this trend is likely to continue.</p><p>Since the first Action Plan for Jobs was launched in early 2012, there are almost 346,000 more people at work bringing total employment in the State to 2,225,100 (as of Q4 2017). My Department and its agencies have a range of initiatives to connect with Irish emigrants (and others) to outline the careers and entrepreneurial opportunities in Ireland. These include:</p><p>- IDA Ireland actively promotes Ireland as a location for new investment and Enterprise Ireland has specific targets to attract entrepreneurs to Ireland with a focused marketing programme underway in international markets.</p><p>- Since 2016, my Department has funded TechLife Ireland- a partnership with Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the Irish Technology industry - to promote and brand Ireland as a top destination to pursue a career in technology and attract top tech professionals to Ireland. Industry is playing an important role in supporting the initiative and driving its development.</p><p>- Science Foundation Ireland encourages leading researchers to move to Ireland raising Ireland's profile as a location for research excellence and career advancement. For instance, SFI awards two Saint Patrick's Day Science Medals to distinguished Irish scientists, engineers or technology leaders living and working in the USA: one academic and one from industry.</p><p>Finally, I would emphasise that ensuring a continued focus on attracting foreign direct investment and maintaining and improving competitiveness is critical to attracting talent back to Ireland.</p></reply>

Under Europe 2020, Ireland committed to raise gross (public and private) investment in Research and Development (R&amp;amp;D) to 2.5% of GNP by 2020. We reiterated this commitment in Innovation 2020, Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for research and development, science and technology.</p><p>The overarching vision in Innovation 2020 is for Ireland to become a Global Innovation Leader driving a strong sustainable economy and a better society &ndash; within this the focus is on excellence, talent and impact. Innovation 2020 commits all research funding government departments to ensure that R&amp;amp;D expenditure is afforded a sufficiently high priority. </p><p>As part of the whole of Government approach to Innovation 2020, an Implementation Group chaired by my Department and comprising representatives from key Government Departments, research funding agencies and the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Government has been established and is tasked with driving delivery of the actions in Innovation 2020.</p><p>As committed to in Innovation 2020, the Implementation Group is to report annually to the Cabinet Committee on progress in achieving high-level targets and delivering on actions. Two progress reports have been published and are available on my Department&rsquo;s website, <i><i>www.dbei.ie</i></i>. Innovation 2020 comprises 139 actions (which includes headline actions and their sub-actions). The Second Progress report, reporting on actions taken in the period up to July 2017, was published in December 2017. It stated that 42 actions had been initiated, 67 actions were ongoing and 8 actions were complete. The third progress report is due to be brought to Cabinet in July 2018. </p><p>As three quarters of Ireland&rsquo;s gross expenditure on R&amp;amp;D is funded by enterprise, a very significant part of our policy has been to align public effort in a manner that leverages R&amp;amp;D activity in the enterprise sectors. While private spending on R&amp;amp;D slowed during the financial crisis, it has been increasing steadily since 2011. Direct public expenditure on R&amp;amp;D climbed from &euro;719m in 2016 to an estimated &euro;768m for 2017.</p><p>Notwithstanding that we have increased both public and private R&amp;amp;D spending in recent years, Ireland&rsquo;s R&amp;amp;D intensity rate (R&amp;amp;D budget as a percentage of GNP) was estimated at 1.52% of GNP for 2015 and 1.43% of GNP in 2016. The recent fall has been due, in part, to the increase in GNP, which was particularly strong in 2015 for one-off reasons. While Ireland has not yet reached its 2020 target, it is worth noting only 2 of the EU27 countries have reached their targets as per latest figures. </p><p>The CSO introduced a new indicator in July 2017 (modified GNI or GNI*) designed to exclude globalisation effects that disproportionately impact the measurement of the size of the Irish economy. When using GNI* as a complementary indicator, the R&amp;amp;D intensity rate is estimated at 1.72% for 2016.</p><p>A mid-term evaluation of Innovation 2020 will be undertaken this year. This will give us the opportunity to review progress on the targets, goals and actions in Innovation 2020 so that we can identify any relevant adjustments in a timely manner to ensure successful delivery on the vision and objectives.</p><p>It is recognised that we will need to continue our drive to increase public and private investment in R&amp;amp;D if we are to realise our vision in Innovation 2020. I have emphasised that across Government there is a need to ensure that in discussions regarding financial allocations for future years, the importance of funding for R&amp;amp;D is kept to the fore.</p></reply>

The Board liaises with IDA Ireland and Tourism Ireland to maximise opportunities for the promotion of Ireland as a location for film productions. Information on its funding scheme is available on the Irish Film Board website at <i><i>www.irishfilmboard.ie</i></i>.</p><p>The Government also supports the film industry through the film tax relief scheme -  Section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  The twin approach of direct funding and tax expenditure measures maximises the benefits of the Government&rsquo;s support to the audiovisual industry.</p></reply>

The six external bodies are as follows:</p><p>- 2 persons nominated by ICTU </p><p>- 1 person nominated by Ibec </p><p>- 1 person nominated by the Irish Insurance Federation (IIF) </p><p>- 1 person nominated by the Central Bank</p><p>- 1 person nominated by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.</p><p>In addition to the six statutory nominees outlined above, members are generally recruited to the Board through open advertisement on the State Boards portal <i>www.stateboards.ie</i>operated by the Public Appointments Service (PAS) who, since 2014, have been responsible for putting in place an open, accessible, rigorous and transparent system to support Ministers in making appointments to State Boards.</p><p>There are currently two vacancies on the Board with a third position becoming vacant in July 2018.  One of these vacancies will be filled by seeking a nominee from Insurance Ireland (formerly the Irish Insurance Federation) as one of the nominating bodies under the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003. </p><p>The most recent advertisement on stateboards.ie seeks to recruit persons with medical and legal expertise for the other two Board positions.  Candidates are sought on the basis of this expertise, rather than being representatives of either medical or legal bodies.  Expertise in these areas is something the Board believes would be useful to its functioning and such skills have been available to the Board in the past.  Other desirable criteria for the posts include: prior experience on a Board, Committee or Working Group at a senior level; knowledge of corporate governance and risk management; understanding of the public sector, in particular, accountability structures and reforms; as well as familiarity with claims assessment, the insurance industry and of personal injuries in particular.  </p><p>Any individual who believes that they meet these criteria may apply and will be assessed in that regard.</p><p>As with all such advertisements, PAS advertise and manage the application process.  When all applications are received, PAS will assemble an Assessment Panel to consider the applications and present a list of eligible candidates to the Department for onward transmission to me as Minister.</p><p>Corporate Governance standards require that Board Members act in good faith and in the best interests of the State body.  The duty of Board Members is owed to the Agency and not to any specific stakeholder.</p></reply>

My Department allocated an additional &euro;5.5m in Budget 2018 to fund both PhDs and Research Masters and this additional funding has already been allocated by Science Foundation Ireland.  It is envisaged that further additional funding will be provided in 2019 and subsequent years to build on the initial steps taken in 2018.</p>  <p>   In this context, my Department recently launched a consultation on a proposed new Centres for Research Training (CRT) programme, to be funded through Science Foundation Ireland.  This new programme is designed to deliver world-class, postgraduate research and training programmes with a focus on employability and sectoral and international mobility.  It is proposed that SFI Centres for Research Training will provide sustainable programmes of research and training for cohorts of research Masters and PhD students commencing in 2019, with new cohorts of students enrolling in subsequent years.  The cohort-based programme will deliver a world-class, student-focused postgraduate experience which will contribute to the goal of positioning Ireland as a leader in postgraduate researcher training and education. </p>  <p>   In the area of research equipment and other infrastructure, Science Foundation Ireland has issued a 2018 Call and is currently assessing proposals using international peer review.  SFI has already funded more than &euro;50m of research infrastructure across the high education system since the start of 2016. </p>  <p>   The Department of Education and Skills also announced funding in the context of Budget 2018 to address the need for physical space for research in the higher education sector.  This includes &euro;200m for public private partnerships in the Institute of Technology sector and &euro;257m for investment in the higher education sector generally, including for research.  Significant additional investment in higher education infrastructure over the period to 2027 (in the region of &euro;3 billion) is indicated in the NDP and this will address both education and research activities in the higher education institutions.</p>  <p>  Pending a decision on a future cycle of PRTLI, the actions being taken by my Department and the Department of Education and Skills are addressing to a significant degree the requirements for increased investment in both physical infrastructure and human capital in higher education research as identified in Innovation 2020.</p></reply>

This more recent examination was a review of the arguments for repealing the rule that a company loses the audit exemption if it files its annual return late.  The CLRG did not find those arguments to be sufficiently compelling to outweigh the benefits of retaining the rule.  </p>  <p>  In 2011, the CLRG also reviewed the system that was in operation at that time whereby the Registrar of Companies could grant a waiver to a company that filed its annual return late.  That waiver was from payment of late filing fees.  The CLRG did recommend that such a grant should not be within the powers of the CRO.  Following the enactment of the Companies Act 2014, that waiver scheme was abolished. </p>  <p>  The CLRG went on to recommend that the waiver of late filing fees should instead be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, preferably the District Court.  Section 10 of the Companies (Statutory Audits) Bill 2017 proposes to give effect to that recommendation. </p>  <p>  However, since the publication of the Companies (Statutory Audits) Bill 2017 last November, it has become clearer that an application to the Court for a waiver of the late filing fees is not appropriate.  Given that the maximum late filing fee that could be waived is &euro;1,200, there appears to be little or no practical benefit for a company when the cost of going to court is taken into account.  Section 10 also provides that the Registrar of Companies would be a notice party and this has proved to be a significant administrative burden on the Companies Registration Office.  For these reasons, I intend to propose an amendment at Report Stage to delete section 10 as it stands in the Bill. </p>  <p>  Before the enactment of the Companies Act 2014, a company could apply to the High Court for an extension of time to file its annual return.  In 2011, a draft of the Bill that would become the Companies Bill 2012 was publicly available.  Accordingly, the CLRG, as part of its 2011 review, considered the provision in that draft Bill that extended the High Court&rsquo;s power to the District Court.  The CLRG welcomed that provision and it was subsequently enacted as section 343 (7) of the Companies Act 2014 and came into operation on 1 June 2015.  </p>  <p>  The Companies (Statutory Audits) Bill 2017 was published in November 2017 and the Company Law Review Group&rsquo;s sub-committee on statutory matters began a consideration of that Bill in January of this year.  The report of that sub-committee has not been finalised or adopted by the CLRG yet, so it is not yet published.</p></reply>

The introduction of the provision allowed the Registrar to better monitor compliance with annual return filing requirements. </p>  <p>  The section also provided that the High Court, on an application made (on notice to the Registrar of Companies) by a company, could, make an order extending the time in which the annual return of the company in relation to a particular year could be delivered to the Registrar of Companies.  I understand that 1 such application to the Court was made in the period in question.</p>  <p>  The ability of individuals to set up a separate legal entity and avail of limited liability is a real and significant privilege as well as being beneficial to the economy and society.

If a company fails to file on time, it will receive a further letter from the CRO warning that they have missed their deadline to file annual returns and advising them to file as soon as possible.  If a company still does not file it will receive an enforcement warning letter indicating that in the absence of filing of annual returns within 10 weeks of the letter, enforcement action will be commenced against the company.  The Registrar is empowered under the Companies Act 2014 to prosecute or to strike off the companies for non-compliance.  If the company is selected for strike off, a statutory strike-off notice is issued.  This will indicate that in the absence of filing of the outstanding returns, a notice of impending strike off will be inserted in the CRO Gazette within 28 days.  28 days after that notice has appeared in the CRO Gazette, the company will be struck off the register, unless all outstanding returns have been filed.  If a company is selected for strike off, the CRO is required by legislation to send only one warning notice.  The CRO is not required to issue notification and reminder letters and this course of action is undertaken to help companies to comply with their statutory obligations.  Companies who have been struck off the Register are over 1 year late in the filing of their annual returns. </p></reply>

The requirement for a company to file its annual return on time is an important transparency measure.  The financial statements and other information that accompany the annual return provide important safeguards for third parties such as suppliers, creditors and employees by giving access to financial information in relation to a company.  It is important that this information is provided on a timely basis to be meaningful.</p><p>Under section 874 Companies Act 2014, the Registrar of Companies may deliver a notice to a company or person if the Registrar has reasonable grounds for believing that the company is in default in the delivery, filing or making to the Registrar of a return or similar document required under the Companies Act 2014.</p><p>A defaulting person or company must, within the period of 21 days following the issue of a notice of on-the-spot fine by the Registrar to that person or company:</p><p>- Remedy the default by filing the outstanding annual return(s), and</p><p>- Make to the Registrar a payment of the amount set out in the notice.</p><p>The defaulting person or company would be prosecuted if the terms of the on-the-spot fine notice are not complied with within the 21-day period. </p><p>To date the Companies Registration Office has not utilised this enforcement mechanism as other measures available to it under the Companies Act 2014 have proved to be effective.

The conditions covered by the LTI are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.  Under the LTI Scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge. </p><p>There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the Scheme.</p><p>However, for people who are not eligible for the LTI scheme, there are other arrangements which protect them from excessive medicine costs.</p><p>Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;134 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p><p>People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.</p><p>People who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of GP consultations.</p></reply>

Recent development include:</p>  <p>  - In November 2015, the Government approved a major programme of patient safety reforms which included the establishment of a National Patient Safety Office (NPSO) in the Department of Health.  The NPSO was established in December 2016 to oversee a programme of patient safety measures.</p>  <p>  - The programme of patient safety centres on initiatives such as the establishment of a national patient advocacy service, the introduction of a patient safety surveillance system, the measurement of patient experience and extending the clinical effectiveness agenda.</p>  <p>  - The NPSO is also progressing a programme of legislation in relation to the provision of open disclosure of patient safety incidents, the Patient Safety Bill, which will provide for the mandatory reporting of serious reportable events, and a Patient Safety Licensing Bill, which will introduce a regulatory regime for all hospitals as well as certain designated high risk activities.</p>  <p>  In addition, on 25 October 2017, I launched the National Standards on the Conduct of Reviews of Patient Safety Incidents.  These standards, developed jointly by HIQA and the Mental Health Commission, set out a new approach to the way health providers respond to, review and investigate incidents in order to determine as quickly as possible what may have transpired, and why, to ensure that they can immediately implement any improvements necessary to prevent a re-occurrence.  </p>  <p>  Finally, the Health Service Executive (HSE) finalised the review of its safety incident management Policy and launched its new Incident Management Frameworks in January which will support implementation.</p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key health service objective.  However, the challenge is to do this in a safe and sustainable manner.  Treatment must be appropriate and proportionate and clinical decision-making, such as prescribing, should be based on both patient needs and sound medical evidence.</p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plasters are licensed for localised relief of post-shingles pain in adults.  This is the patch's only licensed use in Ireland. It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010.</p><p>Clinical concern arose when, from 2012 on, usage increased significantly, to the point where more plasters were being used in Ireland than in the entire UK National Health Service.  In such situations, it is important and appropriate for clinicians to review usage and, in 2016, the HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) reviewed the use of the plasters.  The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing was for the licensed indication.</p><p>From September 2017, following the clinical review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement approval system for the patches, to support appropriate use and patient care.  Under these arrangements, the patient's GP or consultant applies to the MMP for reimbursement approval on behalf of the patient.  In the case of a negative decision, the treating clinician can appeal the decision.  Once a patient is approved for reimbursement support, irrespective of the indication, there is no expiry on the duration of treatment.  This also applies to applications already approved by the MMP.</p><p>As of 1 May 2018, there have been 6,250 online applications from clinicians requesting the reimbursement lidocaine patches.  Of these applications, 1,451 patients (over 23%) have been approved.  Of 807 online appeals, over 70% of patients have been approved for reimbursement.  The MMP has sought further information on another 71 appeals.  Accordingly, since 1 September 2017, 2,019 patients have been approved for reimbursement of lidocaine plasters, based on the clinical case made by their GP or consultant.</p><p>It is clear that this new process supports appropriate use and prescribing and both post-shingles patients and other appropriate cases can continue to be treated with lidocaine plasters.</p><p>The HSE notified prescribers and pharmacies of the introduction of the new system in August 2017.  This advice was re-issued recently, and information for patients and practitioners is on the HSE Medicines Management Programme website at <i>www.hse.ie/yourmedicines.</i></p><p>This reimbursement decision is a matter for the HSE.

The Act sets out criteria for decisions on reimbursement.  As Minister for Health, I do not have any statutory power or function in relation to the reimbursement of medicines.</p><p>In line with the 2013 Act, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed through the community drug schemes, it must submit an application to the HSE to have the new item added to the Reimbursement List.</p><p>As outlined in the IPHA agreement, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving the application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to add the medicine to the reimbursement list, agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine or refuse to reimburse it.</p><p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). </p><p> The NCPE conducts health technology assessments for the HSE, and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions.  The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.</p><p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible.  However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments can be ongoing multi-million euro investments.  Pricing issues can lead to a protracted deliberation process.</p><p>I am keen to engage with industry and to explore ways in which new medicines might be more easily introduced in Ireland.  However, any innovative approaches that may be tabled must be compatible with the statutory provisions in place and must also recognise pricing and funding issues in the context of finite Exchequer resources. </p><p>I have indicated willingness to meet with MS Ireland and my office is in contact with the organisation to arrange a mutually convenient date.</p></reply>

It is in the process of developing a roadmap for progressing its work within its Terms of Reference; and is in particular reviewing existing food and drink reformulation targets such as EU and UK targets for salt, saturated fat and added sugars along with working towards agreeing a methodology for choosing food and drink product categories for the purposes of its work on reformulation. </p><p>The Group is also continuing its consideration of mechanisms for consulting with industry.  Any report of the Reformulation Sub-Group in line with its Terms of Reference can be made available. </p><p>The process for the Reformulation Sub-Group's work with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland on monitoring, validating and setting reformulation targets will be conducted in the context of the FSAI's representative on the membership of the sub-group.  But in addition to this representation, my Department liaises with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) on a regular basis.  The FSAI has been validating food industry salt reduction work for many years.  It has carried out this work by sampling foods from the market and having them analysed in the HSE Public Analysts Laboratory in Galway.  This data is published annually and is available on the FSAI website (<i>fsai.ie).</i></p><p>The FSAI is now exploring the validation of food industry sugar and fat reduction work. In the first instance, it generated baseline data on specific foods based on their labelling and a detailed report on this work is imminent.  In 2018 the FSAI is validating this baseline data by funding the analysis of breakfast cereal and yoghurts for sugar, fat and salt by an external laboratory. </p><p>The National Obesity Policy and Action Plan approved by Government recommended that proposals be developed relating to the roll-out of evidence based fiscal measures, including a levy on sugar-sweetened drinks, in support of healthy eating.  As the Deputy is aware, the Sugar-Sweetened Drinks Tax commenced on the 1st of May.  It represents a positive step in our national policy to deal with the problem of obesity.  </p><p>My Department is currently developing proposals for the purposes of conducting an evaluation of the SSD Tax and the work of the Reformulation Sub-Group is likely to feed into a methodology developed for measuring its efficacy.</p></reply>

The OPAP recommended that a code of practice for food and beverages promotion, marketing and sponsorship be developed, implemented and evaluated in conjunction with the food industry, HSE, Dept of Children and Youth Affairs, safefood, Food Safety Authority of Ireland and advertiser organisations.  The OPAP premised this recommendation by providing that 'already there are many examples of the food industry making positive contributions to the prevention of obesity and it is essential to capitalise and expand on such initiatives'.</p>  <p>  The group that developed the Codes involved representatives from the food industry, advertising sector, statutory agencies, and various Government Departments.  It was chaired by the former CEO of the statutory Food Safety Authority of Ireland. The Codes of Practice concerned were published in February.</p>  <p>  The Codes of Practice are one of the suite of actions set out in the OPAP in the knowledge that no single sector or agency, or no single action, is able to solve this issue on their own.  Everyone and every sector has a role to play in those solutions.</p>  <p>  Section 10 of the Codes of Practice provides for a governance framework for these codes.  It stipulates that the Codes 'will be monitored for compliance and effectiveness by a monitoring body designated by the Minister for Health'  and that the Codes 'will be underpinned by guidance developed by the monitoring body with respect to its application'.  It is not possible at this juncture to specify a timeframe for the development of the latter; but work on the establishment of the monitoring body is underway, and I expect that significant progress will be made in this regard in the coming months.</p></reply>

This is mainly due to the fact that the nature of such liabilities for the HSE mainly arise as a result of current ongoing litigation.  Due to this, it is difficult to determine a) if payment will be probable or b) to calculate a reliable estimate of the potential cost to the HSE until the current test cases have gone through the courts.  Also disclosing any amount could be deemed prejudicial to the issue.  Whilst no provision is made, contingent liabilities are reflected in Note 26 to the HSE Annual Financial Statements each year. </p>  <p>  Funding is allocated to the Department on the basis of costs that will be incurred during the year and is not allocated for possible future funding liabilities.  On this basis, material contingent liabilities funding will only be allocated when the cost associated with it crystalises.  At such time, the Department of Health will engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to funding for the actual cost that the Department will incur.  There has been no crystallisation of a contingent liability for the Department in the last ten years.</p></reply>

The emphasis of the Framework is on recognising good performance, improving performance at all levels of the health service and ensuring that individual managers are held to account for their performance.</p>  <p>  The Framework ensures that named senior health service managers designated as Accountable Officers, including all Hospital Group CEOs, are explicitly and personally accountable for performing within their budget allocation.  The sole line of executive accountability for the Hospital Group CEO is to the National Director for Acute Hospital Services.</p>  <p>  Accountable Officers are provided with a budget to deliver the services set out in the National Service Plan and in their service level operational plans.  They are accountable for their performance in delivering against these plans within budget, and for any specified performance improvements.  Accountable Officers are responsible for preparing a financial plan in line with their Performance Agreement which sets out the actions that they will take to meet the agreed performance targets across the four domains of performance outlined above.</p>  <p>  It is a core responsibility of managers to manage the delivery of services for which they are accountable and they are required to keep performance under constant review, have in place a monthly performance management process and take timely corrective actions to address any underperformance emerging.  Under the PAF, Hospital Group CEOs are expected to have formal monthly performance management processes in place with their direct reports who are accountable at hospital level, to satisfy accountability requirements under the PAF.  This includes the Voluntary Hospitals within their Group (this responsibility exercised via the Service Level Arrangement (SLA) signed by the Group CEO with each Voluntary Hospital).</p>  <p>  In relation to the governance and budgetary oversight of hospitals within the South/South West Hospital Group specifically, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key health service objective.  However, the challenge is to do this in a safe and sustainable manner.  Treatment must be appropriate and proportionate and clinical decision-making, such as prescribing, should be based on both patient needs and sound medical evidence.</p>  <p>  Lidocaine 5% medicated plasters are licensed for localised relief of post-shingles pain in adults.  This is the patch's only licensed use in Ireland. It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010.</p>  <p>  Clinical concern arose when, from 2012 on, usage increased significantly, to the point where more plasters were being used in Ireland than in the entire UK National Health Service. In such situations, it is important and appropriate for clinicians to review usage and, in 2016, the HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) reviewed the use of the plasters.  The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing was for the licensed indication.</p>  <p>  From September 2017, following the clinical review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement approval system for the patches, to support appropriate use and patient care.  Under these arrangements, the patient's GP or consultant applies to the MMP for reimbursement approval on behalf of the patient.  The treating clinician may appeal a negative decision to the MMP, making a clinical case for reimbursement. </p>  <p>  As of 1 May 2018, there have been 6,250 online applications from clinicians requesting the reimbursement lidocaine patches.  Of these applications, 1,451 patients (over 23%) have been approved. Of 807 online appeals, over 70% of patients have been approved for reimbursement.  The MMP has sought further information on another 71 appeals.  Accordingly, since 1 September 2017, 2,019 patients have been approved for reimbursement of lidocaine plasters, based on the clinical case made by their GP or consultant.</p>  <p>  This process supports appropriate use and prescribing and both post-shingles patients and other appropriate cases can continue to be treated with lidocaine plasters.  While I cannot comment on individual cases, it is open to a patient's clinician to appeal a decision to refuse reimbursement. </p>  <p>  Reimbursement decisions are a matter for the HSE.  However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

It is first and foremost a busy working fishery harbour which also provides for other complementary ancillary activities, seafood processing enterprises, cruise liner visits and other marine leisure enterprises. </p>  <p>  The development of the defining infrastructure in Dunmore East for the purposes of supporting the fishing industry commenced in the 1960's and was completed in the early 1970's.  The infrastructure places limits on Harbour managements' ability to cater for and safely facilitate an ever increasing demand for diverse and additional usage. </p>  <p>  At all times safety is a primary concern, and my Department, specifically local Harbour Management has and will continue to engage with stakeholders to ensure that the core fishing activity continues and is managed appropriately, while balancing this priority with the safe operation of all other Harbour activity. </p>  <p>  In regard to developments in the Harbour, I am happy to advise the Deputy that in excess of &euro;14 million has been invested in maintenance, development and upgrading works at Dunmore East FHC as part of my Department&rsquo;s Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme from 2010 to 2017, most notably including the &euro;6 million dredging project in 2015 which has improved conditions for fishing vessels in the harbour and manoeuvrability for fish landings.</p>  <p>  In addition, I allocated further funding of &euro;2.4 million this year for the ongoing maintenance and development of Dunmore East Fishery Harbour Centre.  Significant works in this year&rsquo;s capital programme include the continuation of the West Wharf upgrade works scheduled for completion in the coming months at a total cost in the region of &euro;3 million.</p>  <p>  I also expect that the development of the area known as Shanoon will be completed this year.  This area has been used in recent years as a car park, the surface of the area has been in very poor condition and required work to bring it to a satisfactory standard for users.  Ninety two car parking spaces will be provided in this development which is expected to cost in the region of &euro;250,000.  A new drainage network is being installed as part of these works, as well as new footpaths.  Lighting columns will also be located at various locations throughout the parking areas.  The existing earthen embankments will be retained where possible throughout the car parking areas.  Visibility over the embankments out to sea is to be maintained. </p>  <p>  These substantial investments demonstrate my ongoing commitment to the development of Dunmore East Fishery Harbour Centre.  As the Deputy is aware, all developments in the six Fishery Harbour Centres will be considered under future Capital Programmes on the basis of available exchequer funding and competing national priorities.</p></reply>

This gave an important boost to the trade in young calves, and brought greater equity in the fees payable for calves, weanlings and adult cattle.  </p>  <p>  Exports of calves rose by 20%, to just over 100, 000, in 2017 compared to 2016.  The inspection fee for bovines over three months remains unchanged at &euro;4.80.  </p>  <p>  The cost of reducing the veterinary inspection fee payable on live exports of calves under three months of age can be illustrated as follows:</p>  <p>  Veterinary inspection fees for a load of say 100 calves under three months of age come to &euro;120.  If reduced by 20%, the inspection fee would come to &euro;96.  If reduced by 40%, the inspection fee would come to &euro;72.  If reduced by 60%, the inspection fee would come to &euro;48.  If reduced by 80%, the inspection fee would come to &euro;40.  </p>  <p>  Similarly, the cost of reducing the veterinary inspection fee payable on bovines over three months of age can be illustrated as follows:</p>  <p>  If the inspection fee of &euro;4.80 was reduced by 20%, the inspection fee for a load of 100 cattle would come to &euro;384.  If reduced by 40% the inspection fee would come to &euro;288.  If reduced by 60%, the inspection fee would come to &euro;192.  If reduced by 80%, the inspection fee would come to &euro;96.  </p>  <p>  Animal health and welfare are important contributory factors to the quality and safety of food, and to the prevention of the spread of animal diseases.  The veterinary inspection of live animals for export contributes to maintaining Ireland's reputation as an exporter of livestock of high health status, which is vital to my Department's ongoing efforts to source additional markets abroad.  EU Member States are obliged under the EU Official Controls Regulation (882/2004) to carry out official controls to verify compliance with animal health and welfare rules.</p></reply>

The Deputy is correct to refer to the dairy sector, but labour pressures also exist in the horticultural and meat processing sectors. While the reasons for the shortages are varied, they include the significant value added growth expansion of the sector in recent years; the growth in the economy as a whole which has meant we are now approaching full employment; and also economic and associated employment growth in other EU countries which have traditionally supplied workers for the Irish agri-food sector.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the impact that these labour shortages are having, and I am committed to helping the sectors involved find appropriate solutions.</p>  <p>  In relation to the dairy sector, last November I established a multi stakeholder group with a view to ensuring that Irish dairying has access to the human capital it requires to realise its ambitions. I expect that this Group will finalise an action plan in the coming weeks which will address the short and medium term labour issues facing the dairy sector. This action plan will make an important contribution to alleviating the labour shortage issue that exists and will be submitted to the Food Wise High Level Implementation Committee for information.</p>  <p>  In addition to the work of this group, a range of other measures are being pursued by the dairy sector to try to attract and retain labour, including exchanges with New Zealand, enhanced efforts to recruit from within the European economic area, as well as efforts at regional level to engage with, and attract people on the live register, homemakers and drystock farmers to avail of opportunities on dairy farms.</p></reply>

While the EU study illustrates that small Member States have a large potential to increase their domestic biogas production (in terms of production per inhabitant), these figures are based on accelerated growth scenarios with the upper limits of feedstock potential used.</p>  <p>  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) in their recent report on &ldquo;The Assessment of Cost and Benefits of Biogas and Biomethane in Ireland&rdquo; also highlight that the potential of biogas production could be 35PJ by 2050. This is based on maximum use of grass silage and other resources for anaerobic digestion (AD), which could prove very expensive to mobilise. </p>  <p>  I also recognise that there is an opportunity to encourage the utilisation of agricultural waste as an alternative source of energy. I have noted that while it is possible to produce and utilise methane through AD of stored manure (which accounts for only 10% of agricultural methane), academic and industry research suggests that there is the potential for a significant role in the heat and transport sectors for biogas produced by anaerobic digestion, analysis to date would suggest that costs are a significant factor.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding, my Department and the Government recognise that indigenous renewable energy plays a vital role in our domestic fuel mix and will become even more important in the context of reducing our reliance on imported fuels and in meeting our challenging renewable energy targets. My Department is committed to working closely with the Department for Communications, Climate Action and Environment which is the lead Department in this area, to ensure that the supply of domestic biomass and residues available in the forest and agriculture sectors are mobilised to support energy generation from a range of bioenergy technologies. </p>  <p>  Given renewed interest in this technology and an interest from industry in mobilising biomethane, my Department is also collaborating closely with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment to consider the potential for anaerobic digestion to contribute to Ireland's significant renewable energy and Green House Gas targets, and promote the development of Ireland's bioeconomy.</p></reply>

This support amounts to  &euro;4 billion over the period 2014-2020. Under GLAS our agri-environmental climate measure in the RDP a significant portion of funding is devoted to water protection measures such as priority access to farmers in high status water areas.</p><p>Our Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme (TAMS) provides grant aid of 40% to all farmers and up to 60% to young trained farmers investing in slurry and manure storage facilities and concrete silage slabs etc. The Low Emission Slurry Spreading Scheme has been particularly successful and provides grant support for use of new technology which will increase the value of applied slurries on farms. This leads to reduced nutrient losses and therefore benefit water quality and over 1500 applications have been received to date.</p><p>In addition my Department funds the Teagasc Agricultural Catchments Programme (ACP) which is a joint research and advisory programme operated by Teagasc in six agricultural catchments across the country. The scientific findings from the ACP help fulfil Ireland's monitoring and reporting requirements under the EU Nitrates Directive and the EU Water Framework Directive. The findings support key agri-environmental policies and strategies, including the recent review of the NAP and the 2nd cycle of River Basin District Planning under the Water Framework Directive.</p><p>The most recent support is a collaborative approach between my Department, Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the dairy industry to fund  water advisors for farmers to assist in them in meeting water protection standards. This is an important measure as it is a whole of government, whole of sector innovation and an important measure in Ireland's recently published River Basin Management Plan.</p><p>The Nitrates, Biodiversity and Engineering (NBE) Division of my Department plays a major role in the development and implementation of policies and operations pertaining to the NAP and Nitrates Derogation, in addition to other responsibilities.

It involves the establishment and joint funding between my Department, the Department of Housing, Planning &amp;amp; Local Government (DHPLG) and the Dairy Industry of a resource of 30 Agricultural Sustainability Advisors. 20 Advisors are being jointly funded by my Department and the DHPLG. </p><p>These Advisors will receive comprehensive training provided by Teagasc to ensure a consistent and unified approach. The Government funded Advisors will be managed by Teagasc's environmental section with oversight provided by both my Department and DHPLG.</p><p>This four year programme supports the goals of the Food Wise 2025 strategy, facilitating increased productivity hand-in-hand with a more sustainable sector. The sustainability and efficiency gains will be achieved through improved nutrient management with more targeted use of fertiliser, better farmyard practice, and the development of new approaches to reducing nutrient losses in critical source areas. </p><p>The programme has the potential to strengthen delivery of Ireland's obligations under the Water Framework Directive. It is part of a new approach to River Basin Management Planning for the 2018&ndash;2021 cycle. This new approach includes the development of a much-strengthened evidence base to understand the full range of pressures affecting water quality and the development of the programmes of measures needed to deliver improvements. Over time, the Programme will also address on-farm climate change and biodiversity strategies</p><p>Under the programme, the new team will promote on-farm sustainability best practice to farmers in 190 priority catchments identified by the EPAs in consultation with other Government agencies and Departments. Furthermore the Dairy Co-ops will support sustainability best practice through their structures, promoting best farmyard and nutrient management practice across all their suppliers.</p><p>Projected expenditure details for the 20 Sustainability Advisers and 3 Overhead Personnel, being financed by my Department and DHPLG, are as follows:<table><tr><th></th><th>2018</th><th>2019</th><th>2020</th><th>2021</th></tr><tr><td>Total Annual Cost &euro;</td><td>816,944</td><td>1,686,207</td><td>1,741,284</td><td>1,868,844</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The recently completed Sustainable nitrogen fertiliser Use and Disaggregated Emissions of Nitrogen (SUDEN) project generated, for the first time, Irish specific ammonia emission factors for dung and urine deposited by grazing cows. The project also identified that farmers can maintain yields and reduce ammonia loss to the environment by switching from CAN to urea protected with NBPT (urease inhibiter). The research found nitrogen loss to the environment can be reduced substantially by integrating urease inhibitors in high profit grass systems.<i></i>Following on from this, my Department made an award of further funding for a project titled 'Manipulation and Integration of Nitrogen Emissions (MINE)', which aims to use cutting edge techniques to provide greater understanding of the processes and factors controlling nitrous oxide emissions. </p><p>The LowAmmo project, which is focusing specifically on addressing knowledge gaps in national ammonia emissions data,<i></i>including measurement, modelling and mitigation of ammonia emissions from livestock housing, grazing depositions and slurry storage, is scheduled to conclude later this year. Data collected will feed directly into the refinement of Ireland's national ammonia inventory. The mitigation options for yards and slurry storage investigated in LowAmmo will also provide valuable data for the future development of abatement options.</p><p>Furthermore, we have a whole territory approach to nitrates implementation so all farmers are obliged to abide by nutrient management planning which has many synergies with reducing ammonia due to the efficient use of animal manure. The <i>Nitrates Action Programme</i>agreed in December 2017 included a balanced programme of measures supporting the objectives of achieving good water quality while at the same time encouraging sustainable and efficient agricultural practices. The measures in Ireland's derogation take account of the growing numbers of derogation farmers who are farming at intensive stocking rates, and also environmental objectives for water, climate change and ammonia which Ireland must achieve.  For example, a new condition for derogation farms has been included in that from 2018, 50% or more of slurry must be applied by 15 June and after that it must be applied by using low emission slurry spreading (LESS) equipment. </p><p>Additionally, my Department supports the grant aid for Low Emission Slurry Spreading (LESS) equipment under the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme known as TAMS II and supports the application of slurry via LESS equipment as an option in the GLAS agri-environment scheme which significantly reduces the ammonia losses from slurry.</p><p>Officials from my Department are also engaging with the Department of Communications Climate Action and the Environment, who are the lead Department on air quality issues, on the development of a National Clean Air Strategy.</p></reply>

I recently finalised these regulations ahead of the opening date for the commercial season on 12 May 2018.  These regulations are concerned with conservation of each genetically unique river stock and apply to those rivers with a harvestable surplus of fish on which it is intended to open commercial fisheries. </p>  <p>  District Committees, which include representatives of both the angling and commercial fishing sectors, meet annually to make recommendations on how any surplus on each river is to be allocated between anglers and commercial fishermen.  These recommendations are notified to the relevant Regional Director of IFI to assist informed decision making.</p>  <p>  The commercial salmon fishing season has normally closed on 31 July for many years &ndash; for a small number of years this was extended into August for some fisheries on the basis that the full allocation for commercial fishermen was not being taken by the closing date. </p>  <p>  In 2018, the established closing date of 31 July is being set in an effort to protect the important late running cohort of salmon - the traditional 'autumn run'.  Salmon catch is limited by quota and there is a strong possibility that the quotas will be fully utilised by the commercial nets before that date.  In the event that the allocation in any individual fishery is not taken by the closing date the option remains for me to consider an extension to the season, on a case by case basis.</p></reply>

The findings of the report were debated in the D&aacute;il on 29 March, 2018.</p>  <p>  Both Public Service Broadcasters spend millions of euro each year on independently produced programming. This is vital in supporting a vibrant independent sector, including in the regions. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, Section 116 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 provides that RT&Eacute; make specific amounts available each year for the commissioning of television and radio programmes from the independent production sector. In 2016, it spent &euro;39.6m on independent productions. A total of 719 hours (300 radio, 419 television) were commissioned across a range of programme categories. </p>  <p>  In addition, TG4 commissions the majority of its Irish language programmes from independent production companies throughout Ireland. In 2016, the broadcaster spent over &euro;22.5m on independent productions, which was 90% of its annual programme budget for that year.</p>  <p>  In order to sustain and increase the amount spent on independent productions, additional resources are required for public service broadcasting.

The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector. Today, almost 7 out of 10 of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband. Since this Government came into office almost 400,000 additional premises have access to high speed broadband. This will increase to nearly 8 out of 10 premises by the end of this year and by 2020, 9 out of 10 premises will have access to a high speed broadband connection. This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention.</p><p>In April 2017 I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie. This map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the National Broadband Plan (NBP). </p><p>The Map is colour coded and searchable by address/eircode:</p><p>- The AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP and are the subject of an ongoing procurement process. </p><p>- The BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services. </p><p>- The LIGHT BLUE areas represent eir's commercial rural deployment plans to roll-out high speed broadband to 300,000 premises as part of a Commitment Agreement signed with me in April 2017.</p><p>Premises in the Cobh area fall into all of these categories. Individuals can check which category their premises falls into by going to my Department's website www.broadband.gov.ie and entering their eircode into the High Speed Broadband Map.</p><p>My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area. That procurement process is now in its final stages.</p><p>In April 2017, I signed a Commitment Agreement with eir in relation to its plans to provide high speed broadband to 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis. Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available at . A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my Department's website www.dccae.gov.ie. </p><p>Where someone living in a Blue area is unable to obtain a high speed broadband service, I would ask you to please encourage them to email my Department at broadband@dccae.gov.ie with their eircode and details of the service providers they have contacted and my officials will respond. </p><p>Prior to the roll-out of the State Intervention network, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is improving.

The purpose of the Plan is to specify the policy measures required in order to manage Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions at a level appropriate for making progress towards our long-term national transition objective as set out in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, as well as to take into account existing EU and international obligations on the State in relation to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Although this first Plan will not provide a complete roadmap to achieve the national transition objective to 2050, it begins the process of development of medium- to long-term options to ensure that we are well positioned to take the necessary actions in the next and future decades.</p>  <p>  Building on the National Mitigation Plan, the publication in February of the National Development Plan, will lead to a significant step change in funding available for climate action over the next decade. Almost &euro;22 billion will be directed, between Exchequer and non-Exchequer resources, to addressing the transition to a low-carbon and climate resilient society. In addition, the National Development Plan allocated a further &euro;8.6 billion for investments in sustainable mobility. This capital investment will enable us to deliver a significant reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions over the period to 2030. </p>  <p>  Within the framework of the National Mitigation Plan, the transport sector will need to play a strong role in contributing to our national emissions reduction effort and the Department for Transport, Tourism and Sport is working closely with my Department to develop and implement the policies and measures necessary to achieve these emissions reductions. </p>  <p>  In May 2017, the National Policy Framework on Alternative Fuels Infrastructure for Transport in Ireland was published. It set out the ambition that by 2030 all new cars and vans sold in Ireland will be zero-emissions capable. This ambition was also included in the National Mitigation Plan and was further reinforced by the commitment in the National Development Plan 2018-2027, published in February 2018, that no new non-zero emission vehicles would be sold in Ireland post 2030. Achieving the National Development Plan ambition would require that no new fossil fuel powered cars, including hybrid variants, would be sold in Ireland post-2030. </p>  <p>  In order to consider the range of measures and options available to Government to accelerate the uptake of lower emitting vehicles, a dedicated Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce was established. The low emission vehicle transition will be delivered as quickly and as effectively as possible through a combination of implementing the measures outlined in the National Mitigation Plan, the National Planning Framework and the National Development Plan; realising the outcomes of the Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce deliberations; and developing new and innovative policy interventions in the years ahead in light of technological and market developments.</p></reply>

Investment in further renewable generation will be incentivised. Natural gas will continue to play a key role as a transition fuel.  </p><p>The National Development Plan 2018-2027 sets out clear measures towards decarbonisation, including the upgrading of 45,000 homes every year from 2021 to make them energy efficient, up to 4,500 MW of renewable electricity generation, roll-out of the support scheme for renewable heat, and commitments on electric vehicles and low-emission public transport. However, in the transition, the lowest CO<sub>2</sub>emitting fossil fuel is still required to ensure a safe, secure and competitive path towards sustainability. In addition to this the planned closure of Moneypoint by 2025 and the ending of peat for electricity generation in advance of 2030 will have an positive impact.</p><p>In regard to future electricity demand, EirGrid have modelled a number of scenarios in their 2017 publication &ldquo;Tomorrow&rsquo;s Energy Scenarios&quot;. Each scenario predicts a different possible future for the generation and consumption of electricity out to 2040. A link to the document is available at  </p><p><i> </i></p></reply>

I would note that Tusla was set up in January 2014, and prior to this the services were provided by the Health Service Executive.</p>  <p>  Tusla, the Child and Family Agency has a clear protocol for managing concerns or allegations about foster carers which is procedure which is the &lsquo;Interim Protocol for managing concerns and allegations of abuse or neglect against Foster Carers and Section 36 (relative) Foster Carers&rsquo;.  This guidance is in place nationally. A revised national procedure and guidance is expected to be available this year.</p>  <p>  The guidance is underpinned by the Child Care Act 1991, as amended, the foster care regulations, Children First guidance and the National Standards for Foster Care.  All foster carers are mandated reporters under Children First Act 2015.</p>  <p>  When an allegation of abuse is made, immediate action is taken to protect any child or children who may be at immediate risk. All steps taken are informed by the best interests and safety of the children involved.  Under Children First, all referrals involving child sexual abuse are referred by Tusla to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  Sexual abuse allegations are the most serious form of concerns that are raised against foster carers. An allegation regarding a child in foster care is investigated by the Child Protection Social Work Team. The link social worker for the foster carers does not investigate the allegation however a notification is made to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as it would be for any referral where abuse is suspected or confirmed. </p>  <p>  Sexual abuse is often a secretive act, and sometimes even those closest to the child won&rsquo;t know until the child feels they can disclose what is happening. Each case is unique and all the facts must be looked at to make sure that the child is safe from harm or abuse. </p>  <p>  It is often necessary to consider if a child should be moved from the foster home in order to keep them safe. However, In some cases the person who is in or who has access to the foster home and who may be posing the risk to the child can be removed.  It may, then, be assessed that the child could remain in the foster home if an effective safety plan can be put in place and there are no other reasons for the child to be moved from the home. The child involved is interviewed and this is included as part of the assessment.  This is done sensitively by trained social workers, who moderate their approach according to the child&rsquo;s ability to discuss the events.  The commitment and ability of the foster carers to protect the child is also assessed.  A key element of a good safety plan is regular monitoring.  If a safety plan is not appropriate given the circumstances, an immediate action to remove the child to an alternate placement will take place.  </p></reply>

A minimum of 520 contributions is required for entitlement to standard state pension (contributory) and a minimum of 260 contributions is required for entitlement to a mixed insurance pro-rata pension. </p>  <p>  Under European Union regulations, a person&rsquo;s social insurance record in one or more EU countries can be combined with their Irish social insurance record to determine entitlement to a pro-rata pension.  A deciding officer has decided that the person concerned is eligible for an EU (mixed insurance) pro rata state pension (contributory), based on their Irish full and modified rate social insurance contributions, together with their EU social insurance contributions.  The rate payable is calculated based on the proportion of Irish full-rate social insurance contributions to the person&rsquo;s total social insurance contributions.  </p>  <p>  EU pro-rata pension entitlement is calculated by firstly establishing the person&rsquo;s theoretical pension entitlement, by treating all the contributions as Irish and dividing that number by their number of years from start to end of employment.  The person concerned has a total of 1,644 contributions (their Irish and EU contributions combined) over a 43 year period.  This gives them a yearly average of 38.  This gives them a theoretical weekly rate of pension entitlement (if all contributions were Irish) of &euro;225.80.</p>  <p>  As all contributions are not Irish, their EU pro-rata pension entitlement is calculated by multiplying their theoretical rate (of &euro;225.80) by the number of their Irish contributions and dividing it by the number of their total contributions.  In this case, the person concerned has 164 paid (and credited) Irish contributions, which, multiplied by &euro;225.80 (the theoretical rate) and divided by 1,644 (the total number of their contributions), results in a theoretical EU pro-rata pension entitlement of &euro;22.53.   This rate is then multiplied by 164 (the number of paid and credited contributions) and divided by 522 (the total full-rate paid Irish and UK contributions).  Rounded up, this gives a pro rata pension entitlement of &euro;7.10 per week.  Following the budget increase of 30 March 2018, this amount increased to &euro;10.00 per week.</p>  <p>  The greater the number of Irish contributions paid by a person, the higher their weekly rate of Irish EU pro-rata pension entitlement.  In many cases a person is also entitled to a second (or more) pro-rata pension entitlement from other countries based on their social insurance contributions paid outside Ireland.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The international accounting standard (IAS.37) defines a contingent liability as:</p><p>(a) A possible obligation that arises as from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non- occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity; or </p><p>(b) A present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised because:</p><p>(1) it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefit will be required to settle the obligation; or </p><p>(2) the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.</p><p>In accordance with Government accounting rules and generally accepted accounting standards my Department does not make an accounting provision but discloses by way of note the detail of contingent liabilities in its annual statutory accounts.  These accounts are the Vote 37 Appropriation Account and the Social Insurance Fund Financial Statements, both accounts are subject to audit by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. </p><p>My Department does not carry out an actuarial analysis or a formal risk assessment in respect of contingent liabilities.

This provides them with access to the following benefits: State pension (contributory) and widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (contributory), guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory), maternity benefit, adoptive benefit, paternity benefit, treatment benefit (from March 2017) and invalidity pension, which was extended to the self-employed from December 2017.</p><p>This compares favourably with employees who, in general, are liable to the Class A rate of 4%.  In addition their employers are liable to PRSI at the rate of 8.6% on weekly earnings up to and including &euro;376 or at the rate of 10.85% where weekly earnings exceed &euro;376.  Accordingly the combined rate of PRSI rate paid in respect of Class A employees is 12.6% or 14.85%, depending on the level of weekly earnings. These Class A employees are entitled to the full range of social insurance benefits.</p><p>The issue of extending additional social insurance benefits to the self-employed paying Class S PRSI was considered in the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance fund (SIF) as at 31 December, 2015, which was published on 18 October 2017.  </p><p>The review found that the combined cost of introducing the invalidity, illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits for Class S contributions is estimated to be &euro;118 million in 2018, rising steadily to &euro;223 million in 2020.  By 2025 the projected cost is &euro;413 million and, over the period of the review the cost would rise to &euro;1.3 billion in 2071.  These costs assume that the cost of extending invalidity pension to the self-employed builds up steeply for the first 10 years after introduction after which time the scheme is almost at maturity or a steady state. </p><p>For the shorter term schemes, illness and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefits, it is estimated that they will reach maturity after 2 years.  Projected expenditure on jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit assumes the same incidence rate as prevail in the employed (PRSI Class A) population.  While the review assumed that entitlement to the extended schemes would commence in January 2018, a commencement date of January 2019 would have similar results. Detailed costings of the extension of invalidity pension (entitlement was extended in December 2017) and illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits are contained in the following table.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Invalidity Pension</th><th>Illness Benefit</th><th>Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit</th><th>Carer&rsquo;s Benefit</th><th>Total<br /><br />&euro; million</th></tr><tr><td>2019</td><td>30</td><td>40</td><td>45</td><td>2</td><td>118</td></tr><tr><td>2020</td><td>59</td><td>54</td><td>58</td><td>3</td><td>173</td></tr><tr><td>2021</td><td>87</td><td>72</td><td>60</td><td>4</td><td>223</td></tr><tr><td>2022</td><td>125</td><td>88</td><td>63</td><td>5</td><td>281</td></tr><tr><td>2023</td><td>152</td><td>94</td><td>67</td><td>5</td><td>317</td></tr></table></p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

Neither I nor the Pensions Authority has the power under legislation to intervene to compel an employer to continue to make contributions to a scheme. Even where a scheme is closed to new members or to future accrual of benefits, the sponsoring employer role continues in relation to that scheme.</p>  <p>  Almost all Irish defined benefit schemes have a rule that allows the employer to cease contributions, usually after a notice period.  Currently there is no legislative obligation on the employer to make contributions and no further liability on the employer where contributions cease. Neither is there an obligation on the employer to give notice to members or to consult in advance of ceasing contributions.</p>  <p>  However, in the case where a restructuring of benefits is proposed, the employer and the trustees of a pension scheme are required to notify scheme members, beneficiaries and the authorised trade unions.  Furthermore, changes made to the Occupational Pension Schemes (Section 50 and 50B) Regulations in 2015 require trustees to also notify groups representing the interests of pensioners and deferred scheme members in a scheme in such a situation.</p>  <p>  The Roadmap for Pensions Reform, which was published recently, details specific measures that will modernise our pension system. It sets out under Strand 4, &lsquo;Measures to Support the Operation of Defined Benefit Schemes&rsquo;, that the Government is committed to advancing the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017.  The purpose of this Bill is to respond to the ongoing difficulties in DB schemes and to increase protections for members as well as encouraging employers to ensure that schemes are well funded and managed.</p>  <p>  The general scheme of the Bill, which was published in May 2017, contained a number of key measures relating to DB pension schemes.  These proposed provisions will ensure that an employer cannot &ldquo;walk away&rdquo; at short notice from the pension scheme it is supporting by providing a 12 month notification period where an employer is seeking to cease making contributions to a scheme.  The amendments seek a middle road between the current position where employers can abandon DB schemes and full and immediate debt on employer provisions.  The measures will act to support existing provisions in the Pensions Act and will provide for further protection for scheme members&rsquo; benefits and enhance employer responsibilities for their schemes.</p>  <p>  The amendments also provide for more frequent monitoring of the financial position of schemes and will further provide that, where a scheme is in deficit and a funding proposal has not been put in place in a timely manner, the Pensions Authority may direct steps to be taken to ensure that the scheme meets the funding standard.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that if this new legislation is enacted, a scheme will have to give a minimum notice period of twelve months before contributions can be stopped.  However, it will not prevent a company from ceasing contributions once the minimum notice period is served provided the scheme meets the Minimum Funding Standard. </p>  <p>  These provisions are quite technical and complex.  Work to finalise them is at an advanced stage and I hope to be in position to bring forward the amendments at Committee Stage at the end of May or early June.  With the cooperation of the Oireachtas, the Government intends to pass this legislation before the summer recess.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In this context, I understand that this question relates primarily to policies related to employment progression for people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  In line with commitments under the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for people with disabilities and Pathways to Work 2016-2020, my Department has progressively expanded mainstream activation services to cater for people with disabilities. The Intreo service, the Departments integrated employment support service, is central to this process.</p>  <p>  People with a disability may, on a voluntary basis, seek an appointment with an employment supports case officer to discuss their employment ambitions and develop a personal progression plan. Staff in Intreo offices have undertaken training to better support persons with disabilities who want to pursue further education, training or work opportunities. While the Intreo service acts as the primary gateway to employment supports, it may also refer those with more complex needs to other bodies for specialist training or employment supports.</p>  <p>  For example, with a disability who are job ready and need a level of support to succeed in long-term and sustainable employment can avail of the EmployAbility Service (a nationwide service, funded by and delivered on behalf of the department). The service provides a range of career advice and employment supports to employers and people with a disability, through Job Coaches. Additionally, a new programme &lsquo;Ability&rsquo; will commence in Q2 2018.  This programme aims to bring young people (aged 15-29) with disabilities, who are not yet job-ready, closer to the labour market through a range of person-centred supports.  The programme will be delivered by a range of local providers who specialise in providing supports for people with a disability.</p>  <p>  The Make Work Pay Report, published in April 2017, contains a number of recommendations covering a range of Government departments.  While the Government has decided to implement some of the recommendations, others require further consultation with disability service providers and stakeholders. These include developing and extending interdepartmental and interagency protocols to ensure that the recommendations are reviewed on a regular basis. A number of the report&rsquo;s recommendations, relating to my Department, have already been implemented, namely:</p>  <p>  - People with a long-term disability who take up employment will retain their Free Travel Pass for a period of five years</p>  <p>  - A fast-track return to Disability Allowance in situations where the employment does not work out.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, a number of other recommendations are the subject of on-going work, including:</p>  <p>  - The development of a &ldquo;Ready Reckoner&rdquo; to calculate the net benefit of a return to work for people on a disability type payment.</p>  <p>  - Amending legislation to dispense of the requirement that work must be of a rehabilitative nature</p>  <p>  My Department engages regularly with employers to highlight the benefits of employing people with disabilities. It also provides a range of work related supports for employers who recruit and employ people with disabilities, including:</p>  <p>  - The Wage Subsidy Scheme (WSS) that has been designed to increase the likelihood of people with disabilities participating in the open labour market by providing financial incentives to private sector employers;</p>  <p>  - The Reasonable Accommodation Fund assists employers to take appropriate measures to enable a person with a disability or impairment to access employment. Available grants and supports include; the Workplace Equipment Adaptation Grant, the Personal Reader Grant, the Job Interview Interpreter Grant and an Employee Retention Grant.</p>  <p>- The Employer Information Pack, available on the Department&rsquo;s website (www.welfare.ie), which contains information on services and supports available to people with disabilities and employers.</p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to removing barriers to employment for people with disabilities by focusing on ability rather than disability and enhancing potential through education, training and employment.</p></reply>

The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme. To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p>  <p>  The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the scheme is determined by the relevant local authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the 2014 Act. In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, local authorities include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income. </p>  <p>  In determining reckonable income, the income of all tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants, is included, as is the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner/co-habitant of a tenant who lives in the house with them, thus ensuring the appropriate level of discount is applied to the purchase price.</p>  <p>  The minimum income criterion was introduced in order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme.  Applicants must demonstrate that they have an income that is long-term and sustainable in nature. This ensures that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.</p>  <p>  The financing of any house sold under the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme is a separate matter from the eligibility criteria for the scheme.  If the tenant is deemed eligible under the scheme, he or she may fund the purchase of a house from one, or a combination, of his/her own resources or a mortgage provided by a financial institution or a local authority house purchase loan.</p>  <p>  In line with the commitment given in Rebuilding Ireland, a review of the first 12 months of the Tenant Purchase Scheme&rsquo;s operation has been undertaken. The review has incorporated analysis of comprehensive data received from local authorities regarding the operation of the scheme during 2016 and a wide-ranging public consultation process which took place in 2017 and saw submissions received from individuals, elected representatives and organisations.</p>  <p>  The review is now complete and a full report has been prepared setting out findings and recommendations. In finalising the report some further consultation was necessary and due consideration had to be given to possible implementation arrangements. </p>  <p>  These matters are now almost completed and I expect to be in a position to publish the outcome of the review shortly.</p></reply>

All three sites under the HLI are identified as Strategic Development and Regeneration Areas (SDRA) within the Dublin City Development Plan 2016-2022.</p>  <p>  Mixed-tenure developments are an important policy objective in Rebuilding Ireland and uphold the principle of sustainable mixed communities, where housing needs are not subject to rigid segregation, based on income levels. They also provide an opportunity to see major sites developed more quickly, and integrated into existing communities and areas. </p>  <p>  Oscar Traynor Road is a 17 hectare greenfield site with the potential to yield 640 mixed-tenure homes and the elected members of the City Council have determined that the homes will be provided on the basis of a 30% social, 20% affordable, and 50% private tenure-mix. This mix will help to ensure that the full value of the site will be realised.</p>  <p>  The land is being brought to market on a competitive tendering basis, with a view to leveraging its value to deliver the optimal number of units. The Council is seeking to identify the best qualified economic operator to work in collaboration with the Council to identify the optimal solution for the site, in accordance with the City Development Plan 2016 - 2022; the Oscar Traynor Road Feasibility Study, which has been approved by the elected members; and any other Council requirements; and to deliver it as efficiently as possible. </p>  <p>  The Feasibility Study indicates that the full value of the land will be retrieved from the proposed new development. In terms of the publicly funded elements, as with all such construction projects, the development of this site must comply with the Government&rsquo;s Capital Works Management Framework and procurement rules, to ensure greater cost certainty, best value for money and financial accountability. </p>  <p>  This is a priority project for the City Council and it is progressing through procurement with the Prior Information Notice (PIN) published in June 2017 and the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ) issued on 9 February 2018. My Department and I remain committed to working with Dublin City Council to ensure that the necessary resources are in place to deliver the mixed-tenure homes planned on what is a key site for the sustainable development of Dublin City.</p></reply>

Funding awarded under LIHAF is done on a matched funding basis, where a grant is given for 75% of the costs of the infrastructure and the local authority match funds that grant for the remaining 25%.</p>  <p>  In October 2016, Kildare County Council submitted a proposal for funding for enabling infrastructure in Naas. Following a detailed assessment period, a grant agreement was signed in October 2017 and I approved &euro;6m funding for the project consisting of &euro;4.5 million in Exchequer funding and &euro;1.5 million in matched funding from the Local Authority.</p>  <p>  The grant agreement specifies the value of the grant to be awarded for the funding of public infrastructure, that it must be spent on a relief road to enable housing delivery, and that there is an associated housing activation target that must be met by the end of 2021. </p>  <p>  The exact route of the proposed road is a matter for Kildare County Council and the Part 8 process to determine. As such processes are the reserved function of local authorities, this is not a matter in which I have a role.</p>  <p>  However, I note that should a particular route prove more costly than initially estimated, it is not possible to increase the grant that has been awarded, and any extra cost would need to be met by the Council. Similarly, the timelines set for the completion of the infrastructure and for housing activation must continue to be capable of being met. It is a key requirement under LIHAF that this infrastructure must activate housing supply by 2021 at the latest.</p></reply>

No. 17 of 2017) which is a requirement of all properties being provided to social housing tenants.</p>  <p>  The condition of the property and the cost of repairs to bring the property up to statutory standards is a factor that may impact on the viability of an AHB purchasing a property.  As the households applying for MTR will have been in a position of acute financial hardship, possibly for a number of years, prior to applying for the scheme, they may not have had the means to carry out the necessary repairs on the property.  Accordingly, the scheme has to provide a mechanism by which repairs to the property can be funded to bring the property up to the private rental standards and this is done by deducting the costs of repairs from the market value of the property.</p>  <p>  I can neither compel an AHB to purchase a particular property nor a lender to sell a particular property.  The Housing Agency who administers the scheme on behalf of my Department works closely with AHBs and lenders at all stages of the MTR process and seeks to ensure that MTR cases are dealt with in a fair and efficient manner.</p></reply>

The next Monthly Housing Activity Report will be published shortly.</p><p>As regards the outlook for the coming years, the Central Bank in its Quarterly Bulletin (Q2 2018), which is available at the following weblink, <i></i>,  forecasts that both housing and non-residential building should continue to recover strongly. The Bank has forecast growth for the construction sector as a whole of 14.8% and 11.7% for 2018 and 2019 respectively.</p><p>While it is not possible to directly match the commencement information to social housing provision, as social housing may be delivered in a number of ways, it is expected that over 4,400 new build social homes will be delivered by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) either directly, through turnkey arrangements or under Part V arrangements, the latter reflecting the growth in private sector housing activity.</p><p>Looking overall at social housing delivery in 2018, it is expected that more than 25,000 additional households will have their housing need met, including just under 8,000 units to be built, acquired or leased by local authorities and AHBs, and in excess of 17,000 additional flexible housing solutions through the Housing Assistance Payment Scheme and the Rental Accommodation Scheme. </p><p>This will have a direct impact on social housing waiting lists. The 85,799 households assessed as being qualified for social housing support nationally in 2017 saw a decrease of 6.3% on the comparable figure for 2016.  The resources provided through Rebuilding Ireland are allowing us to respond in a significant manner.  Over &euro;1.4 billion was provided for investment in housing in 2017 and this is being increased significantly to &euro;1.9 billion this year. This investment will yield substantial delivery activity and ensure that we make further significant progress towards meeting the overall target of delivering 137,000 social housing tenancies in the period to 2021, supported by an overall Exchequer commitment of over &euro;6 billion. </p><p>One of the key outcomes of the second Housing Summit with local authority Chief Executives held earlier this year was a commitment to drive greater transparency and accountability at individual local authority level on the delivery of the targets under Rebuilding Ireland. On foot of a detailed process of engagement since then between my Department and individual local authorities, I have now advised local authorities of the social housing targets for 2018 and also for the multi-annual period to 2021. In setting local authority targets for 2018, I have been explicitly clear with local authorities that these are minimum targets, and that where additional capacity to deliver arises, we will work in partnership with local authorities to drive that accelerated delivery.  The targets for each local authority have been published and are available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link: .</p><p>In direct response to the housing challenge and in order to support housing authorities deliver on their responsibilities and obligations, a number of dedicated structures have been put in place to support Approved Housing Bodies and local authorities to maximise their delivery potential and to harness the best that is available in their functional areas.</p><p>New rapid delivery construction is a vital part of the overall social housing delivery programme and 208 new homes have already been delivered through this scheme.  An additional 24 rapid projects, involving over 650 new homes, are now being advanced, 283 of which are scheduled for delivery in 2018.  New social housing construction schemes are being added to the pipeline on a continuous basis, both through the local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies. </p><p>Of particular note has been the establishment of a framework of rapid build contractors by the Office of Government Procurement, which means that local authorities across the country can now run quicker procurement competitions and advance rapid build projects to site more effectively and efficiently. While the rapid build housing programme is being implemented to expedite social housing supply, it should be noted that these homes are being built to the highest construction standards. </p><p>All stakeholders are acutely aware of the challenge around homelessness and are highly focussed on delivering long-term sustainable solutions for those individuals and families experiencing homelessness. For families on the waiting lists who are experiencing homelessness, we will continue to work on further solutions to give them the support they need. During 2017, over 4,700 adults that were homeless, or at risk of homelessness, entered into independent sustainable tenancies.</p><p>The actions, targets and resources available under Rebuilding Ireland provide a strong platform for meeting our challenges in the housing sector. I am satisfied that delivery of the Plan remains firmly on track and I and my Department will continue to work with all delivery partners to ensure that targets continue to be met.</p></reply>

A wide range of delivery mechanisms and a funding commitment of &euro;6 billion over the lifetime of Rebuilding Ireland have been put in place to support the achievement of these targets.</p></reply>

The NPF is a national plan, with a high-level ambition of creating a single vision, a shared set of goals for every community across the country, and to deliver on these in a way that makes sense for our communities, rural and urban alike.</p>  <p>  The Framework recognises the need for sustainable and coordinated development of our towns, villages and rural communities. The policy objectives under the NPF will be progressed further at the regional level through the Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSESs) which will link strategic national planning and investment with regional-scale physical planning and the local economic and community development functions of local authorities.  Preparation of the RSESs by the three Regional Assemblies is underway, with completion envisaged by end 2018. The RSESs will subsequently be further elaborated upon at local authority city and county development plan levels.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Deputy will be aware that the Action Plan for Rural Development, published in January 2017, takes a whole-of-Government approach, led by my colleague, the Minister for Rural and Community Development, to the economic and social development of rural Ireland and will act as an overarching structure for the co-ordination and implementation of rural initiatives across Government Departments and other public bodies.</p>  <p>  A high proportion of overall national house-building taking place in rural areas points to the degree to which indigenous communities in rural areas are being facilitated in meeting their housing needs locally, with a degree of overspill development from cities and towns as well.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department&rsquo;s 2005 Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Sustainable Rural Housing are designed to ensure that planning authorities strike a balance between managing the future of rural areas from a development perspective and at the same time enabling housing requirements of rural communities to be met. The Guidelines set out how planning authorities should frame their development plan policies for the different types of rural areas which may exist within the development plan area. These types of areas range from rural areas close to cities and towns at risk of overspill development and more remote areas with low levels of development pressure and consistent patterns of population decline. The Guidelines also set out policy advice on issues such as access to appropriate wastewater treatment facilities, potential impacts of the development on groundwater, landscape, natural and cultural heritage and addressing road safety issues (e.g. frontage onto national roads).</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that we have a sufficiently flexible and robust national policy framework to ensure that rural communities can meet their housing needs.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-05-08a.1299.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018050800088#WREE00800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 489 and 490 together.</p>  <p>  The Pyrite Resolution Act 2013 provides the statutory framework for the establishment of the Pyrite Resolution Board, and for the making of a pyrite remediation scheme to be implemented by the Board with support from the Housing Agency. The pyrite remediation scheme is a scheme of &ldquo;last resort&rdquo; and is limited in its application and scope.  The full conditions for eligibility under the scheme are set out in the scheme which is available on the Board&rsquo;s website, www.pyriteboard.ie.</p>  <p>   The Act also sets out the broad parameters which the Board must have regard to when establishing the eligibility criteria for the pyrite remediation scheme. </p>  <p>  The restriction in Section 15(3) of the Act preventing applications being made under the scheme by a person who purchases a dwelling on or after 12 December 2013 (the publication date of the Bill) applies where that person knew or ought to have known that the dwelling was constructed using hardcore containing reactive pyrite.</p>  <p>  Following a number of requests for clarification in the matter, my Department has recently sought legal advice on the Board&rsquo;s interpretation of Section 15(3) and I will be in a position to consider this matter further following the receipt of the legal advice. However, it is important to note that ultimately the interpretation of the law is a matter for the courts.</p>  <p>  My Department is in regular contact with the Board and the Housing Agency in relation to the implementation of the scheme and is satisfied with the arrangements that are currently in place.</p>  <p>  In regard to the pyrite remediation scheme, the scheme is applicable to dwellings which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave established, in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2013 - Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol.  In this regard, it is a condition of eligibility under the scheme that an application to the Board must be accompanied by a Building Condition Assessment with a Damage Condition Rating of 2.  Dwellings which do not have a Damage Condition Rating of 2 are not eligible to apply under the scheme.  This ensures that, having regard to the available resources, the focus of the scheme is on dwellings which are most severely damaged by pyritic heave.  I have no proposals to amend this eligibility criterion.</p>  <p>  The Report of the Pyrite Panel (June 2012) recommended a categorisation system as a means of prioritising pyrite remediation works in recognition of the expensive and intrusive nature of pyrite remediation and the unpredictability of pyritic heave. The independent Pyrite Panel was clear in its view that only dwellings with significant damage due to pyritic heave should be remediated and that it would be unreasonable to expect dwellings not exhibiting such damage to be remediated. </p>  <p>  Dwellings which have no significant damage but have reactive pyrite in the hardcore material should be monitored and only remediated if they display significant damage due to pyritic heave. This remains the position with regard to dwellings which do not display significant pyritic damage. </p>  <p>  On foot of this recommendation of the Pyrite Panel, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) published I.S. 398-1:2013 Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol in 2013.The standard provides the means by which dwellings that may be affected by pyrite can be tested and categorised. </p>  <p>  In late 2015, the NSAI commenced a review of I.S. 398-1:2013 in the light of practical experience since the standard was first introduced in January 2013. The standard was updated and revised to reflect the on-site experiences and evidence gathered by technical experts, such as engineers, geologists, professionals providing sampling and testing services and other technical experts, who have been using the standard over the past four years and was published on 4 August 2017.</p>  <p>  I welcome the revised standard published by the NSAI and in this context I signed the Pyrite Resolution (Standard for Testing) Regulations 2017 (S.I. No. 556 of 2017) on 6 December 2017. These Regulations provide that pursuant to section 14(9)(a) of the Pyrite Resolution Act 2013, the &ldquo;standard for testing&rdquo; for the purpose of the Act shall be Irish Standard 398-1:2017 Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material - Part 1: Testing and Categorisation Protocol, as published by the National Standards Authority of Ireland on 4 August 2017. </p>  <p>  Any amendments which the Pyrite Resolution Board consider are required to the scheme as a result of the revised standard will be given full consideration should they be submitted to me in accordance with the requirements of the Act.</p>  <p>  The latest figures available indicate that a total of 2,031 applications have been received under the scheme.  Of these, 1,594 dwellings have been included in the scheme and the applicants notified accordingly.</p>  <p>  A further 85 applications have been validated and referred to the Housing Agency for the Assessment and Verification Process, while another 225 applications are at the initial Application and Validation Process stage. 127 applications under the scheme were not successful.</p>  <p>  Of the 1,594 dwellings that have been included in the pyrite remediation scheme:</p>  <p>  - 284 are at remedial works planning stage, </p>  <p>  - 85 are at tender/tender analysis,</p>  <p>  - 208 are under remediation, and  </p>  <p>  - 1,017 are complete. </p>  <p>  A sum of &euro;30 million was announced under Budget 2018 to fund the operation of the pyrite remediation scheme this year. This allocation will facilitate the remediation of some 430 additional dwellings and is a clear signal of the continuing importance attached by Government to addressing the issue of significant pyritic damage in private dwellings.</p></reply>

A commitment to deliver 50,000 new social housing units through a range of delivery mechanisms has been supported by a multi-annual Exchequer commitment totalling &euro;6.5 billion over the period. These targets will be achieved using a combination of building, purchasing and leasing high quality properties to meet the needs of households on local authority waiting lists around the country.  </p>  <p>  10,000 of these units will be leased by local authorities and approved housing bodies (AHBs) under leasing arrangements from a range of different sources. 3,500 are targeted to be achieved using the Repair and Leasing Scheme (RLS) which harnesses the potential of existing vacant stock and brings it back into use for social housing. The remaining 6,500 properties to be leased are intended to be secured under long-term lease arrangements from a variety of sources which will include existing housing stock and newly built units.  </p>  <p>  Rental payments in respect of leases are either guaranteed to the owner by the local authority or by the AHB. In addition, where the property is leased from the owner by an AHB, and made available to the local authority for social housing, the payments are guaranteed to the AHB by the relevant local authority under a Payment and Availability (P&amp;A) Agreement. In both cases, the local authority is committed to contractual lease payments to the owner regardless of vacancy periods. </p>  <p>  In all cases, the relevant local authority makes payments to the property owner in accordance with the terms of the lease, or to the AHB in accordance with the  P&amp;A agreement, with the full costs being recouped to the local authority, in advance, from my Department on a quarterly basis. My Department has committed to these payments on an ongoing basis to allow local authorities and AHBs to enter long-term leases with private landlords.  </p>  <p>  Local authorities are statutory bodies under the Local Government Act 2001 and other enactments; all leases and P&amp;A agreements entered into by local authorities are either approved by my Department or entered into with delegated authority from my Department, and central Government supports local authorities in meeting their obligations. </p>  <p>  Funding for my Department's leasing programme, including the Enhanced Lease, is provided to local authorities via the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP). The State&rsquo;s expenditure is made up of Voted and Non-Voted Current and Capital expenditure. The SHCEP scheme is part of my Department&rsquo;s Voted Current expenditure.  An allocation of &euro;115 million, which includes &euro;83.4 million in respect of continuing contractual commitments, has been secured for SHCEP in 2018. This is an increase of &euro;31 million compared to 2017. It should be noted that the SHCEP scheme has been in place since 2009 and the State has never defaulted on current expenditure requirements by failing to make the necessary appropriation in any given year.  Existing liabilities will continue to have first call in the annual allocation of budgets.</p></reply>

It is required, under the Directive, to formally designate its special areas of conservation and a project is in place within my Department to oversee this process. This involves the adoption of a Statutory Instrument for each site. These are not new sites &ndash; most have been legally protected for 15 years or more. The making of Statutory Instruments is the final step in the designation of special areas of conservation and does not place any new or additional conditions on landowners/users than already applied from the time the sites were first identified for designation as special areas of conservation.<b></b></p><p>The landholding referred to in the Deputy's Question lies within the Killarney National Park/Magillycuddy's Reeks/Caragh River Catchment site, which was selected for designation as a special area of conservation in 1997.  </p></reply>

It should be noted that the National Symphony Orchestra has been located in the National Concert Hall since it opened in 1981 and it provides the backbone to the Hall's orchestral music programme. Therefore, there is no change in venue required for any organisational change.</p>  <p>  I have also recently announced a major &euro;78m plan to redevelop the National Concert Hall as part of the Government's capital investment plan for Culture, Language and Heritage.
