Most Members of parties - and those of no affiliation - are supporting a "Yes" vote, believing it is very important and in the interests of our children.  It is important that the turnout is high on Saturday and that there is a resounding "Yes" vote.</p><p>Will the Leader raise the issue of student support grants with the Minister for Education and Skills?  There are just under 50,000 grant applications for this education year and some 46,000 have not yet been processed.  Students do not know whether they will receive a student support grant.  I understand the Minister has set up a hotline but it is not intended for students who might be able to telephone to ask about the position of his or her application.  The hotline is for Oireachtas Members.  While all of us would welcome this facility and would wish to assist students in getting word on where their grant application stands, the Minister should not restrict this hotline to Members.  There should be a proper hotline which students can use to ask about their application.  This is the end of the second week in November and 46,000 students still have no word on their third level student support grants.</p><p>I need not remind Members that the Minister for Education and Skills signed, on 21 February 2011, a pledge with the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, and students in general, stating he would oppose and campaign against any new form of third level fees, including student loans, graduate taxes and any further increases in student contribution.  We knew that was a blatant lie at the time, and continues to be so given that this Government has stated it will increase the student registration fee to €3,000, having already increased it by €250 last year.  Not only is the student registration fee being increased but now students cannot access their grant applications.  It is very serious.  There is a minimum of 46,000 applications pending; there has already been a very high refusal rate and the Government has also abolished postgraduate student grants.  </p><p>Will the Leader schedule some time for discussing this matter?  It will not be fixed in the coming week, as is patently obvious by the numbers outstanding.  The Minister should attend the House and explain what is being done.  Let us not forget it was the Government which decided to remove the grant application process from the local authorities in order to streamline the process.  Obviously this streamlining has not worked.  We need to give some certainty to our students as to when their applications will be processed.  It appears to me that applications for 2012 will not even be looked at before the turn of the year.  Most of us do not see that as an acceptable situation.  Will the Leader ask the Minister to come to the House in the coming weeks and outline how his Department envisages working through this self-created backlog of 46,000 outstanding applications?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-11-08a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1148" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012110800003#B00200"><p>We are only two days from the children's rights referendum and I reiterate how important it is to see a high turnout on Saturday and strong support for the "Yes" side.  Many of us have spent a lot of time canvassing.  I was canvassing outside schools only this morning.  There is strong support for the "Yes" side, recognition that the referendum wording is carefully balanced and that it is very important to place protection of children's rights into the Constitution.  However, given how much support there is, it is important not to descend into complacency and that we continue to urge people to come out and vote.  It is also important to have a high turnout because this is the first time a Saturday vote has been tried for a very long time.  This is something we have been seeking for many years in order to enable more people to vote, allowing students in particular and others living away from home to return and vote where they are registered.  It is really important to have that high turnout and I welcome the high levels of canvassing for a "Yes" vote by colleagues from all parties.</p><p>I, too, would like a debate on education issues.  The Minister for Education and Skills was very clear on radio that the streamlining of student grant application process through SUSI should lead to great improvements in the system.  There used to be enormous delays in the old system run by the councils.  The Minister pointed out that although it is regrettable that many people are still waiting for their applications to be processed nonetheless there is an improvement on the old system where considerable delays were built in.  </p><p>There was encouraging news this morning that all colleagues should welcome, indicating that increasing numbers of young people are staying on in secondary schools to leaving certificate level.  The increase is important and very significant.  The number of students staying in school to complete second level is at the highest ever rate, at more than 90%.  The percentage of those who sit the leaving certificate is at 90.2%, and in DEIS schools there has been a greatly increased retention rate, from 68% in 2001 to more than 80% in 2006.  It is very welcome news and we should be cognisant of that when we have a debate on education.</p><p>Many colleagues in the House spoke yesterday on the topic of family planning clinics, with some looking for an inquiry.  Allegations concerning certain family planning clinics were published in one newspaper and there is an ongoing investigation into those.  Clearly, if any practice was engaged in that was against the law or damaging to women's health, that is a very serious matter.  However, there is a broader context.  Clinics operating entirely outside the law, meaning those that do not offer non-directive counselling and are therefore not regulated under the Regulation of Information Act, have in the past been the subject of both allegations in newspapers and of High Court proceedings.  These last concerned practices that sought to use very forceful tactics to bully women into taking certain courses of action, in one case to enter into an illegal adoption.  In this country we have had a history of failing to recognise our responsibility, as legislators, to women in crisis pregnancy.  I am very hopeful that when the ABC group reports we will finally face up to our responsibilities, at very least to those women who face a life-threatening condition as a result of their pregnancy, and to women whose pregnancies show fatal foetal abnormalities.  Currently these women are not treated with any compassion.</p></speech>

If SUSI is an example of what centralisation will mean in this country we have a problem because it simply does not work.  Some 12% or 15% of grant applications have been dealt with.  Those people who apply for grants are under financial pressure.  Some 88% of students who have started first year in college, which can be a traumatic time in its own right, have applied through SUSI.  The difficult and challenging experience they are having in college as they try to adjust to a new life is being compounded by what is, at this stage, a complete fiasco.  Will the Leader ask the education committee to summon the chief executives of SUSI and Dublin VEC to attend, as a matter of absolute urgency, in order to find out what in hell is going on?</p><p>I refer to our discussion yesterday regarding banks.  I was very troubled recently to discover that banks have taken a step backwards in dealing with families where couples are facing separation.  There was a time, believe it or not, when banks did the right thing when it came to assisting couples to come up with a reasonable settlement.  They facilitated moving a mortgage into a sole name in order to expedite a separation agreement.  Now, however, they are not playing ball and families who are going through a difficult and challenging time as a result of marital splits and separations, and where children are involved, now find their situation is totally compounded by the incompetence of banks.  </p><p>I reiterate my call for a banking inquiry.  This is the only way we can unravel the absolute scandal in the banking sector in recent years and, one hopes, come up with proper procedures and protocols to ensure that the like of what happened will never occur again.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-11-08a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1136" speakername="David Norris" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012110800004#C00100"><p>I join colleagues in remarking on the fact that this is the first day of voting in respect of the children's rights referendum.  People who live on the islands off our coast are voting at present.  It is appropriate that both sides of the argument should be presented and I hope that, regardless of the way in which citizens vote, there will be a very high turnout.  All those agencies that have been involved in the protection of children and their welfare - Barnardos, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Roman Catholic bishops - have all adopted a very positive stance towards the referendum.  I am of the view that the virtually unanimous support for the constitutional amendment among all parties in both Houses of the Oireachtas should be noted by the people.</p><p>I was absolutely horrified by last Monday night's edition of &quot;The Frontline&quot; on RTE.  During the programme, a person representing the &quot;No&quot; side made three claims that are utterly false.  The first of these is that the doors of the homes of loving and caring families will be battered down by what he described as the &quot;austerity police&quot; and the unfortunate children found therein would be carted off to a revived Letterfrack.  That is simply and grossly untrue.  Not only that, it is an attempt to create hysteria and to terrify and confuse people.  There is a need for a full turnout on Saturday.  We cannot be complacent and presume that the referendum will be passed.  The second claim made by the individual to whom I refer was even worse.  He suggested that foster parents are in it for the money, which is a disgraceful slur on decent, good citizens who take responsibility for children who would otherwise not have access to either proper parental influence or a home.  I demand that the person in question withdraw the charge that these people are only taking on foster children in order to obtain €325 per week in respect of them.</p><p>The third claim made by this individual is one which really hits me in the heart.  He cited the Roscommon incest case as a classic reason for voting against the proposed constitutional amendment.  That case is the best possible argument for voting in favour of the amendment.  The children in the Roscommon case were routinely sexually abused by both parents - which was highly unusual - and they were also starved, beaten and physically abused.  Their welfare was threatened by the fact that - to put it in the most charitable terms - a misguided group of extreme fundamentalists incited and funded the parents involved to harass the agencies of the State by means of court action in order to prevent the children from exercising their rights.  Those children suffered years of additional horror, hell and misery because there was nothing in the Constitution to protect them.  If people believe in the rights and welfare of children and if they are of the view that the State should intervene and not just leave children dangling in circumstances where parents act in the unspeakable way to which I refer, then they should come out and vote in favour of the constitutional amendment.</p></speech>

His reply was accurate in so far as he replied to the question that was put to him, namely, that one cannot single out a particular small section of society.  We are not saying that.  We are of the view what we are suggesting should apply to everyone.  What would be wrong with placing a cap of, for example, €65,000 - the amount which Senators are currently paid - on publicly provided pensions?  Would such a cap be unfair?  If the cap fits, one should wear it.  This country cannot afford the excessive and inordinately generous pensions that are being paid out of the public purse.  The public will not stand for that, nor will it stand for the Government unless it takes steps to deal with this matter.</p><p>I was brought up to believe - as I am sure were many other Members - that if one minds the pennies, the pounds will take care of themselves.  In that context, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance has decided that the Government Publications Sales Office on Molesworth Street will close on 23 November next.  The saving that will result from this action will be €300,000.  I suppose this is part of the rationalisation which must take place.  I request that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, come to the House prior to the budget in order that we might have an input and suggest where savings could be made.  Senators could make a valid contribution in this regard.  There is one suggestion I would like to put forward.  I call on all Senators and Deputies to desist this year from the thoughtless and vulgar practice of posting out 250,000 Christmas cards at taxpayers' expense.  What is the point of sending out such cards?  In the current climate, it is thoughtless in the extreme to send someone a Christmas card for which he or she is actually paying in the first instance.  If Members want to recognise and mark the goodwill of the festive season, I strongly suggest that they purchase charity Christmas cards from the Jack and Jill Children's Foundation, the Irish Cancer Society or the Irish Hospice Foundation.  In view of the times in which we are living, it is wrong to squander taxpayers' money by sending them Christmas cards for which they are paying in any event.  That is absurd.</p></speech>

I wish to support Senators Darragh O'Brien, Bacik and Norris who was particularly passionate in his contribution in their comments on next Saturday's referendum.  An all-party committee appointed by the previous Government brought forward the first wording in respect of this matter which was agreed by all of the parties.  That committee was chaired by Mary O'Rourke, who did an excellent job.  The previous Government brought forward a particular wording and the current Administration has put forward its own wording.  I commend the latter on putting this issue to the people in a referendum in such austere times.  This matter is being dealt with approximately 40 to 50 years too late.  During that period, young people have been deprived of the right to have responsible parents and to be adopted in the appropriate circumstances.  The necessary safeguards are in place.  I commend all those who are supporting the constitutional amendment.</p><p>The comments and statements made on Monday's edition of &quot;The Frontline&quot; were bizarre and completely outrageous.  I concur with Senator Norris in that regard.  I resent continued references to the &quot;Roscommon case&quot;.

Sligo is next and then Waterford, county and city.  Retention rates in Border counties, including that in which I live, Louth, are generally lower than the national average but I am pleased by the fact that the report shows them to be increasing all the time.</p> <p>As Senator Bacik said, we must look at the good aspects of education when debating it.  It is traumatic for students to be waiting for their grants to be paid.  I know from experience that some of them will be able to survive until Christmas but it is tough on them if grants are delayed until after Christmas.  The new system must be given a chance.  However, I ask that SUSI pulls out all the stops in order to support students.</p></speech>

Financial scandals are revealed on a daily basis such as Anglo Irish Bank today and AIB and the people who so little impressed the finance committee last week.  Massive pensions are being paid to the people who, as Deputy Olivia Mitchell said on radio this morning, brought this country to ruin.  I refer to ghost estates, the activities of NAMA, Anglo Irish Bank, AIB, the bailout money lining the pockets of bankers, their solicitors and their accountants.  It is pulling the entire country down.  The budget is, no doubt, occupying the Ministers, Deputies Noonan, Howlin and Hayes, but I hope that once the budget is dealt with that they will turn their attention to banking because it must be reformed and it needs a different kind of regulation.  There is a significant lethargy and this is noticeable when trying to elicit a response when we proposed here that the Danish system of financing house purchase might be considered.  Before it does any more damage, the financial sector needs to be debated and needs a shake-up.</p></speech>

It is a study of different countries which shows that Ireland has moved from No. 14 to tenth place as a country where it is easier to do business as defined under a series of indices.  This is welcome and it highlights the structural reforms implemented by the Government.  Senator Barrett has touched on a point I wished to make.  We could consider many of the issues he has suggested in any examination of structural reform in this country.  I refer to our level of regulation and the apparent shoddy standards we are happy to stand over and to which Senator Whelan referred in his contribution.  I acknowledge that the Leader has addressed in many ways our concerns expressed yesterday about bankers' pensions and the pensions of other top earners.  However, with respect, the Leader may have missed my point.  I may not have made it clearly and I apologise to him if that is the case.  The perception that is allowed to arise by the Government not tackling this issue leads to the risk of people becoming quite alienated from the State.  This cannot be over-estimated and it demands our attention.</p><p>I was astounded at the response from the colleague across the floor to Senator Whelan's excellent suggestion that if people want to send Christmas cards they should pay for them.  The idea that 250,000 Christmas cards are sent out from here and paid for by the very people who are receiving them seems to me to absolutely absurd.  Perhaps if the reformed wing of Fianna Fáil would like to have a chat with the unreformed wing, we might be able to make some progress.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that the people are outraged because of the pensions being paid to retired bankers who were the architects of many of the problems this country is facing.  These people were responsible for very sharp practices in the banks which led to the collapse of the banking system and forced the Government - against its will - into a bank guarantee that we now know was a disaster for the people.  We are still picking up the pieces, yet these are the people who are walking away with Rolls-Royce pensions over and above what most average workers cannot even imagine ever getting.</p><p>It is not only bankers who are given these massive pensions because politicians also get such pensions.  Senator Whelan made a very important suggestion about capping pensions at €65,000.  He will remember that the Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, brought forward proposals to reform pensions for senior officeholders. Sinn Féin supported some of these proposals.  It was proposed that pensions would be calculated on career earnings rather than on final salary.  Sinn Féin proposed a number of amendments seeking to cap pensions at €65,000 and those amendments were rejected by Senator Whelan and everyone in this Chamber who voted against them.  We have to be consistent on these issues. </p></speech>

I understand why Senator Conway would argue for a banking inquiry but really what this country needs is for the Government to take control of banking policy.  We saw what happened with the Personal Insolvency Bill in that we are still giving the banks a veto.  We saw what happened with the recommendations in the Keane report, such as the mortgage to rent scheme and short selling.  The finance committee was told by senior bankers that only 230 out of 10,000 people in mortgage distress with Bank of Ireland availed of those schemes because some of the banks have not signed up to the mortgage to rent scheme.  We do not need inquiries into what is happening; we need the Government to take control of banking policy and to ensure that we, as legislators, rather than the banks, are driving and setting the agenda.</p></speech>

Like others, I was appalled when watching "The Frontline".  I raised this as a potential issue at the beginning of the campaign.  The McKenna judgment leaves us in a situation where a referendum debate was stifled because of the judgment and gave a voice to people and organisations who came out with all sorts of scare-mongering and ridiculous statements advocating a "No" vote.  I urge people to exercise their vote on Saturday.  I advocate a "Yes" vote but the main point is that people should vote in numbers in order that a good percentage of the population will fully endorse this measure which is so significant for children and Ireland.</p><p>The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, has indicated an intention to bring the enacted Charities Act into being in the near future.  It was delayed because of the cost attached to it and the fact that a charities regulatory authority was required.  I am pleased to note that the Minister has decided on a consultative process with all stakeholders, including charities, in advance of the enactment.  It will lead to best practice and allow the public to have trust and confidence in charities.</p></speech>

It is important that either the Minister for Justice and Equality or the Minister for Health should make a statement to the House about the investigation carried out.  Senator Bacik suggested that just one newspaper raised this matter and she also introduced extraneous matters.  This seems to be another attempt by the Senator because of her own views to deflect from the core issues of this important issue which needs to be raised continually in order to get to the bottom of it.  If is it happening in that particular area, how many other places is it happening where crisis pregnancies are being affected?</p> <p> In common with my colleague, Deputy Frank Feighan, I am sure Members will join me in acknowledging that at the weekend we are commemorating the 94th anniversary of the ending of the war to end all wars.  We have often spoken about acknowledging the Northern Unionist tradition.  We now have a shared tradition of the experience of the horrors of the First World War.  Over the decades, many families have silently grieved for those who died in this war.  In recent years, the Government and civic society in general have allowed them to come out into the sunlight and publicly acknowledge the contribution that was made by Irishmen who believed they were fighting for Irish freedom.  I think it is now accepted that the subsequent events of our history should not diminish the ultimate sacrifice they made in the belief that they acted in the interests of Ireland's future.  It is only right and proper that the House should acknowledge the commemorative activities taking place this weekend.  I am honoured to be a member of the newly formed North-South parliamentary tier.  It is incumbent on us as elected representatives to ensure that the sacrifices Irishmen made at that time continue to be acknowledged publicly.</p></speech>

The good news is the increase in the retention rate of students at second level.  The figures have improved and now only 10% of students do not complete the leaving certificate.  I was the rapporteur for the Oireachtas early school leaving study two years ago on the factors influencing students to leave school early.  At that time the percentage of students who left school without completing the leaving certificate programme was 16%.  It is of major significance that the data is showing a 6% improvement in the space of two years.  That is very welcome.</p><p>The news for the students who are waiting for their third level maintenance grants is not good.  It is not acceptable that they have not been paid.  As a member of the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection, I support Senator Conway's request that the chief executive of SUSI, the board with responsibility for awarding education grants, come before the committee.  We need as a matter of urgency to find a means of sorting out these delays, which are affecting students and their families.  This should be viewed against the exorbitant pensions paid to retired bankers who ruined the country.  That is not acceptable.  Such inequality sticks in the craw of ordinary people.</p><p>I remind Senator Bacik that the allegations made by a newspaper were not against illegal clinics but clinics of the Irish Family Planning Association.  The staff in some of these clinics may think they are helping pregnant mothers, but they were working outside their remit and outside the law.  Only an independent investigation is fit to determine what went on in these clinics.  Anything else is a whitewash.  We do not need that, given that the expert group will deliberate on this issue shortly.  Let us stand up and ensure that the standards we want apply in every case.  This is about life and the right to live.</p></speech>

I do not want to interfere with court decisions, but I think it is important to ask that Ministers refrain from making public comment on Seán Quinn or members of the Quinn family.  This is a delicate situation that involves not only the Quinn family but many thousands of ordinary workers.  I ask the Leader to convey the request that Ministers refrain from commenting on this matter and leave it to the courts.</p><p>I join colleagues in hoping that we will have a large turnout for the children's rights referendum on Saturday, 10 November.  I pay tribute to every Member of the Oireachtas who has canvassed for a &quot;Yes&quot; vote, and I compliment the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, on the major role she has played in the campaign.  I also commend the party spokespersons, particularly Deputy Robert Troy and Senator Terry Leyden.  I ask Members to do everything between now and Saturday to ensure there is a large turnout and that the referendum is passed by a significant number of votes.</p></speech>

This is a real opportunity to make a strong statement of our commitment to children and to righting the wrongs of the past.  I do not think the "No" side has put forward a coherent argument as to why people should vote other than "Yes" on Saturday.  I condemn some of the outrageous comments that were made on the "Frontline" programme on Monday night.  I had great respect for the journalist John Waters, but on Monday night he lost the plot and what he said did a grave disservice to foster families.  He should certainly withdraw his comments.  Foster families have given a valuable service to the State and to vulnerable children over the years.  Mr. Waters should consider what he said.</p><p>We will vote on Saturday, which is the first time we have had Saturday voting for a long time.  It will be an opportunity for students and those who work away from home to vote.  This is probably the most significant referendum we have held for many years.  I applaud the work of the all-party committee and compliment everybody for his or her contribution to the wording of the amendment.  The Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, is to be commended in particular for pulling all the threads together and for achieving a wording that was acceptable to all sides.  Saturday is a crucial day for our country.  It is important for the lives of future children and is an opportunity to show we have learned from the mistakes of the past and will never allow a recurrence of the awful things that happened.</p></speech>

I was glad that Members from different sides of the House made contributions.  I am disappointed by the view that this issue will be swept under the carpet in the hope that it will be forgotten.  The difficulty with that course of action is that it will be revisited as a precedent on some future occasion when another issue of malpractice arises in a different area of society.  I do not think that is good for the body politic or for democracy.  Where malpractice is underpinned by taxpayers' money it must be investigated.  That must be conducted in an open and accountable manner.  What is more difficult for us to accept is that lives may have been put at risk as a result of the advice that was being provided.  As I understand it - one newspaper seems to substantiate the claim - people were being told to tell a lie in particular cases.  That could be life-threatening when it comes to a doctor or some other medical adviser.  It behoves all in public life to be consistent in requesting an open, transparent and independent inquiry into the information that has been revealed.  If that information is not correct, so be it, but it does seem that many allegations can be substantiated.  I hope this issue will not be pushed aside with a view to not offending somebody else.  If we do that, we will be the victims subsequently when it is used as a precedent in some other case.</p></speech>

It is responsible to make such a call.  I have seen a number of e-mails and Twitter messages calling on people to vote "No" in order to settle scores with the Government on other issues.</p> <p>It is irresponsible of people to look for a "No" vote for reasons which are not in any way connected to the referendum.  I would ask people to act in a logical way by voting "Yes" because it is in children's best interests that we vote "Yes".</p><p>On an issue related to children, I wish to refer to an award of €11 million in a medical negligence case made in the High Court yesterday.  I have raised the issue of the making of phased payments in cases previously and the urgent need to introduce periodic payments in respect of the settlement of claims such as this one.  In this case €2 million was awarded in 2009 and the final determination was to be made at a later date.  There is no procedure in the courts for the making of periodic payments.  I have raised the Quirke report here previously and this issue seems to have been put on the long finger.  I ask the Leader to ensure this matter be brought to a head and dealt with in a logical way and that legislation to deal with it would introduce it at a very early date.  All such cases take seven to eight years before they come to conclusion.  There is uncertainty and people are left in limbo for a long period when it is the very time they need help and support.  I ask that legislation to deal with this matter be brought forward at any early date.  It is like the children's rights referendum in that we have been talking about it for a long number of years.  It is time to bring it to a head and deal with it at the earliest possible date.  I ask the Leader to bring the matter to the attention of the Minister for Justice and Equality and that legislation be brought forward as soon as possible.</p></speech>

He should make amends before people go to the polls.  In line with other colleagues, including Senator Norris, I call on him to do so before Saturday as it is a very important referendum.</p><p>In regard to family planning clinics, which was touched on again today, nobody should have anything to fear, as Senator Ó Murchú said, from the carrying out of a proper and fair investigation.

We all agree that this is one of the most important referendums that we have had.  I hope that the fact that it will be held on a Saturday will lead to large numbers coming out in support of it.  It is very important, as Members have stated.  Quite a number of Members have spoken on the issue this morning.</p><p>I agree with the comments of Senator Norris and others in regard to the &quot;Prime Time&quot; programme.  The suggestion that foster families take children for financial gain is ludicrous and outrageous.  It has caused huge damage, hurt and upset to many foster families the length and breadth of the country.  The gentleman in question should withdraw those outrageous comments which were certainly not correct, to put it mildly.  I urge people to come out and use their vote to protect children in the referendum on Saturday.</p><p>The question of family planning was mentioned by a number of Members again this morning.  As I stated yesterday, if there was malpractice involved - I understand that the Garda has been informed - I have complete and utter confidence in the Garda in upholding the laws of this country.  The Garda should not be hindered in any way in conducting its inquiries - I do not believe it will be - and I am sure that will be carried out.  It is the duty of the Garda to investigate any allegation.  If malpractice has taken place, I am sure appropriate action will be taken.  </p><p>Senators Darragh O'Brien, Conway, Healy Eames and others raised the issue of the streamlining of student support grants.  It is a serious problem, of that there is no question.  To have students waiting for their grants for an inordinate amount of time is not acceptable.  We know that all student grant applications are being processed by Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, instead of the 66 local authorities and VECs which were previously responsible for processing them.  SUSI has received in total just over 66,000 completed applications for student grants for this year which can be broken down into three categories.  Some 18,000 applications are now complete and have either been provisionally awarded or refused.  SUSI is awaiting documentation on 21,000 of the applications.  There are 21,000 applications on which further information is required and which were not filled in properly.  The remaining 27,000 applications are in hand in SUSI for processing.  I agree with Members that while it is an improvement on previous years it is still not good enough.  The whole system will have to be fine-tuned to address the needs of students and ensure they get their grants faster than they do now. This facility is only up and running this year.  Like the centralisation of medical cards and other areas where services have been centralised, it is obviously not working as had been intended, but I hope we will see significant improvement in that area in the coming weeks and months.</p><p>Quite a number of requests have been made for a debate on banking and the economy.  Since this time last year we have had eight debates on the economy, finance, budgets and mortgages.  In reply to Senator Whelan's call for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, to come to the House, as I mentioned on the Order of Business, the Minister, Deputy Howlin, will be in the House later today.  I hope all those who asked questions and want to ask questions on public expenditure and reform will be here to ask those pertinent questions of the Minister when he will be here this afternoon.  I hope we will have a full Chamber because at least 30 or 40 Members in recent weeks have requested the Minister to come to the House to address issues and this is the opportunity for the House to have them addressed.  I hope I will not see three, four or five Members here from 3.30 p.m. to 5.30 p.m.  Let us put up or shut up.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-11-08a.64" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1127" speakername="Denis O'Donovan" time="11:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012110800008#H00200"><p>On my own behalf and that of my fellow Senators, I welcome Professor Christopher Pissarides, economist and Nobel laureate, to the House.  This newly elected Seanad is determined to modernise its procedures and actively engage with civic society.  To begin this process we have changed Standing Orders to allow persons and representatives of public and civic life to address Seanad Éireann.  Today our guest, Professor Pissarides, will address Members on unemployment and public policy.  Professor Pissarides is the school professor of economics and political science at the London School of Economics.  He is an elected fellow of the British Academy and has published widely on macro-economics and the theory of labour markets.  In 2005, he became the first European economist to win the IZA Prize in Labour Economics and in 2010 he won the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his analysis of markets with search frictions, in particular, the economics of unemployment, especially job flows and the effects of being out of work.  He specialises in the economics of unemployment, labour market theory, labour market policy and more recently he has written about growth and structural change.  His book, <i>Equilibrium Unemployment Theory</i>, now in its second edition, is a standard reference in the economics of unemployment.</p><p>  All Members will agree a key issue for us is how we will tackle the scourge of unemployment, how we will create jobs, from where they will come and how we produce the right conditions for job creation.  These are areas that Professor Pissarides has covered and on which he has written extensively.  Accordingly, it is an opportune time for Professor Pissarides to address Seanad Éireann on unemployment and public policy.</p> <p>Economics has an important role to play in informing Government policy in a wide variety of areas not only in employment but also education, the environment, infrastructure, health and agriculture.  Nevertheless, Professor Pissarides, I imagine you are perfectly aware and do not need reminding that politicians and economists can make strange bedfellows.  We do not always see eye-to-eye or find ourselves in agreement, and politicians may not always wish to hear what economists say to us.  I am reminded of the words of the American writer and economist Thomas Sowell, who said:<ul><br />The first lesson of economics is scarcity: there is never enough of anything to satisfy all those who want it.  The first lesson of politics is to disregard the first lesson of economics.</ul>Given your distinguished record and achievements I sincerely hope that your words to the House today will not be disregarded and we look forward to a thought provoking and enlightening exchange.  It is a great honour and privilege to invite you to address Seanad Éireann.  You are now entitled to address the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-11-08a.66" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Christopher Pissarides" time="11:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012110800009#J00200"><p>I am pleased to be here and to have this opportunity to talk to the House about youth unemployment.  I have chosen the topic of youth unemployment because of the severity of the problem, especially in the current recession.  It is also a topic close to my work of the past 30 or 40 years.  Unfortunately young workers are affected most in any recession and the current recession is no exception.  By its nature, youth unemployment is usually approximately two and a half times higher than adult unemployment.  Effectively this means if adult unemployment goes up from 5% to 10% in a recession, then youth unemployment goes up from 12% to a staggering 24%.  That is a serious problem.  In countries such as Greece and Spain half of young workers are unemployed.  Ireland, Portugal and the Slovak Republic come next with approximately one third of young workers out of work.  Something must be done about this situation to avoid a lost generation with negative implications for economic growth and employment for many years to come.</p><p>Young workers are at an age when they are uncertain of their skills and future prospects in the labour market.  They need to experiment to discover their true potential.  They should be able to take jobs, try them out and leave them if they find they cannot make best use of their talents.  The best labour markets, therefore, are those which enable young workers to try different jobs and settle down to those they can do best.  A good match with the employer and job needs is essential if the young worker is to find job satisfaction and lead a happy professional and social life.  Usually the two go together and reinforce each other.</p><p>In this scenario some unemployment is inevitable as young workers change jobs and look for what they are best at.  However, were one to ask a young worker about his or her worst fear in the labour market, he or she would say the fear of job loss and unemployment.  How can we reconcile the views of the economist, who maintains that no modern labour market can operate without some unemployment, with those of the worker, who says that unemployment is his or her worst fear?  How can we reduce the costs and fear of unemployment in a modern society?</p><p>Young workers fear unemployment when they have no other choice in the labour market, when they apply for jobs but get rejection after rejection and when they sit out for a long stretch of time without any prospect of finding a job.  Long duration unemployment, sometimes exceeding one year or more, is terrible for the young person.  The poverty that unemployment causes is also terrible.  These are features of a recession.  In good times, workers take advantage of the natural protection that a well functioning labour market provides when a series of job offers is forthcoming.  In bad times this protection is lost, jobs are not forthcoming and long-term unemployment is a real fear.  This is when governments must step in and offset the poor outcomes of the market not necessarily with providing a job outlet for the worker, but by providing alternatives to idle unemployment and no hope of a job in the foreseeable future.  In recessions markets fail to protect their participants, be it workers or employers.  Governments should take action in their place.  In recessions such as the one we are experiencing now we are faced with market failure not personal failure.  Getting on one's bike will not lead one anywhere.  Policy should be carefully directed to those who have been unemployed for a long time to avoid the problems of long-term unemployment.</p><p>Long-term unemployment disenfranchises young people and de-skills them.  They lose their will to seek new job opportunities and the ability to perform even if they are offered a job.  The implications of long-term unemployment are felt for many years to come.  Those who have suffered it have slower career progressions, lower wages and a higher risk of unemployment in adult life.  It is as bad as a criminal record which these people carry with them in whatever else they try to do.  We know from studies of life satisfaction that long-term unemployment is among the greatest negative events in one's life, alongside death in the family and family break-up.  It is important for governments to contain unemployment but not to be over-protective to the extent that young people are not given the initiative to experiment and learn.  Governments need to create the environment in which the young unemployed can help themselves more.  This might necessitate measures to encourage more job creation targeted towards the young unemployed or more training.</p><p>I will go through some of the most important means available to the government to help the young in a recession.  The first important tool in the hand of the government is education and training beyond secondary school.  Better educated workers are more productive and run a lower risk of unemployment.  They are more adaptable to the needs of the market, a necessary attribute in light of the risks associated with the opening up of our economies and the rise of global competition.</p><p>The days when we could predict with certainty the needs of industry have long gone.  Today's European economy is a service economy that relies on digital technology.  We need to make our service economy more competitive and we need to export services to earn the necessary foreign exchange to buy manufacturing goods produced elsewhere.  No modern post-industrialist society can rely only on industry for the production of exports.  It must be competitive in services as well.  Education is necessary in this process.  It gives the necessary skills to young people to work with new technologies, unleash their entrepreneurial potential and compete in the global economy.  We hear many stories of new technology companies growing out of the ingenious discoveries of young people.  Some years ago Apple and Google did not exist but today they are household names.  The vast majority of these companies are American.  We need to develop entrepreneurship in Europe to compete with the Americans in new technology.  We are still good at discovering new things, but not as good at taking advantage of them and creating jobs for our young people.</p><p>In normal times governments subsidise higher education because of the benefits to the individual society.  The European Union estimates the return of higher education to be approximately 12%, a good investment when compared with the alternatives.  On average, countries in the European Union spend approximately 5% of gross national product on supporting education and training.  In times of economic recession the rate of return for education is even higher than 12% because the main cost of education is the withdrawal of a potentially productive worker from the labour market.  However, in recession this cost is lower because, by its nature, a recession reduces the value of the worker's output when employed and increases the chances that the worker will remain unemployed and unproductive otherwise.  The logical conclusion is that in a recession the government should spend more on education and subsidise more young people to pursue further education and training than in normal times.</p><p>This recommendation goes against the austerity measures that are compounding the current recession in Europe.  The austerity measures may be needed for the survival of the euro, but they are counterproductive for the domestic economy and unemployment.  A good deal more can be done for job creation and unemployment even within the current austerity climate.  Education spending is one such area.  Places could be expanded in established colleges and universities, even at the risk of lower entry criteria and some overcrowding.</p> <p>If we are to learn something from this devastating recession, it is that more support should be given to colleges that offer shorter and more practical training courses, because courses of this nature keep young workers occupied during the recession and leave them better qualified to take advantage of new job opportunities.  </p><p>How else can young people be helped in this recession?  The best help that anyone can be given in a recession is through job creation.  In this context, we have given too much weight to fiscal austerity and not enough to job creation.  Even the IMF is now acknowledging that it has underestimated the multiplier benefits of public investment projects.  Infrastructure projects have a significant potential for job creation.  Although they initially cost public money, they eventually pay for themselves through the jobs they create.  Austerity is currently measured by comparing revenues and expenditures in the same year.  This is not good practice for investment projects.  The very nature of investment is that spending usually takes place in the current year while the payoffs are in future years.  Investment projects such as infrastructure and educational spending should be excluded from the annual fiscal budget and funded from other sources.  If it is feared that governments will take advantage of exclusions to reclassify an overly high fraction of public expenditure as public investment, the European Investment Bank should be allowed to define investment spending and recurrent spending.  In countries that have no access to markets because of downgrades and prohibitively high interest rates, the European Commission should part-fund investment projects from the structural budget.  If necessary, it should use money from other budgets, even the European Financial Stability Facility, because investment financed in this manner can help countries to come out of recession faster and with less reliance on the EFSF.  If such investment projects took place, structural reforms would be easier to implement because there would be less resistance to them, and recovery and debt repayment would be faster.</p><p>Education and job creation incentives are the most effective measures for the young unemployed but governments can implement other measures to help them.  There are also certain measures that should not be implemented.  Governments can help the inexperienced young to learn about the labour market and how to look for work.  This training can take place in secondary schools, which need to update their curriculums regularly to meet the needs of modern labour markets.  Unfortunately this is not always the case, with employers often complaining that young workers do not receive enough general training at school to prepare them for the types of job that are available in modern labour markets.  Employers could be more directly involved in curriculum selection.  If this fails, a welfare-to-work programme could still take care of that kind of training.</p><p>Given that young workers need to try different jobs, a flexible labour market with a lot of job-changing and labour mobility is best for them.  Policies that restrict labour turnover are not good for young workers.  For example, the strict job protection for adult jobs that was in place in Spain at the beginning of this recession can go a long way towards explaining the high unemployment rate in that country.  A minimum wage that is set too high is also not good because it discourages job creation, although reasonable levels for the young, such as approximately one third or somewhat more of the adult median wage, can be good for employment because they remove uncertainty from the minds of young people about jobs and fair pay.</p><p>Young unemployed workers need to be independent, and we should help them to avoid poverty with an appropriately designed unemployment insurance system.  In principle, however, job subsidies that offer work experience are better than unconditional unemployment compensation.  There are many ways of subsidising jobs for young people, especially those who have been unemployed for a long time.  Sweden has successfully tried a scheme which subsidised the hiring of unemployed workers as replacements for workers on maternity or other kinds of leave.  Other schemes might include start-up grants for self-employed people or wage subsidies.  The authorities can pass the unemployment compensation to an employer who hires an unemployed worker and pays a wage that is higher than the compensation.  As the employer and the employee both pay national insurance contributions, eventually this subsidisation is cheaper than supporting unemployment through transfers.  In addition, the young unemployed individual can get work experience.  This is what German studies have found when a similar scheme was tried in that country.</p><p>I conclude by repeating my main message.  In a recession, unemployment can be a devastating experience for young people.  Governments need to step in with measures that offset the negative effects of the state of the market through additional education and training, public investment projects and other measures directly addressed to the long-term unemployed.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-11-08a.73" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1131" speakername="Fidelma Healy Eames" time="11:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012110800010#K00700"><p>I welcome Professor Pissarides and thank him for his encouraging words of direction to the Government.  He is shining a spotlight on the important topic of youth unemployment.  This esteemed House has endured since 1922 and is known to be a place of ideas and debate.  We would also like it to be a House of solutions.  In taking over the European Presidency in January 2013, we have a unique opportunity to lead on the issue of youth unemployment.  As leaders and national parliamentarians we will have an opportunity to address youth unemployment across the European Union.  That makes Professor Pissarides's visit all the more special.</p><p>A report published today revealed that 25% of our young people believe that recession is the worst part of Irish life.  More than 66,500 young people were surveyed for this report.  Youth unemployment is a scourge that we ignore at our peril.  History teaches us about the dangers of an unemployed and disaffected youth.  We need only look to the 50% youth unemployment rate in Germany in the 1930s, which is the same level as in Spain and Greece today.  Our youth unemployment rate stands at approximately 30%, or twice the level for the population as a whole.  The President of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, recognises that Europe's biggest problem is unemployment among young people.  One of our own great writers, Peig Sayers, wrote &quot;Measaim ná fuil aon dá sheoid is luachmhaire ná an t-óige 's an tsláinte,&quot; which means &quot;I think there are no two jewels more valuable than youth and health&quot;.  Our youth and the health of this society are under threat.  It makes sense for us to act resolutely and I wish to focus on the solutions.</p><p>One of the best investments we can make in society is in our youth, not only for themselves but also because a working youth will fund our pensions.  Inputs for youth will lead to a healthy cycle of life.  I note the professor's recent comments to the British Government regarding the importance of social protection measures and the need to avoid cutting them for the jobless.</p> <p>We are also committed to this.  I was particularly delighted to hear Professor Pissarides speak today about job creation and public investment programmes.  We should make no mistake about the fact that young people across Europe are not happy.  They believe the implicit contract they bought into has been broken.  They were told they could have a better way of life than their parents if they worked hard and studied hard.  A young Spanish woman who was interviewed by <i>The Economist </i>said she felt as though she had trained for a world that no longer existed.  We all know that for many people, leaving school or college is hopeless in the absence of an outlet for one's skills, natural enthusiasm, hopes and dreams.  As Professor Pissarides knows, we almost had full employment during the boom, from which very high expectations resulted.  Our bust was particularly sharp.  Therefore, the fall has been so much harder.  The sad thing for many parents is that they are no longer in a position to help their children because they are struggling with basic household payments.  All countries that are in programmes are in trouble.  We know we need a return to growth across the eurozone.  In the meantime, we cannot wait.  That is why it was good to hear Professor Pissarides's recommendations.  The good news is that young people bounce back quickly in an economic recovery.  The problem is that this recession has been going on for a long time.</p><p> What can Europe do?  I want to put a proposal to Professor Pissarides.  It is not the case that Ireland is not doing a great deal.  We have drawn up the Pathways to Work proramme and the Action Plan for Jobs.  We have signed up to the Europe 2020 growth agenda.  Some 52% of those who have finished the JobBridge programme - approximately 10,000 people have started it - have gone into paid employment.  I would like to put my own theory and policy direction on these matters to Professor Pissarides.  We have made mistakes in education.  We often educate purely for employment, rather than also educating for self-employment, which means that when people lose their jobs in a recession, they think there is no work they can do.  We should be educating for self-employment and entrepreneurship, as well as for employment.  It should not be an add-on, which is what many of educational institutions meddle in, for example, as part of the transition year programme.  It should be part of mainstream education.  If we are to do this, we need parallel creative and entrepreneurial education pathways which receive the same value and status as the traditional academic pathways.  I would like Professor Pissarides to respond.  What is his experience of other countries?  Are there countries that have entrepreneurial pathways which receive the same value as the traditional academic pathways, on which we have relied for so long and have served us well but are not enough in a recession?  I look forward to hearing Professor Pissarides's response.</p></speech>

It is an honour to be in the presence of a Nobel laureate for the first time in my life.  I am particularly emotionally moved because the prize in question was awarded for economics.  Professor Pissarides is very welcome.  I represent Fianna Fáil, which is the major party in opposition, on the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation of this Parliament.  On 18 September last, Mr. Robert Strauss made a presentation at the committee on the issue of youth unemployment in Ireland in a European perspective.  He held up a chart to show that Ireland has the worst long-term unemployment and youth unemployment of all 27 EU countries.  Professor Pissarides may be surprised to hear that.</p><p>If I may be blunt, if politicians do not have vision and leadership and do not tread dangerously, they are wasting the time of taxpayers.  We received a presentation from a Government body - the expert group on this country's future skills needs - that drew attention to the number of job vacancies in Ireland.  Its most recent report, which was based on a survey conducted in 2011, analysed over 100,000 new vacancies across nine broad occupations, specific required skill sets and educational attainments.  It showed that despite the recession, job vacancies in the Irish labour market had continued to rise.  Approximately 8,500 new vacancies were being advertised each month, despite the scourge of unemployment.  Along with another lady, I established a business in 1986, during the last terrible crisis in Ireland.  The business in question, Lir Chocolates, currently employs 250 people.  We worked for 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for 16 years to make the company succeed.  We worked on Christmas Day and New Year's Day.  The company would not have survived if we had not given it that level of attention.</p><p>We have a serious problem with the public sector.  It is not adding anything to the value of the economy.  The only jobs that will be created in this economy will be in small and medium-sized indigenous Irish companies and foreign direct investment companies.  The people have to realise that those are the only places from which jobs will come.  The budget on 5 December next should not dare to touch anything in this country that will impede or constrain the growth of the economy.  To be honest, we do not have enough people from a business background to understand that point.  I attended a breakfast meeting this morning that was organised by my party's finance spokesman, Deputy Michael McGrath.  The business people at the meeting pleaded with us not to allow the Government to do anything in the budget that would stop them from developing their companies.  Some of them said they feel they are working merely to pay our staff.  As Senator Healy Eames said, we need entrepreneurs.</p><p>I wish to highlight a pet issue of mine, which is the Irish people's lack of bilingualism.  The ability to speak foreign languages like French, German and Spanish is as important as the acquisition of maths, science and technology skills.  We have a serious problem.  When young children are in school, they spend hours learning our native language, which we all love and are emotionally attached to.  When Irish people finish secondary school, they cannot speak their own language.  We have to deal with this issue.  We do not have a second language.  As Professor Pissarides knows, most young people in every other European country can speak English as well as their own languages.  Our serious deficit with regard to bilingualism makes it more difficult for us to do business at the high level of technology that is required now.  Business is much more complicated and technical in the new globalised economy.  It is no longer a question of developing a personal relationship.  One has to be intellectually agile in the areas of science, technology, engineering and maths and be able to communicate in other languages.  We have to be more focused on providing these skills.  We do not have the skilled people necessary to take up thousands of jobs that are available.  I want to know where the leadership will come from to grab this problem and resolve it quickly, as would happen if a multinational company or any other private sector company faced a challenge of this nature.</p><p>I will conclude by emphasising that despite what I may have inferred about the public sector, there is absolutely no doubt that there are outstanding public servants in bodies like Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the county and city enterprise boards, to name but a few.  We have an increasing problem.  The many people who are being let go from the public sector are adding to the high rate of unemployment.  They are unemployed now.  As a former business person, I find it frustrating that there is no energy or drive to solve the myriad problems.</p></speech>

He is very welcome.  I commend my colleague from Trinity College, Senator Barrett, who first suggested that Professor Pissarides might come to address us.</p> <p>I have a particular affection for the London School of Economics, where I completed my masters degree in 1990-91 and have wonderful memories in particular of the late Professor Bill Wedderburn, who was lecturer and mentor to me there.  LSE combines an extraordinary level of intellectual and academic rigour with a really strong level of civic and political engagement at public policy level.  Professor Pissarides's career demonstrates that combination in terms of both his hugely impressive academic and scholarly output, and also his input into public policy at European and national level - quite apart from the Nobel Prize.  We are delighted to have somebody of his eminence here and I thank him for coming.  He brings not only the academic rigour but also membership of organisations such as the European employment task force, which is particularly important for those of us engaged in public policy.</p><p>Senator Healy Eames referred to a comment Professor Pissarides made on the award of the Nobel Prize in 2010 and the risk that deep welfare cuts, particularly cuts to jobseeker's allowance and housing benefit, may cause spiralling poverty and may have a detrimental impact on job creation.  That is a very helpful comment for us to remember.  I know he made it in the context of British Government policy, but it is something that has a resonance here also.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, has stood firm against cuts to core social welfare rates and made the point on several occasions that social welfare spending is an economic stimulus - is a form of stimulus package - because payments made to those on welfare feed directly into the local economy through the local retail sector and so on.  Cuts therefore impact not only on families on welfare but also on businesses their spending supports.</p><p>I very much welcome the point Professor Pissarides made on the need for spending on education and training during a recession.  That is a point very well made and we need to emphasise it here.  Regarding entrepreneurship, the professor mentioned the US as the powerhouse of organisations such as Apple and Google.  In a recent blog he stated that this points to a difference between job-creation policies in Europe and those in the US.  It is no coincidence that Ikea is a Swedish company rather than an American company as this demonstrates the different approaches taken.  Ireland has a strong record of entrepreneurship, particularly in the IT sector.  From Trinity College Dublin we have had companies such as Iona Technologies in the past and more recently major developments in the computed gaming sector where companies such as Havoc, the digital hub and so on have led the way.  Senator White referred to areas in the Irish economy where there are job opportunities but insufficient skills and where we are still importing people with those skills.  The IT and computer gaming sector is one of those areas.  We have a record of entrepreneurship there and we need to stimulate it further.</p><p>I turn to some of the other points Professor Pissarides made on youth unemployment.  This morning we received some very good news from the Department of Education and Skills in terms of youth retention rates at secondary schools, which with 90% of students staying on to complete secondary education is the highest it has ever been.  In particular the number of boys at school has risen and the retention rate of students in disadvantaged schools has also risen.  That is obviously linked to economic recession and a lack of employment opportunities, but it feeds into what the professor said about education.  The Government has commenced many initiatives and my colleagues have referred to some of them including the Pathways to Work programme, JobBridge, Tús and the new SOLAS agency that replaces the pre-existing training agency.</p><p>The professor mentioned the need to ensure training in short courses and this is the way to lift people out of unemployment.  While the previous employment training agency, FÁS, was much maligned, it had the strength of offering short and very labour market focused training programmes.  I know many graduates who could not get work on foot of their primary degrees but following a six-month FÁS course in computer assisted design, for example, or some form of programming, were able to get employment and are still in employment as a result of that short course.  That is also very important point.</p><p>The national policies in which we are engaged can clearly only go so far.  As we take up the Presidency of the European Union in January we need to look at the idea of a European-wide youth guarantee proposal.  Is Professor Pissarides familiar with the idea of a European youth guarantee to be funded potentially by the European Social Fund or European Structural Funds and which would guarantee young people that within four months of becoming unemployed they would be given a training place, an apprenticeship or a combined work and training placement, if not a job offer?  Commitment is needed on this at European level where there is an EU average youth unemployment rate of 22%.  Clearly Ireland's rate is higher at 30% as the professor pointed out.  Does he believe this would be an appropriate measure to tackle youth unemployment?</p><p>Professor Pissarides mentioned wage subsidy schemes which in Germany have been used to great effect to bolster the automobile industry in times of recession.  Does he believe that is something governments across the EU should adopt?  I thank him for is very thought provoking and stimulating address.</p></speech>

What he said to us about the lost generation will certainly stop us in our tracks as we try to deal with the problem of youth unemployment throughout Europe.  This is not the only honour for the professor today.  The Trinity College Historical Society will present him with its gold medal this evening as an appreciation by young people for his work.  That society was founded in April 1747 by Edmund Burke.  His biographer stated that he found in Trinity College Dublin an amount of intellectual activity considerably greater than that which Gibbon a few years later found in Oxford.  I hope the professor finds TCD provides that degree of stimulus when he goes there this evening.</p><p>I note the professor's emphasis on dealing with unemployment on a micro level.  In Ireland probably more than anywhere else we have learned that quantitative easing leads to much faster results in stock exchanges and banks, and then precipitates a property boom from which we are now trying to recover with horrendous consequences because it limits utterly the ability of the Government to tackle the issues the professor has raised so strongly with us.  I agree with the emphasis on such micro approaches because the experience of QE in Ireland has probably been among the biggest disasters of any country.  Given that our resources are limited, the questions that arise from the professor's presentation relate to the type of education we should have.  Can he think of areas of investment in education that we should expand or areas of investment in education that we should reconsider?</p><p>Regarding the professor's project appraisals, we had a massive problem with one of the biggest public capital programmes relative to GDP to be found anywhere.  The background would be a strong tradition of engineer dominance, rent seeking by the construction industry and a lack of project appraisal resulting in projects that add more to the country's debt than to its GDP as they work out.  As Senator Bacik mentioned, we had a problem with labour market quangos - one of which was spending €1 billion of EU funds in a period when unemployment was virtually non-existent at 4%.</p><p>While I hate the term, an important consideration for us is how to get more bang for a buck in these areas.  I ask the professor, developing his major points, to outline any ideas he has to help us to focus.  We are seriously in debt and in an IMF rescue programme.  We are trying to do, as other Senators have said, so much in terms of 90% retention rates at second level and so on but we need to use our resources very efficiently because we made so many mistakes and used up so many of our resources previously.</p><p>The professor mentioned the European Investment Bank.  Can it hone its investments to a better rate of return on projects?  Do we need a central office of project evaluation?  Would he require the evaluations to be published well in advance in order that economists, such as him, could assess whether the projects were worthwhile.  It is an economy where rent seeking and regulatory capture were features.  Today's newspapers have again highlighted that we are still captured by banks that are largely exempted from the consequences of the damage they imposed on the country.</p> <p>I thank the professor for his words of wisdom, which are very important to us.  We have a major problem to address.  I refer to other points mentioned by Senators.  In education we have a mathematics problem, which has been discussed in this House.  We also have a problem with languages, also referred to today.  Is that inherent in all countries in which people speak English?  People do not learn enough languages to trade with the BRIC countries and the wider world.</p><p>I thank Professor Pissarides for addressing the House.  We look forward to his replies.</p></speech>

This debate is particularly relevant to me because young people under 25 years are my peer group.  I am very aware of people my age, friends, family, colleagues from college and school, who are unemployed or have been forced to emigrate.  Senator Healy Eames quoted an Irish writer.  I would like to quote another one, W.B. Yeats, who wrote, "That is no country for old men".</p></speech>

This comes back to the issue of youth unemployment and to emigration, which was not touched upon.  In 2011 alone, 87,000 people left this state and there are 460,000 unemployed.</p><p>I agree totally with the professor's point that we have given too much away to fiscal austerity.  My party is a firm advocate of that position and is strongly in favour of stimulus.  Will the professor give us his opinion of stimulus?  My party has proposed consideration of using State resources such as the National Pensions Reserve Fund, examining what the European Investment Bank could offer and erasing cuts to capital budgets.  As the professor noted, such investment in infrastructure would return benefits into the future.</p><p>The professor laid particular emphasis on frictional employment.  In Ireland there has been much structural employment but because of the collapse of the construction sector many thousands lost employment and are in need of upskilling and retraining to adapt to the new needs of the labour market.  That collapse had many spillover effects on other sectors, such as retail.  Feeding into this problem are the high numbers of young people who are not in education, employment or training.  A recent report put this figure at 22% overall for those aged between 15 and 29, which is probably one of the highest levels in Europe.  The same report found that the number of long-term unemployed in Ireland has skyrocketed and is now the fourth highest in Europe.</p></speech>

Our Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, has stated she would advocate this during the Irish Presidency.  Will the professor give his opinion on that issue?  I refer again to long-term youth unemployment.  How do we try to tackle it?  As he noted it will be much harder for these young people to try to engage, come back to the labour market and upskill.  As Senator Healy Eames noted, these are the people who will pay our pensions into the future.  How do we tackle that problem now, given our high rate of long-term youth unemployment?</p></speech>

Some very useful points were made and I should respond to them quickly before we take questions.</p><p>Senator Healy Eames asked what Ireland can do with the Presidency.  It is a unique opportunity.  The biggest benefit to the economy and all unemployed people, in particular the youth unemployed, would be to persuade the powers that be in the EU, the troika-type powers, to split the budget between recurrent spending and investment spending.  Investment spending costs money now but gives revenue and return in the future.  It is not right to include it with recurrent spending such as salaries of civil servants and whatever other Government consumption there may be.  Even if the powers decide to impose austerity on the investment budget it should still be kept separate.  Putting all the money that has been put aside to rescue and bail out countries in need into one fund, and looking at that budget only to see what economies can be imposed before handing over the money, is wrong.  The money should be split in a way that is more akin to offering Structural Funds, which can then go into investment.  Another part of the money could go where it now goes, as with the EFSF money that goes into the bailout funds.  That would help enormously.  It would create jobs through investment projects and would bring numbers of youth unemployed back to work.  I get the feeling there is a positive leaning towards that measure in Brussels so it might be a good time to propose it.</p><p>There were questions about the jobs and skills we should have and points were made about self-employment.  I envisage certain sectors creating jobs in the future.  This is where job creation will come from and will apply to both young and older workers and especially to women who are coming into the labour force in bigger numbers.  There will be a fairly small number of highly qualified jobs in information and communications technologies, ICT.  There will be green jobs, for example, how to convert our buildings into more environment friendly ones.  The big numbers of jobs will be in health education, the social care type of occupations and retailing.  Retail is a big sector that will employ more people.</p><p>In terms of the skills needed for these jobs we need to train people differently.  There is a different mentality than previously.  An apprenticeship that trains a person for industry is a good training but either there will not be any jobs in that sector or they will be so few that the training will have to be forgotten.  We have to retrain.  That is where conflicts occur in the many vacancies that come onto the market - people do not have the right skills.  We are in recession now.  I do not know the exact numbers in Ireland but in the EU as a whole there are some 25 million unemployed and only 2 million vacancies.  The numbers are obviously distorted but the fact remains that there still are vacancies but they are not being taken up because the relevant skills are not present.</p><p>Training in ICT at school level and training how to convert buildings using a more green technology will help but there must also be training in care.  What does it mean now to enter the health or retail sectors?  Language ability will be very important, particularly in the retail sector, as will teaching person to person skills, how to deal with other people.  That is something we are not used to doing because it was not needed in manufacturing.  If one is on an assembly line or doing machine repairs one is essentially working on one's own, not communicating with others.  The big numbers of jobs in the future will be in sectors where interpersonal communication will be needed.</p><p>In the sectors I mentioned, company size will be smaller which emphasises the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises and the self-employment sector.</p> <p>We know that ever since the Schröder reforms in Germany, the policy of encouraging self-employment in the form of start-up grants for the unemployed in particular has proved very successful.  Under this policy, people can collect unemployment benefit for a limited period.  If they start their own businesses, however, they can collect it for longer in the form of a grant.</p></speech>

I recommend policies of this nature because the relevant government can recoup most of its costs, if not through tax then by means of social security or national insurance contributions that self-employed make.  Essentially, studies from Germany indicate that these programmes become self-financing.  Due to problems with collecting data, these studies do not relate to the recession but are from 2006 and 2007.  I do not believe, however, that the position would be very different in the recession.</p><p>I would like to comment now on how to train people in order that they will obtain suitable skills.  As stated earlier, we must involve local businesses much more in the design of the curriculum.  They are actually prepared to do this.  I have spoken to CEOs who have indicated that they become frustrated when they want to hire young people and then discover that these individuals do not possess the skills they need and must be given a great deal of training.  These CEOs also stated that it would be easy for schools to provide the proper training, particularly if they were invited in once a year to discuss the curriculum and the relevant syllabuses and then make recommendations about the type of jobs they see being created.  Those to whom I refer are best placed to interpret future trends.  They become aware of those trends first and then we discover them by observing what these individuals do in respect of them.  They know what is required before they do it and, as such, this is not a random process.  If that to which I refer were to happen, it would allow for better matching of skills to job creation opportunities.</p><p>I am sure Senators will be aware, in the context of Ireland's forthcoming Presidency, that the Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion of the European Union is carrying out many studies in respect of ICT, green jobs and health.  These sectors were the subject of much discussion when I was in Brussels almost a year ago.  During its Presidency, Ireland could encourage debate on the type of jobs that could be created in these sectors.  Some of the biggest and most important sectors in which jobs were created in the 20th century were those in which the great technologies discovered in the 19th century were used.  I refer, for example, to the internal combustion engine, domestic technologies and appliances, new types of housing, air conditioning and heating.  When I first went to England in the late 1960s, I could not believe that houses still did not have central heating.  Now all houses have central heating.  A great many people had to be employed to ensure that the latter became the case.</p><p>We have not, however, taken action in the context of greening our buildings.  This will be the next major area of construction in which employment is going to be created.  For better or worse, Ireland has an advantage in this regard because it has so many unemployed construction workers.  They will ensure that there will be a silver lining to the cloud currently hanging over the country.  They are going to be of assistance in making a virtue out of the vice that gave rise to the huge expansion of the construction sector in the past.  I will be able to expand more on these points when I address the College Historical Society in Trinity this evening.  Construction is the biggest contributor to unemployment in this country among both young and old.  In fact, Ireland is No. 1 in Europe in this regard and even beat Spain by a tiny amount in the context of the contribution the sector has made to unemployment.  Everyone thinks of Spain as being the major problem in this regard but Ireland is just as much of a problem.</p><p>As stated, the German scheme relating to the self-employed has been very successful.  This is because it has become self-financing.  There are governments, particularly that in Britain, which have doubts with regard to whether such schemes would succeed in their jurisdictions.  When I discuss matters of this nature with the economic policy unit at No. 10 Downing Street in Britain, those who work there have doubts as to whether a subsidy scheme relating to the hiring of unemployed people - particularly those who are long-term unemployed - would succeed.  I am not persuaded by the arguments they put forward in this regard, particularly as the subsidisation scheme in Germany has worked well.  Again, I intend to give more details on this matter when I address the College Historical Society this evening.  However, I will state that the subsidy in Germany is for nine months and this is renewable if the worker stays on and is successful.  The gross cost of the scheme is the same as that which relates to the payment of unemployment benefit.  The latter might be paid for six months or a year but it can last even longer if it is given to an employer who subsequently pays the worker an amount above the rate of the benefit in order to incentivise him or her to take the job.  When the employer then makes national insurance contributions, the net cost to the Government is less than that which would obtain in respect of the payment of unemployment benefit.</p><p>The scheme to which I refer has been especially successful in times of recession because if employers are not intending to create many of the type of jobs to which I refer, then there is no loss in respect of their collecting subsidies in respect of jobs they would have created in any event.  I would certainly recommend this scheme.</p><p>On whether a fiscal stimulus should be put in place, this takes care of the splitting of the budgets to which I referred earlier.  I am of the view that it should be given on the investment side.  The youth guarantee is a good policy but it is going to be very expensive.  Four months is not a long period, particularly in view of the extended durations that exist now.  I have only just become aware that Ireland has the longest duration for youth unemployment.  I had thought that Spain had the longest duration.  The guarantee in this regard is very good.  We must ensure, however, that if it is voted in, it will be followed up on.  If we fail to follow up on it, then the reputation of policy makers will go down in the estimation of those who are young and unemployed.  A guarantee of obtaining a job or training within four months is good but we must wait to see whether it will work in practical terms.</p><p>I will now say something slightly tongue in cheek.  Language is a great skill and I tried to learn French and Italian.  However, I ended up only learning English as a foreign language.  Senator Barrett inquired about the advantages and disadvantages of those who live in English-speaking countries.  The new technologies are entirely dominated by English as a result of the involvement of the Americans.  As a result, there are advantages to being able to train people in ICT skills through English.  However, as we discovered on Tuesday, American politicians are going to be obliged to learn Spanish if they want to be elected to office from now on.  It might become a disadvantage to be in a country in which people speak English in the future, particularly if one is a politician.</p></speech>

It is great to be in such illustrious company.  As time is short, I will come straight to the point.</p> <p>Professor Pissarides mentioned that the minimum wage is a deterrent to employment.  In my view one is never better off unemployed than employed.  If a decent minimum wage is not on offer then we will be unable to encourage people to go back into employment.  I ask for his views on the rates of pay in this country.  The knock-on effect of youth unemployment is far-reaching.  In my part of the country we have a great tradition of Gaelic football.  I note that our football clubs are being forced to amalgamate because there are not enough players as the young people are emigrating.  The effect on communities is significant.  I am the mother of a young person who is in employment and who is about to buy a house.  However, such people are in fear of losing their job of being caught up in negative equity or being unable to repay a mortgage.</p></speech>

He referred to the importance of capital investment.  Up to 2010 this country had a capital investment programme of up to 5% of GNP and it is now closer to 3%.  A cut in the capital programme is seen by many governments as being the easy option.  In the most recent budget there was a further cut of €750 million.  It is difficult for governments to balance the books.  Ireland is in a programme.  The troika has been very critical of extensive cuts but the Government believes in over-cutting the capital investment programme.</p><p>One area in which we have been unable to get any leverage is private sector pensions, corporate pensions in particular.  Over €80 billion is invested in Irish pensions and this does not include the foreign pensions managed in this country.  Have other countries been able to leverage private sector pension investment at a corporate level to provide direct investment in infrastructural and other capital programmes which are regarded as having good steady long-term investment returns?  Successive Governments have been very slow in accessing and opening that pot.  What is the easiest way to do this?  Have other EU states been successful at driving private sector investment into public infrastructural projects?</p></speech>

I have a particular question about putting a human face on economics which is very important.  One of the aspects of his contribution which I admired was that it was delivered in accessible language.  I am lucky enough to have a house on the beautiful island of Cyprus, up in the Troodos mountains.  This summer I saw people collecting money to give food to people in Athens.  Mr. Schäuble recently visited Ireland.  He complimented this country on the fact that we were successful.  It does not feel successful.  It feels rather like what happened during the Famine when a rigid economic theory was imposed from the centre on defenceless people here.  This was not done maliciously, necessarily, but <i>laissez-faire</i> economics contributed to the disaster of the Famine.  Similar rigid economic theories are now being imposed ruthlessly from the centre while people are suffering.</p><p>  Mr. Micawber's explanation was, income, one pound; expenditure, nineteen shillings and sixpence; result: happiness.  Income, one pound; expenditure, one pound and sixpence; result: misery.  In this country, 1.3 million people have a disposable income of &#8364;50 or less at the end of the month and at least that much will be taken in the budget.  How can it be done?  Money is a symbolic representation of energy.  It is unequally distributed.  It seems there is less and less of a human face to be seen in this regard.  The New York Stock Exchange has its algorithms set to discharge sales and purchases in nanoseconds and it is now introducing regulations that one must hold shares for eleven seconds, maximum.  It is astonishing.  It must mean that the humane element is drained out.  Professor Pissarides has a capacity to deliver a message clearly.  I was particularly glad when he spoke about education and investment in infrastructure.  He is right and it was wonderful.  Can we bring the desolate people of Europe with us?  I am sure Professor Pissarides noticed there were between 70,000 and 100,000 people on the streets in Athens last night and that there is a disjuncture.</p></speech>

I come from a town that lost 1,000 industrial jobs in high volume, low tech engineering-type operations.  It is very difficult to replace such jobs.  Professor Pissarides spoke about the future for job creation being in green technology and the retrofitting of homes.  In his view, should the Government provide subsidies or financial inducements to encourage people to consider investing in the retrofitting of homes which would create much-needed jobs?</p><p>Professor Pissarides spoke about social entrepreneurship and the job opportunities which could be created in the area of social care.  Should the Government consider disengaging from some forms of care it currently provides and allow private and social enterprise to replace it?  Jobs are being lost in every small town because the retail trade is on its knees.  What advice would Professor Pissarides give the Government in an effort to boost retail sales and activity in advance of Christmas and throughout the year?  What should be done differently to encourage people to spend money?  Despite the recession, many people have money but they are not spending it because they are fearful of what could happen in the future.</p></speech>

There was something in his contribution for everybody across the political spectrum.  I agree with him that austerity on its own damages the domestic economy.  We all accept the need to reduce the deficit in this State and across Europe.  However, the concern is that investment and growth are not receiving the political attention they require and which the austerity policies receive.  There is much talk about investment and growth.  What advice would Professor Pissarides give the European leaders to put practical supports in place to encourage investment in the eurozone and the member states?  I refer to the unsustainable levels of debt of many European countries, including Ireland.  The servicing of those debts has an impact on the domestic economy and growth.  What advice would he give Ireland and Europe about the management of the unsustainable levels of debt?  My main point is about the need to shift away from austerity to policies which encourage genuine investment and growth.  This is the best way to get people back to work and to reduce the massive unemployment rates across the eurozone.</p></speech>

The phrase, "That is no country for old men", comes from the poem, Sailing to Byzantium, by William Butler Yeats.  He was a Member of this House and it is appropriate his lines were spoken.  I agree with the Senator that this is not a country for young people at the minute and neither is Europe a continent for young people.  The rates of youth unemployment in the United States are much lower compared to the rates in Europe.</p> <p>Is this a result of how it is measured, or is there an actual difference?  I know from my sons and daughter that many young people who have graduated do not believe they will end up working in the discipline in which they graduated.  Many must take up work outside their areas of study.  Does Professor Pissarides believe that people are in the wrong disciplines or that jobs are not available?  Should we focus on more specific degrees so that students will be able to work in defined areas?  More than half of the last generation of graduates have ended up in other fields of employment.  Is that a problem specific to Ireland or Europe or is it a global problem?</p></speech>

There are two categories of young unemployed person.  We have highly qualified young people who feel frustrated because there are no jobs, but there is also a set of young people who have grown up in the tradition of unemployment.  I was involved in a project that helped young people who had dropped out of school.  We worked with them to try to get them into employment.  When we surveyed these people five years later, at a time when the country was doing well, we found that neither their fathers nor their grandfathers had worked.  We now have a problem because of the recession, as it is even more difficult for people to escape from that rut.</p><p>We need to focus on people with good qualifications, but we also need to focus on those families in which nobody has been employed since before the grandparents' time.  Is there a policy at European level to deal with that problem across Europe and to focus on areas in which no progress has been made, even in good times?  We can easily forget about that.  I think we must focus on this problem area.</p></speech>

The minimum wage is viewed in the same way that the medical profession views alcohol.  Too much alcohol is not good for you, and no alcohol is also not good for you, but the middle way is really good for your heart, which is advice that I always follow.  The same logic applies to the minimum wage.  The absence of a minimum wage is not good because it introduces lower expectations of work in the minds of people, but too high a minimum wage will work against job creation.  Where to strike the balance partly depends on the economy in question, but there are many similarities in the structures of European economies.  Economic studies have found that for optimum benefit the minimum wage should be set at between 45% and 50% of the median wage.  This does not harm employment.  The minimum wage in Britain is about right, as no study has found that it has harmed job creation.  It is a little bit higher than the rate in the United States, where it was found that minimum wage actually encouraged employment, but it is less than what they have in France, where studies have shown that the minimum wage has damaged employment.  If I were to use percentages, I would say younger workers should be paid 35% to 40% of the median wage at a maximum.  If an adult is getting 45% to 50% of the median wage, one would have to take 10% off that rate, because young workers are inexperienced and their wages are lower.  A range of 30% to 40% of the median wage is good for the youth labour market.  That is the rate, more or less, that applies in Britain.  The minimum wage council conducts research into the impact of the minimum wage and recommends the necessary adjustments.</p><p>I agree entirely with the points Members made on investment.  There is only one budget for all public spending, and investment is the easiest thing to cut.  I have repeatedly made the proposal that the investment budget should be split from the current budget.  The investment of funds from private sector pensions into public projects is a good idea and it could fit into public private partnerships.  I must confess that I am not aware of any success stories, but that might be because I have not looked for one.  If I had seen or heard somebody discuss that option, I would be able to tell Members about it, but I have not heard of any such success stories.  The most recent information I have on pension funds investment is the direct opposite.  In the financial press today, it is reported that pension funds are more heavily invested in bonds that have secure incomes and are no longer invested in equities.  The culture of investing pension funds in equities is gradually going away because of the uncertainties in the rate of return from equities.  Those who manage pension funds know the obligations they have and feel that a fixed income investment will remove much of the uncertainty.  Of course, investing in public private partnership is a move in the opposite direction.  I am not too optimistic that such funds can be persuaded to invest in projects now that the investment environment is so uncertain.  That is the reason I suggested the European Union should come in and part-fund the projects through the Structural Fund.</p><p>One of the most significant problems we are facing is inequality in pay.  This problem, together with the debt cliff, will haunt America in years to come.  We see the extremes in America.  I do not find that palatable.  The gains from technology in America in the past 30 years went to the top 1% of income earners, which is not acceptable.  Almost all of the gains, with some minor exceptions, went to the top 1%.  We see what is happening in Greece where those on lower incomes are being squeezed to pay for the cuts.  It is creating greater social tension.  It is a major problem for a country to deal with that tension.</p><p>The solution in the Nordic countries to deal with the issue of low incomes is to create public sector employment.  To finance public employment, the average tax intake in countries such as Sweden and Denmark is more than 50% and ranges from 53% to 55% of GDP.  That is acceptable to the Swedes and the Danes because they trust that the Government is doing a good job by creating jobs in social care and so on.  I cannot see something like that working in Greece in the current climate.  I also cannot see it working in a country such as Britain because the electorate would find it completely unacceptable and would simply vote the Government down.  This is a major problem.  How much a government can do is down to politics.</p> <p>However, we have solutions.  I would like, and believe it would more acceptable, to have something like the system that is in place in the Netherlands where there is a good deal of support but the support is not the extent of that found in the Scandinavian countries, which I do not believe would be acceptable to voters in general.  It is a case where the government needs to intervene to reduce the unequal outcomes that have resulted from the new technologies introduced.  New technologies eliminate the layer of middle executives.  The layer of middle executives and department heads employed in the manufacturing industries in big numbers are not compatible with new technologies.  There are the very top people, the managers, the CEOs of the big companies, and then there is an army of people who do the work.  Apple is the best example of this.  The majority of Apple employees in the United States earn very close to the minimum wage.  These are the demonstrators, the delivery people, those who work in the Apple stores, those who answer the telephones and those who chat to customers who want to buy products on the Internet.  All those are Apple employees and they are proud to work for the coolest company in the world but they do not earn much more than the minimum wage.  Then there are the top executives who earn millions of dollars every year.  The layer of middle executives have been lost with the new technologies.  The government needs to redistribute within that picture but how it does that it more of a political decision.    </p><p>On the job losses that have occurred here, green investments for the greening of our buildings in particular should be subsidised because of the social benefits that ensue from them for the environment.  It is a typical case in economics of a social benefit about which an individual would not care.  One could tell someone to give more money to save the environment, to which that person would reply, &quot;Why me?&quot;  A good test of this would be to check how many passengers contribute to airlines that invite passengers to pay another €20 to offset their carbon footprint.  I do not know how many people take it up.  If pressed to make a guess, I do not believe many people would take it up if they pay themselves but if one can claim expenses, one might pay the money and it might make one feel better.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-11-08a.103" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Christopher Pissarides" time="12:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012110800017#R00300"><p>On the question of whether the move should be into the private sector in terms of social enterprises, I would give a similar answer to the one I just gave.  If we look at the history of job creation and structural change taking place in the economy, something in which we have been more interested recently, the move has been increasingly to the health and education sectors, which are publicly funded.  If we do not do anything with the private sector, taxation will inevitably increase to finance those jobs.  We are moving in the direction of the Scandinavians in that respect.  If that is acceptable to a country, there is nothing wrong with it provided a state is not corrupt.  If higher taxes are not acceptable, as in the way we hear American politicians talking about that all the time, then we have to shift to the private sector because someone will have to provide the jobs.  If it is done in the way the Americans have done it, an outcome of that is that health costs there have increased by a multiple of seven compared with all the other costs of services.  The costs of all services there are increasing but health costs are shooting up.  Compared with the mid-1980s, health costs there are seven times higher than the costs of other services.  Britain is finding it cannot finance the National Health Service as efficiently as it was to able to do in the past and only last week it removed some restrictions on hospitals to go private.  There was the usual opposition to that, others applauded it and the Minister said that they are hoping the extra money the hospitals will make from private medical care will be used to enhance the NHS.  I cannot believe that if one makes money from one's private consultancy one will put it back into one's job if one is an employee of the government.  That is a big problem.</p><p>There is no advice one can give about reviving the retail sector other than to revive the economy.  That sector is the biggest measure of how the economy is doing.  If people do not go into shops to buy products, jobs will not be created.  One could try to introduce some job sharing schemes similar to the type Germany has tried to introduce and they have been successful.  Another measure is to give incentives to employers not to lay off part of their workforce.  It is not expensive for the government to do that.  There is the impression that it is expensive because money is given to the employer but it avoids the subsidisation of the unemployment through unemployment benefits.  If one has 100 employees and because of a fall in business one decides to let 20 of them go, instead of the government financing the employment of those 20 employees and providing initiatives for them, that money could be given to the employer and it could be asked to keep those 20 staff employed and to share out the jobs.  It would reduce labour productivity for a short period but it is a much better way of doing it than increasing unemployment. </p><p>Regarding practical advice on investment, as I said, the budgets should be split because that will encourage investment.  On the question of whether servicing the debt is sustainable, that is a can of worms we better keep sealed.  Japan has a debt of 240% of GDP and no one thinks it is unsustainable, therefore, there are ways of financing big debts without defaults but I do not know how one could do that.</p><p>On the question of whether we are educating people in the wrong disciplines, I do not think so apart from the issues we discussed earlier in encouraging more interaction between local businesses and schools to make sure they get the right skills.  In good times young people were not leaving the country.  People are leaving now because of the recession and because Ireland has always had a very mobile population.  It is an issue on which I disagree with the European Commission.  The European Commission wants to encourage this kind of emigration.  In fact, Ireland might discover during its Presidency of the EU that it is the champion of Europe in terms of migration.  The Commission wants to encourage more migration from the high unemployment countries to the low unemployment ones.  I do not believe that will be good for European countries.  I do not believe it will be acceptable.  I do not know what the outcome will be if Germany suddenly discovers it is being invaded by people from southern Europe the way it was in the 1950s with the guest workers.  It is not something that works here.  Even in the United States migration has decreased enormously.  Giving people incentives to stay here would be a good idea.  It is not something the European Commission would be happy to hear but it would be better in the medium to longer term.</p><p>In terms of what we do about the long history of unemployment, Ireland needs something to break that and education is the best way of doing it.  It is very difficult to do it when there is no education mentality in the family or they believe it is useless.  More positive incentives such as better grants could be offered, but education is the only thing that breaks that vicious cycle in the family.</p></speech>

I am delighted that he was able to accept our invitation to address us today.  He is a welcome guest.  His address has been most informative and engaging for Members.  The problem of youth unemployment is raised regularly in the House, particularly by its youngest Member, Senator Kathryn Reilly.  I am glad the topic has been addressed, as it is one with which I am personally all too familiar as my native city of Waterford has the highest unemployment rate in the country at 22%.  It is disheartening to see far too many of our young people emigrating or the less fortunate slipping into the downward spiral of hopelessness in which so many of the unemployed find themselves.  It is the hope of all of us that the current Government programmes of assistance and general policy in this regard will sustain them until such time as we see growth again in the economy and the corresponding job creation.  We have all learned a great deal from Professor Pissarides and I know that many of the sentiments he has expressed will be relayed to the relevant Ministers in our debates with them in the coming weeks.  </p><p>I welcome to the Distinguished Visitors Gallery the Cypriot ambassador who has been present throughout the debate.  His Excellency is very welcome and we are delighted to see him here.  I also acknowledge the presence during the debate of Deputies Stephen Donnelly and Bernard J. Durkan who listened to the debate in the Visitors Gallery.</p><p>I acknowledge and thank Senator Sean D. Barrett and his staff for their assistance in arranging Professor Pissarides' visit.  I wish him well in his deliberations at Trinity College Dublin this evening which should prove most enlightening for all concerned.</p></speech>

In the current fiscal and economic context, the Government's task is not an easy one.  We must reduce public expenditure while maintaining the public services on which many citizens rely.  This is at a time when demand for those services is greater than ever, due to the economic downturn and demographic factors.  As we continue our efforts in this regard, we are acutely aware that nobody has the monopoly on good ideas and solutions.  I would like to thank the Seanad for giving me the opportunity to update the House on public expenditure and reform issues and I look forward to hearing Members' views and answering any questions they have.</p><p>I met the Committee of Public Accounts in a similar context last month and will meet the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform next week.  Ours is a reforming Government.  It is prepared to take the hard decisions, not merely to reduce expenditure, but also to build a sustainable public service for the future.  The Government has embarked on the most ambitious and comprehensive programme of reform in the history of the State.  No previous Government has taken on the scale and breadth of reform we are now driving.  Our task is considerable, but given the situation the Government inherited, change is our only option.  It is an essential part of the overall strategic response to the challenges we continue to face.</p><p>On its establishment last year, I stated that my Department had three key priorities: achieving the Government's fiscal targets; delivering public service reform; and supporting the Government's political reform agenda.  There is increasing evidence that our public finances are showing signs of improvement after a number of very difficult years.  All quantitative fiscal targets set under the terms of the EU-IMF programme, including the 2011 annual deficit target, have been met.  The Exchequer figures for the first ten months of this year confirm that we are on track as we aim to further reduce the deficit in our public finances.  Exchequer tax receipts are up both year-on-year and ahead of current profile.  Overall, tax receipts grew last year for the first time since 2007.  The improvement in the public finances has come about as a result of the difficult decisions that have been taken to reduce expenditure and increase revenue, and also through the return to economic growth in 2011 for the first time since 2007.</p><p>The budgetary adjustment process will present very large challenges to meet the firm commitment to reduce the deficit to below 3% of GDP by 2015.  This will require difficult choices to be made in all areas of public expenditure and to ensure that we remain on a credible path of budgetary adjustment.  The public service pay and pensions bill, at 35% of spending, will need to make a substantial contribution to meeting this fiscal challenge.  I have been clear in my ongoing dealings with public sector unions that, notwithstanding progress under Croke Park, difficult challenges lie ahead to reduce our spending in 2013 and beyond.  There is no doubt that additional productivity and cost extraction measures that were not envisaged under the current Croke Park deal will be required to ensure that the Government meets these commitments.</p><p>However, there is also awareness at both political and official levels that restoring the public finances to sustainability cannot come from consolidation alone.  For example, the new five-year capital framework, published last year, sets out a significant tranche of Exchequer investment of €17 billion out to 2016, and is designed to address critical infrastructure deficits, aid economic growth and provide much needed social infrastructure.  In order to complement the Exchequer capital framework, I announced a new Government stimulus initiative in July.  This initiative, a package of €2.25 billion, is largely predicated on the use of non-Exchequer sources of funding to support the first phase of a new PPP programme of projects in key areas of infrastructure.  There will also be investment through the Exchequer which will be funded from some of the proceeds from the sale of State assets and the new arrangement for the national lottery licence, which will help fund the recently announced children's hospital.</p> <p>The comprehensive review of expenditure, published last December, introduced a range of expenditure reforms to improve the budgetary process and enhance transparency and accountability.  As part of this process, a Bill to provide for medium-term expenditure management through the provision of multi-annual aggregate Government expenditure ceilings and the multi-annual ministerial expenditure ceilings was published in September.  This will facilitate the implementation into legislation of the medium-term expenditure framework and is one of our commitments under the EU IMF programme.  This new approach will set fixed and binding current expenditure ceilings for each ministerial Vote group over a rolling three-year period and makes clear, well in advance, the level of savings that need to be planned for in each Department, to ensure that the allocations are adhered to year after year.  </p><p> Economic growth will be a key contributor to recovery and in designing economic and budgetary policy we must be mindful of this.  Moving towards a balanced budgetary position is a necessity but it is not sufficient, in itself, for restoring the economy to sustainable growth and for securing our re-entry to the international financial markets to source our own financing.  With the need for strategic and balanced fiscal consolidation in mind, the Government is currently finalising the detailed measures underpinning the 2013 budget, which will be announced on Wednesday, 5 December.</p><p> The synergy between fiscal consolidation and reform is clear.  Reform can deliver real cost savings and efficiencies, particularly in the medium and longer terms.  At the same time, we must reform to allow us to continue to deliver public services in an environment of reduced budgets and staff numbers.  As I have said previously, reform is a key part of the overall strategic response to the crisis.  In this context, we are undertaking the most comprehensive reform of the public service since the State was founded.  We must work harder and with more flexibility than ever before and continue to do better with less.  The Government's ambitious public service reform plan was published in November last year.  Since then, effective structures to implement the plan have been put in place within my Department and across the public service.  The Cabinet committee on public service reform is driving the reform agenda at political level.  In particular, I am working closely with my colleague, Deputy Brian Hayes, the Minister of State with responsibility for public service reform, whose efforts and work I commend to the House.  </p><p> I established the reform and delivery office in my Department to drive and oversee the implementation of comprehensive change across the system and recruited an external, experienced individual from the private sector, who has considerable experience of change management, to lead that office.  In September, I published a statement on the progress being made in the implementation of the plan.  I would like to give the House a flavour of just some of the key areas of progress to date.  Public service staff numbers have been reduced to around 291,000, a reduction of some 29,000 from the 2008 peak of 320,000.  This is well within our year end ceiling of 294,400.  We plan to go further to reduce this number to 282,500 by the end of 2014.  </p><p> We are implementing a radical reform of the way in which public procurement is organised.  An external review published in September estimates that these reforms could yield potential savings in the range of &#8364;250 to &#8364;600 million annually.  This will involve the integration of procurement policy, strategy and operations, greater aggregation of purchasing, better spend analytics, and many other actions to transform our procurement model.  The reforms will take place over a three-year rolling period.  A chief procurement officer will shortly be appointed to lead this work, following an open competition.  </p><p> As part of a wider shared services strategy, in May, we approved the establishment of a human resource shared service centre for the Civil Service.  It is estimated that this will reduce human resource headcount by 17% and costs by 26% with annual net savings of &#8364;12.5 million.  The first Departments will transition to this shared service in the first quarter of 2013.  We have accelerated our plan for a pensions administration shared service and will integrate this with the human resources shared service.  We are developing a business case for a payroll shared service and commencing a baseline exercise for a banking and financial management shared service.  All of the work duplicated in human resource management, payroll, pensions administration across 16 and sometimes up to 40 different centres, will be consolidated into either one single centre or a small number of centres.</p><p> In July, we agreed a range of actions aimed at achieving a focused and integrated approach to external service delivery of non-core processes, namely, outsourcing.  A shortlist of potential major projects for priority implementation is being prepared and plans are being developed by the four main sectors of education, health, justice and local government.  In addition, all proposed new services across the public service will first be tested for their suitability for external service delivery before any approval to provide the service internally will be granted.  We want the public service to do what it is best at doing and not replicate services which would be better purchased from outside.  In April, we published the e-government strategy for 2012 to 2015, which builds on Ireland's strong recent performance in this area.  We have also published a cloud computing strategy - Ireland is among the first countries in the world to do so - and have set out plans for significant further data centre consolidation.  </p><p> The senior public service has been established to promote a more integrated public service and to strengthen its senior management and leadership capacity.  Significant reforms to the performance management and development system in the Civil Service have been agreed and will ensure the more effective management of performance.  We have launched the <i>irelandstat.gov</i>website, a pilot whole-of-government level performance measurement website which will allow the public to see how Ireland is performing across a range of indicators.  I urge Senators to look at that website and provide feedback on same while it is in pilot phase and before it goes live.  Progress is also being made on the Government's agency rationalisation programme.  This year, 47 out of the 48 measures set out in the public service reform plan will be completed on a legislative or an administrative basis, resulting in the rationalisation of 101 bodies.  In addition, critical reviews of other identified rationalisation projects are being progressed.  We have introduced a range of expenditure reforms to change the processes involved in allocating and assessing public expenditure to improve transparency and decision making.  These are just some examples of the progress we have achieved in under one year, as set out in the published report.  Along with the comprehensive suite of cross-cutting reforms, the reform and delivery office in my Department is also working with other Departments and sectors to drive the implementation of their own bespoke reform plans.</p><p> I would now like to turn to the Croke Park agreement which is, regrettably, much maligned and often misunderstood.  It is an essential element in enabling the comprehensive reforms that I have outlined - and more besides - that are taking place across the system.  More importantly, the agreement is supporting the continued delivery of public services where staff numbers and budgets have been significantly reduced.  In that context, I would point to what is happening in other countries right now.  This week there is a national strike in Greece and last weekend there was a national strike of all public servants in Spain.  The impact of such strikes, not only on the people who depend on public services but also on external investors' perceptions of countries, is significant.  All of this change happening in a climate of industrial peace in the public service.  The value of this is frequently overlooked in the public discourse about the Croke Park agreement.  As well as facilitating real change, I argue that the industrial peace and stability being delivered by the agreement is a valuable asset in terms of helping to restore our international reputation and our attractiveness as a location for would-be investors.</p><p> I do not propose to provide an exhaustive account of all that is being achieved under the agreement but I wish to stress that it is the Government's view that the agreement is working and is delivering on its objectives.  Real savings are being achieved in the Exchequer pay bill under this agreement.  Over the period 2009 to 2015, the Exchequer pay bill is on target to be reduced by &#8364;3.8 billion, or &#8364;3.3 billion net of expected increases in public service pension costs.</p> <p>The &#8364;500 million in additional pension costs for the people leaving has been factored in because these are people who have paid pension contributions for their whole working lives, up to 40 years or more.</p><p> While discussing the pay bill, we should recall that those working in the public service have already had two pay reductions, totalling, on average, 14% by way of the pension-related deduction and a further cut in pay introduced in 2010.  Salaries at the highest level have been reduced by up to 30% and capped at &#8364;200,000, still, I accept, a significant sum of money.  We have also reduced salaries for new entrants to the public service by a further 10%.</p><p> The Croke Park agreement has been and continues to be instrumental in facilitating reductions in expenditure.  Reports published by the implementation body show that, overall, almost &#8364;1.5 billion in pay and non-pay savings have been facilitated in the first two years of the agreement.  As I have noted, the reductions in the pay bill have been driven by reductions in staff numbers throughout the public service, down by approximately 29,000 on the peak number.  More than 17,000 staff have left the public service in first two years of the agreement, yet services have been maintained by and large and, in some cases, improved.</p><p> Members will recall the fears expressed earlier this year about the impact on public services of the expected retirement of 8,000 public servants.  They proved to be completely unfounded.  I may have mentioned in the House already that I remember when one news organisation asked me to be on stand-by on the night at the end of February as if, like the fears about the Y2K millennium bug, everything would stop.  That was because of the hype which had been built up, but we have had an orderly co-operative change and people are working harder and doing more, which should be acknowledged.  By and large, public servants are doing a good deal more.  Not everyone has bought into the change, but a significant proportion of public servants are working harder and delivering more.  The departure of such a large number of staff was managed successfully by management, staff and unions, with no interruption to services, a point worth recording.  The redeployment provisions of the agreement have been critical to ensure remaining staff resources are allocated to front-line areas where the need is greatest.  Some staff have moved 40 km from base without compensation or demur to meet gaps created by those who had retired.</p><p> The first comprehensive review of allowances paid to public servants has shown that what was created over decades will take time to resolve and that the disaggregation of allowances from core pay is not a simple task.  This is something the discussions at the Committee of Public Accounts is unveiling on a daily basis.  What some see as a simplistic process can be complicated.  This is something that is being and will continue to be addressed.  The Croke Park agreement allows public service employers to put challenging issues on the table and secure agreement in a time-bound process.  Two examples include the agreed standardisation of annual leave and paid sick leave arrangements.  For the first time we have applied public service-wide standards for different public service employees.  We did not have to apply the most generous allowances in the system to achieve this, which would have been the only solution in the past.  In fact, for most public servants, the new sick leave arrangements will mean that the maximum amount of paid sick leave to which they will be entitled will be halved, with an even greater cut for some.  If we had achieved the halving of sick leave entitlements after a protracted strike and a major public battle which would have been the norm in the past, it would have been regarded as a great achievement.  However, if one does it quietly through negotiation, it is taken as the norm.  We should understand what is being delivered.  Some people want conflict.  I am not afraid of conflict, but if I can avoid it and can deliver systems without it, I am certainly in favour of taking that route.  I expect the next steps to be undertaken in the allowances review will also be facilitated by the mechanism set out in the Croke Park agreement. </p><p> All of this is welcome progress, but we understand we have a way to travel in restoring order to the public finances.  The framework provided by the Croke Park agreement will continue to play an important role in the process.  However, we need to ramp up the scale and pace of delivery under which the agreement is advancing.  The Taoiseach and I met the implementation body last month to discuss this issue.  On foot of that engagement, revised action plans are being prepared urgently at sectoral level in conjunction with the unions.  They will set out proposals for extracting further cost savings and advancing key reforms.  The objective is to ensure we get the most out of the agreement in the period ahead.  It is my intention to publish the revised action plans when they are completed.</p><p> In tandem, real progress is being made on the Government's ambitious programme of political and legislative reform aimed at enhancing openness, transparency and accountability.  I commend the great work done in this House in that regard.  Last week the Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill was signed into law by the President.  This legislation will result in the most significant expansion in the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman in 30 years since the original legislation established the Ombudsman was passed.  Following Government approval earlier in the year, the legal drafting of the Protected Disclosures in the Public Interest Bill, the so-called whistleblowers Bill, is well advanced by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government.  I held discussions with the Parliamentary Counsel today because I have a raft of Bills which I am trying to push along.  She is looking for additional staff and we have promised the, but we need to have a <i>quid pro quo</i>.  I should not be admitting to all of this, but I am keen to get the whistleblowers Bill published and I am confident it will be published next year.</p></speech>

The general scheme has been published on my Department's website and submitted to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for legal drafting.  Following publication of the final report of the Mahon tribunal, I decided to examine how the existing legislative framework for ethics could be reformed to develop a single comprehensive legislative framework grounded on clear and comprehensive principles.  Rather than try to amend what is in place, I propose a more ambitious task of recasting the ethics legislation having regard to the work of all the tribunals and all that we have learned to make it a model of best practice.  This work is ongoing in the political and governmental reform unit in my Department.  This will involve, among other things, consolidation of existing legislation and amalgamation of other relevant legislation into a single framework, while examining the position in other jurisdiction to establish best practice.  I have no wish to reinvent the wheel.</p><p>Last week I announced Government approval for the priority drafting of a Bill to provide a comprehensive statutory framework for Oireachtas inquiries on matters of significant public importance.  For example, the Bill will enable the holding of inquiries into the banking crisis.  I have written to the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Finance and Public Expenditure and we have submitted the heads of the Bill to the committee.  It is and will continue to be my practice to submit the heads of a Bill to the relevant Oireachtas committee to get its observations before I move to drafting.  I have asked the committee to provide observations and understand it will try to work to an agenda that will enable me to have the Bill drafted before year end.  I realise this is ambitious, but that is what I wish to do.</p><p>A general scheme of the Bill on lobbying is being prepared by my Department and it is intended to bring the scheme to the Government as soon as possible.  The issue of lobbying is extraordinarily complicated because lobbying is a genuine activity and every citizen is entitled to lobby.  The trick is to create a legal framework such that lobbying will be done in a transparent, overt way, not in the Galway tent or analogous bodies.</p></speech>

We held an interesting seminar when I published the Bills earlier this year and there was a good dialogue.  I realise that many lobby groups, including the IFA and others, have concerns.  Those engaged in legitimate lobbying should have nothing to fear; it is those who engage in unknown lobbying that influences public policy behind closed doors or whisper into the ears of Ministers we wish to get at.  I look forward to the debate on that issue also.  Taken together, these measures represent the most fundamental reform platform and significant advancement in the pursuit of transparency and accountability in a long time.</p> <p>My overall message is that good progress is being made on reducing public expenditure and restoring Ireland to economic health.  Similarly, we are progressing well on the implementation of our ambitious programmes for public service and political reform.  However, the pace of implementation in every area needs to be stepped up.  Big challenges face us.  Public servants will have to be part of the solutions to those challenges.  I am confident they will be and that they will step up to the mark as they have done in the past.  We have the foundations in place, and we must push on with implementing the reform programme.  We must achieve our fiscal requirements and reform the structures of the State in a way that enables us to build a positive environment for enterprise and employment, for job creation and growth.  We must also ensure we build a society that takes care of the vulnerable and provides equal opportunities for growth and development for all citizens.  This will not be easy task but the Government is committed to reform, which is why we have created a bespoke Department for reform.  We are committed to rebuilding our country in the coming years.  I look forward to hearing the views of the House and responding to the concerns, observations and questions of Members.</p></speech>

Ní bhíonn sé ró-fhada as an áit seo agus tá sé tábhachtach go mbíonn sé istigh anseo sa Seanad.  The latest Exchequer figures show that the deficit for the first ten months of the year was €14 billion, compared with €22 billion for the same period last year.  While I acknowledge that the Government is reducing the deficit, the Minister claims to be reducing public expenditure, but in my view there is a difference.  It is a fact that current public expenditure is increasing this year over last year.  Capital programmes and the deficit have been cut.  It is a matter of serious concern.  We are increasing our spending for various reasons.  The main reason for the decline in the deficit is that the Government did not put more cash into the banks this year and we can defer the payment of the promissory note.  The tax returns for October are disappointing, with revenue at 11.4% below target, the third month out of four in which tax revenues have been below profile.  The current expenditure is €424 million over budget, even in an environment in which that current expenditure is increasing.  Health expenditure is €336 million over budget and social protection expenditure is €451 million over budget.  These are the main drivers of the overspend.  The Government has failed to implement measures promised in the budget to control health spending in particular, and it was rapped on the knuckles by the troika in this regard.</p><p>The November outturn will have a significant bearing on whether the Government meets its fiscal targets for this year.  It will affect the coming budget and its impact on citizens.  Capital spending is used to develop national infrastructure such as roads, hospitals and schools, as well as energy, communications and recreation infrastructure.  At the end of October there was an underspend of €336 million in the capital budget.  This is €336 million that the Minister has refused to spend or has not spent, which will cost jobs.  This comes on top of the severe reductions in capital expenditure which the Minister put forward as part of last year's budget and which were greater than the capital expenditure reductions forecast by the troika and contained in the IMF agreement.  The Minister says he is tied down by the troika or that he is obliged to follow the memorandum of understanding, yet he was able to renegotiate a reduction in capital expenditure because he did not want to take the decisions on the current side.  Capital expenditure is decreasing while current expenditure is increasing above the target.  This is having a detrimental and damaging effect on the economy.  The Government is literally starving the domestic economy of much needed spending.</p><p>The Minister says the Croke Park agreement is much maligned and misunderstood.  The Minister should reflect on the Labour Party's time in opposition, when it took a neutral approach to the Croke Park agreement when it was being negotiated by the then Government.  The Minister might look to the gang of eight in the Fine Gael Party who malign and, as the Minister says, misrepresent the Croke Park agreement in the media on a regular basis.  The Government needs to look at itself on this matter.</p><p>The success or otherwise of the agreement will be measured by a simple criterion: how much money will be saved in the Exchequer pay bill.  Much of the savings achieved to date have been from measures introduced by the previous Government.  The hallmark has been endless prevarication.  The Minister referred to the issue of sick leave.  That seemed to be an achievement.  However, while some of the changes were to be introduced administratively - I do not know whether this happened - legislation was to be brought forward to deal with the other aspect of the sick leave issue.  The Minister has not said when this legislation will be published.</p><p>The real situation with regard to the economy is that GDP was flat in the second quarter, while the general debt increased.  It is now over 100% - I suppose that is a projection - and there are fewer people at work.  The Government is not doing enough to reverse those sad economic trends; it is cutting capital expenditure and increasing current expenditure.  I disagree with the pension levy because this measure destroys job creation.  The Government should reverse the cuts to home insulation grants.</p><p>The Slane bypass in my constituency would cost only a fraction of the cut in the capital spend the Minister has put in place above and beyond what was agreed with the troika.  There is much hand-wringing about not having enough money, with people saying that Fianna Fáil did this and that.  The reality is that the Government cut the capital budget significantly above and beyond what is detailed in the troika agreement, with the result that major safety projects such as the Slane bypass cannot go ahead.  I agree there were planning issues.  The county council is currently looking at the planning issues, but the Government has not committed any funding because of the cuts in capital expenditure, while allowing current expenditure to increase all the time.</p><p>We welcome some of the progress on the reform agenda.  The Government talks a good game about openness, transparency and accountability, but I must mention today's Supreme Court judgment.  As a supporter of the &quot;Yes&quot; campaign I am pleased with that judgment because it is essential that the Government operates within the rules and spends its money within the rules of the Constitution.  I hope the judgment acts as a marker on Government arrogance.  The Government has taken things for granted.</p></speech>

There was supposed to be all kinds of reform of the Dáil and the Seanad but it has not happened.  The programme for Government promised that the Dáil would continue to sit during the Hallowe'en break.  It stated that the Hallowe'en break would no longer be taken.  Why was this promise put into the programme only to be ignored, as if it meant nothing?  Surely that programme for Government is a solemn commitment between two parties in the interests of the people and the country.  It seems that if something is inconvenient it can be moved away.  The talk is there but I am not sure about the walk.  Although we understand the difficulty for the Government, we believe more progress needs to be made.  I welcome some of the measures proposed by the Minister.  However, there are significant challenges and it is right that we raise these issues.  There is too much talk of everything going fine.

We are dealing with a crisis and it is always worth bearing in mind that Ireland is operating within the confines of a programme.  We do not have economic independence at present and we are not our own paymaster.  Unfortunately, we are operating at the behest of others.  The Government has responsibility for getting the country's house in order in respect of a crisis it did not create.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party were obliged to do this when they were in government in the 1980s and 1990s and they will do so again in the interests of the people.</p><p>There has been a great deal of discussion about the Croke Park agreement.  There are elements of it with which everyone has an issue.  However, is anyone in a position to offer an alternative to it which would ensure industrial peace?  Despite the difficulties we are experiencing, there has been an unprecedented period of industrial peace which is essential in ensuring competitiveness and efficient performance.  We are enjoying such a period which is largely down to the Croke Park agreement.</p><p>I commend the Minister and the Taoiseach for meeting the implementation body recently and encouraging the various stakeholders to fast-track reform.  Such reform is happening and a great deal of work is being done in various Departments and agencies in order to ensure the pace of such reform will be accelerated.  As the Minister rightly pointed out, it is estimated that by 2015 the ball-park figure for public sector pay savings will be €3.5 billion.  That will be a significant achievement.  As stated, it is being facilitated by the fact that we are in an extended period of industrial peace.  As a country, we must do our business differently and ensure the money we expend on behalf of the people is spent wisely.</p><p>I commend various Government Ministers for the initiatives they have taken.  Most recently, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government Reform announced significant local government reform.  As a result of what he is doing, in the region of €400 million in cost savings will be made at local government level.  In addition, there will be a reduction of 700 in the number of town and county councillors.  As a result, local government is going to work effectively on behalf of the people.  The Minister is responsible for what is the most significant reform of local government in the history of the State, for which he must be commended.  If he does nothing else during his five years in office other than spearheading the reform to which I refer, he will still have achieved a great deal.  Local government has not been working.  One of the Minister's predecessors introduced the Better Local Government legislation in 2002.  In my humble opinion, that legislation was bad for local government because it created an entire layer of middle management operatives and directors of services within local authorities which cost too much and were not effective.</p><p>Under the old system of local government, there was a county manager, a county secretary, a head of finance and a county engineer who ran the county councils.  Town councils were run by town clerks and their assistants.  I live in County Clare and in my local authority there are between seven and ten people at director of service level.  They are each paid in excess of €100,000 per annum, while the county manager is paid €150,000.  I have no intention of impugning their integrity and I am sure they are doing an exceptionally good job in difficult circumstances.  However, one must ask the question as to whether we require that level of bureaucracy within local authorities.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and his Government colleagues are determined that this matter will be dealt with and redundancy packages will be offered to between 500 and 600 senior local authority officials.  In addition, the number of regional authorities is going to be reduced from eight to three.  This means that there will be three effective regional authorities which will be based in populated areas but which will take a broad regional approach.  They will do the same work as that being done by the eight existing authorities.  They will be effective and efficient in their operation.  These are some of the changes, alterations and improvements taking place at local government level.</p><p>Senator Thomas Byrne referred to Seanad reform.

Can this be seen as a positive development in the context of multi-annual budgeting?  If it is such a development, will the savings that will accrue be rolled over?  I am aware, from the agencies with which I deal, of the importance of factoring this in.  If this is a positive, the Minister should accentuate it because it means that for Departments, the glass is half full rather than half empty.  This will allow for more creativity, innovation and strategic thinking in a climate where resources have been reduced.</p><p>I acknowledge the establishment of the procurement programme and look forward to the appointment of the procurement officer.  I also look forward to the reforms relating to whistleblowing and lobbying.  These reforms are exciting, particularly as they are important in making the connection between the State, its citizens and the Government much more transparent.</p><p>I wish to comment on performance indicators.  Such indicators are part of a natural, ordinary, day-to-day process which we must all undergo.  My performance indicator is whether the plays, etc., I put on receive good reviews and whether the theatre is full.  The Minister's performance indicator is whether he gains re-election when he goes before the people.  It is welcome that performance indicators are going to play such an integrated role in the context of the public service.</p><p>There are two issues I wish to raise.  The first relates to the public sector reform plan and, in particular, the Government's agency rationalisation programme.  The second relates to the leader's allowance given to Independent Senators and Deputies under the Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices) (Amendment) Act, 2001.  I will deal with the latter issue first.  </p><p>Will the Minister indicate whether he plans to amend the Act to which I refer in order that all Independent Members of the Oireachtas will have a statutory responsibility to provide detailed accounts of all donations and public funding they receive on an annual basis?</p> <p>We asked the Minister, Deputy Hogan, for this to be included in a previous Act and he said it came within the remit of the Minister's Department.</p><p>Between 25 February 2011 and the end of December of that year a total of €656,134 was paid out to Independent Members of both Houses.  I am one such Senator.  I receive a monthly stipend of €1,948 and use it well to do research and support my work as a parliamentarian.  I am not suggesting cutting it but I know the Minister has spoken publicly about clarifying the functions of this funding and said that it should be vouched.  I would like to hear his view on that issue.</p><p>On Hallowe'en night, the Minister issued the Government decision on the rationalisation of State agencies.  It is important to state I have no issue with the spirit of what he wants to achieve and I applaud him for the gains he is making and the leadership he is showing.  One of his stated ambitions is to create a less crowded administrative landscape, resulting in greater democratic accountability, less duplication of effort and clear lines of responsibility for the citizen.  Under the aegis of the Minister for Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan, and his Department a significant number of agencies and national cultural institutions have been under review.  I will not go into all of them; suffice to say that the intention to rationalise them cuts across some of those institutions' very existence and independence.  As the Minister has reported, considerable success in achieving increased efficiencies and shared services has been made.  These include the Irish Museum of Modern Art, the Crawford Art Gallery and the National Gallery of Ireland.  The process of consultation and co-operation between the Department and these cultural institutions has had a positive outcome and resulted in savings.  I also note that the Heritage Council will not be abolished or merged into the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  That is great news and I thank the Minister for it.</p><p>That brings me to the Government decision on the abolition of the boards of the National Library of Ireland and the National Museum of Ireland.  I know of the Minister's active involvement and interest in arts and culture.  His valuable support of the Wexford Festival Opera is to be recognised.  There is a strong and vibrant arts community in Wexford, not least stemming from the arts centre, as well as internationally well regarded writers such as Billy Roche, Colm Tóibín, Eoin Colfer and John Banville.  I know the Minister met some of my colleagues involved in the National Campaign for the Arts recently.  They were heartened and motivated by his interest in their area, for which I thank him.  What I am concerned about is the lack of any public evidence as to what the cost savings or increased efficiencies might be from abolishing the boards of these two august and important national cultural institutions, replacing them with one joint advisory council and bringing both of those institutions under the remit of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  I am concerned about employees' being moved from public servant status to civil servant status and the lack of a governance or board structure to protect those institutions' operational, strategic and programme autonomy.  I have no issue with board members' not being paid, as is the case for the board of the Abbey Theatre, but to have one board - or rather, an advisory council, which is of lower status - in charge of two completely different organisations and remits is troubling.  Why are two independent statutory cultural institutions being absorbed into the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht?  The only reason is to save money.</p><p>Will the Minister publish, if possible, the cost-saving facts and figures that led the Government to make a decision to abolish those boards?  Both institutions bookmark this very building, Leinster House.  I have no doubt that just as savings were achieved in respect of the Irish Museum of Modern Art in Kilmainham, the National Gallery of Ireland in Clare Street and the Crawford Art Gallery in Cork, our neighbours can find ways of saving money on security, storage, their finance departments and their human resources units while maintaining their statutory independence and protecting their programme independence.  What is proposed is a dismantling of the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997 for no apparent published gain.  As the Minister will know, it was the current President Michael D. Higgins, the Republic's first Minister with responsibility for culture, who sponsored and introduced this historic Act.  On 27 June of this year in this House, the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, said to me and other Members: &quot;Dismantling the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997 was never in my plan, nor was impinging on the arm's length principle.&quot;</p><p>I am happy to support the Minister in his drive for efficiencies and humbly request that he reconsider the dismantling of the National Cultural Institutions Act.  I ask him not to introduce amendments to that Act and not to waste the time of the Seanad trying to argue the case in this respect, in order that we can protect two vitally important national cultural institutions.  Yes, we should save money, but we should protect their independence.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-11-08a.149" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1172" speakername="Aideen Hayden" time="13:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012110800024#Y00200"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I support the comments of my colleague Senator Mac Conghail.  There is a tendency among all Departments, whether it is intentional, to centralise power unto themselves.  It is a bit like sucking everything back into the mothership.  When it comes to matters of culture, in particular, and matters in which independence of mind and creativity are involved, we need to be careful about removing independence from cultural institutions.</p><p>The Minister has a difficult portfolio.  Like my colleagues, I thought his speech, which set out the achievements his Department has had since it was set up, was very good.  I went through the programme for Government before I came here this evening and it was quite impressive to be able to tick so many of the boxes.  A number of points are worth bearing in mind.  Any government will be judged on the reform in which it engages - more, perhaps, than on any other single item.  This is despite the fact that the media seems to be more concerned about the Croke Park agreement.  I did a media search on this and was surprised by the amount of material that splurged forth, in comparison with the amount of material that came out on the reform agenda.  I found the level of what is nothing short of vilification of some of our public servants in the media - although not by all of the media, I hasten to add - quite worrying.  There is a certain attitude among some parts of the media that the public servants of this country are fair game.  It is an issue about which I have significant concern.  That attitude is reflected in the morale of some of our public servants.  People forget that in spite of all the difficulties this country is facing, we do not face the difficulties of Greece or some of our other European partners.  We are not facing into the winter worrying about whether we will have power shortages and so on.  It is easy to forget that a period of industrial unrest could overturn an awful lot of the good work that has been done in this country.  Some of the commentators on the Croke Park agreement and on the public servants of this country should pause before they conduct some of the conversations they tend to have about our public servants.</p><p>One concern I have relates to the changes in allowances for entrants to certain professions - although I can understand the reason for them - compared to the allowances and pay scales granted to those already in the profession.  For example, in the teaching profession there are significant differences between the salaries earned by new entrants and those earned by those who are already within the profession.  I know the reasons behind that, but I am concerned that we may create a two-tier public service - a pre-recession and a post-recession public service.  I am conscious of some studies done prior to the current recession that showed we do not have an excessive number of pubic servants and that the cost of the public service when compared to those of other OECD countries was, surprisingly, not excessive.  As a Government, we have significant cuts to make, but it is important not to undervalue the contribution of public servants and to be careful as we move forward that we do not create a two-tier public service.</p><p>Much has been made in the media of allowances for public servants.</p> <p>It was said that it was a bit of a quick solution from the previous Government to not deal with the difficulties around lower paid public servants.</p><p>I am reminded of perhaps a rather unpopular debate that took place in the British media around the expenses of politicians.  The entire debate centred on such and such a politician building a moat around his castle in the middle of nowhere, and someone else who was supporting three luxury apartments in a prestigious development in London.  What did not come across is that the reason all the abuse was happening was that there was not an adequate system of allowances within the UK political system.  The allowance system we have today was put in place because previous Governments – we all know who they are – were unwilling to face the issue of lower pay among certain grades of public servant.  It was easier to give an outdoor allowance, uniform allowance or one for walking around in the playground than to evaluate the real difficulty of low-paid public workers.  The Department is dealing with the issue.  I accept it will be a difficult obstacle to overcome.</p><p>A certain amount has been said about the significant successes of the Croke Park agreement.</p></speech>

It is very easy to gloss over the kind of work practice changes the Minister outlined on rostering and holidays.  However, there are wider issues to consider in the public service, such as shared services.  Ten years ago the idea that a Department or other public service body would share a service was completely anathema.  Each individual body was a separate fiefdom or kingdom.  We have had a significant change of attitude within the public service and that cannot be underestimated.</p><p>I know I am up against the clock.  It is amazing how time flies in this House.  One issue I wish to bring to the Minister’s attention in the remaining time relates to tendering for public contracts.  It has come to my attention that a lot of middle range companies have been pushed out of tendering processes for State contracts because they do not carry sufficient amounts of professional indemnity insurance, for example, or other types of insurance.  It is a matter of concern to me and to a number of other people to whom I have spoken that we have what are, in effect, restrictive practices which ensure that only the top and largest companies are able to tender for public contracts.  I urge the Minister to examine the matter.</p><p>The second issue on which I would like an update relates to the accountability of public servants.  Under the programme for Government we committed to improve the accountability of public servants, in particular to changing the recruitment practices for public servants to ensure that the best and brightest from outside the public service are brought within it.  If the Minister has time I would like him to deal with the issue.</p></speech>

As was the case with the discussion on the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012, I assure him of the support of this side of the House for his vital reform agenda.</p><p>The Minister referred to sick leave arrangements.  ISME provided information to the effect that three days per year are lost in small enterprises and six in medium enterprises compared with 12 days in the public sector.  It used the statistics to criticise the Minister’s colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton.  I agree with the point made by the Minister that tackling the sick pay problem is important.  I also fully support him on lobbying.  I will return to the issue in due course.</p><p>Such reform as the Minister is undertaking is an international task.  An interesting book was written on the subject last year by Vito Tanzi from the IMF and the University of Cambridge.  Many countries are facing debt-to-GDP ratios of 120%.  The issue with which the Minister is dealing has an international dimension, from which I hope he derives support.  He could give lectures as well as receive them because we have allowed Government expenditure and an entitlement culture to get out of control in many areas.  Tanzi mentioned that strongly.  When one adds up the entitlements and they exceed the tax capacity of the country and its capacity to borrow and the country is required to go broke, we must examine the culture.  The matter was addressed a long time ago by a previous Government in the publication, A Better Way to Plan the Nation’s Finances.  I welcome the Minister’s reforms, including the Fiscal Responsibility Bill and other legislation which was enacted last year.  We look forward to the imminent Bill sponsored by the Minister coming to the House.</p><p>We must examine our instruments and targets.  For example, which health programmes make people healthier and which poverty alleviation programmes score well on the alleviation of poverty.  The Department has a crucial role to play in that regard.  Departments grow up as independent republics with the object of maximising their own budgets.  When we add up all the maximised budgets it is more than this country can afford, which is part of the restructuring of the entire operation we must now attempt.  That is what the Dáil and Seanad were elected to do.  It is difficult.  The second half of a marathon is always much more trying than the first half.</p><p>We have a bureaucracy problem.  According to an bord snip the higher echelons of the public service grew by 17%.  That was three to four times higher than the increase in the number of public servants as a whole.  That is the scandal that results from bureaucrats maximising their budgets.</p><p>The previous occupant of the chair in which the Minister is sitting was the Nobel Prize winner in economics.</p></speech>

I refer to Professor Christopher Pissarides from Cyprus and the London School of Economics.  He had interesting ideas.  We must send the Minister the transcript of what he said on labour market interventions.  He suggested that social welfare payments should be accompanied by something other than just money.  Possible options are half-time jobs or trying to slot those people into jobs to cover maternity leave.  He suggested that just giving people money and leaving it to them to solve the problem will not work.</p><p>I stress those two issues because health and social welfare are the two spending Departments and we need new thinking in them.  There has been a welcome in this House for the Minister, Deputy Reilly’s goal of abolishing the HSE and substituting competing health insurance companies.  It is a huge task to accomplish within three years.  I worry about some of the legislation that still embodies old thinking.  It seems that the new health insurance legislation is designed to protect VHI rather than to promote genuine efficiencies in the health service.  In the Milliman report on VHI it is outlined that a treatment takes 11.6 days in this country compared to best international practice of 3.7 days.  That is €1,000 a night to either the health insurance companies or the Department of Health to keep people in hospital for far longer than is necessary.</p><p>Reference was made to the McLaughlin report by Senator Conway.  It did show that there are too many directors of service, county managers and layers of management.  There is a problem in many sectors of education as well.  I refer to people being taken out of the classroom which is what they were recruited to do.  Giving them managerial titles and relieving them of teaching duties is not a good idea.</p><p>We must compare all the alternatives in order to reach our targets.  We must tackle the interest groups.  The most scandalous example of that was the control by the banks over the economy on 30 September 2008.  That is the most blatant example relative to GDP which took €64 billion out of this country.  An interesting article was written by two retired civil servants from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Pat Mangan and John Lumsden, on the need for a devil’s advocate or contrarian culture within Departments to challenge programmes and not to just close ranks and promote them.</p><p>Rent seeking, regulatory capture and lobbying were features of the economy that got us into the situation we have described.  One of the other points mentioned by Tanzi is the complexity of a tax system and the existence of tax loopholes.</p> <p>There is no major difference from the point of view of Parliament between tax evasion and tax avoidance other than that tax avoidance has a large numbers of lawyers and accountants involved.  It takes vast amounts of money out of the Exchequer, distorts the efficiency of the economy because increasingly more so-called entrepreneurship is spent on tax avoidance, and undermines the public sector.  If we had a simple tax system from which there were no deductions and allowances but one simply pays one's tax it would be an immense step forward.</p><p>Is there a case for integrating the means testing process into the Revenue Commissioners rather than having a myriad of agencies involved?  We should try to simplify the art of taking money from people with above average incomes and give it to those on lower incomes.</p><p>The Minister's legislation on lobbying will be important, and I would not back off on it.  Lobbying for any purpose is an attempt by people to get their hands on Exchequer moneys.  They will always believe the causes are worthwhile but when the Exchequer is empty we have to look askance at some of that behaviour.  Has too much time been spent by Irish agriculture on lobbying and not enough time paying attention to consumers?  They get the chance to pay attention to consumers when the milk quotas end.  The construction industry started off as a highly successful lobbyist and ended up as the producer of the most expensive houses and the most rapid house price rise one would find anywhere.  It is a pity it did not concentrate on running its day to day business and leave people in the Galway tent and those in other places alone.</p><p>Could we hear from the Comptroller and Auditor General before disasters occur?  Could he tip off the Minister when his research indicates that if something does not happen in an area we will have inquiries by Deputy John McGuinness and company who will try to investigate after the event?  We should not wait for the disaster to occur.  We should have an advance warning system, and the Minister's Department and the Comptroller and Auditor General might link up on that.</p><p>There is a huge job of reform to be done in this area and to extend Senator Byrne's Hallowe'en metaphor, the more of it, the merrier.  We need this reform, and it must be fundamental.  The control of lobbyists and regulatory capture is an international problem.  It is a huge expense to taxpayers, and we do not have the money.</p></speech>

In terms of public sector reform I will focus on the issue of public sector pay and pensions.  The Minister knows well how Sinn Féin feels about this issue having listened to my colleague in the Dáil, Deputy Mary Lou McDonald.  We believe there is a need to reform the public sector pension system but we disagree fundamentally on the way it must be done.  It should be done by capping those on the higher end of the scale.  Former Ministers and senior civil servants are receiving shamefully high annual pension payments and an elected MEP is still in receipt of a ministerial pension of over €70,000.  One of the former leaders of Fine Gael receives a pension of €95,000 plus a salary for his role in the IBRC.  A former Labour Party leader receives an annual pension of €120,000 as well as his fee as a public interest director in AIB.  A former Secretary General in the Department of the Taoiseach gets a pension of €142,000, yet the majority of public sector pensions are €30,000 a year or less.</p><p>Despite the promise of some sort of democratic revolution there is still a circle of people at the top of the public sector when it comes to pay and pension entitlements.  The Taoiseach recently told the Dáil that there is a legal impediment to introducing a levy to recoup some of the super pension payments paid from the public purse.  Can we see some of that legal advice on the reason for that, given what he told the Dáil recently?  </p><p>The Government has introduced a levy on public sector pensions over €100,000.  If introduced, Sinn Féin's Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Amendment) Bill 2012 would increase public service pension levy rates for retired public servants in receipt of excessive pensions.  We believe that cutting the income of lower middle income workers in the public sector is unfair and it is not economically guided in the right direction.  Will the Government quality proof the forthcoming budget?  The Minister might discuss that when replying.</p><p>Sinn Féin introduced two Bills earlier this year, a Bill that would appeal Article 70 of the local government superannuation consolidation scheme, and the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Amendment) Bill mentioned earlier.  That would give legal effect to a number of specific demands regarding public sector pay, pensions and allowances.  I will not go into the detail of them as my time is limited but those legislative measures are the approach we believe should be taken on pay and pensions.  The Government should cut from the top, share the burden, and create a more sustainable and fair system.</p></speech>

I will give the House the exact figure.  The underlying spending position at the end of October, which are the most recent figures we published, when adjusted for the shortfall on PRSI receipts as I explained at the beginning of the year, was a shortfall of €289 million.  Social welfare is paid from the social welfare insurance and because social welfare receipts were down, and PRSI receipts are an appropriation-in-aid, they are replaced by a voted sum, therefore, there is no additional expenditure.  Instead of paying it through PRSI it is paid through taxation.  Most people would believe both PRSI and general taxation are one and the same but it is an accounting issue.  A total of €289 million of the expenditure on social welfare is explained by that and I will explain that repeatedly for those who want to hear it.  The commutative underspend in October is €200 million.  Net voted expenditure to mid-October was €88 million over profile, that is €88 million out of the billions of euro we spend, €424 million of net current expenditure offset by the €336 million underspend on capital.  That was the point Senator Byrne was making.</p><p>It is my intention to keep as much control as I can on expenditure.  There are real pressures.  We have real pressure points in the health and social welfare areas.  In the education area we have real pressure points in terms of demographic.  We have remarkable control of expenditure in a diminishing profile on the basis of the figures I just outlined.</p><p>I welcome Senator Byrne back to the Chamber.  The Senator said we were rapped on the knuckles by the troika.  I assure the Deputy no such thing happened.  The leader of the management group from the troika, István Székely from the European Commission, said that he had never worked on a better programme, never dealt with more compliance, never dealt with people in more control than those in Ireland, and that we were a model for that.  All 160 very difficult legislative commitments to fiscal management were achieved.  That is a simple fact, and we should acknowledge it.  None of these are easy, and I commend the Irish people in that regard.</p><p>In terms of the underspend on the capital, I am not putting any breaks on the capital expenditure.  That is the way it is panning out.  Specifically, there is some underspend in the water services division in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p> <p>I have asked for that to be accelerated because I want spend on the capital side as it is important.  It is not the totality of expenditure on the capital side.  To address that issue, Members will recall I announced a stimulus package of &#8364;2.25 billion earlier this year.  We are working towards that, hoping that contracts for the first grouping of schools will be available shortly.  We are driving ahead with all these agenda items to augment as best we can the very scarce capital resources we have.  I am in direct discussions with the European Investment Bank and private sector investment to supplement and leverage the income we are going to get for the sale of State assets next year.</p><p> Senator Byrne and others referred to the Croke Park agreement.  In my judgment it is working and I welcome the Senator&#8217;s support for it.  Last year we had the first growth of gross domestic product in four years.  While this year&#8217;s growth will be less than the 1.2% expected, probably at 0.8%, we are unique in the European Union in having growth.  As an open trading country, we are extraordinarily vulnerable to the economic climate of our trading partners.  We hope there will be further growth with the tangible growth now seen in the US market.</p><p> If the most egregious failure we have in the reform agenda is the Oireachtas not sitting during the Hallowe'en break, I consider my job well done.  My Fine Gael colleague instanced the local government reform package.  What I am doing is part of the set while other Ministers have their own reform agendas.  The local government reform agenda is a case in point.  It is ambitious, ground-breaking and will be good.  It will rebalance power between the elected and the administrative in local authorities.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, has halved the number of vocational education committees and consolidated them.  None of these programmes is easy.  One point I have noticed since taking office is that we are very resistant to change and we love the <i>status quo</i>.  Everyone advocates change for someone else but there is something intrinsically valuable in what we do that cannot be changed.</p></speech>

It will be a three-year horizon.  With the new Estimates process I am producing, it will not simply be the case of there is the voted amount for this purpose but what is the expected outcome for that.  It will not simply take account of whether the money was spent but what was got for it.  That level of accountability will be very useful to the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p><p>We have published the three-year framework of expenditure in both capital and current as well as the comprehensive review of expenditure.  All the policy instruments to reduce expenditure are in the public domain.  I have written to the Chairmen of every sectoral committee to the effect that they should be involved in this process of deciding spending.  It should not be a budget day announcement.  People need to be involved in discussing the various options and consequences of budgetary measures.  It is very difficult to change the culture and getting the Opposition to be part of finding a solution.  I would be exactly the same if I were in opposition asking why I should be part of finding the solution because the hard decisions are for someone else.  If one wants to argue for Parliament having the authority, then it must exercise the powers it has.</p></speech>

On the merger of the National Archives and Irish Manuscripts Commission into the National Library, in order to achieve the greatest possible savings and efficiencies, it was decided that these rationalisation measures would be best implemented by deploying the existing National Archives governance model to the National Library and the National Museum.  This will be put into effect on an administrative basis pending enactment of enabling legislation.  The idea is to get the best synergies we have.  Anything we do in the area of change can be undone if it is not working.  It is hard work to bring agencies together.  There is a view that if we keep our heads down, they will not come at us.  We need to get those synergies and revitalisation.  The overall savings in this process are small.  As I indicated in the published programme last year, it would only come to €20 million.</p></speech>

If further changes are necessary, we will deal with that in due course.  There are people still saying, “Burn the quangos”.  The bulk of these non-governmental organisations, however, are the agencies such as IDA Ireland, the Environmental Protection Agency and Bord Iascaigh Mhara, essential agencies which should be independent of line Departments as they are oversight agencies or agencies that sell Ireland.  That is why when we drill down, the number of those we can actually do away with it is small.  That is why the savings are not significant.</p><p>I am reviewing the leaders’ allowance in so far as it is paid to political parties.  I heard a debate in the other House on this recently.  When Fine Gael and the Labour Party were last in government, we were determined to break the link between business and politics.  One can see how intrusive that is in the political system in the United States when during the last presidential election the candidates spent $6 billion and when one has super packs funding political parties to a vulgar extent.</p> <p>While we have not got to that level, we did have significant business interaction with politics.

It is ongoing with an inquiry into allowances.  While it is all simple to understand on the face of it, again, it is another case of drilling down and discovering it is not so easy.

One cannot turn around and say because one is paid through an allowance, one does not get a big chunk of pay, but if one is paid through a sectorial agreement, one does.  We are working on this issue.  My officials have done extraordinary work on it, for which I commend them.</p><p>Senator Aideen Hayden raised the matter of differences in pay for new entrants.  People speak of two tiers in teachers’ pay scales, yet there have always been different levels owing to incremental pay scales.  We have taken away an allowance for having the qualification they needed in the first place.  It is an anomaly that a teacher received an allowance for having a basic degree when one could not get the job without it.</p></speech>

The starting pay of a teacher is €32,000.  When compared to the starting pay of other graduate entrants in other professions, it is not a bad rate.  Added to this, those affected most by the downturn are those who bought a house during the boom who are up to their oxters in debt that will never be redeemed, not new entrants looking to buy a house now.  The former are the ones with crucifying mortgages on houses which are worth half of what they paid for them and often are unsuited to their family circumstances.  The 35 to 45 year old category is the one on which we need to focus.</p><p>I have asked for a mechanism to be put in place to remove difficulties for small and medium-sized enterprises involved in public procurement processes.  With recruitment, when I took office, one of my first actions was to change the top level appointments committee, TLAC, which met with some resistance.  There is now a majority of non-civil servants, with an external chairman and every interview board has an external majority.  By the way, the TLAC is very willing to discuss its work with the Seanad.</p><p>Senator Sean D. Barrett spoke about the control of public expenditure and the entitlement culture.  I understand this, but it is extremely difficult to square the circle.  We are cutting money, reducing numbers and providing more services for more people because of demand.  There are more medical cards, more children in school and more elderly persons, but we are providing services with fewer resources.  Squaring that circle and keeping industrial peace are a challenge.  The focus will be on outcomes.</p></speech>

There is a complexity to the public service.  When I was in the Department of Health years ago, we actually did not have a proper child support system in place.  Now, we have specialists who interview children in Garda stations.</p><p>Senator Kathryn Reilly spoke about public service reform and pensions.  There is a simplistic view that we can simply levy pensioners over a certain level.  I examined the issue and wanted to bring forward financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI-style legislation to take back a significant proportion of the pensions of individuals, particularly those who may not have performed as well they should have in recent times and left with large pensions.  I brought it forward and top-sliced 20% - Sinn Féin stated we should only top-slice 10% - for pensioners with pensions over €100,000.  I needed the legislation to be robust.  I am not interested in tokenism that will have me down in the High Court with the legislation falling.  First, the measure must be related to the financial emergency and, therefore, have sufficient take to justify it.  Second, it must have reasonably broad application.  One cannot simply say A and B must pay extra.  This is careful and delicate work, to which we need to bring fairness.  I can assure the Senator that I will work might and main to ensure the budget is fair.</p> <p>Two minutes should be more than sufficient to ask a question.  I will call Senator O'Neill first, and then Senators Walsh and Gilroy.  We will take those first three.</p></speech>

I knew he was a doer and in his short time in the Department, we have seen the changes, reforms and savings he has achieved.</p><p>I have issues with the moratorium in recruitment in the public service, especially in local government.  In consultation with his colleagues, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, and the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, would he consider providing a community employment scheme to help local authorities provide outdoor services in the context of the disproportionate amount of local authority outdoor staff who have retired under the Croke Park agreement and other agreements?  Outdoor services are what citizens see as their service from the local authority.  Staff sit in offices and provide services to the local community, but it is the outdoor staff who are seen working on the ground giving the service.</p><p>Since the downturn in the economy, one of the biggest changes has been in the construction sector, with apprenticeships for young people.  Years ago, local authorities used to take on apprentices.  I ask the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, consider providing on a cost-neutral basis for each local authority to be given a mandate to take on apprentices in order that young people could be trained, whether as plumbers, carpenters or block-layers, because there is no training available for them.</p></speech>

In the past few days two elements of child care have come to my attention at board level.  The first will be familiar to Senators.  It is the one year free pre-school child care scheme for children under four years.  The Government proposes to introduce a limit insisting on a minimum of eight eligible children in a facility as a cost-saving measure.  It is all about money.</p></speech>

In the same area special needs children who receive a subvention for attending child care facilities will have their funding cut-off at 15 years.

Many staff are being recruited to the public service, particularly in the education sector, to fill gaps, but I want to avoid agency work, particularly in the health service.  The Senator specifically mentioned outdoor staff in the local authority sphere and made valid points.  I know that the Minister for Social Protection has views on the matter, too.  There must be a balance struck because one cannot replace local government workers with people from community employment schemes because of union issues and so on.  I heard what the Senator said in this regard and his comments are valid.  </p><p>Most of Senator Jim Walsh's questions were about expenditure, including the level of expenditure and capital expenditure.  All of his questions will be answered if he accesses the departmental website. </p><p>Senator John Gilroy asked about reform and the legislative framework.  The first piece of legislation will be on committees of inquiries.  I hope to publish it during the session, but that will be hard to do, as it depends on how quickly it is dealt with by the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.  I have spoken to its Chairman and there is cross-party support for the legislation.  </p><p>I pay tribute to Senator David Norris's record which is exemplary in terms of the issues he has spent a lifetime advancing.  Ireland, generally, would be a worse and less equal place without his sterling contribution to public affairs and public life.  I regret that he finds himself in such a position - I do not think anybody expects to be enriched by such a contribution - but to be impoverished is unacceptable.  I am mindful, however, of his very strong and well made points.</p><p>Senator Lorraine Higgins asked questions on Garda vetting, but they are matters for the Department of Justice and Equality.  The same applies to Senator Paschal Mooney's questions.  Everything comes within the remit of my Department, but I cannot be the Minister responsible for everybody else's Department.  As Senators can see from my portfolio, I am responsible for enough.</p></speech>

The Government proposes to introduce a limit insisting on a minimum of eight eligible children in a facility as a cost-saving measure.  It is all about money.</p></speech>

I regret that this has happened, but it is a fact which we must face.  This is an important day for Seanad Éireann.  It shows we can play a significant role in the public life of the country.  On many occasions I wished to raised items under Standing Order 30, but not once was it accepted, including the occasion of the national strike.  It was simultaneously ruled out of order in the Seanad while it was accepted in the Dáil.  Interestingly, we have had the reverse of that situation today.  I spoke to some members of the Technical Group because of my concern about the possible impact of this decision on the children's rights referendum and they tabled a motion under private notice questions, which was ruled out of order.  They also tabled a motion under Standing Order 32, which was ruled out of order.  This is the only Chamber in which this issue will be discussed.</p><p>This is a very significant day.  The Supreme Court made a unanimous decision which overturned last Thursday's decision by Mr. Justice Kearns on a matter raised in the High Court by an Irish citizen.  It is urgent that we discuss this issue.</p><p>Obviously mistakes were made.  I think they were made with good intention.  It is very significant that the court held that the substance of the referendum was not to be affected by this ruling.  I believe the referendum must go ahead and should go ahead.  I hope the vast majority will support the referendum.  There is no question or doubt that it is a serious matter when the Supreme Court decides unanimously that the Government behaved illegally.  I do not believe it did so intentionally but there is a temptation in the preparation of this type of leaflet to do so.  In previous referenda on which I have taken various sides, I have felt that different Governments have displayed this tendency to put in material.  It is almost an irresistible temptation.  </p><p>Ms Justice Finlay Geoghegan of the Referendum Commission has behaved impeccably.  The Referendum Commission has been technically accurate and has brought equality in publishing all the information.  That is an important point because it means the public has been given access to information which is 100% accurate.  Leaflets were sent out by a Department which contained a mis-statement, which was one of the findings of the court.  That mis-statement was that certain actions and trends continued.  That implied that they had already existed previously.  That was inaccurate.  I think every ninny in this country knew that.  I certainly knew it.  I was astonished to hear somebody foolish, because there are foolish people on both sides, saying that nothing will be changed by the referendum.  If nothing was to be changed by the referendum, why in God's name would one have it?  Of course, things will change and they will change for the better for children.  That is the reason that it is so important that this referendum should be passed.</p><p>It is improper for a Government to use State funding to promote one cause or the other and the Supreme Court isolated a number of instances where it felt this is what had happened.  However, it gave only a partial judgment today.  That is also interesting because it did not reserve judgment completely.  Its judgment found the Government to be in error, but it assumed, correctly in my opinion, that the Government would immediately rectify that and it acted promptly to remove the website.  It is impossible to recall all the leaflets.</p><p>We have a track record in this regard.  Under the Referendum Act 1994, a citizen has a right to impugn the result of a referendum if he or she feels it is inappropriate by making a referendum petition to the High Court.  This was done after the divorce referendum.  A distinguished former Member of this House, Mr. Des Hanafin, whom I remember well and with affection although I differed with him on many issues, impugned the result of the divorce referendum using this mechanism of a petition to the High Court.  At the High Court hearing, it was held that misleading information had been supplied to the public in that instance but the court held it did not significantly affect the outcome of the referendum.  I believe the referendum will go ahead.  It is important that Seanad Éireann offers the opportunity to the Minister to indicate to the Irish public that it will go ahead.  She is perfectly entitled to argue the merits of the case, which I hope she will.  One of the problems in sustaining this kind of petition is that one must show that the outcome was affected.  Clearly a very large number of people had the intention of voting in favour of the referendum.  In my opinion the only thing that is likely to be shown is that declined as a result of what has happened today.</p><p>Mistakes have been made on both sides.  I believe this is a genuine error and that the Government will act as speedily as possible to redress it.  It has already started to do so and the referendum will go ahead.  I believe and hope that it will be won.  I have indicated the mistakes that were made by one side, but one must accept that the majority of the Irish electorate are sensible, intelligent people and that is another test that was applied in the Hanafin case.  It was found that one ought to automatically assume the capacity of the electorate to sort matters out for themselves.  I have listened to every radio programme about the referendum and practically everybody said they had not bothered to read the documents yet.  I doubt if the documents had that much impact.  One must be honest in public life.  I admit that mistakes were made by the side I support but they were made on the other side as well.  I wish to state my horror at what I saw on television on Monday night.  I congratulate the Minister for her very reasonable attempt to defend the position against a tide of demagoguery and mis-statement.</p> <p>First, it was suggested that the loving homes of good parents in this country would have their front doors battered in and the so-called "austerity police" - a new title that has been invented maliciously for this purpose - would take children away to a recently refurbished Letterfrack where they could be tortured.  Second, we heard the appalling, disgraceful and contemptible slur that foster parents get involved in fostering to get a €325 payment.  The third and perhaps most insidious suggestion was that the so-called Roscommon incest case - as one cannot name those involved, one has to use such a title and I emphasise that the person who made this allegation used that title as well - was the best argument in defence of a "No" vote.  As the Minister knows, it is the best argument in favour of a "Yes" vote.  To say otherwise is a perversion of the truth of the most malignant kind.  Members will remember the case in question, in which parents sexually and physically abused their own children over a lengthy period of time.  When the State attempted to intervene, it was hindered by people who may have been misguided but the results of whose actions were evil beyond belief.  They assisted the family in question and harassed the organs of the State which were trying to protect those children.  For three years or so, they were subjected to another continuing hell.  That would not have happened if this referendum had been passed at that time.  As somebody who cares about children and the welfare of all our citizens, I hope we will pass the referendum next Saturday despite this mess.  I will be out at the crack of dawn to vote for it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-11-08a.301" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012110800032#GG00400"><p>I thank Senator Norris.  I want to start by calling for the focus to be kept on the substance of the amendment that is being put to the people two days from now, the primary objective of which is the protection of children.  When we debated the Thirty-First Amendment of the Constitution (Children) Bill 2012 in this House at the beginning of last month, it was clear that there was great unanimity and a strong sense of purpose about the achievement of positive constitutional change for children.  As legislators, we should not lose sight of that in the crucial final hours before the people have their say.  The contributions to last month's debate that were made by Members of this House were striking in their depth of commitment.  Senators were forceful in their determination to work for the right outcome for children through the proposed constitutional change.  I urge all Senators to maintain their focus on the enduring prize that the proposed amendment represents for the rights and protections of children.  They should not let this be overshadowed by today's ruling.</p><p>  When I addressed the House at the start of the Second Stage debate on the Bill, I said that as legislators we were giving the entire voting public a rare opportunity to look at how we view children in society and how that view is reflected in the Constitution.  I noted that the Bill was giving this generation an opportunity to send an enduring positive message to future generations that we place the protection and welfare of children among the highest values of our society.  Few changes matter as much as this one.  Most of what we do in these Houses is about the issues of the day.  By its nature, legislation has to be about delivering for the needs and problems of today.  Constitutional change goes far beyond that in terms of the imprint it puts on values for upcoming generations.  This referendum gives us a rare and historic opportunity.  I know from the cross-party support the amendment has been given, and the unprecedented endorsement it has received from civil society groups across the broadest of spectrums, that when the choice is carefully considered, we will not want the position whereby children are virtually invisible in the Constitution to endure.</p><p>  The conflicting claims regarding the amendment need to be subjected to objective scrutiny before we arrive at our decision on Saturday.  The Constitution rightly recognises the centrality of the family and the special position of parents in the care and upbringing of their children.  This is guaranteed by the Constitution under Articles 41 and 42.  I would like to make it absolutely clear that the referendum will not alter this position.  As it makes no change to Article 41, it does not remove or diminish the recognition given to the family under the Constitution.  Equally, it does not remove or alter the rights and duties of parents under the Constitution to provide, in accordance with their means, for the education and care of their children.  Unfortunately, exceptional cases arise where some children do not have a safe and nurturing family life.  Hard and sometimes awful experience has taught us that we need to be clear in affirming the rights of these children to be protected.  We also need to provide for the possibility of adoption for children in long-term foster care and a second chance for them to have a loving family that protects their safety and welfare.</p><p>  I urge everybody to read the actual proposed wording of the article.  While it is drafted in constitutional language, it is only four sections long.  The stability treaty, by contrast, was 20 pages long.  I am sure the clear purpose of this amendment will come shining through to those who read it.  I encourage people not to be distracted from the crucial issue of considering the substance of the proposed constitutional change.  I remind those who are seeking further factual information that a considerable amount of detail is available from the Referendum Commission.  I remind Senators that the Referendum Commission has engaged in a substantial information campaign that has not been the subject of any objections.  The four main changes proposed in the referendum are explained on the commission's dedicated website, <i>referendum2012.ie</i>, and in its booklet, which was delivered to every home.  These changes, as explained by the commission, relate to the following: an explicit obligation to protect and vindicate rights of children; State intervention if parents fail in their duty; adoption; and the best interests and views of the child.  The chairperson of the independent Referendum Commission answered questions on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; about the referendum and provided considerable information of a factual nature.  She confirmed that no change to Article 41 of the Constitution, or to the current constitutional protections afforded to the family and parental rights, is proposed.  She said that the view of the Referendum Commission is that parents will not take a back seat to the State if this referendum is passed.  She confirmed there is no link between the referendum and the UN convention on children's rights and that the convention will not be given any constitutional standing.</p><p>  The Government fully respects this morning's Supreme Court ruling and is complying fully with it.  We moved immediately to act on the ruling in terms of the distribution and publication of material.  In addressing the ruling, I stress that we do not have the detailed judgments from each of the five judges.  We have the short ruling that was delivered by the Chief Justice on behalf of the court at 11 a.m., in which she said that the individual judgments would be delivered on 11 December.  I emphasise that my Department acted in good faith and with the best intentions to ensure the material complied with the McKenna principles.  The provision of public information by the Government has been undertaken in good faith at all times, based on the prevailing view of what is permitted by the McKenna judgment.  The McKenna case found against the then Government's funding of a publicity campaign that was explicitly designed to advocate a &quot;Yes&quot; vote.  In her 1995 judgment in that case, the current Chief Justice, Mrs. Justice Susan Denham, said the McKenna principles do &quot;not infringe upon the right .... of the Government to give information, to clarify situations, or to give explanations and deal with unforeseen matters and emergencies.&quot;</p><p>  The Government initiated this proposed amendment and received the unanimous support of the Oireachtas in putting the amendment to the people.  In doing so, there is a duty to provide explanations and information which can be understood by members of the public.  Previous referendums have been criticised because of a perception that inadequate information was available to the public.  In the intervening period since the McKenna principles were first enunciated, different Governments have sought to discharge their obligations to provide information and explanations for citizens in previous referendums through the use of websites, leaflets, booklets and advertisements.</p> <p>The provision of public information on the amendment took account of practice in previous referendums.  Public information has been provided in a similar fashion and at all times the Government sought to operate in compliance with the McKenna principles.  Very considerable efforts were made by my Department in this regard, which efforts were acknowledged by the President of the High Court.  In fact, even the plaintiff in his submission to the Supreme Court said there was no challenge to the proposition that the Department had endeavoured to comply with the McKenna judgment as it understood it.  A detailed protocol underpinned the drafting of content for the booklet and website and the Office of the Attorney General was consulted for legal advice throughout the process.</p><p>This is a complex area of law and I expect that the detailed judgments to be delivered by the Supreme Court on 11 December will assist in formulating an approach to information provision in future referendums.  These judgments will be a basis for further legal clarity and direction and studied carefully by the Government.  I welcome the statements of Oireachtas Members from both Government and Opposition sides who share my view that the focus must remain on the children's rights amendment.  There will be other occasions to debate the wider issues arising from today's ruling; the detailed individual judgments due in December will provide an important basis for such a debate.</p><p>I fully acknowledge the Supreme Court has found that not all of the material published complied with the McKenna principles.  Until today's decision the Government had acted in line with the decision handed down by the President of the High Court on 1 November.  At all times the Government acted in good faith based on its understanding of the McKenna principles and with the best of intentions in informing the people about the amendment.  Today's ruling has not changed either the truth or relevance of the message that the rights and protection of children should be fully visible within the Constitution.  It is important, as Senator David Norris said, to be clear that the Supreme Court has not commented on the merits or substance of the amendment.  It has expressly said the &quot;substance of the proposal is a matter for the people alone&quot;.  The public relies on us to show the leadership on this issue, while not losing sight of the importance of what has emerged from the Supreme Court ruling.  These are not mutually exclusive and we can and must attend to both, with the imminence of the children's rights referendum deserving of our greatest attention, energy and focus at this time.  The substance of the amendment is the most important thing for us to focus on at this stage.  This is a once in a generation opportunity and we should not be distracted from its importance.  What this debate must be about is the rights of children being recognised in the highest law in the land, through a dedicated &quot;Children&quot; article in the part of the Constitution called &quot;Fundamental Rights&quot;; what happens in the rare cases where parents fail; making important changes to update adoption law; ensuring the views of the child are taken into account and that their best interests will be at the heart of all decisions about the child in certain legal proceedings; all of these changes without making any amendment to Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution about families' and parents' responsibilities.</p><p>There has been a detailed debate and people are aware of the important issues at stake.  I urge everyone to come out and vote &quot;Yes&quot; on Saturday on this important amendment.  Clearly, addressing children's rights and protections in years to come will be about the wording in the Constitution, whether it is amended or otherwise, not the background to the referendum.  The referendum on Saturday offers us all an opportunity to vote for additional, real constitutional protections for children.</p></speech>

The House has shown that it can be proactive in dealing with urgent and serious matters. I welcome the Minister and thank her for coming to the House.</p><p>It was a shock to hear the decision of the Supreme Court this morning.  It should have delivered a more comprehensive response, rather than waiting until 11 December, when a decision will be made in the referendum on 10 November.  I do not blame the Government for being enthusiastic about the referendum because the issue was deliberated on in the Oireachtas and at the special committee of all Members of the Houses for three years.  At this late stage every effort is being made to thwart the efforts of the people to vote on Saturday, but at the end of the day they will make the decision to vote &quot;Yes&quot;.  We have an opportunity to use whatever influence we have to ensure a &quot;Yes&quot; vote on Saturday, which is vitally important.  </p><p>The position is that the McKenna judgment has been difficult for Governments since it was handed down.  Of course, there must be a separation of the Supreme Court and the Oireachtas.  However, the McKenna judgment has tied the hands of Governments on matters of great importance.  As all parties in the two Houses have endorsed the referendum, it is important to re-energise the campaign in the next 48 hours in support of children.  The referendum is 40 to 50 years too late.  However, the Oireachtas is united in this regard and I will not use the opportunity to criticise the Government in its decision.  However, because of the judgment all future Governments will have to be extremely careful to study the decision of the Supreme Court to ensure there will not be an over-enthusiastic endorsement of a proposal to ensure a &quot;Yes&quot; vote in a referendum.  As Fianna Fáil spokesperson in the Seanad, I suggest this is not the time to debate the merits of the ruling, as that can be done later in a calmer light.  I support Senator David Norris's enthusiastic endorsement in this regard.  The hour is nigh.  This opportunity will not be presented again for the children of Ireland.  </p><p>I agree with Senator David Norris on the position of foster parents.  How could one rear a child on the amount of money mentioned in this day and age?  I fully realise the responsibility on such parents in providing accommodation, food, heat and lighting.  This is an opportunity to say &quot;thank you&quot; to them for their work during the years.  Many of them sought to adopt the beautiful children in their care but were deprived of the opportunity to do so under the Constitution.  We will change this on Saturday with a clear &quot;Yes&quot; vote.  </p></speech>

However, that task has been made more difficult by the Government's actions in this regard.  It follows on from criticisms made during the fiscal treaty referendum and the rejection of the Oireachtas inquiries referendum last year.  Lessons have to be learned.  There is no point in discussing the merits of the Supreme Court judgment.  That is the law of the land and must be applied.</p><p>I am concerned that an e-mail issued to Members of the Seanad before this debate from the Minister's private office with a press release calling for a &quot;Yes&quot; vote.  Surely, the lessons should have been learned from the Supreme Court judgment today.  It is not appropriate that a press release calling for a &quot;Yes&quot; vote should issue to us.  It should not issue from the Minister's private office, as it did at about 5.30 p.m. when we all received a copy.  I certainly received it.  There must be a strong &quot;Yes&quot; vote and we cannot let this episode frustrate our efforts.  The people must realise on what they are voting.  Let all parties, please, work together to ensure a &quot;Yes&quot; vote, as otherwise the referendum may not be passed.</p></speech>

I also compliment the Minister who has led the campaign with a great degree of energy.  It has all-party support.  When I read the document, it crossed my mind that it was positively in favour of a "Yes" vote.  However, it did not register with me that there might be an issue with this because, obviously, I agreed with the content of the document.</p> <p>Senator Norris raised the issue as to whether the result could be impugned because of this Supreme Court decision.  I do not know if the Minister is in a position to answer this.  Obviously, this matter has been most unfortunate from the point of view of the smooth passage of the referendum.  While I know time is short, has any consideration been given to publishing a more balanced summary in a newspaper, perhaps, which might meet the spirit of the Supreme Court’s decision?</p></speech>

I also thank the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs for giving a wonderful explanation as to the position on this matter.  I commend Senator Norris for his strong call for a “Yes” vote in Saturday’s referendum.</p><p>The Supreme Court decision has no impact on the forthcoming proposed amendment to the Constitution.  This referendum, as spelled out by Members and the Minister earlier, is about protecting vulnerable children, supporting families, giving children a voice and treating all of our children equally, particularly in adoption.  Saturday’s referendum will allow people to have their say on this and respond to the many reports, which we have debated in this House, on improving child protection.  It will ultimately be the people’s choice and I urge the people to vote “Yes” for children’s protection in the Constitution.</p></speech>

The Minister has exercised great energy and enthusiasm in putting forward a position which we all heartily endorse.</p><p>On 11 December, when we have the detailed written judgments of the Supreme Court justices on this matter, we will have time to examine it in a calmer light.  As Senator Cummins said, the judgment does not in any way affect the proposed amendment in enshrining children’s rights in the Constitution.  Saturday is an opportunity of which we must avail.  Mr. John Waters has significant amends to make and I invite him again to make them before polling day on Saturday.  In this debate, he has been shockingly insulting to foster parents and all the good they have done down the years.  This should not be let go.</p></speech>

While 17 reports and over 20 years of debate have taken place around this issue, I note we have heard those calling for “Yes” and “No” votes in the forthcoming referendum.  However, we have not heard from children themselves.  I am only new in politics but this seems to be the first constitutional referendum for which there is full cross-party co-operation.  All parties and Independents have said “Yes” to this referendum.  When I asked the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs who would say “No” to giving children’s rights a place in the Constitution, she told me I would be surprised by who would come out of the woodwork at the last minute.  I must say I have been very surprised by who has and their scaremongering of ordinary decent families.  For several days, many such families have told me they have changed their minds because of what they heard on television from the “No” campaign.</p><p>I have first-hand experience of two types of abuse.  A dear friend of mine, whose case has been documented in the courts, was systematically abused from nine years of age, with his sister, by the person who was meant to protect them and give them their voice.  His life and family were ruined by this.  I know of two young boys who walked out of their family home at 15 years of age because they had no father since they were born and their mother was an alcoholic.  Through the medium of sports, they were able to pick up their lives again.  They had no one to go to.  They had their own voices but they were not heard.  This referendum will protect children’s rights and ensure children’s voices will be heard in future.  We must vote “Yes” on Saturday for children to be heard.</p></speech>

When this process started several months ago, I pointed out how the Supreme Court would need the wisdom of Solomon because the 1995 McKenna judgment was only 25 pages long.  I hope today’s judgment is longer because to achieve a 50:50 balance, does one have to invent ideas against a proposal if there are only a few against it?</p></speech>

We all know that while doctors differ, patients die.  With no disrespect to the Judiciary but while judges differ, Governments are charged with that task.  We must examine the McKenna judgment, make sure everyone understands what it is about and get a judgment longer than 25 pages.</p> <p>The previous referendum failed.  A survey on why it failed showed that 60% of it was due to lack of information and if one does not know, one votes, "No".  I rest my case.</p></speech>

We still advocate a &quot;Yes&quot; vote as strongly as ever.  In fact, it reinforces its importance and urgency.  Perhaps it makes our case even stronger.  Rather than seeing us as being derailed a little at this hour, let us strengthen our resolve.  It shows we must get the vote out in even stronger numbers in the next 36 hours.</p><p>It is important to state repeatedly, as others have, that the Supreme Court ruling does not affect the substantive wording of the referendum.  The referendum is about the protection of vulnerable children.  It is about that 1% who will need help and protection.  It is about supporting families that may go through vulnerable times and about the equality of all children in adoption terms.</p><p>The timing of this ruling is poor.  Let us ward against what happened with the referendum on Oireachtas inquiries with the former Attorneys General coming out at the eleventh hour.  The message that must go out to the public is that we need to hold our resolve on this.</p><p>I abhorred the words of Mr. John Waters on Monday night on &quot;The Frontline&quot; because of the way he derailed and debased foster parents.</p></speech>

What those parents do is incredible.  They give love unconditionally and they bring those children to doctors.  They stand by and watch them visit their birth parents.  They deal with the fallout of serious custody issues.  When he says they are doing it for the money, I ask whether Mr. Waters would do it.  Let us stand together and ensure we deliver a "Yes" on Saturday.</p></speech>

It should be noted that the Supreme Court did not make any order against the Government but rather rightly assumed that the Government would cease publishing and distributing the material, which the Government did with immediate effect.</p><p>The Supreme Court has reserved its judgment until 11 December.  While I welcome the opportunity and thank Senator Norris for putting forward the motion, in ways this debate is premature and we will need to revisit this debate post-11 December to discuss and answer questions on the handling of referendum information campaigns, the role of the Attorney General and the McKenna principles.  We need to do it when we are dispassionately unconnected from a particular referendum because these issues are overdue for discussion.</p><p>In the immediate term with polling day less than 40 hours from now, we must not lose sight of the principles at the heart of the amendment or the fact that many other wholly non-State-funded parties have campaigned long and hard to secure the successful passage of this referendum, none of which has been impugned in any way by today's judgment.  I also note, because there is confusion among the public around this judgment, that the Referendum Commission has not been impugned in any way by it.  I understand the commission has been given €2 million in funding and it has been informing the public.</p><p>There have been many vocal opponents of the amendment against whom I have had the pleasure to debate on the national airwaves and at public meetings up and down the country.  We must find a better way to inform the public and have debates because all too often I found myself in yes-no debates in which the &quot;No&quot; side had nothing to do with the wording that was in front of us.  Yesterday, for instance, when I was on RTE's &quot;Drivetime&quot;, Ms Dana Rosemary Scallon asserted on several occasions a statement which I counteracted.  She even asked if I was calling her a liar.  RTE's &quot;Drivetime&quot; announced only a few minutes ago that she has contacted the station acknowledging that she was in error and retracting all of her comments, but yet I was put in a position of having to counteract and not having an opportunity to inform the public of the debate at hand.</p><p>The Referendum Commission clarified in a statement that a referendum cannot be postponed.  The law on the conduct of referenda is set out in the Referendum Act 1994.  Once that order is made the only circumstance in which it may be changed, according to the Referendum Act, is if a general election is called, and there is no sign of that.  There are no other circumstances and for good reason.  The Houses of the Oireachtas passed this referendum Bill.  We in this House had an excellent debate on it.</p><p>I agree with the Minister that we must maintain our focus on the substance of the referendum.  I did my own research and I decided to vote &quot;Yes&quot;, not because the Minister, the Government or anybody else told me to do so.  I did so based on the facts which can be summed up as follows.</p><p>This referendum will make children visible in the Constitution.  It will provide a signpost to the courts, to policymakers and to decision makers that children are independent rights holders.  It will shift the focus away from the failure of parents to the impact on the child and allow the State to intervene earlier and proportionately where necessary.  By voting &quot;Yes&quot; in this referendum people will enable the 2,000 children who have been in foster care for over five years to become eligible for adoption.  This referendum will give a voice to children and ensure that they are heard in judicial decisions that affect their lives.  Finally, this referendum will ensure judicial decisions are made in the child's best interests.</p><p>I recall in June, shortly after the child death review group report came out, expressing my profound sadness and the sense of responsibility and shame I bear as a member of a society that has systematically failed to protect the most vulnerable children.  On rereading the report in preparation for this referendum, it was obvious that if the referendum was passed and in place, the outcomes for these children would be different.  What is striking, and the most disturbing feature, was the invisibility of children in the social work case files.  Children would have been required to have been heard.  This referendum will change that.  It will give children a voice.  It is not a panacea but it is a first, albeit critical, step.</p><p>I have been campaigning for many years on this referendum.  I should also note that some citizens have already started voting.  Islanders have started voting.  My own dad voted in hospital on Monday last.  We cannot take this away.  This referendum is now in place.  It has a chance to culturally shift how we view children.</p><p>I heard the five Independent Deputies state it should be postponed and I took the duty to contact each member in the Seanad Independent group.  The six Independent Taoiseach's nominees strongly believe that the poll should go ahead on Saturday.</p><p>There is a duty on all of us to vote on Saturday and I call on the public to come out in force to support a &quot;Yes&quot; vote, not because the Government has told it but based on the facts.  The ruling today did not reflect in any way on the information and state it was misinformation.  What it stated was that it was potentially promoting one side.  It did not in any way question the facts put forward.</p><p>We all could list the campaigners for the &quot;No&quot; side, and it would be quite a short list.  I am aware of so many organisations campaigning for a &quot;Yes&quot;.  I merely want to put these on the record.  This is the long list of &quot;Yes&quot; campaigners: the Bar Council of Ireland, the Disability Federation of Ireland, the Gaelic Players Association, IMPACT, INTO, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Countrywomen's Association which never before stated how it would vote in a referendum and on this one, stated it is too important, the Irish Foster Care Association, the Law Society of Ireland, Macra na Feirme, Mandate, Fr. Peter McVerry, Dr. Dáire Keogh, president of St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, Pól Ó Murchú, a solicitor who is working in the courts every day with such children-----</p></speech>

Like a number of other people have said, we were all concerned that something would come out of the woodwork in the last days of the campaign and, inevitably, it did.  There has never, in the history of the State, been such a degree of consensus among civil society as there is on the amendment.

One can easily lose sight of that fact.</p><p>A couple of important matters have been stated but they could be stated again.  Nobody has suggested that the Government acted in anything other than good faith.  The Supreme Court did not recommend an injunction to halt the referendum, nobody impugned Mrs. Justice Finlay Geoghegan or the Referendum Commission and we still have not received the full judgment of the Supreme Court.  Those are the facts.  On the other side, I am disappointed with the debate over the past number of days.  I am particularly horrified by some of the suggestions made on the other side of the debate that children are the chattels of their parents.  Somewhere along the line it has been suggested that it is not all right for the State to hold the role of ultimate protector of the child.  I am sure that everybody who has worked with children or in politics is privileged to be able to go to the doors of the country.  I have been in homes - I am not exaggerating - where children crawled around naked and were thrown food as if they were dogs in a pit.  That is the reality for some children and we should not apologise for ever saying that we are their ultimate protectors.  On Saturday we will have an opportunity to stand up and be counted.  That is what the referendum is about and is the message that should be sent by the House.</p></speech>

I also thank Senator Norris for raising the important issue and tabling the motion.  Today is a good case for using the procedure.  I thank the Minister for attending.  I also thank her for making a clear and concise argument for the &quot;Yes&quot; side and for stating her position.</p><p>  We all respect the decision of the Supreme Court.  The Government has stated, as has the Minister stated today, that it respects the decision and will comply with it.  It is important to stress that none of us has seen the judgment or the reasons for the decision.  As the Supreme Court has stated that the judgment will not be published until 11 December, our comments are based on a very limited knowledge of same.  We know that the plaintiff did not argue that the Department or the Government had intentionally acted in breach of the McKenna judgments.  The court appears to have accepted that there was, in good faith, an attempt to comply with the McKenna judgments.</p><p>  The Government also acted in accordance with the established practice since the 1995 McKenna judgment and the High Court judgment of 1 November 2012 in which the President of the High Court, as Senator Keane has said, accepted the manner in which the information was being provided and that there is a clear obligation to provide it.  In the past the Government was criticised when information it provided was inadequate.  </p><p>  It is also important to note that the relief granted by the court was declaratory only and concerned the text and the extraneous material published by the Government.  No injunction was granted to stop the distribution of the material or prohibit the referendum being held.  I have examined what the court has said.  It does not affect the holding of the referendum or the integrity of the result.  The court stated that it was a matter for the people.  The referendum shall go ahead on Saturday and the Supreme Court decision will not affect the outcome.  I am desperately disappointed to hear that five Independent Members of the other House have sought a deferral of the referendum.  It is far too important an issue for them to play a political game with.  Their comments are very disappointing.  They are also legally wrong to suggest that the outcome will be tainted by the ruling of the Supreme Court in respect of certain information provided by the Government.  </p><p>  I commend the Minister for the calmness and clarity that she has brought to the debate today, particularly in response to the judgment and in the past week, even though she was subjected to intense provocation by the &quot;No&quot; side.  <b></b>There is an extraordinary level of support for the referendum and Senator van Turnhout has eloquently demonstrated that.  She is correct that this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to place a value system within the Constitution for a framework under which law and policies on the care and protection of children can be developed.  We cannot miss this opportunity and I urge, as others have done, a high turnout and a strong &quot;Yes&quot; vote on Saturday.</p></speech>

My fellow colleagues on all sides of the House share that view.  I also commend Senator Norris for tabling the motion.</p><p>We cannot reiterate enough that the substance of the referendum's proposal is not affected by today's ruling.  We need to send that message and repeat it as often as we can in the next 36 hours.  The referendum shall go ahead on Saturday.  The argument for putting the explicit rights of children in the Constitution remains the same as it did 19 years ago when it was first called for by Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness.  </p><p>The amendment provides an explicit guarantee that the State will protect the rights of children.  It will allow for adoption that is in the best interests of children, regardless of marital status.  It will ensure that the best interests and views of a child will be taken into account when the courts make decisions on particular cases.  We have all made the same argument and it was done in an eloquent manner today.   </p><p>On a personal note, I spoke to a foster parent the other day whom I had not met for a number of years.  I happened to bump into her and asked her about the children in her care.  She became extremely tearful when she told me about a child whom I had known.  He had been in my son's class and had made his communion on the same day.  He had been completely abandoned by his parents but she looked after him.  She had bought his First Holy Communion suit and looked forward to the day when she was informed by the social worker that his parents had decided that she could not go to his First Holy Communion, despite all of her efforts.</p> <p>The little fellow, who has an intellectual disability, went to the First Holy Communion ceremony and immediately afterwards was taken kicking and screaming - I saw this myself - to respite care, where he was left for the weekend.  Our own child was being taken out for a meal, as were all the other children who were present.  I ask how anyone could even consider voting "No" and people must come out to vote.  I urge everyone in the country to turn out to vote on Saturday.  They should not only vote but should vote "Yes" in the interests of all children.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister to the House and commend her on the calm manner in which she has conducted this campaign.  She has been a model to us all and has reached out to many people.  As I understand it, and I thank Senator Bacik for her legal exposition, the judgment does not affect the substantive issue and I urge people to vote "Yes" for this proposal on Saturday.  Not too long ago, Geoffrey Shannon and Ian Elliott spoke most movingly in this Chamber to the North-South body on the rights of children.  One may take it that support for this extends to Stormont and all the parties therein, all of which were represented in this Chamber on that day, as well as to all the parties in this House and this is valuable to know.  Children everywhere on the island want a "Yes" vote on Saturday and I commend Senator Norris on raising this matter as an item under Standing Order 30, as well as the Cathaoirleach and the Leas-Chathaoirleach for facilitating this important discussion.</p></speech>

It is important for Members to have a debate on the court decision.  It is also important that Members do not blame the courts or the judges for today's decision because I believe the judgment gives cause for concern.  On behalf of my party, I wish to state its clear view that the referendum should go ahead as planned on Saturday.  Sinn Féin is also clear that the people of the State should support wholeheartedly the referendum and should vote in favour of it.  It is an important step in safeguarding children and it should proceed and I hope be passed by the people.  Moreover, it is important to remember that for my party, the amendment is a first step towards incorporating the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child into Irish law.  The Minister is aware that Sinn Féin would have preferred a stronger wording but that said, this proposal is a highly significant step in the right direction and should be supported by the people of the State.  It also is fair to acknowledge this is a significant judgment of the court, which upholds the principles of fairness in referendum campaigns that were set out in the McKenna judgment.  On a previous occasion, when the Minister was in this House, Sinn Féin warned against this and asked that the 50:50 rule be upheld and that the situation be avoided whereby the State could find itself in court and be subject to such court judgments.  However, we are where we are in this regard.</p><p>  I sincerely hope and firmly believe that this court judgment will not in any way take away from people's views that this constitutes an important advance for children and that it is about children's rights.  The issue of Government spending has been raised in previous referendum campaigns and has been a continuing cause for concern.  It will be necessary to study carefully the full judgment of the Supreme Court when it becomes available.  The Government's approach to the conduct of referendums must be seriously questioned in light of this judgment.  It is not the first time the Government has pushed the limits on the McKenna judgment, as some boundaries surely were pushed during the presentation of the austerity treaty.  The McKenna and Coughlan judgments pertain to ensuring fairness in referendum campaigns.  They were hard-won by citizens and should be respected in law and in spirit.  However, it would be a setback for children were the reaction to this court outcome to jeopardise the adoption of the proposed constitutional amendment to children's rights.  I again take the opportunity to call on the people of Ireland to vote &quot;Yes&quot; on Saturday.</p><p>  I also believe it is important to note that once this referendum is passed, as I sincerely hope it will, this will not be the end when it comes to children's rights but will only be the beginning.  Members will be aware I have repeated the point in this House <i>ad nauseam</i> that children in this State live in poverty, go to school hungry or not properly clothed and get sick and do not receive the treatments they need as quickly as they should.  Consequently, I seek the passing of the referendum and the enshrining of children's rights in the Constitution.  Moreover, all the issues about protecting children, supporting families, reducing inequalities in adoption and recognising children in their own right in the Constitution, as proposed in this amendment, are very important.</p><p>  However, I also support parliamentarians and legislators doing the right thing to support children at budget time and that Members will make decisions that take children out of poverty, rather than pushing them into poverty.  I will echo the sentiments of Senator Hayden when she spoke of potential failures of the past in respect of children in care.  All Members accept that in the past, the State failed on occasion when it came to children and there is no doubt but that institutions failed children.  However, one also should be mindful that many people who work for the State have done Trojan work in protecting children in State care.  I know of many social workers and people who work in the HSE who have provided the utmost care and in some cases the best care a child can possibly get.  This point should not be lost when one discusses issues such as the protector of last resort being the State and past failures.  Everyone accepts there were past failures but Senator Hayden is correct that one cannot be a politician for as long as have been many Members and not come across instances in which children were not being properly looked after by their parents.  I personally have seen examples of this and in such circumstances, one must ensure that children come first.  Their health, well-being and safety must come first and that is what this referendum is about.  I will conclude by again urging the people of the State to vote comprehensively and overwhelmingly in favour of this constitutional amendment.</p></speech>

As previous speakers have stated, this is a referendum that has been campaigned for and awaited for years.  I do not believe that any judge in the High Court or the Supreme Court would have intended an outcome that would jeopardise the actual referendum going ahead.  It unquestionably should go ahead as nothing has changed with the substance of the proposed amendment and I urge people in the first instance to be sure to exercise their vote and obviously to vote "Yes".</p><p>While I mentioned this point on the Order of Business this morning, a number of weeks ago I expressed concern and foresaw a situation which has arisen with the &quot;No&quot; side, whereby people are given a voice in this referendum campaign who have no substance to their argument.  Members have referred to the making of incredibly inaccurate statements and I refer to the situation to which Senator van Turnhout alluded, in which a certain individual had appeared on radio to speak against her and who was speaking untruths.  No amount of clarifications will rectify the fact that a huge number of people will have heard her first statement and will be misinformed as to the substance of what she was saying.  I am heartened by the cross-party support this evening.  I hope people will come out to vote and I urge them to vote&quot;Yes&quot; in favour of children.</p></speech>

While it has been forthcoming for many years, the Minister has brought it through.</p> <p>The people and the children of Ireland will forever be indebted to her for that.  I ask those who might be contemplating voting "No" whether they want to say that the rights of children should not be recognised in the highest law in the land.  Do they believe that in the rare cases where parents fail, the State should not intervene?  Do they believe we should not make important changes to update this country's adoption law?  Do they believe we should ensure the views of the child are not taken into account?  Do they believe the best interests of children should not be at the heart of all decisions that are made?  I ask them not to go out to vote until they have reflected on those questions.  When they have done that, they can vote on this matter with a clear conscience.  I congratulate the Minister again.</p></speech>
