I have selected the matters raised by Senators John Whelan, Denis O&#8217;Donovan, John Kelly and Thomas Byrne and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.

For the information of the House, I have received written confirmation from the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, that her Department is ceasing those payments to families who require them so their children can be clothed appropriately for first communions, confirmations and other religious ceremonies.  Most of us said yesterday that we were very disappointed with this move.  Would it be possible to arrange for the Minister to come to the House in the next week to discuss this issue and why the Government or her Department has not made a specific statement on it?  Last year, the payment was cut to €110 but now it has been abolished.  Will the Leader schedule time in the next week or so for this?  It would save me moving an amendment to the Order of Business, which I will not do this morning, asking the Minister to come to the House to address this issue.</p><p>Third, and most important, I wish to raise the report published yesterday on the Magdalen laundries.  As I said yesterday, successive Governments over the last 40 years have failed these ladies.  There is no question about that.  All parties that have been in government over that period, including my party, share the blame for not acting sooner on this very serious issue.  It is important to put on the record my personal and my party's grave disappointment with the Taoiseach's reaction to the publication of the report yesterday and that an apology was not issued on behalf of the State.  Most people will have seen and heard the reactions on television, radio and in the print media this morning, of the many women who were effectively incarcerated in these institutions against their will.  At the very least, the Taoiseach should have given a fulsome apology on behalf of the State and not just say he was sorry that women lived in that environment and under those circumstances.  That is not good enough, and we are gravely disappointed with it.</p><p>It is a very detailed report, just short of 1,000 pages.  All Members of the Oireachtas must read it, including the Taoiseach.  I assume that the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, will take the debate on it when it is scheduled in this House and I hope she will give an apology at that stage on behalf of her Department.  However, if the Taoiseach did not consider it appropriate yesterday to give an apology on behalf of the State, and I do not know why he did not, he will have a second opportunity to do so when the debate on the report is held in the Dáil in two weeks.  I ask the Leader to urge him, on behalf of our group in the Seanad and on behalf of all Senators, to use that opportunity, after reading the full report, to provide the apology that is absolutely required for these ladies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-06a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1143" speakername="John Whelan" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013020600003#B00200"><p>Most days when one comes to work here one is glad and proud to be Irish.  Unfortunately, however, yesterday was not one of those days.  The day was punctuated by the McAleese report, which is an indictment of not just politics, politicians and Governments but also society in general.  It goes to show that we should not always run with the conventional wisdom or herd mentality of the day about what is right or best for people.  It underscores for Senators the importance of speaking out at the time, not retrospectively.</p><p>The McAleese report on the Magdalen laundries is a sordid and shameful chapter in Irish history.  The hurt, harm and horror inflicted on these women is an indictment of all of us.  We should not add insult to injury now by equivocating in any way.  I second the call by Labour Youth and Labour Women for the Government to apologise unreservedly to these women.  The Taoiseach is a kind, caring and compassionate man.  Whoever is advising him that it would be unwise to apologise is not correct.  He should go with his heart on this matter.  The people of this country would be thankful to him if he apologised to the Magdalen women on behalf of the State.</p><p>This Government has been in office for two years.  It is two years since both the Labour Party and Fine Gael promised to radically reform our health services.  I believe we have, perhaps, taken two steps forward and three steps backward.  Unfortunately, we still have a two-tier system in which the people who get the best and earliest care are those who can pay the most.  As we have seen from the recent hike in VHI fees, more people are dropping out of the private system and putting pressure and a further burden on the public system, leading to longer queues and longer delays.  I am not surprised.  I do not know how the system works at all.  A constituent reported to me that they received a folio from the VHI which stated that an ambulance that transported a woman from the midlands to a hospital in Dublin cost €1,900.  No system can sustain that.</p><p>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Health, who has a thankless task, to the House to set out his vision and strategy for how the reforms will proceed.  Senator Eamonn Coghlan raised an interesting point yesterday.  Money is being stripped from productive hospitals that are doing a good job while hospitals that are not as effective and productive are being rewarded.  We have been promised radical reform in terms of the appointment of multidisciplinary teams, but that has not happened.  Furthermore, 18 months later I am still waiting for the Minister to make an announcement about community nursing homes, particularly with regard to hospitals such as those in Abbeyleix and Shane, Portlaoise.  People need to know where they stand.  It would be welcome if the Minister for Health came to the House, set out his stall, told us what progress has been made and explained the roadmap and timeframe for the other reforms.</p></speech>

Mr. Michael O'Leary is a very clever and competent business man, but this is nothing other than the calculated dismemberment of our national airline.  Ryanair started as an Irish airline but it is now a multinational concern, with all the voracious appetites that, perhaps appropriately, go with this.  It is quite extraordinary that a gift of €100 million will apparently be made to a moth-eaten, decrepit British airline to prop it up and make it some type of artificial competitor with Aer Lingus.  What happens if, after the cannibalisation of Aer Lingus, Flybe flies off and disappears?  The €100 million investment might well prove to be very worthwhile for Mr. O'Leary, who is clever and calculating, as business men must be.</p><p>I take this opportunity to welcome the overwhelming vote in the House of Commons yesterday in favour of gay marriage.  This can be put in the context that for the first time President Obama referred to this situation and endorsed gay marriage.  Recent polls have shown that approximately 75% of Irish people support it as well.  During the discussion this morning it was mentioned that this would be one of the principal items of discussion in the convention on the Constitution.  I was part of that and I spoke quite effectively, I believe, and got things changed at the first meeting - I will return again for something else - but I have been dislodged from speaking on this subject and will be replaced by my colleague, Senator Rónán Mullen.  I have always considered it important to include people who have a particular expertise in an area.  I have a particular interest because, first, I produced the first legislation in this area.  It was quite historic in this country and it was discussed on a number of occasions in this House.  It put the bomb under the Government that moved it in this direction.  I will not speak at length about what I think of the suitability of the two people who showed an interest in this area.  Anybody who wishes to know my views need only consult the record and see the very different positions taken by Senator Mullen and me on this issue when it was discussed.  People would be well advised to look at what was said in that debate.</p><p>However, I have every confidence in the Irish people.  Having attended the convention, I believe it will emerge with a view that reflects the views of 75% of the people on this island.</p></speech>

It is important that we all read it.  I hope, having read it, we will all have an opportunity at the appropriate time to make meaningful and thoughtful contributions on it.  It is important that the women who helped the former Senator to compile the report be acknowledged, as it cannot have been easy for them.  They made a very important contribution and shone a light on a period that was not a very proud one in our history.  As a nation, we failed those to whom the State had a duty of care.</p><p>I have read the summary of the report, but have not read the report in detail.  It points to the role of the State in the sending of many women to the laundries.  The Government should now consider how it can support them in the light of their experiences.  It should offer them appropriate support and a means of reconciliation, which I am sure will be forthcoming.  We should all read the report and reflect on it.  It covers a difficult period in our history, but it is important that the facts be made known.  I sincerely thank former Senator Martin McAleese for his contribution in that regard.</p></speech>

The timing of its release has not been helpful.  It was released after a Cabinet meeting that the Attorney General attended.  It was quite evident that the latter put constraints on the Taoiseach.  The victims, the survivors, must have been absolutely stunned by the tone of the Taoiseach's comments in the Dáil.  We know he is a compassionate man, as has been said, but it might have been better if the Government had considered the 1,000 page document and then entered debate straightaway.  Further injury is being inflicted on the survivors.  To realise this, we have only to recall some of yesterday's television programmes, in which one could see what I describe in the faces of some of the survivors.  They would have received a briefing in advance and been expecting a full response from the Government, but it did not come.  Consequently, they were absolutely shattered by what they were hearing and seeing.  It is a very complex issue.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, put his finger on it this morning on radio when he said this was not the stuff of films but the stuff of individuals suffering, not only the survivors but also the families of people who had already died, including former inmates of the Magdalen laundries.  We are talking about an apology which I still believe could be forthcoming today.  The legalese is not necessary; that can follow subsequently when talking about recompense for the affected individuals who suffered so much.</p><p>In the hiatus in the next two weeks all kinds of emotional elements will come to the fore.  Yet again, the victims and sufferers will be the survivors, which nobody genuinely wants.  Incidentally, we owe a debt of gratitude to the Government, as it brought forward the report which it produced after a very short time in office and deserves credit for having done so.  If we do nothing in the next 24 or 48 hours, we will do further damage.  I refer not only to the 100-plus individuals who came forward but to the hundreds who have not come forward at all, as is their entitlement.  They are suffering privately and, to all intents and purposes, have tried to black out a portion of their innocent lives.  If we want to give due recognition to the wonderful work done by former Senator Martin McAleese and his team, we should not do so in two weeks but immediately.</p></speech>

Everybody in the State, including the Taoiseach, is of the opinion that the women in question and their families suffered for a long time.  On reflection, an apology will be forthcoming.  It has to be made because the period of our history in question must be acknowledged.  I credit the Government for producing the report and former Senator Martin McAleese for presenting it yesterday.  I fully support the sentiments of all Deputies and Senators on the issue.</p><p>I ask that the Minister for Health come to the House to explain the budgetary increases and decreases announced on Monday.  Letterkenny General Hospital has been subject to an increase of 7%, owing to efficiencies and the hard work of staff and management.  It is a credit to them.  I caution the Opposition which was very quick off the mark to criticise the Minister for the announcement concerning Mr. Tony O'Brien from the HSE.  I ask the Minister to explain the procedure to the Opposition.  Mr. O'Brien, CEO of the HSE, explained it very well on &quot;Six One News&quot; on Monday evening.  He stated categorically that no representations had been made to him by any Minister or politician on the budgets.  This is the way forward.  With respect to Fianna Fáil, it probably would have expected the Minister to have had a serious influence when it was in power, but Mr. O'Brien knocked that thinking on the head.  The Minister should explain the procedure to us.</p></speech>

I ask the Leader to try to obtain for me the answer to some very specific questions.</p><p>I am interested in the financial investigation into the various organisations and the laundries.  I refer, in particular, to the evidence to support the assertion that the laundries were run at subsistence level, for a small profit or, in some cases, at a loss.  From first principles, it does not seem credible that organisations which had State-funded contracts with other organisations that they owned were not actually generating a profit.  Many of the religious orders which ran the laundries also ran the hospitals and had the gift of the contracts for laundry services for hospitals and other institutions, using taxpayers money and at the same time employing staff who were effectively working for free.  It is possible that there were non-profit-generating work practices and that the overall ethos of the institutions was such that they were not trying to generate a profit, but, in the light of the fact that the work practices and contractual arrangements were so unusual, there is a need for a detailed forensic analysis of the financial statements included in the report.  We do not get this in the report.  If I am not misreading it, the only accountancy input comprises reports from the paid accountants who worked for the religious orders which were being investigated.  We all know that accountants have an attorney-client relationship.  They act for the client, not for any disinterested third party.  Asking them to provide the detailed financial analysis of the state of the laundries' finances is inadequate.  Clarification is, therefore, required.</p><p>I am very troubled by the composition of the committee, the members of which were drawn entirely from the Civil Service.  The committee's remit was to investigate the involvement of the State in a matter reported at a level as high as the United Nations.  It is a matter that caused the State to suffer a substantial reputational hit.</p></speech>

When people read the McAleese report in 100 years time, they will say there were problems in regard to the Church and the State.  I hope this report gives some comfort to the survivors.  Whether it involved one person or 6 million people, this will go down in the same way as the way Negroes were treated and enslaved and the way the Holocaust developed and the Jews were persecuted.  This was the persecution of people who were in a vulnerable state in our country.  I would welcome a debate on the matter and I will leave it up to the Leader as to when we have it.  The report runs to 1,000 pages and it will take us a while to read through it and make sure we take it all in.</p><p>I refer to a statement made last week in the other House by the Sinn Féin deputy leader that there is a difference between the murder of a PSNI or RUC man and a garda.  Is this Sinn Féin policy?</p></speech>

Nowhere was that more relevant and true than in the laundry in my home city of Waterford.  If the Leader has read the report, he will see in the context of referrals from the courts and when women were sent to these laundries through the courts system, that the report makes particular note of this high practice in Waterford.</p><p>This whole episode is a blot on the history of this State and that is why many people were deeply disappointed with the Taoiseach's response yesterday.  They were looking for the Taoiseach of this country to apologise, on behalf of the people of this State, to the women who suffered in these laundries.  I accept fully the women's testimony when they say they were kept in these places against their will and that they were forced to work for nothing - a form of slave labour - that they were mistreated and that they were victims of physical and emotional abuse.  All of those survivors and their families deserve an unequivocal apology by the Taoiseach of this State for what happened.  He cannot say this was wrong and condemn what happened but not apologise on behalf of the State.  I take the opportunity to appeal to the Leader to appeal to the Taoiseach to make that apology to the survivors and the victims, many of whom live in the Leader's home city of Waterford.</p></speech>

When the State or a person fails in its or his or her duty, it or he or she should apologise.  When the Minister for Justice and Equality was in opposition, he described the State as being directly responsible for barbaric cruelty yet in a position of responsibility in government, he rode back from all he had said.  The Taoiseach rightly rebuked the Vatican when it failed the children of this country by refusing to fully participate in tribunals of inquiry and investigations into what the Church had done.  However, when the State, for which he is responsible, is found to have been responsible for incarcerating women in the most cruel of circumstances, described by his Minister for Justice and Equality in opposition as barbaric, the Taoiseach is not able to apologise fully.</p></speech>

I find that ironic and appalling.  Will the Leader organise a debate as soon as possible on the lack of an apology to those who were sent to the Magdalen laundries?  The State failed these women and, at the very least, they deserve an apology. </p></speech>

His report records a blight on our social history - on the Ireland which we have come from.  It showed that more than 10,000 women were committed to the Magdalen laundries, one of which was in Galway from where I come.  More than one quarter of these women were referrals made by the State.  What is significant about this report is that all of these victims were women and children.  It is clear they are still hurting and suffering.  We know that an apology goes an awfully long way towards healing and they deserve it and should get it.  Will the Government seriously reflect on giving them that apology so they can get peace of mind and heal?  Will the Leader arrange a full debate and seek clarity from the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, on the entitlements these women currently receive from the State?  These Irish women were in servitude to this State.  That is not something of which we should be proud and they deserve an apology.</p></speech>

Many of us, in particular myself, have been critical of what I describe as a headless chicken approach.  The Minister for Health pontificates on a regular basis about the strategic approach he is taking and promised free GP care would be rolled out by the last quarter of 2012 at the latest.  We have heard much about universal health care.  We have a manifesto and a programme for Government which pronounced the importance of keeping people in their homes yet we proceed to cut home help hours, thus increasing pressure on acute hospitals which are already running over budget.  Senator Whelan mentioned some of that.</p> <p>We have a hospitals capital programme that appears to follow the geographic trail of the Cabinet table rather than taking a strategic approach to the selection processes, as we have seen in Wexford and Kilkenny, and also the primary care centres.  That is before we even get into the pre-election porky pies which Senator Kelly and I know all about in the context of cancer services in Sligo hospital or accident and emergency services in Roscommon hospital.</p><p>With regard to a chief executive officer of an interim health service indicating he has not been lobbied by any Government Minister, I would submit he was told, &quot;This is what you are doing&quot; because while not wishing to impugn that particular individual's character or professionalism, he did not apply for that job, was not interviewed for that job but was simply put into it by the Minister of the day, which is wrong.  I agree with Senator Whelan that we need to have a debate here.  We must begin to take a strategic approach and not the old Cabinet cronyism approach, and certainly not the headless chicken approach we have seen taken by the Minister, Deputy Reilly, so far.</p><p>Following the public consultation in this House on the issue of cancer, which was important and successful, the Leas-Chathaoirleach as we speak is launching a report that states that changes in lifestyle can prevent up to one third of cancers.  It is important that we acknowledge that.  The public consultation was a good day's work for this House and we have seen the fruits of it today.  It would be worthwhile debating the report here at an early date if that were possible.  It is important to acknowledge how it has been received when one considers that John McCormack, the chief executive officer of the Irish Cancer Society, and a former colleague and Senator who is head of advocacy, Kathleen O'Meara, are here for that launch.</p></speech>

It is simply not justifiable.</p><p>I spoke to a woman recently who told me that she had a hysterectomy in a private hospital in Galway.  She spent three nights in the hospital and received fantastic care but for the bed alone she was charged €20,000.</p></speech>

The end result is that the ordinary Joe Soap with private health insurance will pay for the health service in the future.  We need to address that, and that is the reason we must have a debate on it in this House.</p><p>I call on the Leader to see if we can get clarity from the Minister for Health on what we are doing about the mobility allowance.  The Ombudsman found we were illegally ensuring that people over the age of 66 who were the most in need of the allowance were being deprived of it by virtue of their age.  I would appreciate it if the Leader could have that question put to the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and perhaps at some stage in the future when he comes into the House he might have answers for us on it.</p></speech>

The crackdown on rating agencies it called for is interesting because it is blaming agencies like Fitch, Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody, which have 95% of the market, for taking a lax attitude to the sub-prime debt which arose in 2007-8 that caused the financial crisis.  That debate came to the conclusion that something must be done about it.  I wonder if we should have a debate on that topic in this House or perhaps in the finance committee.  Senator Norris has called for such a debate on a number of occasions in recent years.  I do not know enough about it but I am sure Senator Barrett and others would give us a very good insight into it.  I would welcome a debate on that topic because if there is a 95% monopoly in any trade, and certainly in an area such as this one that can do so much harm, it is time we examined it with a professional eye.  A debate would open the door to that.</p></speech>

I urge that that would happen, perhaps during the Oireachtas debates a few weeks from now.  I would also like to see these women recompensed financially in some way.  A redress scheme is appropriate when we consider the billions of euro spent and squandered on this country's banks and the way our citizens, who are the most vulnerable and the most challenged, were treated.  Some form of redress scheme would be appropriate to recognise the terrible suffering highlighted in the McAleese report, which I urge all Members to study in the coming days to ensure we can all participate in a full debate in this House which I know the Leader will organise in due course.</p></speech>

That the two organisations stood shoulder to shoulder on the death of PSNI officers recently is a testament in itself.</p><p>I wish to air my disappointment that the Older and Bolder organisation will cease activities in the middle of this year.  I appreciate that the funding for Older and Bolder has come from an outside source but it raises the issue of the state of play in the State regarding community and voluntary sector organisations.  We are seeing a decay of those organisations as a result of the impact of austerity on them and on funding and it would be important that we have a debate on those community and voluntary sector organisations.  In many cases they have been the voices crying out and organising rallies against the austerity budgets and some of the cuts that have been brought in.  It is ironic that some of the more vocal groups are the ones that are going by the wayside at a time when we most need them.</p><p>It is ironic also that the Labour Party Senators are complaining this morning about the health budgets, etc., when they did not have much to say when the health budget was being put through the House before Christmas, but that stance will speak for itself.</p></speech>

Calling for an apology is one thing but Senator Martin Conway was the only Senator who mentioned compensation which is tangible acknowledgement of wrongdoing.  In addition to calling for an apology we will have to examine the report.</p><p>We are all calling on the State to say &quot;Sorry&quot; but it is not only the State that should say &quot;Sorry&quot;.  The institutions, the nuns and everyone involved should say &quot;Sorry&quot;.  As a society we should all say &quot;Sorry&quot;.  Actions speak louder than words.  Words are easy but it is the action taken that is important.  A considered debate on this issue in the Seanad, as the Leader has promised, and a follow up will be very important.</p><p>I raise the issue of the new junior certificate framework.  The first students who will be involved in this will be the intake of September 2014.  We have all spoken about the importance of physical education, PE, in schools, and Senator Eamonn Coghlan in particular, for the health of the nation because in the new junior certificate framework PE will now have the diminished status of a short course with a time allocation of just 100 hours over a two to three year period.  Currently, only 10% of schools are implementing the minimum recommendation of 120 minutes per week.</p> <p>The Department of Education and Skills says one thing.  Is physical education important or is it not?  The Department of Health advises one to get out on one's bicycle.  This is false economy.  The two Departments must work together because the children's national physical education study states that three out of four Irish adults and four out of five Irish children do not meet the guidelines.  The recent report also showed that one in four children was unfit, overweight or obese.  Children cannot learn if they are unfit.  What does adrenaline do for education?  Senator Eamonn Coghlan is tired asking for this to happen.  I ask the Ministers for Education and Skills and Health to draw up a coherent policy on physical education and let us have the debate as called for by many Senators.  It is going in the opposite direction and we have to change it.  It is not too late yet for the 2014 curriculum.</p></speech>

In light of the wave of media attention that has rightly focused on this tragic episode in recent Irish history, the House should be aware that yesterday afternoon the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, of which Senators Brian Ó Domhnaill, Pat O'Neill and I are members, spent more than four hours listening to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, and Professor Alan Reilly, chief executive of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland outline the current situation on what could be a potentially disastrous episode impacting on Irish agriculture.</p><p>There are more than 200,000 people employed in agriculture, generating €9 billion in exports.  The issue is getting worse rather than better.  I commend the Minister, his officials, and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland on their efforts but how long more will the saga drag on?  The Minister is sticking rigidly to the view that the horse DNA emanated from Poland and has the documentation to prove it.  The Polish authorities deny that.  The indication appears to be that somewhere along the food chain, traces of horsemeat and pork were introduced which leads to possible allegations of corrupt practices.</p><p>There are more than 140 people employed in the Silvercrest facility in Monaghan and there has been little discussion on the impact this saga is having on them and their families and the uncertain future they are facing.  I was reassured by the Minister yesterday.  I and other Members will be surprised to hear that this plant is not only a state-of-the-art facility specifically for the processing of beefburgers but the most advanced plant in the world.  It is currently operating at 50% of its overall capacity but has now lost more than €30 million in food contracts to various multiples.  That Tesco withdrew its €15 million contract after the management had been changed and the new procedures introduced raises questions as to why it did so.  If it had done so before one could understand.</p><p>In light of this, I ask that the House be kept regularly informed of the issue.  I hope we will not have to be regularly informed.  I hope the Minister, his officials and the Garda authorities who are now involved, will accelerate the investigations and bring the matter to a speedy conclusion, otherwise Ireland's image as a green island and its food exports will be damaged.  The sooner the issue is grappled with, the sooner the investigation will be concluded.  If the Minister is coming to the House, I ask that he keep the House informed in order to maintain the pressure on all the relevant State agencies to conclude the issue quickly.  I support the view of our spokesperson on agriculture, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, who is a member of the committee, in calling for an independent investigation.  If one person is given a timeline and access, the entire issue can be dealt with in a month or six weeks which, in my opinion, is too long.</p></speech>

Yes, that was a huge blot on the State and certainly there were barbaric and horrific practices involved.  I am saddened that some Members are, in effect, playing politics with the issue.

As outlined by Senator Ó Murchú, the advice of the Attorney General was probably sought at the Government meeting yesterday on the question of compensation.  That is a narrow way of looking at the issue.  The issue is about closure, providing forgiveness and reassurance and, as one lady said yesterday on radio, the State wrapping its arms around us again.  That was not done yesterday which was a mistake.  I hope the Taoiseach will reflect on it.  I understand he will look comprehensively at the documentation but he would be better advised to listen to some of the victims and respond more quickly than is proposed.  Whether the issue of compensation arises, those people deserve compensation if it is to be made available.  That should not be an issue.</p><p>I call on the Leader to invite the Minister for Education and Skills to the House to discuss the new means-testing arrangement which he is due to bring to Cabinet this month for including farmland and assets of the self-employed in consideration for third level grants.  That would mean students from farming backgrounds would be unable to go to third level education.  The Minister does not appear to have any idea of the implications of the proposal.  I appeal to the Leader to liaise with the Minister's office as to when the proposal is due to go before Cabinet and allow us have our say before that occurs.</p></speech>

The facts and scale of the Magdalen laundries scandal are known.  It is appropriate that the Government would take time to analyse the comprehensive report and give its response.  It should not be forgotten that this is the first Government in the history of the State to tackle the issue.  I remind Senator Ó Domhnaill that his colleagues sat on their backsides for 14 years and did absolutely nothing for those vulnerable people who have suffered so much at the hands of the State.</p></speech>

However, an apology must mean more than words.  It is appropriate and the Taoiseach has a responsibility to ensure that when he gives that apology he has put in place some supports and benefits for the people who have suffered much.  He also has a responsibility to act on behalf of the State which is broke.  We have to put in place an appropriate apology and supports that we can afford.  As stated, the Taoiseach is a caring person who will do the right thing for those people who deserve to be treated properly.  For decades they have been left in a state of limbo where nobody appeared to care or did nothing for them until this Government took decisive action.</p></speech>

I have to say our reputation has been sullied once more.  Holy Ireland used to be known around the world as a holier-than-thou Catholic country, but it has become totally clear that the human rights of women and children were denied and that sexual abuse took place in many institutions.  My former colleagues in the Oireachtas, Tom Kitt and Michael Kennedy, valiantly established an <i>ad hoc</i> Oireachtas committee to seek justice for the Magdalens.  They were stonewalled by civil servants who briefed their Ministers and did not want to upset the apple cart.  We need an investigation into Departments that stymie development.  I had a go at the Secretary General of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation yesterday.  These civil servants hold back our country in more ways than one.  In years to come, this will be investigated.</p><p>  I have to say that various Fianna Fáil Ministers failed to follow this issue up because they were afraid of what would happen.  They did not have the political guts to speak the truth regardless of the repercussions.  I will set out what has to be done.  Of course we all want the Taoiseach to give a full apology.  These women, many of whom are very old and some of whom are in my age group, do not want to go to their death beds without getting an apology from the State.  Those who worked in these laundries as slave labour should be able to die in peace when the time comes.  The departmental officials who went to investigate the laundries did not give a damn that the women were not being paid.  As they were not paying social welfare, they were not entitled to claim pensions.  That needs to be resolved.  I want a full State apology to be given and recompense to be paid.  These women should be able to spend the rest of their lives in proper physical accommodation.</p><p>  I would like to conclude by mentioning another <i>bête noire</i> of mine.

Our international image as the land of saints and scholars, which we enjoyed for a long time, is long gone as a consequence of the many reports that have been released in recent years.  We are too quick to hand responsibility for everything to the State.  As a society, we must read and take stock of this report.  It makes it clear the Catholic Church, society at large and the Government were responsible for the horrific and barbaric treatment of these women.  We all must reflect on the inescapable fact that this was tantamount to slavery.  It is very important for the issue of compensation to be addressed.  While it is easy to say that the State should wrap its arms around these women and apologise to them, it is important for a full and meaningful apology to be extended to them, as Senator Mullins said.  As Senator Keane said, the provision of compensation is the only tangible way for the State to show it is truly sorry for what these women endured.  The pensions issue has been mentioned.  Quite simply, these women should be paid for the work they did.  They were treated as slaves.  The reality is that they need to be compensated for the work they did.  Their abandonment by the State also needs to be addressed in this way.  We really need to have a debate on the matter in the House.  The Taoiseach's suggestion that the report should be digested in some way is very important.  I hope a debate can be facilitated, perhaps next week.</p></speech>

It is long overdue.  I pay tribute to Senator Ó Murchú, who summed it up very well.  In fairness, the Government should have taken two weeks to consider the matter before dealing with it comprehensively, rather than having the report published at this stage.  The demand was for it to be published as soon as it was made available to the Government.  That is what the Government did.  Some of those who have come in here to criticise the Taoiseach are members of a party that did absolutely nothing for 14 years when it was in government.  Some of those who were detained in Magdalen laundries died during that time.  Regardless of what happens now, those people will not receive an apology now because they are not alive.  I advise the Senators in question to keep that in mind.  Equally, I do not think the party that took 17 years to apologise for the death of a garda is in any position to criticise the Government for not dealing with this issue.</p></speech>

The Government has said that it will arrange a debate on this matter and that it will deal with it comprehensively and carefully.  Governments should be given time to deal with reports like this after they are published.  That is what this Government is doing.  I remind the Leader that it is important for this House to have a debate on this report.  We should deal with it comprehensively.  We need to ensure procedures are put in place when an issue arises and the State is involved.  I am reminded of the nursing home cases long ago.  In that case, the State kicked the issue around for 24 years without doing anything about it.  When an issue arises, we should not allow any Department to try to push it under the carpet.  That seems to have been the approach of Administrations in this country for far too long.  It is time we changed that system.  We need to put procedures in place to ensure that when valid complaints about how we do our business in this country are raised, they are dealt with immediately rather than being left lying around for ten, 20, 30, 40 or 50 years.</p></speech>

As I have explained previously, such payments are made when essential, once-off, exceptional and unforeseen expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from his or her weekly income, arises.  There is no automatic entitlement to a payment.  The Government has provided almost €48 million for payments in this regard in 2013.  The guidelines mentioned by the Senator have been issued to the staff who administer this scheme.  It is recommended that the payment of the allowance in respect of specific religious ceremonies, mainly communion and confirmation ceremonies, will cease from 2013.  Applications can continue to be made under the scheme for assistance with children's clothing.  This measure will ensure that the exceptional needs payment scheme continues to respond to specific needs, rather than to specific occasions.  These recommendations to not affect the discretion available to officers administering the scheme, in issuing an exceptional needs payment, to assist an individual or household in any particular hardship situation which may arise.</p> <p>I hope that clarifies the situation for the Senator.</p><p>Quite a number of Members rightly raised the question of the McAleese report into the Magdalen laundries.  I do not intend to respond to all the points made.  We will endeavour to have a debate in this House within two weeks.  As soon as the Minister is available to come in, we will have him in, and the request has gone in already.</p><p>As was mentioned, the Government acted as soon as it was elected in having this report commissioned.  The concerns of these vulnerable women have been dismissed for decades.  There is no question from reading part of the report that the State was complicit - it specifically states that 26% of those who became residents of the Magdalen laundries did so through State processes, judicial State care, etc.  There is no question that there was State collusion in this.</p><p>I would hope we will have a debate on the report.  We should treat the report with the measure of calmness and consideration which I believe it deserves.  It is a very comprehensive report.  I am sure this House will have a very considered, measured and informed debate, as we usually do on subjects such as this.  It is unfortunate that we have had need for other reports in recent years, such as the Ryan report and others, which has certainly been a blight on the country.  We should wait and have that calm and considered debate in a couple of weeks.</p><p>Senators Whelan and Kelly called for a debate on the health service strategy.  I will ask the Minister for Health to come to the House to address the whole area of reform of the health services.  As the Minister said, change is not optional; it is essential.  The Minister would suggest, and I agree with him, that a lot of change has taken place already but there is a hell of a lot more to be done - there is no question about that.  I will ask him to come to the House for a debate on the progress that has been made to date and what the strategy is for the future.</p><p>I can assure Senator MacSharry that free GP care will be introduced in the term of this Government.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-06a.100" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1061" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013020600010#J00400"><p>I am very pleased to be back in the Seanad to have an opportunity to speak on the subject of the private rented sector.  The past five years have been turbulent and traumatic in the housing market.  An obsession with residential property as an investment vehicle rather than as a home was driven by the failed pro-cyclical policies of the past decade.  Home ownership, a noble aspiration, mutated into a speculative mania and an entire generation was cajoled or encouraged to chase an out of control housing bubble.  When the music stopped, the damage to individual households and the wider economy was clear to see.  Spuriously inflated property prices, lax lending policies and weak central oversight have bequeathed large-scale negative equity and the dream of owning a home has turned into a nightmare for some families.  Many are struggling to pay their mortgages, with some at risk of losing their homes.  What should be viewed as a place of comfort and shelter is now for too many a millstone and constant worry.</p><p>I am acutely aware of the real difficulties people are experiencing and there is no question but that we face a difficult path in finding a solution to the housing crisis.  It will not be solved overnight.  What is needed is sound and humane decision-making, imaginative policies that produce the greatest possible housing yield to the widest range of people at the best return to the taxpayer and, critically, an understanding of the mistakes of the past and an ability to learn from them.  We must not return to the unsustainable and unprecedented growth that represented the boom years.  The greater the boom, the worse the bust and we must seek to provide a moderating structure that will allow for sustainable and long-term growth.  However, future housing policy cannot just be a reaction to the madness of the past.  It must confidently set out a vision for the future based on values such as community, neighbourhood, security and safety.  In doing so, we need to look at international best practice and learn from the innovation and initiatives that guide housing policy, specifically social housing policy, among our European neighbours.  </p><p>For all these reasons, I am absolutely committed to the development of a genuinely sustainable approach to housing policy in Ireland.  Such a policy has the interests of communities at its heart; is based on choice, fairness and equity across tenures; and will enable all householders to access good quality housing appropriate to their household circumstances and in their community of choice.  I am committed to a vision of housing where people, once again, view their house as a home, not as a dubious investment.  </p><p>We must do things differently.  The Government's housing policy statement published in June 2011 marked a profound change in the State's approach to housing policy.  This clear and concise statement was based on a number of fundamental principles and goals which form the basis for reform under way.  It is a framework document that does not claim to contain all the answers to the issues it raises.  It takes account of the dramatic cycle of growth and collapse in the residential property market.  In that context, it charts a way forward for housing policy by placing explicit emphasis on choice, equity across all housing tenures and delivering quality outcomes for the resources invested.  The housing policy statement provides a framework for legislative and policy initiatives in the short to medium term, many of which are in train.</p><p>Key to these aims is a move from a focus on the promotion of home ownership to a more equitable treatment of tenures.  If there is one thing the crisis has taught us, it is that home ownership need not be the ultimate goal.  I stress that this does not mean we are turning our backs on home ownership or that we are seeking to impede people from realising their valid home ownership aspirations.  Far from it - the reality is that for the majority of households, home ownership will continue to be the tenure of choice and this is recognised and welcomed by the Government.  However, there are other households that may not want or be in a position to own their home.  We increasingly see households moving between both options at different stages of their lives.  Our goal for such households is to provide a choice based on household circumstances and needs rather than on the expectation of house price growth.  The current crisis has given us an opportunity to reassess our attitudes to housing and home ownership.  The emergence of rented housing as a real, viable housing option is part of this reassessment.  A well balanced housing sector requires a strong, vibrant and, I stress again, well regulated rental sector which is an integral part of the Government's housing policy for the future.  </p><p>The Residential Tenancies Act was passed in 2004 and represented the most significant legislative reform in the private rented sector in over a century.  Prior to 2004, the rental market operated in a crude and fragmented manner.  There was little or no security of tenure for tenants and recovery of possession presented a nightmare scenario of long and expensive court proceedings for landlords.  Even minor disputes arising during the course of a tenancy had no avenue of resolution other than the courts.  Standards in rental accommodation were notoriously low and while minimum standard regulations had been in place since 1993, they were already out of date and characterised by very low levels of enforcement.  The combination of these factors resulted in the absence of a secure, regulated rental market that could offer a real, attractive long-term housing solution to people searching for an appropriate home.  Rented housing represented a tenure choice of last resort.  For many, it was synonymous with student accommodation and grotty bed-sits - a short-term or the only solution for the most marginalised and vulnerable in our society who could not afford anything better.  </p><p>This, thankfully, is not the private rented market of today.  More people are renting than ever before.  Census figures from 2011 show an increase of almost 64% in the number renting from private or approved housing body landlords since the last census in 2006.  The proportion of overall home ownership has declined by 5% and the rental market now accounts for 29% of the total housing market.  In the eight years since the passing of the Residential Tenancies Act and the establishment of the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, we have seen significant strides in the development of the private rental market which is largely unrecognisable from where it was at the end of the millennium.  </p><p>The Residential Tenancies Act introduced real security of tenure for tenants in the private rented residential sector for the first time.  It set out minimum obligations for landlords and tenants and provided access for both tenants and landlords to a relatively cheap, informal and independent dispute resolution service.  It laid out conditions for rent reviews and prohibited the charging of rents in excess of market levels.  It set out fair procedures for the termination of tenancies and provided for notice periods linked with the duration of a tenancy.  </p><p>The PRTB was established as an independent statutory body under the Residential Tenancies Act on 1 September 2004.  Its principal activities include the registration of private residential tenancies and the resolution of disputes between tenants and landlords, as well as the provision of information, assistance and advice for the Minister on the private residential sector.  It has achieved much since it was established.  It can now offer clients a full suite of on-line services, including on-line tenancy registration and payment facilities.  Since 2012, it has introduced on-line dispute applications, with electronic case management of files, which allows parties to register an adjudication, mediation and tribunal on-line.  From the perspective of internal efficiencies, this takes 1.2 million items of post and paper out of the system through scanning, electronic case management and remote access via secure portals.  In addition, new software rolled out by the PRTB allows effective interrogation of databases provided by sister public sector organisations, primarily the Department of Social Protection, and is proving to be a very effective tool both in identifying unregistered landlords and electronically managing their case files to secure registration compliance and bring prosecutions, where necessary.  It has allowed the PRTB to lay the groundwork for a compliance programme for the prosecution of landlords who fail to apply for tenancy registration.</p> <p>However, more remains to be done.</p><p>It is recognised that it can be a considerable period before cases are heard by the PRTB and it is essential that, as much as possible, we supply the board with the necessary tools to reduce delays.   I am aware that this issue is a concern for Senators.  It must also be acknowledged, however, that the number of dispute cases referred to the PRTB has grown by 25% since 2008.  During the same period, staff numbers decreased by 53% from their peak as a result of the employment control framework's relentless downward pressure on public sector numbers right across the board.  Notwithstanding these challenges, the PRTB is actively pursuing a range of modernisation initiatives such as outsourcing of work and shared services.</p><p>It is hoped that in the longer term this will enable the PRTB to continue to do more with less and significantly reduce delays.  Outsourcing of its paper registrations process and of its telephony services has allowed the PRTB to cope with a reduction in staffing numbers, while offering an expanded telephone contact service.  It has worked closely with other public bodies and public service partners such as the Revenue and the NTMA on ICT developments.  Its investment in ICT is a key element in its corporate plan and modernisation agenda under the Croke Park agreement.  A new tenancy management system came on stream in mid-2012 and will considerably reduce processing times in 2013.  It must be recognised, however, that there will be considerable challenges for the PRTB in the years ahead and the Government is committed to helping it to meet these.</p><p>My Department conducted a review of the Residential Tenancies Act in 2009, with a specific emphasis on whether it best supports the PRTB's key functions and on whether legislative amendments would support either the achievement of additional operational efficiencies by the PRTB in the delivery of those functions or the broader good working of the private rented sector.  The outcomes of the review were announced in April 2010 and the drafting of the general scheme of a Bill to give effect to the recommendations of the review was approved by Government in July 2011.  The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 has just concluded Second Stage in the Dáil.  I very much look forward to what I hope will be a constructive debate on the Bill when it comes before the Seanad later in the year.  The Residential Tenancies (Amendment)(No. 2) Bill 2012 builds on what has been achieved by the Residential Tenancies Act and the PRTB and provides for the further development of the rental sector into the future by introducing into law a number of programme for Government commitments.  While it contains a number of quite significant policy developments, this is very much an evolutionary rather than revolutionary item of legislation.</p><p>Perhaps the most significant achievement of the Bill, if enacted, will be the extension of the remit of the Residential Tenancies Act to approved housing body dwellings.  Approved housing bodies generally provide rental accommodation for families and persons with specific categories of need who are on the social housing list.  However, the relationship between these tenants and their approved housing body landlords is not generally provided for in either the Housing Acts or the Residential Tenancies Acts.  Instead, they operate on the basis of lease agreements, the various Landlord and Tenant Acts and common law.  As such, formal regulation of the tenant-landlord relationship in the sector lags considerably behind the private rented sector and there is an urgent need for a modern legislative basis for approved housing body tenancies.  The Bill will afford to those in the approved housing body sector the same rights and obligations as those afforded to landlords and tenants in the private rented sector.  This is a logical follow-on from the June 2011 housing policy statement, which sets out the key role envisaged for the approved housing body sector in the delivery of social housing.</p><p>Extending the 2004 Act to approved housing body tenancies will create a unified legislative base for the private rented and approved housing body sectors, assisting movement between tenures and making more efficient use of rental stock across both the public and private sector.  Creating a unified legislative basis assists in the objective of affording equal treatment to households in similar economic circumstances and is consistent with my belief that broadly similar rights and responsibilities should apply to all forms of rented accommodation.  This raises the logical question as to whether the same framework of rights and responsibilities should be extended to the local authority sector.  My view is that this is a natural next step but it will not be dealt with in the context of the Bill before the House.  In that context, we are dealing here with a very broad area and an extremely large number of tenancies.  I am of the view that the extension to which I refer will occur in the future.</p><p>An area still under development, which I will raise for consideration during the Bill's passage through the Oireachtas and about which Senators are very concerned, is that of deposit protection.  This is a priority I identified when I was appointed as Minister of State last December and it remains so.  As the House will be aware, the programme for Government 2011 contains a commitment to establish a tenancy deposit protection scheme to address this issue.  On foot of this commitment, I asked the PRTB to commission research on such a scheme and, following a selection process, the research contract was awarded to Indecon economic consultants.  I received the final report on the topic from Indecon in November and I have given a commitment to act on the establishment of a deposit protection scheme in the context of the passage of this Bill through the Oireachtas.</p><p>On an initial examination of the report, it seems that Indecon has prepared a comprehensive analysis of the range of options for delivery of the programme for Government commitment.  I will need to weigh up those options and determine how best to offer the greatest protection to tenants in this area at the least cost to the Exchequer.  Critical issues currently being addressed include whether a scheme should be custodial or insurance-based in nature, whether it should be operated by the PRTB or a third party and how it should interface with the current legal system and the PRTB.  In order to inform wider debate and thinking on this topic, I published the report on my Department's website before Christmas.  I very much look forward to hearing Senators' views on the report, particularly as there is a great deal of expertise in the House in respect of this issue.</p><p>Given the rapid growth in the size of the sector, it is imperative that an acceptable set of minimum accommodation standards be applied in the private rented sector.  During the past 20 years, since the first minimum accommodation standards were set down, our expectations as to what constitutes acceptable housing have advanced a great deal.  The new regulations reflect the requirements of a modern rental sector and wider quality-of-life expectations.  Outdoor toilets, no hot water and open fires as the only heating source have been consigned to the past as today's minimum standards cover a broad range of requirements from structural repair to sanitary facilities and from heating and ventilation to the safety of gas, electrical supply and fire safety.</p><p>The first day of February 2013 was particularly significant in the ongoing drive to improve standards as the four-year phasing-in period that had been allowed for existing rented accommodation under the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008 expired.  Since that date, all rented accommodation must have its own sanitary facilities in a separate room.  This means that the days of multiple rented units sharing a single bathroom are over.  The fact that this reform is being introduced in the centenary year of the 1913 Lockout - a struggle which brought to worldwide attention the plight of tenement dwellers in Dublin - will not be lost on Senators, who have taken a keen interest in the decade of centenaries that we have embarked upon.  One can see, from the exhibitions relating to the housing which obtained at the time of the Lockout, that we have come a long way.  I intend to ensure that the reform to which I refer is fully implemented.</p><p>Enforcement of these standards is a key challenge for the local authority sector but I am satisfied that the new standards regulations provide for a much strengthened sanctions and enforcement regime.  The penalties for non-compliance with the regulations can amount to a fine of up to €5,000 and/or imprisonment for up to six months.  Local authorities will also have the power to serve prohibition notices on properties which prevent the landlord from renting the property out until such time as it complies with the standards.  I am very confident that local authorities have an active programme of targeted inspections in place to ensure compliance with standards.  In 2011, for example, almost 20,000 inspections were carried out nationwide, more than 2,500 improvement notices were issued and, while most compliance issues were addressed, 60 prohibition notices were served.  Dublin City Council is particularly active in this regard and initiated 36 prosecutions in 2012 under the standards regulations.</p><p>My Department placed advertisements in national newspapers in October outlining these new requirements and we will continue to work with key stakeholders such as the local authorities, Threshold and the Irish Property Owners Association, IPOA, in order to spread awareness of the standards and improve compliance.  It is important to note that in 2008 each of the aforementioned entities played an important role in the consultative and drafting phase relating to the new regulations.  It is for this reason I am somewhat puzzled by the IPOA's sudden public pronouncements of concern regarding the perceived negative impacts of the new regulations on tenants and landlords.  I am of the view that a four-year lead-in period is more than adequate notice of these changes and I expect landlords to comply with their legal and moral obligations in this area.  I also expect vigorous enforcement of these standards by local authorities.  I understand that Dublin City Council, in particular, has a strong current focus on this area.  I reiterate that there was a four-year lead-in period and that there is no excuse for landlords who have not yet brought their properties up to standard.  In general, however, I am satisfied that significant progress has already been made with regard to minimum standards in recent years.  The final implementation of the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008 represents a significant step forward.</p> <p>We have minimum standards for rented accommodation to protect the most vulnerable in society.  Strong standards and robust enforcement, allied to an ever more professional rental sector, will contribute to the creation of sustainable communities and healthy and happy homes.</p><p>Some comment in the media in recent days has attempted to introduce outlandish claims that this progressive move will increase the level of homelessness.  The former Minister of State, Mr. Michael Finneran, was right to introduce these regulations in 2009 and they will not be rescinded or diluted under my watch.  This is an issue of human dignity.  It is about raising the standards of accommodation availed of by some of the poorest in society.  Threshold, the voluntary organisation working with private rented sector tenants, fully concurs with this view and welcomes the introduction of the new standards, the only purpose of which is to provide citizens with decent and modern living conditions.</p><p>I look forward to tabling detailed amendments on Committee Stage relating to the issue of rent arrears.  I am very aware of the concerns of landlords about unpaid rent and of the difficulty of repossessing a rental property in cases in which the rent remains unpaid.  In these difficult times, when many are struggling to pay mortgages on buy-to-let properties, it is essential to take action on this issue.  We have made significant progress in dealing with the complex legal and policy issues surrounding this topic, but it was not possible to finalise the necessary provisions in time for inclusion in the published Bill.  It is a case of balance and ensuring both landlords and tenants are protected.</p><p>The Government is committed to a ten year neutral approach to housing.  We will continue to support the development of a strong, vibrant and well regulated private rented sector.  Strong standards and robust enforcement, allied to an ever more professional rental sector, will contribute to the creation of sustainable communities, equity of choice and decent living conditions.  This must be our long-term goal. </p><p>I thank my colleagues in the Seanad for inviting me to attend today.  I look forward to the debate.  I know that all Members are willing to work with us in finding solutions to the problems we face.  I welcome the views of Members, as we know significant challenges lie ahead.  The state of the economy means we do not have the money we had in the past to spend on social housing.  We want to ensure the private rented sector is properly regulated, treated equally and can be a real option in modern Ireland.  We will provide the legislative base and the enforcement regulations required to make this happen.</p></speech>

The average Irish landlord owns one or two properties, while fewer than 10% of landlords own two or more properties.  This reflects the underdeveloped and amateur market compared with the European standard of large landlord companies operating multiple properties, which in many cases is to be welcomed.  The rental market is changing rapidly, particularly in the context of the collapse of the housing bubble to which the Minister of State referred.  This presents a new set of challenges which the original Private Residential Tenancies Bill 2004 did not accommodate.  I welcome the Government's new Bill to address the outstanding legal aspects of the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB.</p><p>It is interesting to note that approximately 29% of the population are renting accommodation, with 18.5% renting in the private sector.  What is more interesting is the speed of change.  Numbers renting in the private sector have increased by 86%, up from 9.9% since 2006.</p><p>A grave injustice is being perpetrated against the providers of private rented accommodation who provide accommodation for 700,000 people.  Private landlords are seen as easy pickings in the obsessive manner in which the Government is seeking to raise revenue.  However, in the process, it has not given any thought to the issue of fairness.  The landlords' national representative body, the Irish Property Owners Association, has invented a new verb to describe the position - &quot;to taxault&quot;.  The latest taxault is the double taxation this year of the non-principal private residence charge and the local property tax.  The Minister for Finance told the Dáil that the local property tax would be tax-deductible, but he then quietly announced that it would be phased in at some stage.  Either it is a legitimate expense in the business of letting property or it is not.  It is a legitimate expense.  If it is a legitimate expense, it cannot be simply phased in as if it is some fantastic concession from the Minister.  This is only the latest in a series of taxaults against private landlords.  It must be a grave injustice and against all the rules of equity that landlords should this year have to pay a charge of €200 next month on the non-principal private residence, followed so far by an undetermined charge by way of the local property tax which we believe will be in the region of €1,000 a year, based on location, followed so far by undetermined water charges in 2014, estimated to be an average of €500 per household.</p><p>The non-principal private residence charge was introduced to pay for local services.  However, the users of these services are not the ones who are levied.  The household charge was introduced to pay for local services and, again, the users were let off the hook, while landlords were levied.  It is not yet known how the water charge will be levied or on whom it will be levied in the case of rented accommodation.  I, therefore, ask the Minister of State to clarify the position.  To compound the problem, neither the NPPR nor the household charge can be offset against rental income.  This surely is another gross injustice.</p><p>The Revenue Commissioners describe rental income as unearned income, even though landlords are operating a business, just like other self-employed persons.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, was questioned in the Dáil late last year and his reply was that Revenue designated rental income as unearned income, as if he was not the Minister for Finance who made the final decisions in this regard.</p><p>Private landlords are asking to be treated fairly.  I refer to the grossly unfair situation where 25% of mortgage interest cannot be written off against rental income, which, in many cases, leads to payment of tax on a business loss.  Where is the equity?  The Minister for Finance and the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, must realise that private landlords cannot continue to be targeted in this way, when their so-called unearned income is being slashed owing to mortgage costs and the continuing reductions in rent supplement imposed by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton.  If private landlords were not providing accommodation for the 700,000 who are renting, the Government would be left to provide accommodation for them.  It is time private landlords were regarded as partners in the provision of housing for those who need it.  Landlords who make a profit will pay tax each year at the marginal rate, with the universal social charge and PRSI contributions, without tangible benefits to them.  They also pay stamp duty when purchasing properties and will be required to pay capital gains tax when selling properties.  All they want is fairness, which they are not getting.  </p><p>I welcome the Minister of State's comments about the deposit protection scheme and minimum standards.  I congratulate her on the work of her office and Department on unfinished housing estates, an issue also prioritised by Deputy Willie Penrose when he was for a short time Minister of State with responsibility for housing.  I note the many good points in the Minister of State's contribution and appeal to her to ask the Minister for Finance to give some consideration to the private landlord who is doing his or her best to provide accommodation for those who need it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-06a.104" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1135" speakername="Caít Keane" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013020600012#L00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State and the debate on the private rented sector.  Historically, the private rented housing sector was described as the forgotten sector.  The Minister of State is changing that perception and the sector can no longer be described as such.</p> <p>The area received little policy attention and as a result the role of private rented accommodation in the housing system went into decline.  Ireland has traditionally had a very high owner occupancy rate compared with peer countries.  By the 1990s, when it peaked, four out of five households had purchased their residence.  The reasons for the strength of the owner-occupied sector can be attributed to cultural and historical factors that have led to a strong desire on the part of Irish people to own their dwelling - "the field" was very important - rather than rent or lease it.  However, this trend has started to reverse in the last five years, no doubt as a direct result of the property crash that began in 2008.  Over the five years to 2011, Ireland not only fell to the EU average of 73.5% home ownership, but crashed through it.  Fewer than 70% of homes in Ireland were owned by their occupants on census night in April last year, demonstrating quite dramatic change in home ownership in Ireland.</p><p>Traditionally, Government policy on housing has had two goals - to provide adequate housing for all and to promote owner-occupation.  As the 1970s and 1980s passed, the goal of promoting home ownership began to take precedence to an excessive and unbalanced extent and culminated in a bloated and unsustainable property sector that inevitably crashed in 2008.  Some people say we were all responsible.  Most of us were, but not all.  Not everybody bought a property.  The housing market now is undergoing the most significant and seismic change since the foundation of the State.  The Government faces the challenge of supporting the transition to a mixed-tenure market that does not prioritise one form of housing tenure over another, that recognises that households' housing needs will change over time and that provides a safety net to assist the most vulnerable to find housing solutions to meet their needs at a particular point in time.  We are all aware of the little matchbox apartments that were built in the city centre.  People are now stuck in them, with no way or means to get out of them.  That is a sector we must cater for as well.</p><p>The critical role of the private rented sector in this regard is explicitly recognised in the Government's 2011 housing policy statement.  There has been rapid growth in the size of the private rented sector, from 156,000 households in 2006 to 305,000 in 2011, according to the Central Statistics Office, CSO.  It is imperative that there be acceptable minimum standards.  These have now been put in place and, indeed, they were being put in place under the last Government.  It is also imperative that those minimum standards are implemented.  The first major reform to the sector was introduced in 1992.  Further reform has been taking place over the years.</p><p>Over the last 20 years, since the first minimum accommodation standards were set down, our expectation as to what constitutes acceptable housing has advanced.  As the Minister outlined, on 1 February 2008 the housing standards for rented houses regulations expired, and landlords were given four years to implement the standards set down under the previous Government.  I compliment the Government on introducing them at the time because what tenants had to put up with was pathetic.  The regulations removed the substandard accommodation which had not been modified or updated for years.  Some of it even dated back to the 1950s.  A Senator related to me today how he went up the stairs of a house and could see the sky peeping through the structure.  That is no longer acceptable.  The new regulations will have a most positive impact on studio flats, apartments and bedsitters that are to be found in period dwellings.</p><p>Enforcement of these standards is a key challenge for the local authority sector but I am satisfied that the new standards provide for much strengthened sanctions and enforcement.  The penalties for non-compliance with the regulations can amount to a fine of €5,000 and/or imprisonment for up to six months.  Many of us come from the local authority sector and we are aware that rules and regulations must be enforced.  The Minister has provided some funding for this to ensure that inspections can take place.  I have the figures for inspections.  In 2011, for example, more than 2,500 improvement notices were issued by local authorities and, while most compliance issues were addressed, 60 prohibition notices were served.  Dublin City Council is particularly active in this regard and it initiated approximately 40 prosecutions in 2012 under the standards regulations.  South Dublin County Council, of which I was a member, has also been quite active, even though it would not have the same capacity of rented accommodation as Dublin city.  However, it carried out 5,192 inspections on rented properties from 2005 to 2011.</p><p>The allocation of funding to local authorities for this area increased significantly between 2005 and 2011, rising from €1.5 million to €4 million.  The Minister has stated previously that in 2012 her Department allocated a total sum of €2.4 million to housing authorities for the purpose of carrying out their functions under the Housing Acts with regard to rented accommodation.  Clearly, funding from the Department is being maintained in this area.  The upkeep of minimum standards of accommodation in the private sector cannot be neglected.</p><p>The Minister spoke about the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB.  That was introduced by the previous Government in 2004.  It was a very necessary initiative.  It has played its role well since its establishment.  It is a significant reform that could not escape reference in a debate on the private rented sector, as it was of profound significance.  There are also provisions in the Act for a dispute resolution service through the PRTB.  This is a very valuable initiative as well.  The Act also sets out clearly the statutory tenancy obligations of landlords and tenants' powers to address anti-social behaviour.  This is an area that must be given huge attention.  In the past week there was media coverage of an estate in County Clare which people were afraid to visit due to anti-social behaviour.  The hand of the local authority is strengthened in this regard to ensure that people cannot run riot in estates.</p><p>In recent years, the State has taken on a major role in the private rental market through the rent supplement scheme.  The Department currently funds approximately 30% of the private rented sector.  The rents are kept under review and reflect current market conditions.  There are approximately 90,000 persons in receipt of rent supplement, for which the Government provided €436 million in 2012.  Revised maximum rent limits came into force on 1 January 2012 and are in place until June 2013.  I understand these limits were set after an analysis of the most up to date market data available for private rented accommodation.  It ensures that accommodation can be secured by tenants under those limits.  The Department of Social Protection continues to work with rent supplement tenants to ensure that their accommodation needs are met and that there will not be an increase in homelessness.  The Minister has dealt with that and I will not reiterate what she said.</p><p>I wish to refer to the shared ownership scheme.  I realise it has been suspended due to the reality of market conditions.  However, there is a clause in the shared ownership agreement which prevents co-owners from sub-letting.  People who have secured jobs in other areas of the country or even in England or elsewhere cannot let out their shared ownership, but must pay their mortgage.  This is not fair or right.  We always talk about what we can do for mortgage holders.  These people are mortgage holders with the local authority.  They are tied into this situation through no fault of their own.  It was attractive at the time, but it is not attractive now.  Their houses and apartments are now empty because of this clause.  It should be revoked and the reality of market conditions should be acknowledged.</p><p>The Minister mentioned the report on deposit retention.  The previous speaker dwelt on the situation of landlords.  As he said, they are providing accommodation which the State would otherwise have to provide.  It is important that the rights of the landlord, as well as the rights of the tenant, are protected.  Where tenants move away leaving big debts, the bill should follow the tenant.  They should not be able to proceed to clean out another landlord in the same way as they cleaned out the last one.  It can become a vicious cycle.  We talk about money following the patient but the bill should follow the patient too in the housing context, rather than leaving the landlord stuck.</p><p>The Minister has inherited the tax situation regarding landlords.  It is an area that must be examined.  Commercial business can offset rates for businesses against income, but landlords cannot do this because rent is not regarded as earned income.  It never was.  The Minister has not been in office for long and has not yet examined this.  That was always the situation, but if it is a rental business-----</p></speech>

One in five households in Ireland lives in private rented accommodation.  We have not had that proportion of people in the private rented sector since the 1950s.  It is a significant turnaround in the housing context, and there is every indication that the number of people renting privately in Ireland will grow rather than decline.</p><p>The Minister of State mentioned that we are living in a time of change in respect of housing policy.</p> <p>Our private rental sector is reflecting very much what is happening in the European and international context, that is, the decline in home ownership.  Social housing provision is also in decline but private rental is increasing.  This presents us with a number of challenges, to which I will refer.</p><p>Let me focus on the positive points.  As stated, the regulation of the rental sector has come a long way.  Having been very much involved at the coalface of housing as chair of Threshold housing organisation - I have worked in housing since the mid-1980s – I note there is no doubt that the private rental sector was very much neglected historically.  It was the sector of those who could not obtain social housing or become homeowners, and was associated with people in transition, such as students or others on their way to home ownership or social housing.  Happily, what has happened over the past decade has been very significant in the evolution of the private rental sector.</p><p>When the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 was introduced, there were many naysayers saying that if one regulated the rental sector, it would cause it to collapse in its entirety.  This has not been the case.  In fact, more robust regulation has occurred hand in hand with more interest in the private rental sector as a place where people, including families, can spend longer periods.  In the past, families would not have considered spending much time in private rented accommodation.</p><p>Some of the positive aspects, particularly regarding the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, were mentioned by the Minister of State.  There have been very significant achievements, including security of tenure.  Many do not realise that, before the introduction of the Act, the maximum security of tenure for a tenant, unless he had a lease, was 28 days, irrespective of the time he had spent in the property.  A property is one's home.  We call rented places dwellings and properties but they are not dwellings and properties for those who live therein; they are their homes and should be regarded as such.</p><p>Since the introduction of the Act, there has been some rent certainty.  A landlord cannot simply increase the rent whenever he feels like it.  Perhaps the most important change has been access to dispute resolution mechanisms.  Many tenants have poor economic means and do not have the capacity of wealthier people to go to court.  This has been a very significant departure.</p><p>The Minister of State mentioned some of the challenges faced by the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB.  I am very much aware of these.  It is easy to criticise the board over some of its failures and to fail to recognise some of its very significant achievements.  As stated, there have been delays, but it must be remembered the board has offered a cheap, accessible service to people who would otherwise not have been able to gain access to the court system.</p><p>With regard to the changes, I very much welcome the review of the Residential Tenancies Act and the measures that will be included in the forthcoming Bill to make the board more effective.</p><p>The Minister of State mentioned the Government's commitment to the deposit protection scheme.  I have campaigned for this for many years.  My support for the scheme arises very much from my front-line involvement with the housing sector.  I have seen at first hand the importance of the introduction of such a scheme.  Aside from the fact that I believe the scheme will make the whole rental sector more efficient and effective, there is evidence that large multinational companies, for example, want the measure introduced because it actually makes renting property in Ireland more secure.  It will actually improve the conduct of business in the country.  More important, over many years a loss has been incurred because of an attitude in society.  To be honest about the matter, some landlords just do not return deposits.  For many, a deposit of €800 may be a life's savings.  I very much welcome the deposit protection scheme to be introduced in the upcoming legislation.  I genuinely believe it will reduce the level of homelessness and, as such, will represent a saving for the State in the longer term.</p><p>The Minister of State mentioned the very welcome change on 1 February, namely, the end of the bedsit.  I have seen some of the coverage in the newspapers and some of the statements by the Irish Property Owners Association implying the measure results in homelessness.  That is absolutely not the position.  As the Minister of State said, landlords have had four years to do as required.  I am aware of a building with 17 bedsits that share three bathrooms.  There is an elderly lady in her 70s who was afraid to leave her room after 6.30 p.m. because she was sharing with a number of men. Consequently, she was using a pot under her bed.  Let us be absolutely honest: that is not the kind of housing in which the poor and people with low incomes should be made live.  It behoves us to abolish the bedsit.  There is nothing fuzzy or cuddly about the bedsit.  It is telling that most people's only experience of a bedsit is as a university student or sharing the floor with a friend overnight.  That is the reality and people should remember it when they talk in warm, fuzzy terms about the bedsit.  This kind of outdated, substandard accommodation has no place in this country.  It now behoves us to ensure that every local authority will take the steps necessary for us to see the end of the bedsit.</p><p>It is not normal in the House to mention an individual but I must mention the work of Mr. Colm Smyth of Dublin City Council, who stands out as a beacon of light among local authorities.</p><p>I ask the Minister to consider the introduction of a certification system that would require landlords to conduct the equivalent of an NCT.  It would put the onus on landlords, rather than local authorities, to ensure their properties are compliant.</p><p>With regard to the transfer of the rent supplement to the local authorities, I very much believe it would be positive to provide for the housing assistance payment.  It would be very positive, both for local authorities and people in receipt thereof.</p><p>My final point relates to arrears in the buy-to-let market.  The threat facing that market is very significant.  For a tenant, a rented property is his home.  Statistics from the Central Bank show that in the region of 20% of buy-to-let mortgages are in arrears.  This is very dangerous.  The number is higher than that pertaining to residential mortgages.  I ask the Minister of State to consider a measure introduced in regard to commercial property under legislation permitting the creation of real-estate investment trusts.  This might allow conglomerates to take over without discommoding the residents.  I refer to portfolios of buy-to-let properties that are being held by the banks.</p><p>I thank the Minister of State for attending.  The work she is doing is excellent and leading to a better housing system.</p></speech>

I wish I had read the first pages of the Minister of State's speech approximately ten years ago because they capture very well what occurs when housing is used as a bubble and a means of acquiring tax-free capital gains and reducing income tax liabilities rather than a place in which to live.  Let us return to a position in which houses are people's residences.</p><p>There are three ways of coping with housing, as the Minister of State said.  The proportion of the total market represented by owner occupancy is now in decline, as is direct provision by local authorities.  Let us consider the position on direct provision.  As evident from a report commissioned by Mr. Gay Mitchell when he was Lord Mayor of Dublin - the reporting group was chaired by the late former Taoiseach Dr. Garret FitzGerald - the difference between the rents and the costs was considerable and there were concerns about the social consequences.</p> <p>The local authority house building programme declined because of these factors.  It was mentioned that tenants had a dependency culture, that maintenance costs were extremely high, that the restrictive practices in the building industry meant it was too expensive for the State to maintain the local authority housing stock and that there was a far higher call-out fee for Dublin Corporation compared to, say, the Northern Ireland Housing Executive.  We then had the splurge of owner occupancy.  </p><p> An article in <i>The Economist</i>on 15 September 2007 entitled, Houses built on sand, noted that Irish house prices in that decade had increased faster than anywhere else, a most unwanted gold medal.  This reflected the banking policy at the time and the factors the Minister of State mentioned about the pursuit of housing as an asset rather than as a place in which to live.  In the article it was estimated that the price of an average house in Dublin had increased from &#8364;104,000 in 1997 to &#8364;512,000 in 2006.  It is probably now back to somewhere around &#8364;200,000, leaving a large number of people in negative equity.  That surge in real estate lending figures after we joined the euro from &#8364;4.8 billion in the base year to &#8364;97.5 billion precipitated the price rise and, unfortunately, the Central Bank of Ireland and the Department of Finance were asleep and the bankers certainly needed better economic intelligence than what they showed.  In many ways, the Minister of State's Department was a kind of downtown office for the construction industry.  Once the building boom kept going, everybody was happy and there was no one to say it was not sustainable.</p><p> We have had to fall back on the private rented sector, for which we have better rules which the Minister of State described.  On the massive boom after Ireland joined the euro, approximately 1.9% of the extra lending was directed at manufacturing or agriculture, while all of the rest of the money went into property-related activities, towards financial intermediation and personal lending.  For example, it destroyed the building society movement, in addition to wrecking the banks and requiring a &#8364;64 billion bailout.  The building society movement was a co-operative, philanthropic body to help people to buy houses.  The Educational Building Society was an example of teachers helping one another to buy houses.  This became probably one of the most corrupt parts of the system, as we know from the examples of the conduct of some of the people involved in running building societies which the Exchequer and the taxpayer are now trying to bail out.  </p><p> The Minister of State should move to get ghost estates and NAMA properties onto the market.  There are 80,000 empty houses which are deteriorating.  In Longford NAMA had a set of houses knocked down. That is crazy in a society which will need these houses.  I would welcome it if property prices fell.  The wage costs caused by property increases would then decline, which would help to develop export-led growth, on which the Minister of State, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and so on depend.  It might mean the banks will need another rescue package, but why artificially make banks look good by keeping properties off the market?  NAMA should be asked serious questions by people like the Minister of State and an evaluation should be made.  We tried to persuade the former Minister of State, Deputy Willie Penrose, to move in that direction also when he held the portfolio.  If we are to make Ireland competitive again, keeping houses off the market to make banks look better is not the way to proceed.  </p><p> Renting represents much better value because of the decline in capital values, although it is tough on those who are in negative equity.  However, it may suit some and it is a more flexible option.  As several Senators said, we are getting back to the normal European pattern.  In Germany the market is nearly 50:50, but we developed this house ownership model - almost a fetish - regardless of the cost and in the process did ourselves serious damage.  I saw a headline in <i>The Sunday Business Post </i>last Sunday stating eight out of ten millionaires around the world had made their first million on a property based transaction.  It might have worked for the individual millionaires, but it certainly does not work for a country and we have just conducted that experiment at huge cost to us all.  </p><p> The Minister of State's rules for better conduct in renting are very welcome and she will find there is support for them in the House.  They represent part of the cure for the economy in a disastrous era in banking and in the context of a property fetish beyond all reason.  These data were published internationally.  We should have known that what we were doing was unsustainable and have had brainier individuals in banks to realise this.  The Minister of State's corrective measures are absolutely right and, as other Senators have said, she will have the support of the House in making a very necessary adjustment.  It is a pity we did not start on this path five to seven years ago.  I welcome the Minister of State's speech and the policy reforms and radicalism implied therein.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-06a.115" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1114" speakername="Deirdre Clune" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013020600015#O00200"><p>I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I would like to raise an issue others wanted to raise in regard to the statement on buy-to-let investors.  Some of the 600,000 homes rented are supported with rent support payments.  The recent statement by the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland encouraging banks to foreclose on buy-to-let mortgages is one we should take very seriously.  Has the Minister of State conducted any research in this regard?  I am sure she is aware of it, but has there been an examination of the impact this could have?  Many buy-to-let mortgages were taken out at a time when banks were encouraging individuals to take out loans.  I will not lay blame in this regard because there is fault on many sides, but families and individuals are dependent on these properties for their homes and should the banks foreclose on them, there will be social consequences for the families and individuals affected.  It is an issue on which others and I have concerns and I have seen it documented.  It is one I want to raise with the Minister of State directly because there will be consequences.  We have heard many contributions from banks and their representatives on how they are moving forward in dealing with individuals who find themselves in difficulty.  These properties are the family homes of many tenants.  This needs to be recognised.</p><p>I commend the Minister of State in many respects.  I mention quality and standards which were highlighted this week as the new regulations came into force on 1 February.   There is a large number of rented houses in Cork city, providing accommodation for students in Cork Institute of Technology and University College Cork.  During the years the standard of some of these houses left a lot to be desired, despite the fact that they were commanding high rents.  The sale value of properties in and around the western suburbs of Cork city was always very high which I am sure was reflected in the income landlords received on them.   Much purpose-built student accommodation was provided in Cork which was of a very high standard.  This, in turn, resulted in improvements in the standard of rented accommodation, which was a positive development.  It was always a contentious issue trying to get the local authorities - Cork City Council and Cork County Council - to inspect, but the level of inspections has improved in a big way.  For a long time, the contribution local authorities received from registration bodies was not reflected in the level of inspections, but the number has increased.  Given that the new regulations have been in place since 1 February, I am sure there will be a spotlight on the issue to ensure inspections happen.</p><p>The rental sector is a very important part of the economy.  The State depends on private rented properties to house individuals it is supporting.</p> <p>The rental accommodation scheme, RAS, is an important element of the housing policy.  I would like to see it encouraged as it has worked extremely well, even though it took a while.  The downturn in the economy has resulted in many landlords approaching local authorities and volunteering to have their properties taken on by the local authorities.  It is a good scheme because it gives protection to the tenants and they no longer have to deal with a landlord.  Landlords also benefit from continuity because a tenant may rent for five or six years.  Local authorities gain because they can guarantee the rent is below market value as a result of a landlord agreeing to let his or her property for 12 months of every year.  That measure also benefits landlords.  I would like the Minister responsible to encourage all of the local authorities to expand the scheme whenever possible.  Nobody wants to rent forever.  Some tenants take a long-term view while for others it is a short-term measure, and this is how the rental support scheme has been described.  </p><p>Rental rates continue to be challenging.  Individuals in receipt of rent supplement find it difficult to access properties, particularly in Dublin and in Cork city.  It is difficult to get landlords to comply with the level of rent required for the scheme.  Landlords are unwilling to reduce rents in many areas.  Tenants who are in receipt of rental income also become used to living in an area and their children attend the local schools, which are factors when it comes to choosing areas.  Tenants may be able to rent a property for less but it would mean moving to a town that is located outside of the city in which they live.  In many cases such a move would have a detrimental effect on families.</p><p>Fluctuating rents continues to be a source of friction.  According to figures I have researched, rents in Cork increased by 2% last year.  The local authorities must compete with the private rental sector and with a young mobile population who work.  At the same time, individuals have been forced out of the city due to fluctuations in the rental property market.  I know the Minister of State is aware of the problem.  It continues to be a source of friction and difficulty for tenants, particularly in areas that now demand higher rents.</p></speech>

I thank her for and acknowledge the good work she has done in this area and I respect her for it.  I watched the monitor when she made her opening remarks.  I noted that she acknowledged the work that was done by her predecessor, Michael Finneran, which is good.</p><p>The Government has made massive progress with the sector over the past 18 months and previously.  Colleagues have referred to the Residential Tenancies Act and to the great changes in security of tenure for tenants.  I am drafting a dispute resolution process.  In a previous life I was a student union officer at Trinity College Dublin so I know about the nightmare scenarios faced by students.  For example, there were poor standards in accommodation and students were at the mercy of landlords because there was no independent dispute resolution process.  However, great improvements have been made.    </p><p>I support the Minister of State's remarks on bedsit regulations.  Four years is plenty of notice, and it is remarkable that anybody would try to justify bedsits in this day and age.  It is incredible to hear about the conditions in bedsits that people had to live in, which persisted for so long.  </p><p>Focus Ireland has made suggestions on how to roll out the new regulations and asked us to do as much as possible to support tenants.  Some of its suggestions have merit and I shall mention some of them.  It recommended that local authorities implement an information campaign to inform tenants about the new regulations and about non-compliant bedsits, and deliver leaflets in areas with a high concentration of bedsits, such as particular parts of Dublin.  A leaflet drop would let people know about the new regulations and advise them about their options.  It could also advise them about housing agencies that would help and urge them to contact their local authorities.  A suggestion has been made that tenants living in bedsits should be fast-tracked for housing needs assessments.  In terms of prioritising people on a housing list, the local authority should consider bedsit dwellers in the same way it does everybody else.  It is important to arrange assessments straight away if we want tenants to move out of bedsits.</p><p>There have been great improvements in tenants' rights, which is welcome, and other improvements are in train.  However, many find themselves experiencing certain conditions.  First, we must identify the landlords.  As Senator Wilson pointed out earlier, the vast majority of landlords have one or two properties.  A large number of them never wanted to be landlords and do not want to be landlords now.  I have two friends who each bought a one-bedroom apartment before they married but bought a house when they started a family.  They rent out both apartments now because they are so deep in negative equity that they cannot sell them.  There are a lot of people trapped in a similar situation.  Many of these families are also tenants because they cannot afford to buy a house.  They must rent a house while renting their previous properties.  People are caught in a messy downward spiral that is the fallout from the property crash.</p><p>Many landlords do not earn money from renting their properties because they are losing a fortune on properties they cannot sell.  It is unfair that they must pay tax on losses from rental income.  At present people must pay the universal social charge on rental income even if they make a loss.  Changes were made to the mortgage interest supplement so now they can only write off 75% of their mortgage interest.  People are paying tax on losses, which is extraordinary when one compares them to multinational companies earning massive profits that can write off every expense under the sun to minimise their tax exposure.  At the same time families are losing money on apartments and houses that they cannot sell and the properties are a millstone around their necks.</p><p>I listened to the debate in the other Chamber on the budget speech by the Minister for Finance.  I was genuinely shocked when he said that the Government had decided to impose PRSI on rental income.  It is incredibly unfair that people must pay PRSI on a loss from next year onwards.  I do not think anyone would dispute that landlords should pay tax if they make a profit from their rental accommodation, but a landlord should not have to pay tax if he or she makes a loss.  That is a basic principle and one that is accepted across the taxation system for companies and everybody else.  At present the only people who pay such tax are landlords, but many of them never wanted to be in that situation and have problems with negative equity properties and mortgages.  I know the Minister of State is a reasonable person and I urge her to ask the Government to reconsider that tax before the PRSI change comes into force.</p></speech>

This morning I had intended to raise homelessness in Dublin city on the Order of Business.  My route to work took me along Talbot Street, O'Connell Street, Westmoreland Street, Grafton Street and Molesworth Street.  Along my way I counted seven homeless people lying in doorways with rucksacks, which is unacceptable in this day and age.  I empathised with their situation because they had to sleep in sub-zero temperatures last night.  As far as I can see, the same problem does not exist in rural areas, but it is a trend in cities.</p> <p>It is something few people are talking about it but the leaders of our country are not talking about it either.  The Taoiseach is committed to the abolition of the Seanad but I do not believe he is committed to dealing with homelessness.  We had an example of that this week in regard to the Magdalen laundries report.  In a few years from now will we look back and say that we were guilty of a crime against our citizens for not dealing with the problem of homelessness?  With the number of empty houses in the country I cannot believe so many people are lying in empty doorways, and we are unable to do anything about it.</p><p> Senator Hayden raised the bedsit issue.  In the 1980s I shared a bedsit with a friend of mine in Dublin which consisted of two single beds, a wardrobe and a cooker.  Today, most people have an <i>en suite</i>that is much bigger.  When I moved to Ballaghaderreen in the mid-1980s I could not get accommodation because there was no rental property in the town.  One person rented a place to me.  It had shutters on the windows, the floorboards were sagging and mushrooms were growing from the ceiling and on the floor.  In fairness, in the 1990s the builders began to provide housing which took a great deal of pressure off the county councils at the time.  More builds then came on stream which took even more pressure off the county councils but in the Celtic tiger era we provided the country with far too many houses.  My town is an example of that because over 200 houses in the town are empty.  I do not know whether to call a housing estate a ghost housing estate if ten out of 90 houses are occupied but 80 of those 90 houses are boarded up.  I do not know whether that was done by the banks or NAMA but the estate is an eyesore.  We need to know what will happen with those houses.  I am aware that in some cases they have been stripped of all the copper and the wiring and are fit for nothing other than to be knocked down.</p><p> I agree with what Senator Power said.  Landlords got sucked into this system in the Celtic tiger era and nobody could see what would happen in terms of a crash.  Landlords bought properties that were over-valued.  Some of them are friends of mine and they have five and six houses but they are not worth one third of the mortgage they have on them.  Most of them are unoccupied because they cannot rent them, and now they are being hit with a second home property tax which is to be replaced by the new property tax to be introduced in the middle of the year.  I know in my heart that some of those landlords are on the point of being driven over the edge, and I have to sympathise with them to a large degree because they were the people who provided accommodation for us when we needed it for our people.</p><p> I had reason to discuss an issue regarding anti-social behaviour with my council some weeks ago and I found that the rules and regulations, if they are accurate in terms of what I was told, are wrong and unfair.  If a family is engaging in anti-social behaviour not in their own estate but in another estate or another town, and if they have been arrested numerous times for everything and anything, they can be housed in an adjacent estate and wreck it.  If they did not engage in the anti-social behaviour in their own estate the council said it cannot do anything about it.  That is staggering.  I think I have about a minute left, a Chathaoirligh.</p></speech>

I mentioned previously that the shared ownership scheme must be examined because as the mortgage part of the shared ownership goes down, the council's share of it goes up.  I am aware in one case that when the mortgage is paid off the tenants will owe the council €35,000.  We need to examine that.  I made a submission on that to the then Minister of State, Deputy Willie Penrose.</p><p>Rent caps must be examined because they are all over the shop, so to speak.  A rent cap for a single person in Roscommon town where one cannot get property is €69 and a rent cap for rural County Galway, just up the road, is €104.</p><p>I agree with the Senator who raised the issue of the second home property tax having to be paid in full for this year even though the new property tax will be introduced in July.  That is unfair.  There should be a way of dealing with it.  If the €200 must be paid for some reason or another, a reduction of €100 in the property tax should be applicable to the person, and the Revenue should deal with that.</p></speech>

I live in rented accommodation.  I am fortunate that I have had a very good relationship with my landlord.  I have not had any problems with him.  It is a very professional relationship but I know not everyone is fortunate to have that kind of relationship.</p><p>Along with other Members I spend a good deal of my time doing constituency work with people who live in private rented accommodation in the private rented sector.  There are concerns about a number of problems that are becoming increasingly widespread in the sector.  The first issue I will touch on is rent supplement and rent supplement reviews.  The dramatic increase in the number of households claiming rent supplement is a direct consequence of the failure of successive Governments to invest in social housing in a meaningful way, and more of that is needed.  As a result of that the cost to the Exchequer from rent supplement claims has reached stark levels.  To cut the cost the Department of Social Protection has cut the rent supplement caps and introduced annual rent supplement reviews.  We are told the purpose of that is to force down the price of rents in the rental sector but there is growing evidence that the impact of these cuts and reviews is to force low-income families deeper into poverty as they struggle to meet the rent shortfalls from their low salaries or social welfare payments.</p><p>I am aware of two cases where young mothers were made homeless as a result of the rent supplement reviews that left them unable to afford their rental accommodation.  In one case, six months on the family involved are living with family as they are unable to find suitable accommodation at the rates offered post the review.  Has the Minister's Department conducted any research into the impact of the rent supplement reviews on the caps, rent levels and household poverty and financial hardship?</p><p>The other issue that is emerging as a growing problem is buy-to-let properties about which Members spoke earlier and those properties being placed in receivership by banks when the owners default on their mortgages.  I am aware some rental tenants are being left in an uncertain, insecure position as both the receiver and the landlord are demanding rental payments.  If the tenant transfers rent payments to the receiver there is not an automatic guarantee that the receiver will accept all of the landlord obligations outlined in the tenancy agreement or honour the return of the deposit.  In light of that I ask the Minister of State if she would consider requesting the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator to develop a code of conduct for the banks and receivers detailing the obligations the receiver takes on when appointed to a rental property, including respect for the duration and terms of the tenancy agreement and honouring the tenant's deposit.</p><p>Many of the other issues have been dealt with and I do not want to cover old ground when other Senators wish to speak.</p></speech>

I will be brief and to the point.  In fairness to the previous Minister, former Deputy Michael Finneran, and the previous Government, the 2004 Act was revolutionary.  It created a new dimension to rental markets and gave rights in what was a haphazard and landlord-driven scenario prior to that.  I find it amusing that we spent 800 years trying to eliminate the absentee landlord only to replace the absentee landlord with landlords of our own who were very cruel in certain respects.  However, the vast majority of landlords are very good people who are doing their best.  They usually own second or third homes and they are doing their best to provide quality accommodation for their tenants.</p> <p>Where I live in County Clare we have a large number of holiday homes.  People rent a house for nine months and are expected to vacate it for the following three months.  During those three months the landlords can get a large amount of money from renting as a holiday let on a weekly basis.  I do not know what can be done but it appears unfair that a house can be rented to a person from 1 September to the end of May and then he or she must leave for the three months of the summer.  That is certainly an issue.</p><p>I would have a concern about the fees paid to the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  It is an expensive process for landlords.  The fees were increased recently.  The fee was €70 for a tenant who was registered in the first month and increased to €140.  I understand those amounts were increased recently.  Obviously the landlord is the person who pays the fee.  If one is in difficulty there are probably good resolution mechanisms in place.  I believe it is an expensive process and the PRTB should be made to reduce its fees.  For the vast majority of small landlords who try to do their best, they would prefer if the money spent on registration was used to paint or raise the standard of their properties.  Unfortunately, I have to attend a committee meeting but I will listen to the Minister of State's response later.  She is welcome to the House and I ask her to keep up the good work.  From my experience she is one of the very good Ministers of State.</p></speech>

She has done much good work in her Department since her appointment and we wish her well.  It is a challenging Department involving as it does the whole housing area and the manner in which housing and homes are changing.</p><p>During the Celtic tiger people purchased dwelling houses for investment purposes.  Some of my friends would have purchased houses as a pension pot for their retirement.  Unfortunately, the situation has changed dramatically and those people who invested in such properties are in negative equity and paying the same level of mortgage as in the boom years.  Those who were most culpable in enticing people to invest in such properties were the bankers.  We have all heard the stories of the period from 2000 to 2008 where bankers received incentives for enticing people to take out mortgages.  The banking and financial sectors campaigned throughout the country to incentivise people to take out mortgages, buy a car and go on holidays, all of which people did in good faith.  Those bankers are not being held accountable but the individuals concerned are left with the properties.  Many of those properties are rented in the private property sector which is an excellent resource for individuals who are not in a financial position to provide properties for themselves.</p><p>It is interesting to note the home ownership rate in Ireland is 73.5% compared with 26% who rent.  Of the 26% who rent, almost 15% rent at lower than the market rate and 11% rent at the market rate.  Those figures are comparable with those in the UK and Belgium.  In Austria the rate of home ownership is only 57%.  In Ireland there was always a culture of home ownership which drove the initiative during the years when people invested in property and now find themselves in a very difficult position.  As my colleague, Senator Averil Power, outlined they face a multitude of difficult scenarios this year, next year and in the following years.  A very difficult situation arises where a person who invested in a property and is struggling to service the loan associated with it is providing that property as a home for somebody else.  Obviously that person has legal obligations to ensure the home meets the desired standard as set out in the 2004 Act, which the Minister of State is proposing to amend.  It is unreal that the State is asking those who are in a loss-making position, struggling to pay a mortgage and under pressure from a bank, to pay additional taxation.  That does not make sense.  Unless that issue is addressed people will hand the keys back to the banks to deal with the consequences.  They will not be in a position to pay the mortgages on those properties if continuing charges are imposed on them.  I ask the Minister of State to examine that issue as the private rental accommodation sector is crucially important to those who are renting as it is a home.  </p><p>For example, in Foxrock in Dublin, people may have borrowed for a very large property or built or purchased a large property and due to no fault of their own, perhaps losing one job, they have to move out of the property and rent it and move into a smaller rented property.  That is happening in the city of Dublin and in other parts of the country.  This area is a minefield.  If new legislation is being brought forward the Minister of State will have our full support.  However, I urge her to look at the issue in as broad a context as possible and to meet the Irish Property Owners Association which has made valid points and must be listened to as it has a legal obligation to protect the tenants who are renting from the association.  It is doing that as the law is in place to protect the tenant and the landlord.  It is important to take all those issues into consideration in the new changed environment in which we find ourselves.</p></speech>

One of the most important issues facing the Government is housing - social housing and private rented accommodation.  In the past, people alluded to the "flatland" which was part of Dublin for many years.  As a student in Dublin, Ranelagh was known as "flatland" because everyone had a bedsit there or stayed in a bedsit with friends or family.  That day should be gone.  I am pleased the minimum standards regulations have been introduced as I do not think we can expect anyone, no matter what the age, student or pensioner, to share sanitation and cooking facilities in old run-down properties.  I am sure landlords will come up to the mark and, if not, the law will apply to them equally.</p><p>In regard to the private rented sector, I sympathise with many landlords who got into the business as a long-term investment.  It is good for the economy that they would provide long-term accommodation.  In Ireland people get into the property market for a short-term profit.  I can only relate the experience of the housing estate where I live in Letterkenny.  I have noticed over the years that people came in and bought a property which they sold a year later and  probably got €50,000 or €60,000 equity.  </p> <p>Many of these houses were bought up by investors leading to half of the houses on the estate being owner-occupied with the other half rented.  This is a pattern that was repeated across the country which destroyed many estates.  One upside of the economic downturn is that people are choosing to keep their homes for longer which gives estates a sense of community.  Many of us will have attended resident association meetings one year only to note the following year all the members had left because they had moved on.</p><p>As a member of the Simon Community in the north west, I am delighted the Minister of State will include voluntary housing associations in the Residential Tenancies (Amendment)(No. 2) Bill 2012.  Some claim there is no homelessness in certain areas.  However, the definition of homelessness is not just confined to someone living on the street under a cardboard box.  It also includes those who have nowhere to stay but reside temporarily with friends or have left home.  There is a significant homeless population that does not come on the radar.  Organisations such as Clúid, Threshold and Simon are playing an important part in getting these people who county councils cannot always assist into accommodation.</p><p>When I was a county councillor in Lifford, I was on record for praising the former Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Michael Finneran, for the rental accommodation scheme, RAS.  It was much better for people to get accommodation under the scheme as it tended to be clean and new, as well as being monitored by the county councils.  Senator Ó Domhnaill's colleagues on the council did not praise their own Minister but I did as he was concerned with the housing issue and did much good work on it.  This is being continued by this Government.</p><p>Will the Minister of State clarify the position of the private-rented sector with the property tax which will replace the non-principal private residence charge?  Many landlords have invested in their properties and we need to clarify their position on the tax.  Many citizens will also be renting for the long term now too.  In Switzerland, probably the most stable economy in the world, private home ownership has not gone beyond 38% in the past 60 years.  Ireland is probably going in that direction.  Many of our citizens under the age of 35 have no desire to own a property but wish to have a job and settle down.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-06a.134" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1153" speakername="Catherine Noone" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013020600019#S00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and commend her on her work.  The introduction of minimum standards and obligations for the private-rented sector is to be expected.  I welcome the ongoing drive to secure standards as the four-year phasing-in period that has been allowed for existing rented accommodation under the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008 expires.  On 1 February, we said "Goodbye" to the original bedsit which is a good development.  Rented accommodation will also be required to have fixed heating appliances controlled by the tenants in every room, another basic standard.  The new regulations reflect the requirements of a modern and much more complicated renting market.  Senator Power alluded to this and I know many of my peers own properties which they are renting out.</p><p>I commend Dublin City Council for its positive record in enforcing the regulations.  It initiated 40 prosecutions in 2012 under them.  There is a major imbalance in liability for property tax, however.  As Senator Wilson pointed out, landlords have paid the NPPR in March 2012, will have to pay the property tax in July 2013 and a subsequent water tax in 2014.  While it is to be welcomed that the local property tax is a tax deductible expense, it is not proposed to provide legislative backing for this immediately but introduce it on a phased basis, according to the Minister for Finance.  We need to address the balancing of rights between landlord and tenant in this regard in a more holistic way.  Landlords are perceived to be wealthy but most people now realise - or should realise - that they are in a worse financial position than the tenant with many just trying to keep their heads above water.  As Senator Ó Domhnaill said, many of them are in loss-making positions and suggested they hand back the keys.  The banks do not want the properties as they will have to find a way to make the property work.  Ultimately, everyone loses.</p><p>While I commend the Minister of State for her work and welcome the regulations, we need a much holistic approach to the current private-rented sector.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-06a.135" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1132" speakername="Marie Maloney" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013020600019#S00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and her commitment to the deposit protection scheme.  More than €30 million was paid by the Department of Social Protection in rent deposits for social welfare recipients between 2006 and 2012.  Many of the deposits could come between €500 and €1,000 but sometimes they were even higher.  Normally, deposits are refunded at the end of the tenancy but none of the moneys in the case of social welfare recipients' deposits has been returned to the Department.  The Department does not know whether these moneys are withheld by the landlord or by the tenant.  Obviously, a tenant may move on to new accommodation and needs a deposit for it.  However, if they move back home, move in with a partner, leave the country and, accordingly, do not need a deposit, then the money should be returned to the Department.  Considering that 50% of tenants bringing disputes to the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, are rent supplement tenants and almost three quarters of disputes, 72%, relate to deposits, it is clear some landlords are profiting from retaining State moneys.  The State cannot continue to waste such resources as these moneys could be used to assist others.</p><p>The introduction of a deposit protection scheme would ensure that deposit moneys would be returned to the State at the end of a tenancy.  It would also ensure deposit moneys would only be paid to landlords who have proved a legitimate claim to the moneys either because the tenant was in rent or utility arrears or caused damage to the property.  I know the Minister is considering a range of options provided by Indecon.  However, I would suggest the Department does not lodge the moneys with the deposit protection scheme but rather provide a guarantee that the moneys would be available should the landlord have a legitimate claim.  This could be effectively done by a bond similar to the one for developers when they are developing an estate.</p> <p>They lodge an insurance bond.  The Department could do the same and this would mean it would have the use of the money during that period rather than the landlord having the use of the money.  The landlord would have the security of knowing that if things go wrong with his tenants, backup would be secured in the form of the bond.  I call on the Minister of State to consider this proposal for the Department of Social Protection because we need the money circulating in the country rather than sitting in a landlord's bank account.</p><p>I could speak all day on housing issues.  Having been a county councillor I am aware of the issues affecting people.  The affordable housing scheme was a great way to get people into their own private rented accommodation but it is now closed.  The banks are approving mortgages again.  Will the Minister of State consider the re-introduction of the affordable housing scheme?  I know for a fact that in Killarney four houses available under the affordable housing scheme could not be allocated to people because they could not get a mortgage.  The four houses have remained empty for the past two or three years.  They should be transferred to social housing or the affordable housing scheme should be re-opened.  Either way the houses should be given out because people are crying out for accommodation while many houses remain empty.</p><p>I know of a young man who left home and moved into a flat but he could not get rent supplement because he had to get a letter from the Garda stating that he could not live at home.  I realise this is more an issue for the Department of Social Protection.  It is a terrible thing to ask any young person to get a letter from the Garda stating that he could not live in the family house because of trouble at home.  I could speak all day on the matter but I realise another Senator wishes to contribute.  I call on the Minister of State to take on board those suggestions.</p></speech>

I wish to highlight one experience of my own.  Some two years ago, I visited a family in a three-storey premises in Dundalk.  They lived at the top but the bathroom was at the bottom.  Senator Keane referred to poor accommodation as well.  The family of three included a husband and wife living on the top floor, where it was possible to see the sky.  They had to move the mattress when it rained at night.  Thankfully they have been accommodated by Dundalk Town Council in a new home.  However, I wish to alert the Minister of State to the fact that there are bogus landlords who do not meet any standards or regulations.  In some cases they will not rent accommodation to someone entitled to a rent supplement.  One of the questions possible tenants are asked is whether they will be applying for rent supplement.  Dreadful accommodation is still available and if it is in one town it is in all towns.</p><p>Someone referred to anti-social behaviour.  Houses are being rented out by landlords in private estates on a weekly or weekend basis.  They are being used to accommodate ten or 12 people.  They are taken up by boys and girls who come to a three-bedroom home for the weekend, for example, and pay €1,000.  Can we stipulate to landlords who meet the standards that there should be a limit on the number of people who can be accommodated in a two-bedroom, three-bedroom or four-bedroom home?  In some cases, ten, 12 or perhaps more are living in houses for the weekend and engaging in anti-social behaviour which is impacting on residents nearby.  Such people are in town for a hen or stag party.  Can we limit the number of people and state that landlords should not accommodate hen parties for a weekend?  Is it possible to legalise that?  I am particularly concerned about this issue because I come from the tourist town of Carlingford where such anti-social behaviour is occurring every weekend.  What responsibility rests with a landlord to ensure that anti-social behaviour does not take place in the house he or she is renting out for the weekend or the week?  I commend the Minister of State on the work she is doing.  Coimeád ag obair.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-06a.138" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1061" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="13:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013020600020#T00300"><p>I thank all Senators who contributed to the debate for the positive support for the progress being made.  I particularly appreciate the support on the matter of bedsits, which has come from all sides of the House, because we are keen to ensure that we improve standards.  There were several common themes among the contributions and I will address these and refer to some of the individual Senators as well.</p><p>One theme raised by Senator Wilson related to the difficulties for landlords.  I appreciate that there are difficulties for landlords.  Senator Keane and others referred to the fact that we are trying to strike a balance.  There are issues for landlords and tenants and we are keen to ensure that we address the issues on both sides.  A number of Senators referred to the difficulties for landlords.  Part of this area is not under my responsibility but under the responsibility of the Minister for Finance.  However, I am a member of the Cabinet sub-committee on mortgage arrears, as is the Minister for Finance.  Representatives from the Central Bank of Ireland and the Financial Regulator attend these meetings as do several other Ministers and senior officials from various Departments.  That is one forum for addressing the difficulties of landlords and the issue of distressed mortgages in the buy-to-let sector.  There are genuine difficulties here and I recognise that they exist.</p><p>Senator Barrett remarked on the extent of the emphasis on investment in the property sector instead the productive sector of the economy.  We are trying to address that.  He also raised the issue of the NAMA units, as did other Senators.  We are trying to get these NAMA units on the market.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, and I meet representatives from NAMA from time to time.  We are trying to get some units for the social housing sector and we have had some success.  I was in Drogheda last week visiting people who are in NAMA units.  NAMA is also working to ensure it gets property into the private market as well, although perhaps we should put more pressure on it in this regard.</p><p>Issues of enforcement and inspections were raised by several people.  There was much commendation for Dublin City Council.  I agree it has carried out some very good work on inspections and enforcement and we are positively encouraging this.</p><p>Issues of money and funding were raised, mainly by Senator Conway.  The Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, is self-financing but a percentage of the money is allocated to the local authorities for inspection and enforcement.  We expect the local authorities to spend this money on inspection and enforcement.  Dublin City Council has led in this regard as have the local authorities in Cork, to which Senator Clune referred.  A court case arose in Cork recently in Bishopscourt which vindicated rights of residents in that area and that is to be welcomed.  We are putting an emphasis on inspection and enforcement.</p><p>Another issue raised by several Senators on both sides was the prevalence of anti-social behaviour.  There is a problem with the law at the moment because of a court case which struck down section 82, a provision which had been used by housing authorities to address anti-social behaviour.  We need to address that issue.</p><p>Senator Brennan referred to issues of overcrowding where it may lead to anti-social behaviour.  I will have to get back to Senator Brennan with regard to whether we can specifically address overcrowding.  I am keen to address issues of anti-social behaviour because it causes real misery for residents, tenants, neighbours etc.  It is a difficult problem to resolve but the PRTB has some powers in this area.</p> <p>If we can address this issue, whether in the context of legislation or otherwise, we will certainly consider doing so.</p><p>I compliment Senator Hayden on her wide knowledge of this area.  She raised specific issues regarding the certification system.  We would probably need a lead-in time if we were to address the issues raised because they would place certain obligations on landlords.  The writs for the buy-to-let sector touches on the other issue I referred to earlier.</p><p>I will address the general issues raised in regard to housing if I have time but first I want to speak about deposit protection because it is a central part of what we want to achieve in this legislation.  I am minded to introduce amendments in the Seanad rather than on Committee Stage in the Dáil in order to allow them a full airing.</p></speech>

Several good schemes have been put in place in Britain and Northern Ireland has recently introduced a scheme.  We still have quite a bit of work to do on the measure but I intend to have it ready to bring before the Seanad.</p><p>  Senator Reilly raised the issue of rent receivers.  My Department has entered discussions with the banking sector to clarify the responsibilities of rent receivers <i>vis-à-vis</i> landlords and we intend to produce clear guidelines for lenders and tenants in conjunction with the Irish Banking Federation.  I acknowledge the problems that arise with shared ownership.  It arises in some counties more than others.  Senator Keane referred to the practice of letting out properties and issues also arise in regard to substantial repayments on moneys borrowed by local authorities in earlier times.  The payback is now falling on those who are in shared ownership schemes.</p><p>  The issue of caps on rent supplement is not the direct responsibility of my Department but reference was also made to the rent allowance scheme.  The Department of Social Protection is monitoring market values.</p><p>  Senator Kelly raised the issue of ghost estates.  We are working hard to address this issue.  A sub-committee has been established in my Department to deal with ghost estates and we are gradually reducing the number of estates that are in bad condition, in conjunction with the various stakeholders.  It is true to say that a small number of estates will never be brought back to any kind of use but where we can we are working very hard with NAMA and local authorities to remediate them.</p><p>  Senator Moloney raised an important point in the context of deposit protection.  The State is paying for many of these deposits through community welfare officers and the money is not returned in many cases.  This is one of the reasons we should establish a deposit protection scheme.  Deposits involve State money as well as individuals' hard earned savings and they can contribute to homelessness if they are not returned when tenants attempt to move elsewhere.  I will take on board the Senator's suggestion regarding a bond rather than cash for State deposits.  We have not gotten far enough in drafting the proposal to determine exactly how we will achieve that.  We are also examining the issue of left-over units on the affordable housing schemes.  It does not make sense to leave empty houses that were intended for sale under a scheme which may no longer be affordable.  We want to find ways of bringing those houses back into use.</p><p>  I think I have addressed all the issues raised.  I apologise if I left anything out and I will revert to Senators if I have not responded to them.  I thank Senators for their wide knowledge and interest in this area.  Considerable progress has been made already but more can be done.  We intend to make progress with the legislation that is currently proceeding through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We also intend to work on enforcement because there is little point in introducing rules if they cannot be enforced.  We are conscious of need to achieve a balance between the rights of tenants and landlords and we will address both sets of rights in the legislation in so far as we can.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-06a.149" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013020600022#V00700"><p>I am very pleased to present this Bill to Seanad Éireann.</p><p>At its peak during the Second World War, the Defence Forces had approximately 42,000 serving personnel.  Over the course of the war, it is estimated that over 7,000 members of the Defence Forces deserted, many to join with the Allied forces.  Of these, some 2,500 personnel returned to their units or were apprehended and were tried by military tribunal.  The remaining personnel, numbering some 5,000, were the subject of dismissal under the Emergency Powers (No. 362) Order 1945 and the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act 1946.</p><p>The Emergency Powers (No. 362) Order 1945, which was signed by the then Taoiseach on 8 August 1945, provided for automatic dismissal from the Defence Forces of certain deserters and absentees without leave.  The order also provided for forfeiture of pay and allowances and a condition that every person to whom the order applied should be disqualified for seven years from holding any office or employment remunerated from the Central Fund.  This was subsequently enacted by the Oireachtas in the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act 1946.</p><p>The effect of the order was to impose significant hardship on many individuals and families.  It removed from them the right to be tried for the offences of which they stood accused and to provide a defence against the alleged crime.  Many of the individuals were shunned in their communities and many never returned to Ireland.  Indeed, it is understood that some of those who were the subject of the order had actually died in combat.  The majority of the individuals impacted by the order have now passed on, while those still alive are now in the twilight years of their lives.</p><p>It was against this backdrop that in June 2012, and following a detailed consideration of the issue, the Government concluded that the sacrifice and contribution of those who deserted from the Defence Forces to fight on the allied side in the Second World War should be recognised, while not undermining the requirements of military discipline or in any way condoning their desertion in a time of national emergency.  In this context the Government committed to issuing an apology for the manner in which those members of the Defence Forces who left to join the allied side during 1939 to 1945, were treated after the war by the State and to seek to provide a legal mechanism that would provide an amnesty to those who absented themselves from our Defence Forces for that reason.  It is these individuals that the Defence Forces (Second World War Amnesty and Immunity) Bill 2012, seeks to address.</p><p>The ability of the Defence Forces to maintain the high standards demanded of them requires complete clarity with regard to the exercise of command authority whether at home or abroad.  To maintain standards and rise to the challenges of a military environment and all of the associated tasks, it is important to uphold a chain of command that is clear and unambiguous at all times.  This is critical to the maintenance of unit cohesion and operational effectiveness.  In that regard, it goes without saying that the Defence Forces must retain the power to enforce discipline through its own unique code of discipline within the military justice system.  This disciplinary code must be efficient and effective and, above all else, it must be fair to the individual.</p><p>In common with armies across the world, desertion from the Defence Forces is regarded as a very serious offence.  It is at the heart of the system of military discipline that when an individual takes the solemn oath at the commencement of his or her career that he or she cannot decide to just up and leave or fail to be available to perform duties.  While this is very much the case today, it would especially have been the case at a time when the world was at war and our troops were on stand-by to defend our country from invasion.</p><p>Before elaborating on the Bill, it is important to put on the record the fact the Government recognises the value and importance to the State of the essential service given by all those who served in the Defence Forces throughout the Second World War.  They performed a crucial duty for the State at a time of national emergency and enormous difficulty.  The loyalty of the Defence Forces to the State is indispensable.  It is essential to the national interest that members of the Defence Forces do not abandon their duties at any time, especially at a time of crisis, and no responsible Government could ever depart from this principle.</p><p>Accordingly, it is important we acknowledge that throughout the Second World War the majority of men chose to stay in the Defence Forces and serve their own country.  These members were engaged in important service for their country and it is crucial that nothing we do now in any way diminishes or undervalues their loyalty and the service given by them to the State.</p><p>Having said that, I believe it is accepted by most people today that the majority of those who deserted the Defence Forces during the Second World War and who went on to fight against fascism did so out of a sense of idealism and with a commitment to protect democracies from tyranny and totalitarianism.  Had there been a different outcome to the Second World War, there is no reason to believe this State would have been immune to invasion.</p><p>In seeking to address the question of desertion during the Second World War, the Government has already acknowledged that the war gave rise to circumstances that were grave and exceptional.  Members of the Defence Forces left their posts at that time to join the allied side in the fight against tyranny and, together with many thousands of other Irish men and women, these individuals played an important role in defending freedom and democracy.  Those who fought on the allied side also contributed to protecting this State's sovereignty and independence and our democratic values.  It will be accepted by all in this House that in the almost 74 years since the outbreak of the Second World War, our understanding of history has matured.  History teaches us lessons that can sometimes only be learnt with the benefit of hindsight.  The actions of those taken long ago, for whatever reasons, are not beyond re-evaluation.</p> <p>Those actions can now be considered free from the constraints that bound those directly involved at the time and without questioning or revisiting their motivation.</p><p>I have stated previously that the exploits of the men who left the Defence Forces to join the allies have been politically airbrushed out of our contemporary history.  However, given the greater insight and understanding now of the shared history and experiences of Ireland and Britain I believe the time is right for the role played by these brave volunteer Irish veterans to be recognised and the rejection they experienced understood.</p><p>From the remove of 2013 it is not easy to imagine the difficult decisions that people made when they consciously decided to leave Ireland to join the Allied Forces during the course of the Second World War.  During that period Ireland decided to remain neutral but it is safe to say that at the time anti-British feeling was still running very high.  Despite the level of anti-British feeling that without doubt existed it is not generally known that over the period of the Second World War an estimated 60,000 individually motivated citizens from the Twenty-six Counties left these shores to serve as volunteers in the British armed forces.  Others migrated to England to participate in the war economy.</p><p>While at the end of the war many of those who chose to fight with the allies stayed on and sought to build lives for themselves in England, many more returned to Ireland.  There is no doubt that many veterans returning to Ireland at the end of the Second World War were met with grudging acceptance.  However, it is also clear that others faced hostility.  This was particularly true when the individual was known to have deserted the Defence Forces.  For all such people, the honour and celebration which they may have experienced at the end of the war in England contrasted sharply with the changed circumstances of their return.  There was no flag-waving nor any cheering masses to greet them here.  Instead, they were faced with difficulties in seeking either employment or social assistance and many of their countrymen and women remained suspicious towards them long after their return.</p><p>Before detailing the specific provisions I wish to re-emphasise that the Government does not condone desertion and fully recognises, values and respects the contribution of all those who stood by their posts with the Defence Forces and pledged their lives to defend the State's integrity and sovereignty against any and all aggressors.  In any consideration of the matter we should bear in mind the principle that such decisions cannot be left to the individual discretion of individual soldiers on active service and that all soldiers must accept that there are consequences for desertion.</p><p>I will outline the specific provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 outlines the definitions for the purposes of the Bill.  Section 2 provides an amnesty for members of the Defence Forces who deserted or were absent without leave during the course of the Second World War and who subsequently served with forces fighting on the Allied side in that war and who: were dismissed from the Defence Forces by the Emergency Powers Order 1945; were convicted of desertion or being absent without leave; or were or are liable to be prosecuted for desertion or being absent without leave.</p><p>Senators will note that the Bill provides for an amnesty for those convicted of desertion or being absent without leave rather than a pardon, as was originally envisaged by Government.  This change has been made for technical reasons and is in line with legal advice provided to me during the drafting process by the Attorney General to the effect that a pardon would require that each case be individually processed, a situation that clearly is not possible in practical terms today.</p><p>Section 3 provides an immunity from prosecution for members of the Defence Forces who deserted or were absent without leave during the course of the Second World War and who subsequently served with forces fighting on the Allied side in that war.  Section 4 provides that no right, liability or any cause of action shall arise resulting from the enactment.  Section 4 also provides that the amnesty being provided in section 2 will not have the effect of a pardon under Article 13.6 of the Constitution.  Section 5 provides for the Short Title of the Bill.</p><p>I am satisfied that the Bill as drafted fully meets the Government's commitment to deal in a positive way with the issue of those who deserted our Defence Forces to join the Allied forces during the course of the Second World War and that it does so in a way that does not expose the State to any liability in respect of those individuals.  I am pleased to submit this legislation for the consideration of the House and I look forward with anticipation to hearing the views and contributions of Senators in their deliberations and reflections on the Bill.  I commend the Bill to Seanad Éireann.</p></speech>

I compliment the Minister on bringing forward this legislation.  Fianna Fáil will not oppose the Bill, which provides an amnesty for those who deserted the Defence Forces during the Second World War to fight on the Allied side.  Nonetheless we believe a mature reader of history will appreciate why it was necessary, in the context of the time, to impose severe sanctions on deserters.</p><p>  It is important to note the background to the Bill.  Last year, the Minister, on behalf of the Government, apologised for the manner in which those members of the Defence Forces who left to fight on the side of the Allied Forces during the Second World War from 1939 to 1945 were treated afterwards by the State.  That was a progressive and important statement from the Minister.  The Minister also stated that in addressing the question of desertion during the Second World War, the Government acknowledged that the war gave rise to circumstances that were grave and exceptional.  At the time, the Minister, Deputy Shatter, stated:<blockquote>Members of the Defence Forces left their posts at that time to fight on the Allied side against tyranny and, together with many thousands of other Irish men and women, played an important role in defending freedom and democracy.  Those who fought on the Allied side also contributed to protecting this State&#8217;s sovereignty and independence and our democratic values.</blockquote>  It is worth noting that during the Second World War the State decided to take a neutral stance.  It is fitting, bearing in mind that historical decision, that this amnesty should come into play.  The Minister stated that no distinction was made between those who fought on the Allied side for freedom and democracy and those who absented themselves for other reasons.  That was an important statement by the Minister as well.</p><p>  In the 73 years since the outbreak of the Second World War our understanding of history has matured.  The Minister said that we can re-evaluate actions taken long ago free from the constraints that bound those directly involved without questioning or revisiting their motivation.  The passage of time has diminished considerably the number of people who are alive to avail of the amnesty.</p><p>  The Minister may have covered this point in his speech but I note that at the time it was estimated that approximately 6,000 or 7,000 men deserted the Defence Forces.  Apparently one in six of those who deserted went to join another army and fought in the war.  Approximately 5,000, or one in eight, of these men went to join the British army.  At the time the Defence Forces amounted to 42,000.  Therefore, one in eight of the Defence Forces joined the British army and fought in the war.</p><p>  It is important to note the remarks of Éamon de Valera to the then Minister in 1948.  He stated:<blockquote>Desertion is a very serious offence, as I am sure he will be the first to admit.  According to the regulations, it is a matter for which every deserter is liable to be court-martialled and get very severe punishment.</blockquote>  That statement and others were made in the era after a world war which had been rampant throughout Europe and the greater world.  Since Ireland was on the periphery of Europe such a statement was necessary and the laws extant were there for good reason.  Thankfully, with the development of the European Union and the expansion of the Union to 27 countries, it is something we seldom reflect on and acknowledge, but that since that war and despite our economic woes at the moment the Union has brought peace and stability to the entire continent.  In my younger days I would not have envisaged the collapse and fall of the Berlin Wall.  Major developments have taken place since then.</p><p>  At the end of the war we were lenient in making it known that courts martial were not going to take place.  Successive Governments, especially at the time, did not actively pursue those whom, it was well known, had deserted the Defence Forces.  Nevertheless, we had to establish and show that the offence could not be tolerated.  It is important to note and put these matters in context when discussing the Bill.</p> <p>It is vital to put all the events of the war and subsequent peace in Europe in the proper context.  We should not forget that when the Second World War broke out, Ireland had been independent for only 17 years.  The Civil War created serious divisions on this island and major problems for the fledgling nation.  If we could turn back the clock we might take a better course in history.  Some people have criticised de Valera for his stance on neutrality but he was also making a clear statement of our independence as a small nation.  Our decision to remain neutral was read as an anti-British stance but the reasons went much deeper.  When we reflect on history, we see that Éamon de Valera made a brave decision which saved thousands of lives and prevented the country from undergoing the type of ravaging that has not happened since Cromwellian times.  His decision also received widespread public support at the time.</p><p>In welcoming the Bill on behalf of my Fianna Fáil colleagues, I note that the current size of the Defence Forces is tiny compared to its size the 1940s.  The strength of the Defence Forces was approximately 40,000 then, compared to no more than 8,000 now.  There have also been many changes in the Defence Forces.  I will not criticise the Minister tonight about barracks closures.  These debates have taken place, much as the closures may be regretted, and the primary role of the Defence Forces is now peacekeeping on foreign soil.  The Army is more advanced, with better technology, and a slimmer version of what it used to be.  In the context of a Bill dealing with amnesties, immunity and prosecution, we should acknowledge the tremendous work the Defence Forces have done over the years in Cyprus, the Congo and elsewhere.  They have made us proud of their peacekeeping missions and this is recognised well beyond the boundaries of Europe.  I acknowledge the significant contribution they have made to peace in several countries in Africa and beyond.</p></speech>

The Bill provides a pardon and amnesty to those who absented themselves from the Defence Forces without leave or permission in order to fight on the Allied side during the Second World War.  The Government has apologised for the manner in which these individuals were treated by the State after the war.  It recognises the value and importance to the State of the essential service given by all who served in the Defence Forces throughout the war.  They performed a crucial duty for the State during a period of national emergency and enormous difficulty.  The loyalty of the Defence Forces to the State is indispensable.</p><p>In addressing the question of desertion during the Second World War, the Government acknowledges that the war gave rise to circumstances that were grave and exceptional.  Members of the Defence Forces left their posts to fight on the Allied side against tyranny and, together with many thousands of Irish men and women, played an important role in defending freedom and democracy.  Those who fought on the Allied side also contributed to protecting the State's sovereignty, independence and democratic values.  </p><p>In August 1945 the Government of the day used an emergency powers order to address the issue of members of the Defence Forces who had absented themselves during the war by summarily dismissing them from the Defence Forces and disqualifying them from holding employment or office remunerated from the State Central Fund for seven years.  Individuals were not given an opportunity to explain their absence.  This remained the position following the transposition of the emergency powers order into an Act of the Oireachtas in 1946.  No distinction was made between those who fought for freedom and democracy on the Allied side and those who absented themselves for other reasons.</p><p>Our understanding of history has matured in the years since the outbreak of the war.  It is time for understanding and forgiveness.  In recognition of the shared history and experience of Ireland and Britain, it is right that the role played by Irish veterans who fought on the Allied side be recognised and the rejection they experienced be understood.  To that end the Government is resolved to provide a legal mechanism to offer an amnesty to those who absented themselves from our Defence Forces and fought with Allied forces in the Second World War, and to pardon those who were individually court-martialled.  This will, however, be achieved without undermining the general principle regarding desertion, as the Minister has explained. </p><p>The Bill will provide that the pardon and amnesty do not give rise to any right or entitlement or any liability on the part of the State.  As the Minister has emphasised in extending this amnesty and pardon, the Government does not condone desertion and fully recognises, values and respects the contribution of all those who stood by their posts in the Defence Forces and pledged their lives to defend this State's integrity and sovereignty against any and all aggressors.  I welcome that the measure has support from both sides of the House and I look forward to its speedy passage.</p></speech>

I first raised this issue in the Seanad in November 2011 because, in the context of our preparations for the centenary celebrations of the 1916 Easter Rising, I felt it important to draw the attention of the House to a forgotten, although no less brave, cohort of men.  In granting a pardon, the Minister has made an historic decision for which he should be congratulated.</p><p>  During the Second World War almost 5,000 Irishmen left or deserted the Defence Forces to join the British Army to fight for democracy and the future and freedom of us all.  Many of these brave men never made it home.  The book <i>Spitting on a Soldier's Grave</i> details the suffering some of these men endured in camps.  Some of their children received special treatment in orphanages in Ireland because they were the children of deserters.</p><p>  In August 1945, the then Government, headed by Éamon de Valera, circulated a list of almost 5,000 servicemen it labelled as deserters under the Emergency Powers (No. 362) Order 1945.  The list was a blunt political tool which denied these men their constitutional right to defend themselves in an Irish court.  Membership of this list meant a person was barred from government employment for seven years and had to forfeit any pay due.  Appallingly, it was the ordinary squaddie who was tarnished, because officers were exempt.  Ordinary working-class lads, some of whom had been decorated for valour, were punished for their part in the fight against fascism.  Fine Gael, in Opposition at the time, appealed for their pardon but then Taoiseach, Éamon de Valera, and the Minister for Defence, Oscar Traynor, refused.  Since then there has been a great movement to have these people pardoned as an act of compassion.  I am aware that the Minister has been considering this matter since summer 2011 and I am delighted that he has concluded this process and granted the pardon.  For the 100 veterans left alive and their families, this announcement will go some small way to ease the pain they have endured over the years.  We should acknowledge these brave men who fought with idealism and commitment to protect democracy from tyranny.</p></speech>

Those troops have been celebrated and admonished by historians and viewed as both traitors and heroes by different ends of the spectrum.  During the Second World War, Ireland, or Éire as it was known then, held neutral status.  Recently, I was reading that in the early 1800s, half of the British Army was Irish, because of the people of both countries being so similar.  Dublin was a military base for the British Army and provided soldiers to it.  Many of these soldiers probably came from families with a tradition of joining the British army, a tradition many families here had before the formation of the State, for family reasons, for financial benefit or in order to acquire a trade or pension.</p><p>Hundreds of these Irish soldiers deserted their positions in the Irish Defence Forces at the time and crossed the Border into Northern Ireland or travelled across the sea to Britain to join the ranks of the British Army, British navy and British air force.  The Minister may have figures on how many may have joined the US army also.  It would be interesting to see those figures if available.</p><p>Regardless of their motives for deserting their Irish positions and taking up new roles in the British armed forces, it would be naive to believe they were singularly driven to fight the spread of Nazism in western Europe.  The better pay and conditions were surely a factor for many men with large families at home to provide for and many came from large families that could not keep them at home.  Many of the men who deserted from the Irish forces to fight with the British, American and other Allied forces were killed or wounded in the cause of liberating Europe from Nazism and fighting Japanese imperialism in the Far East.</p><p>Those who subsequently survived the Second World War and returned home, were found guilty by a military tribunal or were unable to be prosecuted for desertion or being absent without leave and were dismissed from the Defence Forces pursuant to the provisions of the Emergency Powers (362) Order.  Furthermore, these soldiers found they were barred from employment by the Irish State and as a result they suffered numerous hardships throughout their lives.  This carried on to their families and the stigma carried on with them for generations.  Approximately 100 of these men are alive - I am not sure whether any women are involved - and they deserve the recognition alluded to by the Minister.</p><p>I am very proud this Government and Bill acknowledge the Second World War gave rise to grave and exceptional circumstances.  Irish citizens who left their posts to join the Allied side against Nazism and fascism played a key role in defending the freedom and democracy of the people of Europe and Asia.  In fighting with the Allied side, Irish deserters, by extension, protected a militarily weak Irish State and its sovereignty and protected independence and democratic values from far right oppressors.  We should be proud of the Irish men, our compatriots, who left their posts and took great personal risks to oppose the biggest threat to democracy that Europe had ever faced.  </p><p>The brutality of the Second World War was on a scale unimaginable to later generations of Irish men and women.  I hope this Bill allays the concerns of the remaining Second World War veterans and is part of a phase of proper remembrance for our fallen citizens, not only those who died in the Second World War, but the 49,000 Irish men who fought and died in the First World War and those who survived the inconceivable horrors of the trenches.  I welcome the Bill and believe it will give some relief to the many men and families conscious of what happened.  Most citizens probably do not know what happened these men, but the Minister has highlighted the issue and it will be a good day's work if the Bill is passed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-06a.157" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013020600025#Y00200"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  Like other Senators, I warmly support the Bill, which is part of the reconciliation between North and South within this island and between east and west.  It is part of a wider reconciliation also and as Senator O'Donovan said, the EU 27 was formed to ensure we do not  have further outbreaks of war like the First World War or Second World War.</p><p>  The timing of this Bill is right.  This is Holocaust week, commemorating the dreadful events of that time.  These events were also commemorated in the Mansion House last Sunday and outside the Bundestag there is a massive memorial to the Holocaust.  We are all coming to terms with what happened in the Second World War and this Bill takes the right direction.  Senator Harte's father, Paddy, played a major role in the memorial to Irish soldiers at Messines, which reconciles the different traditions on this island.  We had the successful visit of the Queen of England and her husband and co-operation was manifest at the Islandbridge ceremonies during the summer where the Army and veterans conducted services honouring the veterans.  The same happens on Remembrance Day in St. Patrick's Cathedral.  At that ceremony, I met people from west Cork whose sons had died recently in Afghanistan and met a man from Mayo whose brother had died in Afghanistan.</p><p>  This connection has been strong and it was exercised in the service of freedom and democracy.  The Minister is convincing that the original regulations were necessary.  If all 42,000 members of the Defence Forces had left, the State would have been left unprotected.  However, it is now time to lay that aside.  The Bill is neatly phrased and states in section 2 that &quot;we recognise we have been unduly harsh&quot;, &quot;we apologise for the treatment&quot; and &quot;it occurred in special circumstances&quot;.  It provides for exoneration in respect of the acts and immunity from prosecution.  In section 4 it states that this &quot;does not confer a right on any person&quot; or &quot;create any cause of action&quot; or &quot;impose any liability on the State or on any person&quot;. </p><p>  This is a fine piece of legislation in the spirit of the times.  I would like to draw the attention to one slight issue.  Page 4 of our briefing states there were 80,000 Irish soldiers in the Allied army in the Second World War, but the Minister's page 4 states there were 60,000.  Perhaps the two historians will confer to decide which figure should be brought to the Dáil.  This all refers to the past.  In the present time, relations between the traditions on this island have never been better and improve daily.  This Bill is another step in that direction.</p><p>  There is a more serious dissertation, which is beautifully covered in the Tom Kettle poem dedicated to his daughter, as he suspected he would not survive too long in World War One.  He wore the uniform of the British Army.  He says: <blockquote>You'll ask why I abandoned you, my own,<br />And the dear breast that was your baby's throne.</blockquote>Why did he?  He continues: <blockquote>So here, while the mad guns curse overhead,<br />And tired men sigh, with mud for couch and floor,<br />Know that we fools, now with the foolish dead,<br />Died not for Flag, nor King, nor Emperor,<br />But for a dream, born in a herdsman's shed,<br />And for the Secret Scripture of the poor.</blockquote>This is very moving.  He knew he would never see his daughter again and that she would feel he had deserted her.  His expression is so much more vital to the human condition than deserting countries and he was deeply moved to write this.</p><p>  Francis Ledwidge too, who liked County Meath so much that when he got a job in Dublin he walked home to Slane one evening, fought in World War One.  He said he joined the British Army &quot;because she stood between Ireland and an enemy of civilization and I would not have her say that she defended us while we did nothing but pass resolutions&quot;.  This is a reconciling part of this beautiful island and great country we share.  Perhaps we should think of some way to celebrate the 100 veterans Senator O'Brien mentioned and cherish them as part of this great nation.  I welcome the Minister's initiative and am sure he will have the support of all of the House.</p></speech>

I thank him for his contribution and welcome the proposed legislation.</p> <p>In an hour or so the Minister will be debating the current Garda cutbacks and relocations with the House, perhaps in a more robust fashion, but this is a more reflective and conciliatory debate.  We are discussing the events of the Second World War.  In the course of history we should be mindful of the comments of one of the former leaders of the Chinese Communist Party.  I cannot fully recall his name and certainly could not pronounce it, but he said it was too early to assess the significance of the French Revolution.  Similarly, we have to do a lot of further deep thinking about Ireland's role, or non-role, in the Second World War.  The specific Bill being introduced by the Minister relates to a small number of people who deserted the Irish Army during that time.  This humane and realistic legislation strikes the right balance between attempting to right what most people see as a wrong and expressing once again our support for and thanks as a nation to all those who have served in the Defence Forces.</p><p>In this country we did not call the Second World War a war - we called it &quot;the Emergency&quot;.  Before we sneer at such terminology, we must remember and recognise that it was a time before the Internet, colour television sets, mass media, Twitter and Sky News.  It was difficult for many people, even at high levels of the Government, to appreciate fully the slaughter, terror, mass murder and killing that was commonplace across the continent of Europe.  The Second World War was entirely different from the First World War.  While millions of people were tragically killed during the First World War, it moved at a snail's pace, as Senator Fidelma Healy Eames said.  The technology of war had advanced by the time the Second World War started.  This facilitated mass murder on a entirely different and more horrific scale, as evidenced by the dreadful concentration camps of eastern Europe.  At this time, the Irish Government was a relatively new institution in a very new state.  It was inevitable that the Government of the time was defensive and inward-looking.  As Senator Denis O'Donovan said, just 17 years had passed since the end of the Civil War.  There was a sense of tension and fear among the political establishment.  Perhaps it is more understandable than it should be, therefore, that we decided almost to ignore what was happening across the continent of Europe.  We tried to put our own little Iron Curtain around the island and look after our own affairs.</p><p>A number of people who were serving in the Irish Army at the time decided that the State's approach was not good enough and took the difficult and dangerous option of fighting for the British Army on the continent of Europe.  The figures presented by the Minister seem to indicate that the majority deserted to join the British Army.  A small number simply walked away from the Defence Forces.  I recognise how difficult it was for the people concerned to remove themselves from their own national army and move into an entirely different theatre of military engagement, where death and destruction were a daily inevitability for so many.  Many, if not all, of them went to war to defend democracy and fight fascism, which must be lauded.  We have to recognise, as the Minister did in his very balanced contribution, that as a nation we were still hugely dependent on, and must be thankful for, the Irish Army.  The LDF served side by side with the Irish Army in almost every town and townland.  This created a great sense of national unity during the Emergency.  The LDF played a part not just in a military sense but also from a community perspective.  It had its role also.</p><p>I welcome the legislation that the Minister has introduced.  It is appropriate, fair and balanced.  The people who left our shores to fight on foreign fields were no lesser Irishmen, or no less committed, than those who had stayed at home.  They took the road less travelled, which was the far more dangerous one.  It is right, many years later, that we are recognising that they were patriots, too.  We must try to wipe the record clean as far as they are concerned.</p></speech>

I welcome and commend the Minister who I know has a particular interest in this period of history.  This is an extraordinarily generous gesture on the part of the Government at this remove.  It might not seem like a lot, but it is.  I know that the Minister has spoken out somewhat critically against the actions of the Irish Government after the Second World War, particularly with regard to those who survived the Holocaust.  I share his view.  It was a shameful episode.</p><p>  It is appropriate in this context to consider the dynamic entrepreneurship and creative energy that our immigrant population has brought to this country.  As a former emigrant, I have worked in the environment in which one makes a contribution to the country of one's adoption that is far in excess of that one might make at home.  To a degree, I can understand from where the Minister is coming.  I should declare an interest in so far as I am a member of the Connaught Rangers Association.  I have visited the battlefields of northern France and Belgium and been to the very spot where Francis Ledwidge was killed.  It was a most random act.  As Senators will recall, he had worked as an engineer with Meath County Council and his expertise was being put to good use because he was leading a group of soldiers who were widening a road when a shell randomly landed in the middle of them.  It was a terrible tragedy.</p><p>  I would like to mention one little quibble I have.  I appreciate that two thirds of the Minister's speech was in defence of the proud contribution the Defence Forces made during the Second World War.  I do not want to quibble with this in any way, other than to say I found one paragraph rather interesting.  He said:<blockquote>From the remove of 2013 it is not easy to imagine the difficult decisions that people made when they consciously decided to leave Ireland to join the Allied Forces during the course of the Second World War.  During that period Ireland decided to remain neutral but it is safe to say that at the time anti-British feeling was still running very high.</blockquote>I do not dispute that analysis, but it should also be mentioned that Ireland was not the only country to declare neutrality.  The Low Countries also declared neutrality.  Holland, Belgium and Luxembourg were all invaded by Nazi forces and dragged into the war as a result.  The British spent two fruitless years trying to get the United States to enter the war, but it refused to do so, although it did bring the Lend-Lease system into operation.  In fairness, President Roosevelt did a lot to help the British war effort surreptitiously.  Official America was, however, totally opposed to getting involved in the European war.  It was not until the attack on Pearl Harbour that the United States engaged with it.  Japan had become part of the Axis powers and aligned with Hitler and Nazism.  I mention this because I always consider a certain revisionism is creeping into the history of Ireland's neutral position.  As a small island off the shore of mainland Europe, Ireland was still in the throes of trying to declare its separate identity having come out of the Civil War 17 years earlier.  The Irish should not have been neutral, but that is neither here nor there.  As a student of Second World War history, particularly the enormous horrors Nazism imposed on the peoples of Europe, I am conscious of the circumstances of the time.  During the period about which we are talking Britain stood alone against the forces of fascism.  In that context, one can understand why people left the Defence Forces.</p><p>  I am grateful to Dr. Bernard Kelly whose book, <i>Returning Home</i>, about the lack of welcome those who had fought during the Second World War received when they returned home, I commend to all Members of the House.  I am also grateful to Dr. Michael Kennedy, the executive editor of the Royal Irish Academy's documents on Irish foreign policy, who has written widely on Ireland and the Second World War.  According to Dr. Kelly's book, some 60,000 Irish men and women joined the British forces to fight against fascism.  Some 9,000 Irish citizens died during the war.  In this debate we are talking about the 12,000 who returned to Ireland.  As the Minister indicated, it seems that the rest wisely chose to stay in the United Kingdom.  <i>Returning Home</i> outlines the massive economic, social and psychological problems that these veterans faced for the rest of their lives.</p> <p>For the 5,000 men who deserted the Defence Forces to join the British Army, poverty, joblessness and social exclusion were their reward.  The book explores how Irish ex-servicemen coped with the frosty welcome they received when they came back to Ireland, the difficult task of reintegration, economic difficulties and psychological problems.</p><p>Dr. Kennedy raises a number of interesting questions.  Who were the deserters?  How many of them fought with the Allies is still unknown.  Who they were is also a mystery.  We know them only as a category.  Apart from the voices of one or two individuals who have gone on record, we cannot and perhaps never will be able to tell which of them joined the Allies from the list of names and deserters published by the De Valera Government after the war.  This was not known in 1945 and it is not known now.  It is often assumed, according to Dr. Kennedy, that all of the deserters on the list fought on the side of the Allies, but his research suggests they did not.</p></speech>

Dr. Bernard Kelly's book, <i>Returning Home</i>, argues that the Emergency Powers (No. 362) Order 1945 was unnecessary in reality because, as they were without Defence Forces' discharge papers, those who had deserted could not get State jobs, which is a rather interesting historical twist.  I am sorry I do not have more time to devote to this issue.  I, again, commend the Minister's initiative in this regard.  I know he has a personal feeling about these matters dating from that period.  Although there are only 100 survivors left, at least it will bring some comfort not only to them and their families but also to the families of those who have not survived to this time.  From that point of view, I overwhelmingly welcome this initiative and wish the Minister well.</p></speech>

It is only proper that we seize the opportunity to address the injustice experienced by those members of the Defence Forces who left the country to fight with the Allies and help those affected as a consequence in the most appropriate way.  For these reasons, I warmly welcome the legislation and congratulate the Minister on introducing it.</p><p>It is almost three quarters of a century since the outbreak of the Second World War and the events of that time seem to belong to a very different era.  One of the major changes to have taken place is in our relationship with our nearest neighbour, Great Britain.  During the Emergency the idea that a British monarch would be warmly welcomed to Ireland or that &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; would ever be sung or heard in Croke Park would have been considered completely impossible and beyond belief, but this has happened.  The idea that someone would leave the Defence Forces to fight with the Allies struck at the heart of what was considered to be patriotism and was dealt with in a most harsh and cruel way.  We now have the opportunity to re-evaluate the reasoning and the actions of long ago.  While the bravery and loyalty of the members of the Defence Forces who remained at home is widely acknowledged, it is only right that those members who left to fight with the Allies should equally be acknowledged.  It is a measure of our continuing growth and maturity as a nation that we recognise the importance of granting this amnesty.  I sincerely hope those who still survive and all of the families involved will feel that, finally, a wrong has been righted.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

On my own behalf and that of Sinn Féin, we welcome this legislation which we will be supporting.  It is appropriate recognition of the wrongdoing of the State at the time and a fitting gesture for the families of those who were stigmatised owing to the Emergency Powers (No. 362) Order 1945.</p><p>  The Second World War was, notwithstanding the neutrality of the State, a significant event in Irish as well as European history.  It affected all Irish people, North and South, in a variety of ways.  It was a time of considerable sacrifice and hardship in Ireland during which there were bombings in Belfast and on the North Strand.  As we know, many thousands of Irish people, from North and South, were killed in battle during the war.</p><p>  Some 80,000 citizens from the South volunteered to join the British Army during the course of the war.  Of between 6,000 and 7,000 men who deserted the Defence Forces at the time, approximately 5,000 joined the British Army.  They did so for many reasons, but for very many, fighting the evil of fascism was the foremost motivation.  Many of them died in battle and their sacrifice is now remembered in an annual commemoration.  It is also important for us to be vigilant in regard to the rise of fascism in our time, given what is happening in many European countries and the rise of far right parties in many countries across Europe.</p><p>  Those who survived the war returned to Ireland to face a difficult and cold future.  In October 1945 the Government of the day used powers under the Emergency Powers Acts 1939 to 1945 to issue the Emergency Powers (No. 362) Order 1945 which provided that any member of the Defence Forces who had deserted or absented himself or herself from service without being granted official leave for 120 days or more during the Emergency period should be dismissed from the Defence Forces for desertion.  The order meant the summary dismissal of some 5,000 members of the Defence Forces.</p><p>  The order also stipulated that those dismissed were disqualified for seven years from any public or Civil Service employment, including employment with local authorities or a position on any board or office established by statute such as the ESB.  They also lost many of their pension entitlements and access to unemployment assistance payments under the Unemployment Insurance Act 1945.  Pursuant to section 4(<i>a</i>), a &#8220;List of personnel of the Defence Forces dismissed for desertion in the time of National Emergency pursuant to the terms of the Emergency Powers (No. 362) Order 1945&quot; was circulated to all major public bodies and Departments.  It effectively functioned as a blacklist.  During the course of the debate on the order it was characterised as a sentence of starvation and those affected were blocked from public employment and receiving State assistance.  The State was happy to consign them to penury.</p><p>  The manner in which the order was issued was also disproportionate and disposed with the ordinary judicial code for dealing with desertion from the armed forces under the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act 1923 and instead used the Emergency Powers Act to punish a particular group of deserters <i>en masse</i> without a court martial.  They were denied an opportunity to defend themselves and their reputation.  This was very wrong and contrary to the norms of fair procedure.  The amnesty is an acknowledgement that the treatment received as a consequence of desertion is now considered to have been unduly harsh and an acceptance that the acts of those who deserted occurred in the special circumstances of the Second World War.  They did not deserve the treatment they received; they did not deserve to be stigmatised, isolated and effectively blacklisted from public employment, as well as social society.  Aside from the not inconsiderable trauma and upset the stigmatisation caused those affected by the order and their families, many also suffered hardship and poverty.</p><p>  The Government of the time was one that showed little regard for human rights and due procedure.  There were other categories who suffered grievously owing to its brutal use of special powers.  In particular, I note the inhumane treatment of republican prisoners during and after the war.  Three prisoners died while on hunger strike to protest at the conditions in prison camps at the time.  They were Seán McCaughey, Jack McNeela and Tony D'Arcy.  The inquest into the death of Seán McCaughey heard that he had not been outside in the fresh air or sunlight for four and a half years and had been kept for months on end in solitary confinement.  In challenging the prison doctor Seán McBride, counsel for the next of kin, asked if he would treat a dog in such a manner.  The doctor replied that he would not.  While the Minister may see this as a matter for another day, which I accept, the State has never properly acknowledged the maltreatment of such prisoners.  The Minister should give the matter careful consideration. </p><p>  I fully support what the Minister is attempting to do.  As previous speakers said, there are 100 survivors who will benefit from this measure.  Because many others have, unfortunately, passed away, it is important for their families also.  I hope the Bill will pass through both Houses of the Oireachtas quickly and without amendment in order that we can support the survivors, in particular, and the families of those who have passed away.</p></speech>

Many who deserted went on to fight, as others have said, against fascism.  Many were driven by a commitment to protect democracy from tyranny and dictatorship, as has already been stated by my colleague, Senator Mary Ann O'Brien, who raised the issue here last November.  I commend her on taking it before the House.</p><p>Last year, the Minister apologised on behalf of the State in the Lower House for the manner in which those members of the Defence Forces who left to fight on the Allied side during the Second World War were treated after the war by this State.  He promised to introduce legislation to grant pardon and amnesty to those members of the Defence Forces.  I recognise the value and importance of their military contribution to the Allied victory.  It is only right and fitting to introduce this legislation to grant pardon and amnesty to those who absented themselves from the Defence Forces without leave or permission to fight on the Allied side.  </p><p>In his statement today, the Minister commended the Defence Forces at home who performed a crucial duty for the State at a time of national emergency, enormous difficulty and great hardship.  He acknowledged the loyalty of the Defence Forces to the State and that it is indispensable and essential to the national interest that members of the Defence Forces do not abandon their duties at any time.  Those who fought on the Allied side also contributed to protecting this State's sovereignty, independence and democratic values.  Like other Senators, I acknowledge the significant peacekeeping record of our Defence Forces in faraway places like Lebanon, the Congo and Namibia.  Many of them paid the ultimate price and lost their lives on peacekeeping missions in those foreign fields and are to be congratulated.  As a young man, I remember a soldier telling me he was heading for the Congo.  I had to look up an atlas to find out where the Congo was.  I said I would never see him again.  Tá mé beagnach críochnaithe.  Níl ach leathleathanach fágtha agam.  The Bill is a stand-alone Bill.  I congratulate the Minister.  He said he would do it and he can give me a tour in this House any time.  </p></speech>

This is an important piece of legislation.  I am very conscious that the vast majority of individuals whom it addresses have now passed on.  It has relevance for their families - their children and grandchildren - because it recognises the fact that they did something to the benefit of this State by participating in the Second World War.  Senator Mooney made a very interesting point when he made reference to other states that declared their neutrality during the Second World War and promptly found themselves invaded by Germany.  None of us should be naïve about that particular matter.  It is something that if said from this position some years ago would have been a great cause of controversy but I suspect it is nothing other than reality now.  If the Battle of Britain had been lost and Germany had invaded Great Britain, this island was next and our neutrality would have provided us with no protection in that context.  That was the lesson the neutral states in Europe learned at a very high cost.</p><p>A very personal aspect of that to me is a map prepared in 1941 which detailed the proposed liquidation of Jewish communities across Europe.  A copy of that map exists in Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial centre in Jerusalem.  What is interesting about that map is that it contains details of the estimated numbers of Jews in every European country designated for extermination.  The number of Jews in Ireland was not left out.  The number designated for extermination in Ireland on that map was 4,500, which is very close to the actual numbers in the Irish Jewish community.  That was a map put together by Adolf Eichmann as part of the planned liquidation of Jews in Europe and one can be pretty certain the accurate inclusion of the Irish Jewish community in terms of its numbers was not just an idle addition.  </p><p>As Minister for Defence, I am very conscious of the importance of discipline within our Defence Forces, the importance of the command structure applying and the importance of individual members of the Defence Forces not making individualised decisions and failing to do their duty.  It is of as much importance to the State domestically that the Defence Forces do their duty today as it was at the time of what Senator Bradford referred to as the Emergency.  It is important that they do their duty and obey orders when on UN peacekeeping missions as we have people around the world and it is important for their safety that they do that.  However, these were exceptional times and individuals made what must have been for them extraordinarily difficult decisions.  They placed their lives at risk and a significant number of them died.  In the context of the figures given by Senator Mooney, we do not know how many of those who died simply joined the Allied Forces or deserted the Irish Army and then joined the Allied Forces.  However, they lost their lives and in doing so, they assisted in the Allied victory and indirectly assisted in protecting the sovereignty and independence of this State.  It is appropriate at this historical juncture that we recognise that.  In this new world in which we live, it is appropriate that we recognise the extent of the connectivity between the islands of Ireland and Great Britain and the extent to which the lives of people on this island and neighbouring ones have interacted and the contribution made by those both North and South to the Allied side during the Second World War.  </p><p>I very much appreciate the support expressed by Members of this House and the fact that some of them, including Senator Mary Ann O'Brien, are on record expressing views with which I agree on this particular issue.  I appreciate that this measure, as do all measures coming before this House, has the full support of my Cabinet colleagues.  We are making a small bit of history with this Bill in the context of reconciling the two islands and acknowledging that people who have been hidden in the shadows of the history of this island should be acknowledged and recognised and that a tribute should be paid to the role they played in years gone by.  Senator Cullinane is right in saying that we need to be vigilant about the rise of fascism.  </p> <p> I do not believe any of us envisages, in the short term, the rise of another government in Europe dominated by fascists.  However, there is certainly a small number of people in public life and the political system across Europe who are prepared to express particular views and resort to racism and anti-Semitism in seeking personal, political publicity and electoral support.  This is something of which we, as Europeans, must be conscious.  It is an issue I discussed at the first informal meeting of European Justice Ministers held in Dublin Castle two weeks ago.  More needs to be done to ensure that not only will we continue to be vigilant in our commitment to protecting human rights and the ethos and democratic principles of Europe but also that we will unite to make certain there will not be a growth in racism, anti-Semitism and the attitudes which led to the disaster of Nazi Germany in the 1930s and gave rise to a greater disaster across the Continent.</p><p>For some reason, I seem to keep returning to the points raised by Senator Paschal Mooney.  I am going to have to stop talking about the Senator who made reference-----</p></speech>

It is an excellent book which I read some time ago.  It is a very interesting account of the contribution made by those who fought in the Second World War.  I recollect that Mr. Kelly also considers a slightly earlier period in history, namely, the First World War.  As Minister for Defence, I have visited different states and found that there is a history of people born in this state, from 1922 onwards, and on the island of Ireland, prior to 1922, who fought in foreign armies on foreign fields on the side with which most people on this island would identify.  When I visited the war museum in Australia, I looked at the walls and discovered lists of those who had died in the First World War and the Second World War.  The number of Irish names on these lists is extraordinary.  Not all of them were second, third or fourth generation Irish.  If one examines the history of Australia in the context of the two world wars, one will discover that many Irish emigrants in the 18 to 35 year age group joined the Australian army and fought in these wars.  There were also those who joined the armies of the United States and Canada.  I have read a number of books on this subject, some of which dealt with the United States, some with Canada and others with Australia.  However, all of the information has not been brought together in one publication.  In years gone by an extraordinary number of young people who had emigrated from Ireland and never had any intention of joining up and fighting in navies, armies or air corps ultimately did join and fought in either the First World War or the Second World War.  That is an extremely interesting and important aspect of our history of which we should not lose sight.</p><p>  I thank those on all sides who spoke during the debate.  I must make special mention of my Fine Gael and Labour Party colleagues for being supportive of things I do on occasion which might create difficulties for them.  I extend my thanks to all other Members of the House.</p><p>  This is an important Bill.  When it has been enacted, it would be nice if we could invite some of those who fought in the Second World War who are still with us and very elderly to come to the House for some celebration.  I do not know whether it would be possible to do this or whether we would be in a position to identify and invite the appropriate people.  Perhaps Senators might give some thought to the matter, particularly as it will be some weeks before the Bill is passed by both Houses.  The objective is to have it enacted before Easter.  It might be a nice way to pay tribute to people who are still with us and had adventures in foreign fields which were important to the State and are part of their history and that of their families.  For far too long, those to whom I refer did not receive the recognition they deserved.</p></speech>

It is with deep regret that we must offer our sympathy to the family of the late Garda Adrian Donohoe who was murdered in County Louth.  When I read the Sunday newspapers, I was deeply concerned by certain comments and statements, either made on the Minister's behalf or by others, in this regard.  The headline in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> indicated that the Minister had been asked to stay away from the home of the late Garda Donohoe.  Will the Minister confirm if this was the case, either directly or indirectly?  If so, it is a hugely significant and worrying departure for him.  Is he aware that the family and colleagues of the late Garda Donohoe were extremely angry at the insensitive closure of approximately 95 Garda stations the day after the funeral?  I hope he will comment on this.  Furthermore, one of the newspaper articles referred to what was, perhaps, a flippant, throwaway remark.  The article was about a remark some people say the Minister had made in the ante room of the Seanad about how many Garda stations he could close in ten minutes.  If he made that remark, it might be appropriate for him to apologise for it during this debate.  I do not think he intended to make it or if he did, it is very regrettable because it certainly does not augur well for policing in rural Ireland.</p><p>  Does the Minister accept that there has been a significant drop in morale in the past 12 months among rank and file gardaí?  This is a matter of serious concern.  Does he accept that the Garda is under-resourced in respect of modern technology and state-of-the-art equipment?  It is even alleged that some of the guns carried by gardaí are outdated.  Although the Minister has said he is providing new Garda vehicles, Garda cars are not up to the mark in matching the vehicles being used by the criminals we are all trying to fight.  Does he also agree that a significant reason, although not the sole one, that the Garda Representative Association, GRA, and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, AGSI, are pulling out of the Croke Park talks is the closure of Garda stations, what has been described as the Minister's abrupt manner towards rank and file gardaí and a lack of faith in his stewardship?  It is a very regrettable move.  I would prefer if the Garda representative bodies stayed at the talks and it is a matter the Minister could appropriately address tonight.</p><p>  I have tabled a number of motions in the House because I feel passionately about this issue.  I supported the Minister on and welcomed the last six Bills he brought to the House, but the closure of rural Garda stations is a huge concern for me and the area where I live.  He has attributed the prime blame to the Garda Commissioner, Mr. Martin Callinan, for the policy of so-called smart policing and the closure of 140 Garda stations nationwide.  Obviously, they were not all rural Garda stations.  Given that the Minister has ultimate responsibility for dealing with crime, is it not a convenient derogation from the Minister's responsibility to deal with it?  If the Commissioner is the driving force, it might be appropriate for the Minister to have a word with him in this regard.  In the light of the closure of Stepaside Garda station in the Minister's constituency and the fact that over 2,000 people came out to protest against this last week, will he now reconsider this rather daft and ridiculous policy of closing these Garda stations?  He has already conceded in the House that there will be little or no financial saving as a result.</p><p>  Does the Minister accept that the continued mothballing of the Templemore training college and the reduction in the number of gardaí are a recipe for disaster and that this does not rest easily with rank and file gardaí or the general public?  I will give an example of the closure of rural Garda stations.  The electoral area I previously represented on the council, the Bantry electoral area, contains the peninsula of Mizen Head which is roughly 35 miles long from Skibbereen to the end, the Sheep's Head Peninsula and the Beara Peninsula.  There are two resident gardaí covering these areas.  If a garda in the main station in Bantry or Skibbereen answers an emergency call to attend a burglary or stave off some criminal activity, some of these peninsulas are more than an hour's drive away; therefore, this is very regrettable.</p><p>  As I am aware the Minister has a keen interest in this matter, I am putting my question not to entrap him in any way but to get to the truth.  Is he concerned about the lack of progress in the investigation into the appalling and dastardly murder of Garda Donohoe?  There are reports that it is known who the people are.  The Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, is involved and it is said to be a Border gang, with members from the North and the South.  I am concerned at the lack of progress in having some of the people concerned brought in, arrested and charged, if it is known who they are.</p><p>  There are large areas of rural Ireland, Goleen being an example of one such remote rural area, where not only will there be no Garda station but also there will be no garda living in these areas.  There are 27 or 28 gardaí in Bantry Garda station, but 18 of them do not live anywhere near the town.  Gone are the days when if a garda was stationed in Bantry or Skibbereen, he or she lived there and worked within the community.  The concern I am expressing on behalf of community groups is that where there is a large rural area where no garda lives in it and the Garda station is closed, it is not good enough that a garda who is unknown to the community comes into the area on an <i>à la carte</i> basis.</p><p>  Is the Minister concerned that there is growing anger and discontent among the general public at the breakdown of law and order in communities?  Does it trouble him that the closure of many banks and post offices in rural areas will encourage crime and heighten fear among vulnerable and older communities?  There will be a tendency to keep money at home.  I tabled a motion on the closure of the AIB branches in Schull and Ballydehob on the Mizen Peninsula.  I realise it is not the Minister's area of responsibility, but there appears to be no joined-up thinking.  I call on the Government to seriously consider the appointment of a senior Minister with responsibility for community, rural and Gaeltacht affairs, as was the case up to the last general election.  That is significant because rural communities believe they have no voice.</p><p>  I am not being parochial but simply trying to give the Minister a picture of what is happening in rural areas.  On the Mizen Peninsula about 14 years ago there was the appalling murder of the beautiful French lady, Sophie Toscan du Plantier.  Her family were there last weekend for a service; they come every year.  Will the Minister convey my concern and that of the community at the lack of progress in solving that appalling crime?  It was a senseless and brutal murder and people are wondering if the file on it has been closed or if it is an ongoing case.  It is a matter of concern for many in rural communities that the murder remains unsolved.  There were reports and investigations by the Garda into what had gone wrong.  Is the Minister concerned that there was bad policing on the part of the Garda in the pursuit of a particular person who is widely accused of committing the crime?</p> <p>I ask the Minister to reconsider and re-evaluate his policies with regard to the management and resourcing of the Garda Síochána before it is too late and another innocent garda or citizen of the country is murdered.</p><p>I have raised many questions for the Minister.  I am not speaking in a provocative fashion.  In three weeks' time we will enter the third year of this Government.  It is not good enough for the Minister to say that the Fianna Fáil-led Government of three years ago planned this or that.  We must move on.  The Minister is in charge in a new Government.  I have attended several rural Lions meetings in the past number of months.  I am not saying the previous Government was entirely blameless but there is a new scenario with new developments.  Gangland crime has never been so severe in terms of the number of murders committed in the capital and in the vicinity of the capital.  Many of them are gangsters who are taken out but very few successful prosecutions have been taken in respect of these crimes.  In responding, I hope the Minister will acknowledge the good faith of Members on this side.  I am deeply concerned and I have a deep passion for rural Ireland.  It worries me if there is a disintegration of the fabric of society in which I grew up and continue to live.  I hope the Minister will take my questions and concerns in the good faith I intend to portray.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-06a.183" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1139" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013020600032#FF00200"><p>I second the motion proposed by Senator O'Donovan on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Senators.  I welcome the Minister and thank him for taking this debate.  My colleague has covered a number of items in detail.  Nearly 12 months ago, I took part in an Adjournment debate with the Minister relating to Malahide Garda station.  This was in the first round of closure and downgrading.  The Minister stated at the time that the move was not taken for financial reasons.  He said the savings from downgrading and closure of stations would be negligible.  At the time I raised the examples of Malahide and Rush.  Since then, the Minister stated that the downgrading of stations - the early closure of stations - was to free up Garda resources on the beat.  That has not happened at any Garda station I have been involved in.  I will give the specific example of my Garda station in Malahide.  The station closes at night but firearms, uniforms and items of evidence are held in the station.  The station does not have an alarm and the superintendent believes the station should be manned, even though the phones are not answered and calls are diverted to Coolock.  Gardaí in Coolock must phone gardaí on the beat in Malahide and inform them of what is happening.  I use this as an example because it is happening in many Garda stations in urban and rural Ireland.  One cannot leave a Garda station unattended if it is a part-time station.  It does not free up resources.  I refer to it as a downgrade because it is a diminution of its status.  In the period since the Minister downgraded that station and others, we have lost 40% of our Garda vehicles.  The number of vehicles has decreased from five to three.  Three years ago, some 44 gardaí operated in the station, now there are 32.  We had five sergeants and we now have two.  The Minister said prisoners would not be transferred from part-time stations to other Garda stations but they are being transferred.  The Garda car in a particular town is being taken off patrol and is going to the full-time station to transfer prisoners.  I attend joint policing committee meetings in my area and senior members of the Garda Síochána inform me that this practice is losing them up to two hours.  Over 12 months ago, I mentioned valid reasons this should not happen.  It is not an improvement for operational reasons.</p><p>I also made reference to a rural Garda station in my constituency, Rush, which was a part-time station but it has now been closed.  Since the closure, four armed robberies of local businesses have taken place and there was an attempted arson attack on the church, St. Maur's, two weeks ago.</p><p>Perception can be reality and the reality is that people in many areas across the country feel extremely vulnerable.  Residents groups are meeting me and are setting up text alert systems so that they can text their neighbours if they see something happening or hear of a burglary in the area.  Neighbourhood Watch committees have been set up, which I welcome, but I do not welcome the fact that they are set up on the basis that our citizens, who deserve policing, feel they cannot be policed properly.  That is not the fault of the Garda Síochána.  Last week, I put on record my deepest sympathies to the family of Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe and his colleagues and friends.  As part of that contribution, I made it clear that nothing I was saying called into question the Garda Síochána.  It is operating at a difficult time, with crime on the increase regardless of what figures are put out there.  Garda Síochána resources are being badly stretched.  Many Garda units in stations are made up of one garda.</p><p>In order to be constructive, I ask the Minister to re-examine the re-opening of Templemore for training.  We will have a two-year vacuum before new recruits come onto the scene.  I raised this matter before the closing of Templemore.  I have experience of the Garda reserve, which does a fantastic job working with full-time gardaí.  Its members, who have been trained, should not have to go through the same training to be commissioned as full-time gardaí.  The Minister should decide to re-open recruitment to the Garda Síochána and, if he does so, he should look to the Garda Reserve first so that he can fast-track new gardaí on the street.</p><p>I would not expect the Minister to be aware that, yesterday on the Order of Business, I mentioned an allegation made at the Dublin north inner city joint policing committee meeting of 10 December, that a directive went from the Department of Justice and Equality to the Courts Service to the effect that alternatives to custodial sentences should be actively considered in the case of burglaries.  A letter was sent from the joint policing committee saying that it strongly objected to the suggestion.  I would like the Minister to clear up that matter in his contribution.  Burglary is a crime and while it may not be a crime on the person in every case, we must consider the after-effect on families whose homes have been violated and whose property has been stolen or destroyed.  I hope the suggestion is not true and I ask the Minister to comment.</p><p>Regardless of party, we all support the Garda Síochána 100%.  We need a Minister in the Department to show the requisite support and respect for gardaí.  Morale is at its lowest.  There is an active campaign on social media to restart Garda recruitment.  I am sure the Minister's officials have seen comments on the campaign, some of which are fair and some of which are not fair.  This is a massive issue in every area, urban and rural, because people's safety is paramount.  I refer in particular to the areas where the Minister has closed 130 Garda stations since he took over.  I also refer to the areas where the Minister has downgraded the status of stations.  When I raised this matter, the Minister promised me an improvement in operations and in the number of gardaí on the beat.  That has not happened and it is not working.  The Minister should go back to the drawing board, re-open Templemore for new recruits and put more gardaí on the street.</p></speech>

The Minister was with us earlier this afternoon when he had on his Minister for Defence hat.  He was debating a matter relevant to the Second World War.  In towns and villages across Europe and particularly across the United Kingdom, there are monuments and statues to the Second World War.  Many of them carry the phrase &quot;lest we forget&quot;.</p> <p>Do my colleagues in opposition remember the state of this country two short years ago?  I ask them lest they forget.  The Government was collapsing and Ministers were resigning every second day.  We did not know how long the Government or State would survive.  Do my colleagues remember the state of the public finances?  Do they remember when we did not know whether we could pay our gardaí?  It was not a question of how many gardaí we should have.  We did not know whether we could pay nurses and teachers.</p><p>We must be fair and put on the record that every decision the current Government is making has hanging over it the profound economic distress in which we still find ourselves.  I hope that tonight we will see some light at the end of the long tunnel of darkness.  However, let us not forget where we have come from.  Thankfully, our State has survived as a result of the careful management of the Administration over the past two years.  It is important to remember this.  We must, therefore, take parts of the motion tabled by our friends in Fianna Fáil with a grain of salt.  The party seems to want to rewrite history, if not write it out entirely.  I am not one of those who always want to harp on about who did what, but we must be realistic.  If the current Administration did not face the existing financial constraints, it would be possible for every Minister to proceed differently but we must live in the real economic world, in which we must realise there is still considerable economic mismanagement to correct.  Until such time as that phase of correction is over, every Ministers' hands will be somewhat tied.  Let us not forget that.</p><p>Consider the second amendment, tabled by colleagues in Sinn Féin.  It notes the role of the Garda in providing security to the State and its people since its foundation.  I welcome that new language from Sinn Féin but we should not forget that, until recent years, that party did not even recognise the State.  With regret, I contend it showed scant regard for the Garda, the force of law and order.  Recent conversions to democracy in support of the Garda must be taken with a grain of salt.  I look forward to Sinn Féin co-operating to a much greater level with the forces of law and order on this island in years to come.  That will be important.  I welcome the journey Sinn Féin has travelled but take some of its sentiments rather lightly.</p><p>We all recognise that the gardaí have concerns, worries and questions.  I look forward to some of the answers that the Minister will be able to provide tonight.  It is important to recognise that rural communities want a policing service.  We must tease out how that service can best be provided.</p><p>Society has changed, as has technology.  Whether we like that or not, the day has long since passed when every village and small town had a Garda station.  Some 25 or 30 years ago, we saw the first step in the change.  Garda stations still existed in the towns and villages, but gardaí no longer lived in them, as had been the case previously.  This change was followed by the closure of some of the Garda stations, which is now occurring again.  A significant responsibility among the Minister's many responsibilities is to ensure that a suitable and significant policing service will be available throughout the country, including in towns, townlands and large and small cities.</p><p>It would be great if we could have a Garda station at every crossroads but that is simply not possible.  Therefore, it is a question of how we use resources to ensure the service is sufficient.  The Minister has expressed the view that the service will now be much more mobile.  Instead of being almost locked in a Garda station, gardaí will be more mobile.  They will be able to get out to the towns, villages and townlands much more regularly and at greater speed.  I look forward to the Minister's comments on that.</p><p>Considerable desk work is still being done in Garda stations by gardaí whom we would be happier to see out on the streets and in the communities.  This needs to be considered.  Will the Minister update us on the Garda Reserve?  This was an idea of the previous Government.  It seemed good but I am not sure how well it has worked.  Perhaps a little tweaking is required.  There is no need for members of my party, in particular, to express our support for the Garda Síochána.  Since the party founded the Garda, it will always stand by it.  However, we need to send out a strong signal that the required resources will be provided and that the necessary changes to management structures, which may be required occasionally, will be made.  Fearful residents of rural communities, particularly isolated ones, ought to be reassured by the new policing methods and by having a more visible Garda presence on the streets, highways and byways rather than simply having gardaí parked at a Garda station.  I look forward to the Minister's comments.  I am absolutely certain of his commitment to the Garda.</p><p>I express my sympathy with the family and colleagues of murdered Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe.  His colleagues have played a huge role in maintaining the security of the State.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-06a.186" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1122" speakername="Trevor Ó Clochartaigh" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013020600033#GG00200"><p>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire.  Tá áthas orm a bheith in ann labhairt ar an rún seo mar tá an t-ábhar seo i mbéal an phobail agus thar a bheith tábhachtach.</p><p>The closure of Garda stations and the reductions in time are causing considerable concern from Mizen Head to Malin Head, and from Connemara to Stepaside.  I raised this issue in the House only a week or two ago in response to the Private Members' motion tabled by the Labour Party.  We saw some 100 Garda stations closed at the end of last month, on 31 January.  This is a crushing blow to rural areas, and I do not believe that the Minister truly understands the effect it will have, not only on community safety but also on the community spirit and people's sense of security and safety in rural communities.  I made the point the week before last that the local garda is a key focal point and plays a significant role as a community resource and point of contact.  The cuts weaken the social fabric in the affected communities.</p><p>We are to move an amendment to the motion because, while it is correct in what it says, the proposers have neglected to recognise that this is a process which began under a Fianna Fáil Government, although it has certainly escalated substantially under the current Minister.  As the amendment states, there was a commitment in the 2010 national recovery plan agreed between the Fianna Fáil-Green Party coalition and the troika to cut the number of gardaí from 14,500 that year to 13,500 the following year, and to 13,000 in 2014, representing a total reduction of 10%.  There were also substantial reductions in closing times and closures of Garda stations in that time.</p><p>In the 2008 report produced by my party colleague Deputy Pearse Doherty, Awakening the West, it was highlighted that, by November 2008, in almost half of all the Garda stations in Cork, Kerry, Clare, Galway and Roscommon the complement had been reduced to one garda operating on a part-time basis.  In many of those cases, Garda stations were closed on Sundays, and opening hours during the week were limited to the period between 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.</p><p>It is remarkable that the call to reopen Templemore, correct though it may be, comes from the party under whose watch in 2010 the college had no students for the first time.  The Garda Representative Association president, Mr. Michael O'Boyce, claimed that the force was on the brink of disaster, as so many experienced gardaí were being lost to it and no new blood was coming in.</p><p>The reality is that the State has by and large failed to take rural policing seriously.  It requires a different approach and thinking than applies to the policing of urban areas.  There is a very obvious value to the local garda and rural Garda stations in the prevention of crime.  That is very apparent to me, and the Minister's approach of simply using PULSE crime figures seems blunt and very unwieldy.</p><p>There is increasing evidence that police station closures can lead to an increase in crime.  In England, where rural police services have seen similar cutbacks, crime figures have surged.  Violent crime rose by 119% in country areas between 1988 and 1989 and 2006 and 2007 compared with a national increase of 108%.</p><p>Many crimes in rural areas go unreported.  This is not as it should be but it is the reality.</p> <p>In addition, many crimes in rural areas go unreported.  This is not as it should be but it is the reality.  According to an IFA survey, more than 10% of farmers have been victims of crime, which is quite considerable.</p><p>The Minister claimed the Garda station network was established at a time when gardaí travelled on bicycles but as my colleague, Deputy Colreavy, noted in the Dáil last week, criminals have also moved with the times and they do not travel on bicycles either.  They are as mobile as the gardaí, if not more so.  They are also clinical and calculating.  One can be sure that many of them have examined the list of closed Garda stations, or stations with reduced hours, and are establishing what are the easy targets and what parts of the country will now be hard for gardaí to reach.  Remote rural areas, such as those where elderly pensioners have twice been targeted in callous burglaries and assaults, will become the focus of these criminals.  </p><p>There was an incident in Rossaveal at the weekend when more than 100 youths in cars displayed their rallying expertise along the rural roads of Connemara.  A young man was seriously assaulted with a mallet but there were no gardaí to be found.  When people asked where the gardaí were during this incident, they were told they were otherwise deployed.  </p><p>I once again invoke the 2007 Garda Inspectorate report, Policing in Ireland, Looking Forward, which recommended the implementation of &quot;a consistent rural policing model that enhances visibility and makes best use of Garda resources in serving local communities&quot;.  This has never happened in reality and instead we are simply seeing cutbacks.  We will also see certain rural Garda districts being amalgamated into 14 districts as part of an effort to centralise in urban areas the policing of huge swathes of rural Ireland, so clearly there is no desire for a dedicated approach to crime in rural Ireland.  Like in so many other areas of Government policy, there is an expectation that it will all be okay and that rural people will either make do or move to the cities.  I find that assumption insulting and naive.  </p><p>The Garda Representative Association, which represents 11,300 rank and file gardaí, has said that most small stations cost €3,000 or less per year to run, that they deter crime and that further closures will compromise effective policing.  This is a very small amount for what they deliver.  </p><p>I accept there is the possibility of getting more out of current force and maximising the resources available to us but that should not be achieved by reducing the number of gardaí.  It should be achieved by ensuring that the gardaí can spend the bulk of their time on the beat and, as we have noted in our amendment, it is by way of further progressing the civilianisation of administrative services to international standards that gardaí can be freed up to undertake the role they were trained for, namely, to prevent and solve crime.  It can also create valuable local employment for civilians.</p><p>The Minister's claim that his plans will free up gardaí is undermined by the lack of resources available to the gardaí.  We believe that in a rural setting, it is essential that gardaí have sufficient equipment and accommodation which is fit-for-purpose, including secure digital radio, satellite navigation systems, Internet and e-mail access and suitable transportation.  In reality, this is often not the case and, in particular, the cars available to the gardaí mean that they are not as mobile as they should be.</p><p>I highlighted the slow response times for incidents in Galway last week and while the Minister will point to investments in Garda cars, it is worth noting the high replacement levels for Garda cars and that is barely being exceeded.  It is certainly not enough to meet the gap in coverage created by the closure of these stations.  The Minister is putting communities at risk by ordering these closures and I very much hope he will reconsider his position in this regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-06a.188" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1162" speakername="Denis Landy" time="15:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013020600034#HH00200"><p>I welcome the Minister and thank him for taking this important debate.  I commend all serving and former members of the Garda Síochána.  Members of my family served in the Garda Síochána on the front line in the 1980s, when it defended this State against subversives, and put their lives on the line in the defence of the State.</p><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion which was loaded with hypocrisy and opportunism by the party which brought this country to its knees economically and socially.  Let us be straight about things - the rot set in before the Minister began the challenge of modernising the Garda force.  The national recovery plan, agreed by the Fianna Fáil Administration, signed off on a cut in numbers exceeding the cuts forced on this Government, so to have Fianna Fáil jump up and down and put a motion before this House in regard to cuts would be funny if it was not so serious.  Once again Fianna Fáil seems to be hedging its bets that the people of this country have profound memory loss and that its national recovery plan, which covers in detail the reduction in public service numbers, will be forgotten.  Let us remember that the document, which details a reduction in Garda numbers from 14,500 in December 2010 to 13,500 in December 2011 with a further reduction to 13,350 to be effected by 31 December 2012, further required reductions by 31 December 2013 to bring the force down to 13,150 and down further to 13,000 by the end of December 2014.  Fianna Fáil's plan also stated that there would be €25 million in savings from unspecified Garda management efficiencies and a further €140 million in savings from overtime, allowances and transport costs.  </p><p>While I support the call for this debate and agree in some respects that the case for certain stations should be re-examined, Fianna Fáil should look at its position on this issue in the not too distant past.  The reality is that this call by Fianna Fáil is more about populist electioneering.  It did not seem too concerned about the downgrading of services when it was in the dying days of the last Government and desperately trying to maintain control of that Government.</p><p>Admittedly, I was critical last week of how the plan was being rolled out, and I stand over those remarks.  I appreciate radical change and reform is a difficult job but in rural areas, the roll-out of this plan could have been managed in a different way with more information given to the public at large.  The concern and fear being expressed and experienced by the communities in rural Ireland, including the community in which I live and represent in County Tipperary, is a reality.  I do not believe elected representatives are whipping this up for the sake of it or to further their own interests, unlike Fianna Fáil with this motion.  We are standing up for communities and I commend everybody on taking that stand.  </p><p>I acknowledge a well-resourced Garda force plays a vital role in the security of the State and I support the Garda Commissioner, Martin Callinan, in his statement that he would not like to see the numbers in the Garda falling below 13,000.  The challenge for the Garda is to maintain the public safety of people in their homes, workplaces, on the streets and in public places while operating in extremely difficult financial conditions in which the previous Fianna Fáil-led Government left us.  </p><p>The new Garda roster being piloted is aimed at making the gardaí more mobile and flexible to deliver a more effective policing service.  I heard the Minister say that of the 100 Garda stations being closed, 98% are open part-time, 94% are open for three hours or less per day, 88% are served by one garda and 5% are served by three or more gardaí.  This is true but it does not reflect the security rural Garda stations instil in people's minds that their local garda is available to them.  Operation Fiacla and the move to smart policing have yet to percolate down to rural Ireland.  The crucial links between the community and the gardaí must be reinforced as a matter of urgency.  The relationship the local garda builds up with the local people cannot be measured and has been overlooked or maybe misunderstood.  </p><p>I commend the Minister on finding funding in the current economic climate to invest €4 million in the Garda fleet in 2012, for putting 213 cars on the road and for providing extra officers on the beat and finding an extra €5 million for the purchase of new Garda cars in 2013.  However, I believe the present Administration's pursuance of modernisation of the Garda Síochána would have been better served by frontloading the upgrade of and increase in fleet numbers in the first instance, prior to the closure of barracks.  We should first have made operational the 400 vehicles and put them in the communities as a presence protecting people and putting communities at ease.  Those vehicles should have been put in place in rural communities and the new Garda rostering system should have been implemented.</p> <p>The entire process should have been allowed to bed in and the Government should have revamped the community alert and neighbourhood watch schemes.  This would have meant a front-loading of the new system.  I was led to believe that the ongoing engagement between the Department of Justice and Equality, Garda management and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding Garda strength and expenditure would ensure that the situation is monitored during 2013.  I was also led to believe that the Government will provide the necessary resources during 2013 and in the future.</p></speech>

Obviously the closure of rural Garda stations is a hotly contested and debated issue in County Kerry because so many areas are affected.  They stations affected are Ballinskelligs, Valentia Island, Beaufort, Kilgarvan, Lauragh, Brosna, Abbeydorney, Camp and Fenit.  While the Government side has articulated that there are nearby Garda stations and its masters of spin have spun the story that the stations can be served by driving a few minutes to other Garda stations,  that is not the case.  For example, Lauragh is 56 km and Kilgarvan is 32 km from the nearest 24-hour station.  We all know that crime has increased, the number of burglaries has increased and the instances of thefts has soared in rural areas.  People in Lauragh will not get a Garda response in reasonable time and only if a Garda car can be provided by the nearest station in Killarney.  Rural areas like Lauragh will suffer.</p><p>The Government has berated the previous Government.  We must remember that the Minister said that drug gangs and their leaders would drink a celebratory toast to thank the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Dermot Ahern, when previous cuts were made.  We know that the troika did not demand the closure of rural Garda stations but asked for cuts and savings wherever the Government saw fit.  Therefore, it was the Government that made the decision.  When it comes to the safety of people living in rural areas, such as in Kerry, Garda stations are a significant symbol of the Government's presence and protect the citizen.</p></speech>

If the Government is doing good work then my party will support the Minister.  As I have said before, he is one of the hardest working Ministers with responsibility for the justice portfolio that we have ever had in this country.  I compliment him on his work, brains and energy.</p><p>I shall use my time to talk about two issues.  First, in the north west, thugs and criminals can make a quick getaway across the Border after attacking vulnerable people in Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim.  The PSNI and the Garda Síochána have not liaised enough when it comes to the Border region.  I have raised the matter at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  Both organisations must work more closely.  Why not have simultaneous road blocks on either side of the Border to improve vigilance?  Civil servants will probably give me a Civil Service answer by stating that there is great contact between them but I do not believe them.  That contact is not up to scratch.  If I was in the Minister's shoes I would put the screws on Matt Baggott, the Chief Constable of PSNI, and the Garda Commissioner, Mr. Martin Callinan, to get their act together in an efficient way and to adopt proper management.</p><p>I have researched the issue and discovered that Garda management is not up to modern standards.  We know that its members are dedicated but, following my research over the past three weeks, I have discovered that we need top class sergeants located in areas who know how to manage the gardaí under their control.  I have been led to believe, and people have told me, that there is not proper management in the force, which is a serious issue.</p><p>I produced a Fianna Fáil policy paper on quality caring and active ageing and I discovered that social isolation and fear among older people living in rural areas is a real issue.  It is sad to think that we have reached the stage in this developed economy where older people must live in fear of being attacked and mugged.  Apparently, some people have resorted to leaving money on their kitchen table as a precaution in order that they can give it to a burglar if one enters their home.</p><p>Last Sunday I participated in a protest at Stepaside which is in the Minister's constituency.  I can show Members a picture of myself and the former assistant Garda commissioner, Mr. Martin Donnellan, Mr. Richard Murphy and Deputy Mattie McGrath attending the protest.  I am sure that the Minister got a good report on the protest and the prevailing atmosphere.  The people of Stepaside will not give up on the issue.  The new suburb has a population of 30,000 but it is also a mixture of people and professions and I spoke about a group earlier.  However, the Minister will know as well as I do that the area is inherently rural.  I look forward to his explanation for the closure of the Stepaside Garda station.  Criminals can make a quick getaway because Stepaside is located beside the M50.  The area provides an important fabric of employment and we must protect the people in the region.</p><p>I speak on behalf of my colleague, Senator Denis O'Donovan, when I say that we both agree that the Minister has done a good job.  Is that not right, Senator?</p></speech>

Earlier I was here wearing my hat as Minister for Defence but now I am here as the Minister for Justice and Equality which is the first time that I have done so since the very tragic death of Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe.  I would like to put on the record of the House my revulsion and sadness at his brutal murder.  Again I extend my condolences to his family and to all members of the Garda Síochána - the opportunity to have a conversation with his wife, Caroline, and some members of his family following his being put to rest on this day last week.  It was a tragedy that should never have happened.  It was a very moving and sad funeral for all who attended and he will in our thoughts for a long period.</p><p>I do not normally get too annoyed about anything that Senator O'Donovan says because in the cut and thrust of politics, it is important to take things on the chin and get on with it.  He raised a couple of issues at the start of his contribution which I think were unfortunate.  I am not going to lend credibility to what was written in one particular Sunday newspaper nor will I comment on it and give it the dignity of a commentary.  I will not bring a family that has been grievously bereaved into a debate based on a Fianna Fáil motion on the Garda Síochána on which I have a particular view.</p> <p>I will deal with the motion.  It is inappropriate, and I regret the Senator felt the need to raise that issue.  I would simply say to the Senator-----</p></speech>

Not everything one reads is necessarily accurate, but I am not going to get into that because what was written was inappropriate.  Raising that this evening is inappropriate and does not deserve the dignity of any detailed response.</p><p>I was also surprised at something else Senator O'Donovan said which on reflection he may think about and on some other occasion withdraw it or expand on it in some way.  I am very conscious it is only a week since Detective Garda Donohoe was laid to rest and he said this evening, and I thought it was an extraordinary piece of criticism, that he was not sure - I am paraphrasing what he said - that everything necessary was being done with regard to the investigation into the barbaric murder that took place.  This is not a moment to be criticising an investigation into the callous murder of a member of the force when there are dedicated members of that force, together with the PSNI, devoting all of their energies to identifying those responsible and an evidential trail that will facilitate them being brought to justice.  I hope the Senator would withdraw what he said.  </p><p>I visited Dundalk Garda station and met many of the late Detective Garda's colleagues last Monday week.  They were very determined to bring to justice the people responsible.  They were people who clearly admired the Detective Garda who had been mercilessly mown down.  They were very stressed, and I do not believe we should be criticising them or their colleagues.  It is not appropriate to try to raise the issue in what is, to be clear, a debate that is a little bit about the old politics of posturing and party political game playing.  </p><p>There is a basic hypocrisy, as other Members of the Seanad have said, about tonight's Fianna Fáil motion.  Why I am I saying that?  One of the many headaches I inherited when I was appointed Minister for Justice and Equality in March 2011 was attempting to unravel the expenditure ceilings for the justice sector which were contained in the Fianna Fáil-led Government's national recovery plan, to which Senator Landy referred.  I have a copy of the plan here as a primer for any member of Fianna Fáil who may need to read it.  I can hand them the relevant page because I made an additional photocopy of it.  If these ceilings had been applied they would have resulted in devastating cuts in Garda services which I, as Minister for Justice and Equality, would not and could not in any circumstances stand over, even in the circumstances of the troika wanting us to effect certain cuts.</p><p>The Fianna Fáil national recovery plan was unacceptable and would have put the Garda Commissioner in an impossible position.  Fortunately, I was able to secure additional funding over the three year period 2012-2014 to ensure that the Garda Commissioner, and An Garda Síochána, could continue to deliver an effective policing service.  I could not do anything about 2011.  I inherited the Estimates.  They were there when I came into office.</p><p>In summary, for the justice sector in 2012 I secured €2.243 billion, which was an additional €118 million over and above the Fianna Fáil allocation of €2.125 billion.  For 2013 I secured funding of €2.2 billion, which was €191 million over and above the Fianna Fáil allocation of €2.009 billion, and for 2014 I secured funding of €2.065 billion, which was €105 million over and above the original Fianna Fáil allocation of €1.96 billion.  If the Fianna Fáil national recovery plan had been implemented - it was the November 2010 plan, published ten days before the deal was done with the troika and designed to implement the policies of financial reductions the troika was seeking - the effect of that on An Garda Síochána for the years 2012, 2013 and 2014 would have on average resulted in their being €90 million less available in each of those three years than is available this year, last year and for 2014.  The Fianna Fáil finances would have devastated the Garda and rendered it impossible.  They were based on funny figures as well because the funny figures set out, and Senators have referred to it, a roadmap for the reduction in the numbers in the Garda force but on the figures, even the numbers it was projected would be retained were unsustainable because the funding would not have been available to pay them.  It is as simple as that.  That was the legacy Fianna Fáil was happy to bequeath to me as justice Minister.  </p><p>I do not like engaging in too much of what I would describe as the caricature of the party political toing and froing that goes on because I am conscious that we do very good legislative work in this House but it is very difficult for me to listen to some of the criticisms that were made this evening and the hypocrisy of Fianna Fáil as it attempts to erase its national recovery plan from public memory and engage in extraordinary political revisionism.</p><p>This motion is also critical of the reduction in Garda numbers.  Once again, the proposers seem to have forgotten their own national recovery plan.  That plan details where things were going to go with Garda numbers - this is an extract from it.  That plan detailed a reduction in Garda numbers from a strength of 14,500, as has already been said, on 31 December 2010 to 13,500 at the end of 2011.  It proposed further reductions to 13,350 by 31 December 2012, 13,150 by 31 December 2013 and then to 13,000 by 31 December 2014.  In fact, the number of gardaí in the force today exceeds by approximately 80 the number Fianna Fáil intended to bring about by the end of 2012.</p><p>In terms of where the figures were funny, in the context of funny money, if the funding had remained as it was I do not believe I would have had the funding to pay for the numbers who are in the force in 2012 or the numbers we have now in 2013.  Apart from the financial figures being a little odd in that context there is one part of this which is common sense because on average approximately 350 members of the Garda retire by way of natural retirement every year, therefore, the projected figure will be down to 13,150 by the end of this year and then to 13,000 by December 2014, but all recruitment was cancelled.  Natural retirement would have got us to 2014 below the 13,000 figure.  We would have been down to 12,750 or 12,700 members of the force.</p><p>The Garda Commissioner has succeeded in maintaining essential front-line policing services by the implementation of important and necessary reforms, including the new Garda rostering system.  I also made additional funding available last year, and again in 2013, for the purchase of vehicles for the Garda fleet.  Members might be interested to know that no provision of any nature was made for the purchase of Garda cars, and I want to refer to the exact figures because there is a typographical error in the script.  There was no provision of any nature made for the purchase of Garda cars in 2009; 2010 is indicated in the script.</p> <p>There was some provision in 2010.  No new cars were purchased in 2009 but 146 were purchased in 2010.  When I came into office inheriting an Estimate figure for 2011 we were able to purchase only 52 new vehicles.  Some 213 new vehicles were purchased for the Garda in 2012, which is more than the total of 198 purchased between 2009 and 2011.  I want to be very clear about those figures.  This year I have dedicated funding of €5 million which will allow for the purchase of a significant number of new vehicles.  It is an increased fund despite the reduction in the funding available to me generally because I was able, with the goodwill and assistance of my good friend and colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, to negotiate additional funding at Estimates time to ensure we could renew the Garda fleet.</p><p>The Fianna Fáil motion refers to the reopening of the Garda College at Templemore to Garda recruitment.  Recruitment to An Garda Síochána was ended by my predecessor Dermot Ahern.  The most recent recruits to enter Templemore did so in 2009 and the last substantial number of recruits graduated in June 2011.  No recruitment took place in 2010.  In Fianna Fáil's national recovery plan, no reference is made to the recommencement of Garda recruitment.   The question of new recruitment is under active consideration and it is an issue that I will address with my Cabinet colleagues during the course of this year, because it is my objective to maintain the Garda force at 13,000.  It is worth noting that the college is not closed or mothballed, as some people have suggested.  It continues to provide professional development training to Garda members and reserve gardaí.  It also provides employment to the local community.  On Friday week I will be in Templemore for the graduation of some new members of the Reserve Garda force who have been trained there.</p><p>It goes without saying that no Minister would choose to have to operate in this appalling financial position.  Notwithstanding this, despite what I said about having additional funds available year on year, I still have less, but not as low as the Fianna Fáil figures went.  For example, in 2012 I had €100 million less than was available in the preceding year.  This year I have €62 million less than was available in 2012, but the position is not as drastic as it would have been under the Fianna Fáil national recovery plan.  Despite the difficulties I have done everything possible to maintain Garda resources at the highest possible level.  A budget of more than €1.4 billion is available for the force in 2013 - the major portion of justice funding.  By any standards, this is a substantial amount.</p><p>I am also very pleased that the provision of three new Garda divisional headquarters for Kevin Street in Dublin, Galway and Wexford was included in the special Government stimulus package announced last July.  The projects are to be delivered by means of a public private partnership and discussions are currently taking place between the relevant agencies in light of the Government announcement.</p><p>When I entered office there were 703 Garda stations in the Garda station network.  The network, essentially, was as designed and inherited by us from colonial times in 1922.  Some 39 Garda stations were closed in 2012, eight of which had not been open for a number of years, but no Minister had had the courage to announce that they would never be reopened.  A pretence was maintained that some day someone would refurbish them.  Their closure was a paper exercise which simply recognised reality, a reality that had been concealed by my immediate predecessors.  Many more were only one- or two-member stations.  Following a comprehensive assessment by the Garda Commissioner of the Garda station network in 2012, a further 100 were listed for closure in the Commissioner's policing plan for 2013.  Ninety-five of these closed last Thursday 31 January, while the remainder will close in the coming months.</p><p>The Garda station network was inherited from the Royal Irish Constabulary network in 1922 on the foundation of the State.  Such a large-scale static deployment of resources is no longer appropriate in the present day as the transport and communications infrastructure has been transformed beyond recognition.  The Garda Síochána has a class-leading police computer system, a state-of-the-art digital radio system, and a transport fleet which is currently receiving significant investment.  The new Garda roster currently being piloted provides a better match between Garda availability and policing demand.  All of these developments enable the Garda Síochána to be more mobile and flexible and to deliver a more effective policing service.</p><p>We need to be honest about the level of policing service that was capable of being provided from the stations listed for closure in 2013.  Of the 100 stations on the list, 98% opened part-time, 94% opened for three hours a day or less, 88% were manned by one Garda and only 5% were manned by three or more Garda personnel.  Some critics have complained that the station closures will save only small amounts of money, but to do so completely misses the point.  The objective is to maximise the time that our well-trained and highly skilled gardaí spend on operational duties.  This is about smart policing and the most efficient and effective deployment of Garda resources.  I have listened with interest to comments made by at least one retired member of the Garda, an assistant commissioner, who said he did not know what smart policing was.  Everyone here knows what a smartphone is.  Would they like a smartphone or the old type of phone?  Smart policing is very simple.  It means there is flexibility about policing policies, with problem areas being targeted as the need arises.  It means there are specified targeted operations such as Operation Fiacla, with the Garda force deployed on a mobile basis where necessary, as is the case in dealing with the burglary gangs around the country and where special operations are needed to deal with fuel laundering or drugs.  It is not about keeping gardaí in Garda stations doing administrative work and not using their skills and training for crime prevention and crime detection.  Smart policing is a term that is well understood throughout Europe, not just in Ireland.  It is remarkable that someone who has retired from the force should find it so difficult to understand the concept, but I recognise that some people think we should do things the way we always did them in the past and there is no room for change.  Some people find change difficult.  We must change to deal with criminals who are changing their methodologies and the manner in which they target communities.  </p><p>It is the view of the view of the Garda Commissioner that a country the size of Ireland, with a population of 4.5 million, does not need 700 Garda stations in the 21st century.  It is nothing less than scaremongering to suggest that reducing that network to 564 Garda stations is a cause for fear and anxiety.  Northern Ireland, which has 1.5 million people, has 83 police stations and the objective is to reduce the number to around 50 by 2015.  Scotland, with a population of 5.2 million, has 340 police stations.  It is not about bricks and mortar but intelligent and targeted police work.   </p><p>The Garda Commissioner has concluded that a more effective and efficient policing service can be provided by releasing the maximum possible number of gardaí for front-line service in our communities.  This is his professional opinion, and it would be entirely wrong for me, as Minister for Justice and Equality, to second-guess his expertise in this matter.  I support him.  I am not passing the buck as some people have suggested.  The last thing we need is a Minister for Justice and Equality who thinks he should make operational decisions for the Garda Síochána when we have a Garda Commissioner who has the required expertise.  He is the person who manages the Garda force and is at the centre of the operational decisions that are made.</p><p>It is unfortunate and regrettable that some public representatives have been fuelling public fear regarding the impact of the closure of Garda stations.  In fact, I am advised by the Garda Commissioner that Garda station closures in 2013 will result in an extra 61,000 Garda patrol hours.</p> <p>For those who believe the stations provide a deterrent to criminals, the sad fact is that this is not true.  Clear evidence of this reality was shown by the appalling events of the robbery of Oldcastle post office on 31 January following the holding captive of two people at their home.  Oldcastle post office is adjacent to the Garda station to which, in turn, four Garda members are assigned.  The station is scheduled to be open for three hours a day on weekdays and Sundays and two hours on Saturdays, subject to manpower availability.  The presence of the station next to the post office was no deterrent to the robbery that took place there.  We must move beyond the simplistic notion that Garda stations are a deterrent to serious criminals.</p><p>Some have painted the Garda station consolidation process as an attack on rural Ireland.  However, the two largest stations listed for closure in 2013 are Stepaside in my constituency of Dublin South and Kill O' the Grange in the Tánaiste's constituency of Dún Laoghaire.  In 2012, the three largest Garda stations to be closed were in Dublin - Harcourt Terrace, Whitehall and Dalkey.  Let there be no misconception.  The objective of modernising and re-calibrating the Garda station network is to ensure that Garda resources are used in the best and most efficient way possible, in both rural and urban areas, to the benefit of all law-abiding people who reside in this State.</p><p>Stepaside Garda station is situated three miles from Dundrum Garda station which Senator White mistakenly mentioned earlier.</p></speech>

It is the opinion of the Garda Commissioner that there is no operational benefit to maintaining these two Garda stations in such close proximity.  As a constituency representative, there is no doubt that my life would be more comfortable if Stepaside Garda station was not on the list for closure.  However, I accept the professional advice of the Garda Commissioner on foot of the operational assessment conducted throughout the country, including in my constituency.</p><p>In a different era Ministers could be predicted to block any contentious development in their own constituencies to protect themselves locally from adverse comment and constituency rivals getting people excited and organising protests.  However, I believe it is important to make the right decision, not the politically personally advantageous decision.  For that reason I reiterate, I will not second-guess the professional advice of the Garda Commissioner.</p><p>In the London metropolitan area, which has a population three times that of the entire population of this State, 66 police stations are due to close, leaving 73 police stations open to the public.  Is it seriously being suggested that, with the advances we have seen in modern policing, transport and technology, we should act as if time had stood still since 1922?  Should we maintain a police network based on what we inherited from the British and which was devised between 1850 and 1900 to keep an eye on the rebellious Irish?</p><p>Garda stations come under the control of the Office of Public Works.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, has confirmed that, if an appropriate community management structure is put in place, the closed stations can be utilised for local community purposes.  This can be of considerable benefit to a variety of local voluntary organisations which currently lack appropriate facilities.  The Garda Commissioner has stated the revised structures will continue to support the Garda community philosophy through the clustering of services at policing hubs.  This centralisation of services will facilitate the introduction of enhanced patrolling arrangements which, in turn, will provide increased Garda visibility, as well as maintaining existing Garda links with communities across the country.</p><p>In addition, an Garda Síochána has recently acquired a number of vehicles which are being converted into mobile Garda offices.  It is planned they will be assigned to areas where Garda stations have been closed to ensure that members of the public can continue to conduct their business and interact with members of an Garda Síochána.  These offices will be in place with the agreement of the community on a particular day to deal with basic policing issues.  In addition to the role that all gardaí have to play in community policing, there are more than 1,000 gardaí dedicated to community policing countrywide.  Gardaí continue to work closely with all communities to enhance community safety through a wide range of local fora such as Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch.</p><p>It was claimed earlier that some communities are re-establishing Neighbourhood Watch schemes which I would encourage.  We need an extension of these schemes.  Last Thursday, a new memorandum of understanding was completed between an Garda Síochána and Muintir na Tíre.  Community Text is an important pilot scheme.  If a member of a community sees something suspicious, he or she can text to a communal text alert which can be shared with neighbours and the Garda.  It is simple and inexpensive which community gardaí will help establish.  I encourage Members to engage with their communities not to create unnecessary fear, but assist them to set up such schemes.  It does not matter how many gardaí we have.  They cannot be standing outside every person’s front door.</p><p>My Department, along with the Health Service Executive, HSE, has, for many years, supported the work of the Community Alert programme, which was set up in 1985 by Muintir na Tíre in association with the Garda authorities.  This programme has since developed into a national movement comprising over 1,300 local groups which work with the Garda to promote crime prevention and improve the security of older and vulnerable persons in the community.  Last year, my Department achieved savings which we did not believe we could achieve.  Subsequently, we managed to find an additional €40,000 to give to this scheme.</p><p>An Garda Síochána has risen to the challenges that it faces in the current economic climate.  Change is being delivered in co-operation with the members and staff in the Garda Síochána.  Without doubt, the single largest transformation project in the Garda Síochána, and arguably in the public service, has been the development and implementation of a new roster system in the force.  Not only does the new roster provide a more effective policing service, it also protects the health and welfare of the members of the Garda Síochána.  The new Garda roster system ensures that resources are optimally deployed when and where they are required, to every part of the community, both rural and urban.  Evidence of the new roster is immediately apparent on our streets as more gardaí are on duty at times of peak demand and fewer during quieter periods.  This is essentially what this reform is about - doing things differently but more effectively.</p><p>This revised roster was introduced under the provisions of the public service agreement.  Every Member will be aware that discussions are under way on revisions to the public service agreement.  I am disappointed some organisations have chosen to absent themselves from the discussions on any reductions in allowances and I would hope they will reconsider this decision.  The discussions are focused on the unpalatable truth that the public service pay bill must be reduced.  I do not wish to pre-empt the outcome of the talks by making any further comment at this time other than to confirm that I am firmly committed to ensuring resources remain at the highest level possible that will enable the Garda Commissioner, his senior management team and all members of An Garda Síochána to continue to deliver an outstanding policing service to the people.  I encourage all those who are engaged in this process to remain in dialogue to find a solution to the problems that all of us are facing.</p> <p> In response to allegations about increased crime levels throughout the country, the crime statistics for the 12 months ending on 30 September 2012 show reductions in 12 of the 14 crime groups.  Crimes against the person are down, including homicide offences, down 17.9%, sexual offences, down 0.7%, and assault and related offences, down 9.5%.  Public order and damage to property offences are also down, by 12% and 9.3% respectively, as are drug offences, which are down 7.1%, and weapons and explosives offences, which are down 17.4%.  Burglaries, however, increased by 7.9% during the period and I will comment on that presently.  It is worth noting that the Garda has had a particularly successful year in confiscating drugs.  Some €100 million worth of drugs were confiscated by the end of December 2012 from those engaged in drug crime.</p><p>I am acutely aware of the concerns that exist about the incidence of burglaries and of the corrosive effect that the fear of crime can have on community morale and its impact on elderly and more vulnerable people.  Interestingly, the spike in burglaries occurred in 2011 before one Garda station had been closed.  In response to the increase in the number of burglaries, Operation Fiacla was set up by the Garda Commissioner in the spring of 2012 and is particularly focused on identifying and targeting mobile gangs involved in burglaries throughout the country.  Operation Fiacla has been and continues to be remarkably effective.  In the period from the beginning of April 2012 to the end of January 2013 it resulted in 3,903 persons being arrested and 2,142 persons being charged with offences.  In addition, the latest quarterly figures for burglary suggest that Operation Fiacla is having an impact when compared with the quarterly figures prior to its introduction.</p><p>These figures, taken with the robust response of the Garda in tackling gangland crime and the activities of paramilitary organisations, are clear evidence that while the Garda cannot avoid the economic realities it has been more than able to continue to respond effectively to crime.  The most recent crime figures show that the number of aggravated burglaries is down when compared with the previous 12 months.  I realise that is of no solace to some individuals who have been the victims of brutal and violent burglaries in recent weeks.  The sad reality is that no matter what the policing methods and no matter how successful the Garda may be in bringing people to justice, we have always had and we will continue to have bad people, who have no respect for individuals, human rights, people's property or the privacy of their homes and who will be intent on burglary.  Unfortunately some of these people have no compunction about using violence.</p><p>I assure the House that An Garda Síochána is taking all available measures to respond to this type of crime, especially in the case of what has happened in Oldcastle and the other shocking incidents which we have seen recently.  I share the widespread outrage at gang-related criminal activity.  The brutal nature of these crimes is a stark reminder to us of the mentality of those involved in organised criminality and the danger that they pose to our society.  I am in regular contact with the Garda Commissioner about all aspects of serious crime and I know that the Garda will continue to bear down heavily on the activities of those involved in gangland crime.</p><p>The only effective way to combat organised crime is by disrupting and prosecuting those involved in its operations, especially the drugs trade, which is at the heart of much of its profits.  We should not underestimate the difficulties the Garda faces in trying to prevent gangland killings, in particular those involving the killing of members of one gang by those of another, and related crimes and in bringing the perpetrators to justice.  These crimes are carefully planned and are carried out by people who are familiar with criminal and forensic investigation techniques.  Moreover, despite the clear risk to themselves, members of gangs will not generally co-operate with Garda investigations.  Despite these difficulties the Garda has been able to bring people before the courts, particularly in the case of several high-profile killings in recent years, although it will take some time before those cases are disposed of.</p><p>This is not a budgetary matter.  In this context, the Commissioner has made it clear that where resources are needed to combat serious and organised crime, those resources will be made available.  The number of gangland murders was, in fact, higher when Garda numbers were higher and higher than they are today.  It is unrealistic to expect the Commissioner to devote his entire resources to individually protecting people who are routinely trying to avoid the Garda in order that they can continue to engage in criminal activity.  Such an approach could only come at the expense of ordinary Garda activity to protect the community generally.</p><p>There is already strong anti-gangland legislation in place.  I have made it clear to the Garda Commissioner that if he believes there are other measures that could be taken in this area I will look at the matter very positively.  Anyway, it is misleading for anyone to suggest that there is some simple legislative solution which will prevent dangerous criminals from trying to kill each other.  If that were the case it would have been enacted years ago.</p><p>Despite the many positive developments in recent years in Northern Ireland, the Garda has never let up in its efforts to counteract criminal groups whose only objective is to drag our island back to a dark past.  The police force has a proud record in this respect standing in defence of the State.  The Garda will continue to be fully supported in its efforts to counter the activities of these subversive criminals.  The fight against criminal terrorism has been and remains an absolute priority for the Garda authorities and that will not change.</p><p>The shared objective of the Government and the authorities in Northern Ireland is to enhance community safety on the whole of the island.  I assure the House that, in co-operation with the authorities in Northern Ireland, we will continue to spare no effort to ensure that those criminal terrorists who seek to subvert the democratic will of the people will face the full rigours of the law.  I listened with interest to what Senator White said about the Police Service of Northern Ireland and its Chief Constable, Matt Baggott.  She suggested I was taking a Civil Service line but I was not; this is practical reality.  I put it to Senator White that there is extraordinary co-operation going on between the Garda Síochána and the PSNI in addressing the particular issues she raised, not only the issue of subversive crime but of organised gangs who are located on one side of the Border and who set about marauding on people on the opposite side of the Border.  There is the closest co-operation going on, including exchange of information and intelligence and co-ordinated operations North and South.  I hope and trust that such work will bring to justice those who murdered Garda Donohoe.</p><p>In the context of general criminality there are gangs operating along the Border, some of which locate in one part of the island and commit crime on the other part of the island.  Some are engaged in general criminality, including fuel laundering operations, and they have no interest in the Border; they simply operate North and South.  However, there is the closest co-operation and there are regular meetings between members of An Garda Síochána and the PSNI at all levels.  I have regular meetings with the Northern Ireland Minister for the Department of Justice, David Ford.  We have regular contact to discuss issues of mutual concern.  Meetings take place at which there are present the two ministers with responsibility for justice on this island, David Ford and myself, the Chief Constable, the Garda Commissioner and those working with us.  This is a continuing and regular contact and interaction.</p><p>It is important to acknowledge that members of An Garda Síochána provide a vital service to the public.  They are called into an remarkable variety of situations on a daily basis.  These calls bring with them attendant risks which those in the force must assess and deal with regularly.  We have had a dreadful reminder of the extent of these risks in recent days.  We must never forget this nor take for granted the work the Garda carries out on our behalf.  In this respect, a safe society is the responsibility of every member of that society and not only those in the Garda.  The interconnection between the Garda and the community is vital in the successful delivery of a policing service in Ireland.  The closure of stations that has been effected will not impede that community interaction and connection because it is one of the central objectives of the Garda Síochána that these values are maintained and this is detailed in the policing plan for 2013.  Neither I, as Minister, nor the Government will shirk in our responsibility to do everything we can to ensure that this connection is not broken and that the best possible resources are made available to An Garda Síochána.</p><p>I apologise for taking so long.  This is a serious issue.  It is important that we discuss reality and that we do not unnecessarily engage in party political posturing or point scoring.  The Garda deserves our full support.  I put it to the House that despite the difficult financial circumstances in which we find ourselves and despite the agreements with the troika with which we must comply to get the funding the State still needs to pay for essential front-line services, I will continue to do everything I can as the Minister for Justice and Equality to ensure that we do for the Garda what is necessary.</p> <p>I advise Senator O'Donovan and others who are interested in legislation, as well as my colleagues on my side of this House, that I expect, within the next few weeks, to publish legislation that past Governments promised on a regular basis, namely, legislation to provide for a DNA database, which should have been enacted years ago.  That legislation will be published shortly.  It is being finalised in the Attorney General's office and I hope it will be published before Easter or, if not, immediately afterwards.  The objective is to have it enacted rapidly.  When I came into office there had been much talk about the DNA database but nothing had been done to prepare the technology necessary for it to be established.  During 2012, with the assistance of the forensic science laboratory, the technology was made available and ready.  If this legislation is enacted we will be up and running with a DNA database before the end of this year.</p></speech>

I thank him for his detailed contribution, which contained much with which all of us can agree.  Nobody doubts his personal commitment to doing the best job he can.  That goes for the Minister of the day irrespective of his or her party or Department.</p><p>I followed the debate on the monitor while I was preparing to come down to the Chamber and I heard the Minister switch with agility from the previous Government's national recovery plan to the current Opposition's pre-budget submission and back again.  We often hear that the previous Government did this or that.  I was not in the previous Government.  The people have adjudicated on its manifesto and the national recovery plan and my party lost 53 seats.  My job as one of the 14 Members elected to the Seanad for Fianna Fáil is to hold this Government to account on its performance.  If we were to do that based on its own manifesto, we would be looking at the greatest act of political delinquency any of us ever witnessed in regard to the promises made under all headings.  I do not refer to the Minister's area in particular.  When a question pertaining to health was put to the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Perry, his only refuge was to hang up on live radio.  Senator Kelly could tell the Minister about the accident and emergency departments of Roscommon.  We could go through all the various issues.  The figures were known at the time because the then Opposition had access to the books of the Department of Finance.  Opposition Members even met the same troika which informs me regularly that it does not prescribe every cut needed in Ministers' respective areas.  They merely suggest cuts but they are happy to go along with alternatives provided the bottom line is the same.  We must be fair in these debates and if the Minister's only response to constructive criticism of his performance is to look to the already adjudicated on Government of the past, that is wrong.  When one is playing football today one does not blame the team of yesterday for losing the game or playing badly.  I am sure somebody as experienced in politics and the legal profession as the Minister can at least concede that it is a poor response to constructive criticism.</p><p>As someone from regional Ireland - Sligo town in the north west - I have raised the issue of the Garda fleet of vehicles well in advance of the recent criminal tragedies.  I am not being opportunistic in raising the issue again this week.  There are eight detectives in the unit in Sligo, which is the ninth largest urban centre in Ireland, and six in Cavan town.  These two units share one car between them.  Under anybody's calculations that does not provide adequate resources to allow people to do their job.  The term &quot;aggravated burglary&quot; used to be quite foreign to our part of the country.  When the Troubles in the North were at their height there may have been times when these crimes were more regular but it has now become a real concept.  I am sure Members have similar experiences in their own parts of the country.  West County Sligo, for those who are not familiar with it, stretches from Ballina and along the coast into Ballisodare and Sligo town.  According to the official figures, there are eight gardaí in that area.  The reality on the ground is that two gardaí are on duty at any one time and the area is covered by the superintendent in Ballymote, which is more than 80 minutes drive.  If a serious incident occurs on a day when somebody has called in sick, one law enforcement officer will be available to respond.  The area has suffered several serious aggravated burglaries, including an incident involving a lady who was recovering from an illness and whose husband brought the family to mass in the evening.  Two men with balaclavas came into the house to steal whatever they could.  People wonder how this can happen but it is basic mathematics.  If I am a criminal who knows that two gardaí cover an area at any one time it is a simple issue of finding an accomplice to watch the gardaí while I rob the house.</p><p>If it were merely a case of Stepaside to town or Dalkey to Dún Laoghaire I would agree with the Minister but as somebody who is familiar with the culture of rural Ireland and the fact that people live in different villages and even islands, I recognise the need to deploy gardaí on the ground.  Conversations I have had with gardaí who are friends of mine suggest that morale in the force is at an all time low.  As this problem extends back to the previous Government, do not think I am letting it away with it.  This is a challenge for all of us.  I do not say it is a specific issue of resourcing but we need to address it.  I commend the Minister on his efforts but more must be done.  Perhaps he needs more resources from his Government colleagues to do what is necessary.</p><p>I will conclude on a point with which I am sure the House will agree.  A colleague in the Dáil spoke about the use of cocaine and class A drugs as if they were like trying a pint of Guinness or a different type of pasta in a restaurant.  I resent that attitude.  The Deputy in question may be in breach of the code of conduct for Members of the Oireachtas and any buffoon who uses cocaine and boasts about it without connecting bullets in the back of people's heads on a weekly basis is deluded and, quite frankly, has no place in these Houses.</p></speech>

I also thank Fianna Fáil for tabling the motion because it offers an opportunity to tease out the new policing arrangements.  I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator MacSharry in regard to the Member of the other House and his recent stupid and ridiculous comments.</p><p>I want to state my total and unequivocal support for An Garda Síochána and compliment the force on the service it provides to the citizens of this State and the exemplary work its members have done over the years in protecting communities throughout the country.  It is unfortunate that people are playing politics with the recent reforms announced by the Minister, Deputy Shatter, which are designed to provide a more efficient and effective police force, as well as to make more efficient use of the scarce resources of the State.</p> <p>We will not go back over why the resources of the State are so scarce, but we are all aware of the difficult times we live in, where every service is under pressure.  The Garda Síochána and the Commissioner are obliged to use their resources as effectively and efficiently as possible.  As politicians, we must stop being so irresponsible and stop frightening the people with untrue statements and comments that do not stand up.</p><p>As the Minister has said, Garda strength is over 13,400 and will remain at over 13,000 for the next number of years.  We also have a reserve force of over 1,000.  Some 100 stations are to be closed, one of which is in my home parish and which station was open for three hours a day.  Hand on heart, I only got one phone call as a result of the closure of that Garda station.  The reason there was no outcry is because the gardaí came to the community and spoke to representatives of residents and assured them adequate cover would be provided and that gardaí would patrol the area and provide an up-to-date, modern policing service to the community.  The same happened in several communities around east Galway.  </p><p>I have a difficulty with regard to Garda vehicles and I am glad the Minister has addressed this recently.  When the parish of New Inn was informed it was to be provided for by Kilreekil, I was told there was no Garda car in Kilreekil to provide that service.  However, I am pleased to learn that the situation is being rectified as a result of the moneys - an additional €5 million this year - the Minister is making available for the purchase and replacement of Garda vehicles.  I want to see gardaí out in the community and patrolling areas and interacting with communities on a regular basis.  They should be out in the community at peak demand times and should be there to deal with mobile criminals who are patrolling various parts of the country.  A garda sitting in a Garda station in rural Ireland is not much use when we have criminals who are very mobile and roaming rural Ireland and making use of our new, improved road network for their criminal activities.</p><p>I welcome the new roster system.  I have been told by quite a number of gardaí that it is working very well and many of them welcome the fact it is more family friendly and more effective in helping them perform their duties.  I share the concerns expressed by many speakers with regard to the fear felt by the elderly in isolated areas.  However, as the Minister said, we cannot have a garda protecting every house in the country.  The protection of the elderly will be more successful if we have regular Garda patrols throughout our communities, which will interact with the local Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert people.  We revamped the Neighbourhood Watch system in my area recently and it is working effectively and people feel more secure as a result.</p><p>I compliment the Minister on the work he is doing.  This motion was timely and appropriate, but as public representatives we need to row in behind the Garda Commissioner and the Minister to ensure that as a result of the commitment being given, we will have a smarter, more effective and more efficient policing system throughout the country, using the scarce resources we have got.  In years to come, we should be able to look back and wonder why we did not take this route earlier.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-06a.214" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1133" speakername="David Cullinane" time="16:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013020600041#PP00200"><p>I am always amused when I hear Government representatives talk about the Opposition playing politics with issues.  I am sure if we were to waste our time and go back over endless hours of contributions the Minister made when he was Opposition spokesman for his party and when he was seeking to hold the then Government to account on a range of issues, we would see that he was often accused of playing politics with issues.  It strikes me this Government in particular is trying to rewrite, not just history, but how we do politics and the role of the Opposition.  We seem to get this attitude a lot from the Government.  It is as if it cannot be criticised and any criticism is seen as playing party politics with issues.</p><p>I find the Minister's response on this issue entirely disingenuous.  The Minister talks about smart policing, but he is really engaged in semantics.  There is nobody in the Chamber against smart policing.  Nobody here is against better and more effective use of Garda resources.  Therefore, there is nobody against the principle of smart policing.  However, many people outside of this Chamber living in communities that will be affected by the closure of Garda stations, the reduction in Garda numbers and a reduction of resources generally to the Garda Síochána will see all of these reductions as anything but smart.  The demand for protests and the demand to hold the Government to account on these issues comes from communities that feel isolated, particularly those in rural areas, and which are fearful of the kinds of policies being put in place by the Government.</p><p>The Minister also makes the charge that some people find change difficulty.  I accept that some people do find change difficult.  However, most people do not find cuts to the resources of An Garda Síochána, to the number of gardaí patrolling the streets and to the number of Garda stations difficult, but they see them as wrong and as something that should not happen.  The Minister also spoke about public representatives fuelling fear, but many people are genuinely fearful of the changes being made.</p><p>The premise of the Minister's argument here today is entirely disingenuous.  He is correct and I agree with him with regard to the hypocrisy of the Fianna Fáil Party in tabling this motion, because it was the party that agreed to the National Recovery Plan 2010-2014, the now infamous four-year plan.  It was the party that agreed with the troika that we should reduce Garda numbers and that agreed cuts in the number of Garda stations.  However, the Minister is delivering on those policies.  Therefore, he cannot on the one hand come in here and accuse Fianna Fáil of hypocrisy and on the other come in as a Minister who is continuing with those policies.  He has no new policies of his own, but is continuing with the policies negotiated by the previous Government with the troika.</p><p>While the Minister sits there and says that members of the Opposition are whipping up fear, the reality is that we meet members of the community every day of the week who are genuinely concerned about these cuts.  We also meet rank and file members of An Garda Síochána who are also fearful.  The Government makes great play of the fact the Garda Commission is on the public record as saying he is confident he can provide the same level of service with the resources he has.  What else would one expect him to say?  A Garda Commissioner will not step into the political arena and engage in that type of debate.  This has always been the case and is the correct position for any Garda commissioner.  However, the Minister can bet his bottom dollar that behind the scenes, the Garda Commissioner, Chief Superintendents and superintendents and Garda sergeants and community police officers across the State are very concerned about the cuts the Minister, his party and the Government are making in this area.</p><p>While I share the Minister's view regarding the hypocrisy of Fianna Fáil, I level the same charge against the Minister.</p> <p>He is also engaged in hypocrisy.  When he was his party's justice spokesman in opposition, he railed against the very changes he is now implementing, including cuts in Garda numbers and Garda station closures.  As a Fianna Fáil Senator said, the exact same thing is evident during debates on many other issues, including health.  While I agree that Fianna Fáil has a brass neck to come in here to engage in such hypocrisy, I contend that the Minister has a brass neck as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-06a.216" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1143" speakername="John Whelan" time="16:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013020600042#QQ00200"><p>I appreciate the decision of the Minister, Deputy Shatter, to come here today.  I realise that he has a great deal of responsibility on his plate.  I think it is important that he is present to hear our concerns and views at first hand.  The House has to be grateful to the Minister for giving such a thorough and comprehensive response to this Private Members' motion.</p><p>  Having said that, it is important for the Minister to hear from us about the genuine fears of people.  These fears are not groundless.  Perhaps the Minister will take them into account in the development and implementation of future policy.  We may have inherited these problems from the previous Government - its recklessness has been well rehearsed during this debate - but it does not follow that we should adopt that Government's policies.  I have serious concerns that the rapport, mutual respect and special relationship that normally exists between the Garda and the Government of the day is under great strain.  I urge the Minister to do everything he can to try to restore and rebuild that relationship.</p><p>  I am in favour of smart policing.  I am fully in favour of reform and change if it results in a more effective way of doing things.  The PULSE system is often referred to as one of the most important resources as changes are introduced to make our system of policing more modern.  The PULSE system that I rely on is having the finger on the pulse in towns, villages and communities throughout the country and listening to members of the Garda Síochána.</p><p>  I understand that over 350 officers attended last night's GRA meeting in Cork.  I note with some disquiet that they voted unanimously to take strike action, in effect, which would be a very serious step.  It is a reflection of the low morale in the Garda.  It would almost be tantamount to mutiny in the force.  I implore the GRA and the AGSI to step back from that kind of action.  It is a two-way street.  I ask the Minister to meet the GRA and the AGSI halfway.  This is not just about Garda stations.  The point and the case we are making is not as simplistic as that.  It is about Garda resources, patrols and visibility.  It is about local knowledge.</p><p>  Throughout November, I repeatedly raised the serious incidents that were happening in Mountmellick, sometimes in broad daylight.  The citizens of the town are afraid to traverse the main street and go about their business.  I could not have conjured up a headline - &quot;Sledgehammer Attack&quot; - in the edition of my local paper that was published yesterday.  The headline, in the <i>Leinster Express</i>, relates to an attack on a lone garda in Mountmellick in the early hours of Monday morning.  That is an example of the kind of challenge and the kind of problem being faced by gardaí.</p><p>  A good point made by Senator Landy needs to be considered.  It is unfortunate that we proceeded with the closure of Garda stations before we rolled out the deployment of the new Garda vehicles.  To be fair, the Minister took the wise decision to make resources available for those vehicles.  My understanding was that the 212 new patrol vehicles which were purchased last year were to be deployed in December 2012 and January 2013.  I have not seen any of them in the Laois-Offaly Garda division or in other parts of the country.  A strategic mistake was made because people would have felt more reassured and heartened if they had seen those vehicles on the beat prior to the closure of the Garda stations.</p><p>  Gardaí are law-abiding people.  They are not militant.  They are supporters of the State and of the Government.  I believe they think their pay and basic working conditions are under attack at the moment.  Serving members of the force have told me that gardaí with up to 20 years' service are now relying on credit to get by.  I have been informed that since 2007, gardaí have taken a 26% cut in their effective rate of pay.  I am aware of Garda families that are applying for and receiving family income supplement.  Now more pay cuts are proposed.  I do not think the Minister for Justice and Equality would like to see any serving member of the Garda being reduced to this level.  This has traditionally been regarded as a good and well-paid job.</p><p>  As a Government, we must do everything we can to regain the trust of gardaí and retain their expertise and vast experience.  I am a supporter and advocate of Community Alert schemes.  I am involved in such a scheme in my own rural community of Timahoe and Ratheniska.  Our local scheme was established through Muintir na Tíre with the assistance of a retired superintendent.  If we are to deter unscrupulous criminals from engaging in these activities throughout the countryside, we need deterrents other than text alerts.  We need highly-motivated gardaí on the beat with modern patrol cars.  Their response times should be quick enough to reassure rural people that they are not isolated or being left alone.  We must be careful with the use of statistics.  They can be applied in all sorts of ways.  I do not think the reality on the ground is necessarily borne out in the statistics we are using.</p><p>  I was glad to hear the Minister say that the Garda buildings which are being vacated can be put to positive community use.  This is important.  I echo and support the views of a member of Dublin City Council, Mannix Flynn, who has pointed out that these buildings are in important locations and form an important part of our policing heritage, tradition and history across the length and breadth of the country.  It would be a disaster if they were to fall into disrepair, to be vandalised or to be pilfered.  I encourage the Minister to ensure they are retained, maintained and managed so they can be put to good use.  They should not be allowed to decay or to be lost to the community.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the budgetary challenges the Minister is facing, I urge him to try to re-engage with the GRA and the AGSI.  If he can get them back to the table, they should start with a clean sheet.  I urge the associations to meet the Minister halfway in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-06a.217" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1123" speakername="Brian Ó Domhnaill" time="16:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013020600042#QQ00300"><p>I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on this important motion.  This is a burning issue up and down the country, particularly in many rural areas but also in cities and other urban areas.  Threats to the lives of members of the Garda Síochána and members of the general public are associated with the ongoing phenomenon of gangland criminality.  Old people in the part of the country where I come from are living in a state of fear.  Some people have told me at constituency clinics that they are afraid to go to the bingo as a result of the lack of policing and the lack of resources available to the Garda.  I know the Minister spoke on this issue on local radio in County Donegal.  I did not hear the interview but I know that it was obvious that he had not been briefed on the point of view of local gardaí.  Members of the force in County Donegal and other western counties have made it clear that there is a complete breakdown between the Minister's version of what is happening at national level and what is actually happening on the ground.</p><p>The Minister has every right to come in and rebut the motion by saying the troika brought in certain proposals which had to be adhered to.  If the troika agreement that was signed up to was so ring-fenced and so hard and fast, why was the Minister in a position to obtain additional resources?  Why was Fianna Fáil in a position to sit down with the troika team over numerous months and be told that decisions on how the budgetary adjustment should be achieved were matters for the Government of the State?  We have been told that every Minister in the Government is responsible for deciding how the budgetary arithmetic can best be achieved, for example by making changes to staffing levels or to capital or current expenditure.</p> <p>It is not right to blame those who are funding us.  It is a matter for the Government to decide on how the resources are expended.  It is very easy to blame the troika.  I often hear that the troika is to blame or Fianna Fáil is to blame whereas the only people not to blame, it would appear, are the members of the current Government.  Perhaps the GRA, the unions and everyone else is wrong, and perhaps the only people who are actually right are Government Ministers.  I do not subscribe to that.</p><p>I am very disappointed with the resources being made available to rank and file gardaí.  I would agree with much of what has been said by most Senators, including Senator Whelan.  However, the ordinary gardaí who speak to us as public representatives have a right to do so.  They may not do it in a public forum but they have every right to speak to us or to express their opinions through their own organisation.  The opinion that is coming forward is one of discontent, disquiet and unease at the level of resources being made available.</p><p>I come from a county where two members of the Garda Síochána lost their lives while undertaking their duties - the late Garda Robert McCallion and Garda Gary McLoughlin, of whom the Minister is well aware.  My county has witnessed a spate of crime, in particular burglaries on elderly members of the community, and in particular since last October up to the end of January, where people as old as 96 were targeted and burgled in their homes.  There are people living in a state of fear.  This is the wrong time to close down Garda stations.  We can say we are in a new and modern age but how can we expect the elderly population, who very often live alone, to subscribe to the new modern technology.  How can we expect stations or community halls to be used for two hours a day or two hours a week?  Are we telling the criminals only to commit the crimes during the two hours of those days or that week?  It is a crazy situation.  We are leaving vast areas without a presence.</p><p>For example, Glencolmcille Garda station was opened in the 1920s and closed last week.  That Garda station had a point of presence in the locality.  The population in that area more than doubles during the summer yet we are now leaving it without a Garda station.  People can argue that resources are being channelled in a different way but that does not appear to be happening on the ground in regard to the additional hours.  There is a lack of resources in terms of Garda stations.</p><p>I am not here to take lectures from Sinn Féin in regard to the activities and resources of An Garda Síochána over the last 30 years in the Border region.  I lived in Northern Ireland for longer than perhaps any other Member of the House and I saw first-hand what was occurring there, on both sides and on all sides.  The Border is left open at present.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister to the House and commend him for his incredible work-rate.  The last number of weeks have seen a lot of talk about changes in Garda practice and station closures.  This motion addresses the concern of the Garda Commissioner about not wanting to let the levels in the service drop below 13,000.  Fianna Fáil's plan would have hit exactly that number in 2014 yet, right now, Garda numbers are still above what Fianna Fáil was projecting back in 2012.  Therefore, I would have to say this Fianna Fáil motion smacks of hypocrisy, wherein it opposes these reforms although its own National Recovery Plan 2011-14 showed that it proposed a reduction in Garda numbers and bigger cuts in the Garda budget.  It is hypocrisy that, out of one of side of his mouth, the Fianna Fáil leader laments the parish pump politics and the continuation of politics as usual, but he then engages in precisely that.  It is hypocrisy in that Fianna Fáil does not care about the actual numbers, with crime having reduced between 2008 and 2012, and instead tries to generate fear in communities.</p><p>Numbers - real numbers - matter, so they should.  Let us take a look at some of the Fianna Fáil numbers and compare them to our own.  In 2012 the Minister, Deputy Shatter, secured €2.243 billion, which was an additional €118 million over and above the intended Fianna Fáil allocation of €2.125 billion.  For this year, the Minister secured funding of €2.2 billion, which was €191 million over and above the Fianna Fáil allocation of €2.009 billion.  The reality of these numbers is that the budget for policing is better off than it would have been under Fianna Fáil's plans.  It is there in black and white in Fianna Fáil's own report.</p><p>Nevertheless, despite Fianna Fáil attempting to generate controversy and upset in communities over these policing issues, let us look at some facts about Garda station closures.  Of the 100 stations to be closed in 2013, 98% are open part time while 94% are open for three hours a day or less.  Meanwhile, in terms of personnel, 88% are served by one garda and only 5% are served by three or more Garda personnel.  What does this mean precisely?  In the case of one garda manning a station, it now means one garda is freed up to patrol.  The reality of advancing technology, communications and equipment for gardaí means gardaí are now deployed on our streets and are able to access information and communicate as effectively and efficiently as they were when based at a station just ten years ago.  Policing is evolving as technology evolves and our structures need to evolve with it.</p><p>Evidently, this has the capacity to scare people as they think police coverage will be thinner, and Fianna Fáil plays on this fear.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The reality is that to have Fianna Fáil bemoaning stations closing and better equipped gardaí being allowed to protect the streets is akin to complaining that we no longer buy as many muskets for the army as we used to and have instead upgraded them.  Technology changes and processes update.  Having a station open for three hours a day when the gardaí can be better deployed elsewhere is pure symbolism, which I know many politicians like to specialise in.</p><p>Fine Gael has always prided itself on its position as a law and order party, and that is so in this case also.  However, for once, the greater good and the good of the police force clashes with the parish pump.  We have chosen the good of the police force.  I am sorry to say this motion shows Fianna Fáil already harking back to the parish pump.</p></speech>

The Garda Síochána has and always had my full support.  However, as we speak, it is a force that is disillusioned and semi-demoralised, mainly with the direction the force is going.  I would have to agree with the suggestion of Senators Landy and Whelan that it might have been a mistake to close down the Garda stations before first putting in place the new fleet of cars the Minister has purchased, and letting people know we had them, perhaps by advertising this on television and explaining how many cars would be in circulation in each county.  This would have served to allay the fears of elderly people.</p><p>A similar mistake was made in regard to the closing of the accident and emergency unit in Roscommon Hospital, where the HSE promised the unit would not be closed until after it proved to the people over a number of months how the advanced paramedics were going to work in the locality, in order that their fears would be allayed.  It did not do that and, again, it put the fear of God into people.  Lessons should be learned from some of these issues.</p><p>There are also concerns within the Garda in regard to the new rostering arrangements.  I see this in my own home town of Ballaghaderreen.</p> <p>The station there is not the headquarters.  The headquarters are in Castlerea, but the staff at Ballaghaderreen are being told to go up to Castlerea every night in their cars.  Yet the crime figures for my area are greater than those for Castlerea.  They are no sooner up in Castlerea than they are sent back down to Ballaghaderreen again.  As was already mentioned, it is important that we do everything to make sure we do not end up with a blue flu epidemic again.  I agree with calls for us to consider reopening Templemore in the very near future.  We cannot let a situation arise in which the force gets demoralised, members take early retirement and we are left with a two-year period in which numbers of gardaí on the ground are low.  </p><p>Senator Darragh O'Brien mentioned burglaries earlier, and said it had been mentioned at a joint policing committee that the Department was looking for more lenient sentences for burglars.  That, coupled with an advertisement that the Garda stations are closing, is not a good recipe when one puts the two together.  It needs to be hit somehow on the head.  Senator MacSharry made a point I was going to make.  I know we are supposedly putting more police cars on the streets.  Given the introduction of mobile phones and the fact that gangs are coming down from other parts of the country with between one and three cars, they will always be ahead of us unless we address it in a different way.</p><p>Senator Daly said that the previous Government could not be blamed, that the Government could do business its own way and that the troika did not demand that we do this.  Fianna Fáil signed up to this in 2010 with the troika, yet it now says there were other ways it could have been done.  I ask Senator Daly and Senator Ó Domhnaill, who made a similar point, to tell us what the other ways are.  What other way was the previous Government going to propose if it had not agreed with the troika?  Had it another plan, and if so, why did it not use it?</p></speech>

Two Government Ministers were severely criticised recently because decisions were taken affecting particular areas and false allegations were made.  Now, however, the Minister for Justice and Equality has taken a decision that affects his own constituency and we have not seen any headlines in the newspapers on the taking of that decisive action, because he believed it was the correct decision to make.</p><p>We have seen the figures showing that 94% of the Garda stations to be closed were open for three hours or less.  Do people want to keep them open even if that means keeping them open for 15 minutes in the day?  If that is the kind of system they want, it will not provide a very good service for the local community in any area.  The figures clearly show that there will be 61,000 extra Garda patrol hours available as a result of this change.  We have all seen that there are 83 police stations in Northern Ireland for a population of 1.4 million, while there are 340 police stations in Scotland for a population of 5.2 million.  We are moving with the times by creating an efficient Garda force and providing backup support to the local community.  Everyone in the community has a role to play in working with and protecting each other and making sure that people assist the gardaí in preventing criminal activity.  The ordinary person does have a part to play.  I have seen this work very effectively in my constituency of Cork North Central.  Over the past 18 years, I have been working with the local community policing service.  One project involved training 50 young people who had dropped out of school.  The vast majority of those young people - 50 at any one time - were referred to us by gardaí working with the local community and young people.  We carried out a survey of those 50 young people because there is a different group every year.  Five years after leaving the training system, the vast majority of them were in full-time employment.  The records also showed that the vast majority of their fathers or grandfathers had never worked.  This was the positive contribution the Garda made in that area.  The gardaí on the north side of Cork city meet with all of the local communities on a regular basis, making sure that if there are issues that need to be dealt with, they are highlighted and dealt with.  The work being done by the Garda is very positive, and long may it continue.</p></speech>

My wife was born in a Garda station, as were many of her siblings in Carrigart in Donegal.  I must add that this was not because her mother was a criminal but because her father was a Garda.  That was over 50 years ago.  The Garda station was manned by a family, as were most stations in the country.  The local Garda, God rest my father-in-law, was usually there seven days a week.  He did not take a holiday.  He was an ordinary country man who enjoyed his job.</p><p>The police service that we have now and want to develop cannot be based on that model because the young gardaí we have now are trained up and technologically savvy.  Most of them have degrees and many of them are studying policing.  It is a different system.  If we were setting up a police force today, we would not have 700 Garda stations.  People talk about how robberies happen along the Border.  I lived in Lifford when there were 50 gardaí there and we were terrorised by certain individuals who called gardaí collaborators, protested outside the Garda station and petrol-bombed it.  That was 25 years ago, not 50 or 60 years ago.  At that stage, there were people on both sides of the Border, but the call for more Garda stations to be open on the Donegal side of the Border is in contrast to the PSNI stations on the other side of the Border which are being closed down.  We are now protecting the Border without any police stations on the other side, thanks to Sinn Féin.</p></speech>

I am asking a simple question.  I asked the Minister about the lack of progress with regard to the investigation into the murderers of Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe.  The point I was making is that I want to see the murderers arrested and locked up tonight if possible.  It is not a criticism of the Minister, but it was such a callous crime and we are being told that the Garda knows who these people are.  There were 16 different articles over the weekend.  I do not always get the newspapers to read and I specifically did not get them to throw at the Minister.  This was not political spin by the newspapers and the rest of the media.  Various journalists condemned the low morale within the Garda, the closure of Garda stations and the Garda College at Templemore and the lack of resources.  That was not a Fianna Fáil issue.  The Minister will also ignore at his peril the comments of the GRA and the AGSI.  He cannot do this and if he does, it is at his peril.  I am not being political when I say he can also ignore at his peril the very striking and powerful eulogy by the priest at the funeral of Detective Garda Donohoe.</p> <p>That was not done without the prior <i>imprimatur</i>of his family and of the wider Garda community.</p><p> The Minister ignores at his peril the pleas of rank and file gardaí.  He cannot ignore the comments made in the House on a previous occasion by Senator Sheehan to the effect that the streets of Dublin are not safe to walk on.  He also cannot ignore the fact that communities and rural alliance groups are approaching Members in respect of this matter.  I have never sought a public meeting in respect of the closure of rural barracks but I have attended a number of such meetings.  We are not the catalyst when it comes to criticisms being made; it is community councils and, on occasion, those gardaí who work in rural stations and who are embedded in their local communities that are raising concerns.</p><p> I wish to nail a particular lie in respect of the availability of 61,000 additional Garda patrol hours.  I live in a very rural area near Schull, which is on the Mizen Peninsula in west Cork, and I am not in possession of an iota of evidence from community council activists and gardaí that the closure of local stations has given rise to this extra allowance.  The notion that a garda in a rural station comes to work for four hours, puts his feet up on his desk, drinks a cup of coffee and looks out the window is nonsense.  Most Senators will agree that rural gardaí are involved in their communities and are members of local GAA or soccer teams.  They call to the homes of elderly people to check on them and they can sometimes be seen doing work out of hours.  These officers are active in the communities in which they live.  I hate the fact that this will no longer be the case.  The Minister stated that Garda squad cars will patrol places such as the Mizen, the Beara and the Sheep's Head peninsulas and many other remote areas in Kerry, Donegal and other western counties.  In such locations, it would probably take a garda an hour to drive - on bad roads - to the scene of a crime, which is ludicrous.  A locally-based officer could be on the scene in a matter of minutes.</p><p> This is an extremely important matter.  There is no evidence available that indicates that the smart policing model - or whatever one wishes to call it - offers a better way to operate.  In the context of what Senator Landy and others stated, I am aware that, unfortunately, those who are taking the biggest hit in rural areas, particularly the area in which I live, are elected representatives from the Labour Party.  Those opposite ignore that fact at their peril.</p><p> I posed a large number of questions on particular issues and I am disappointed the Minister did not bring greater clarity to the answers he offered in respect of them.  As a justice spokesperson on this side of the House, it would be remiss of me to ignore those issues.  The Minister, Deputy Shatter, has left the Chamber but I wish to give an assurance to his replacement that if what is happening is allowed to continue - if the resources and manpower available to the Garda are not improved and further rural stations are closed - we will raise this matter again and we will not be cowed by a lot of nonsense from the Government in respect of something that happened three or four years ago.  In my opinion, the Minister's response was disappointing.  I am most disillusioned with what he said.</p></speech>

 &#8212; records the views of the Garda Commissioner that he would not like to see the strength of the force drop below 13,000 members;
 &#8212; notes the pivotal role that Garda stations play in the fabric of rural Ireland, their central position in the life of the towns and villages they serve and their part in effective, on the ground community policing;
 &#8212; notes with grave concern the disturbing rise in burglary levels across the country, particularly in commuter belt areas and the impact this has had on the safety and security of the family home across the country;
 &#8212; observes the disturbing number of illegal dissident actions in the past number of months and the growing threat of dissident terrorist activity;
 &#8212; further notes the rise in gangland related murders in 2012 and the ongoing threat of gangland violence across the country;
 &#8212; strongly criticises the draconian closure of 140 Garda stations across the State with over 100 stations that closed on 31 January 2013, particularly in vulnerable rural areas where appalling crimes on isolated elderly homeowners have taken place and in busy urban stations such as Stepaside and Kill O the Grange in Dublin;
 &#8212; fully opposes the covert reduction in Garda numbers to dangerously low levels through the whittling away of the Garda payroll that jeopardises the effectiveness of the force in protecting Irish citizens;
 &#8212; vehemently disagrees with the Government&#8217;s failure to address the degradation of the Garda vehicle fleet which has an integral part in tackling crime;
 &#8212; calls on the Minister for Justice and Equality to reopen Templemore to Garda recruitment to ensure the force does not fall to negligent strength; and
 &#8212; further calls on the Minister to reverse his attack on the physical infrastructure of rural Ireland and stop the closure of Garda stations across the country.</p></speech>

To delete all words after &#8216;&#8216;That&#8217;&#8217;, and substitute the following:&quot;&#8212; acknowledges the vital role of An Garda Síochána in providing security to the State and protection to the public;
&#8212; acknowledges the investment of &#8364;4m in the Garda fleet in 2012 which provided for the purchase of a total of 213 vehicles and the additional allocation of a dedicated &#8364;5m for the purchase of new Garda vehicles in 2013;
&#8212; recognises in particular the value of the recent significant reforms in An Garda Síochána in making more efficient use of resources and delivering a more effective policing service;
&#8212; recognises the importance of ensuring the continued capacity of An Garda Síochána to combat crime effectively and welcomes the Government&#8217;s commitment to maintain resources at the highest possible level;
&#8212; recognises the continued success of An Garda Síochána in tackling crime, reflected in the downward trend in most categories of crime;
&#8212; welcomes the continued impact Operation Fiacla is having in tackling burglary around the country, with the arrest of 3,538 persons and 1,924 persons charged between April and December 2012;
&#8212; supports in particular the measures being taken by An Garda Síochána to tackle organised and gangland crime, including extensive drug seizures and associated arrests, as well as ongoing operations to disrupt and prosecute criminal terrorists;
and
&#8212; resolves to continue to support An Garda Síochána in the prevention and detection of crime and the bringing of criminals to justice.&quot;.- (Senator Paul Bradford).</p></speech>

The ECB is considering a proposal from the Government as part of the ongoing discussions.  In discussions with the ECB it was envisaged that the first step would be the liquidation of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, and the sale of its remaining assets to NAMA or other market purchasers.</p><p>  The Bill has been in preparation for a considerable period and its presentation now was precipitated by the proposal to liquidate IBRC being made public.</p> <p>This posed an immediate risk to the bank and required immediate action to secure the stability of the bank and the value of its assets of between €12 billion and €14 billion.  On behalf of the State I have vested the powers of the board temporarily in an employee of KPMG, and a KPMG team is now in control of the bank on my behalf.  The team moved at approximately 4 p.m. to secure the IBRC premises in Dublin, London and New York.</p><p>Questions were raised in the Dáil about the need for urgency in passing this Bill.  The reason for urgency is that it is not possible to have a long-drawn-out debate, during which time the value of IBRC and its assets would be eroded, because that would cause significant additional losses for the taxpayer.  Anyone who is familiar with even the smallest corner shop going into liquidation will be aware that no company can continue to trade when there is a credible belief that it will go into liquidation.  The reality is that no developer would ever make a repayment on his or her loan to IBRC while the bank was in limbo.  This would mean that the bank would only be losing money at the expense of the taxpayer and we would eventually have to bring in a liquidator after suffering even further loss of value.  The special liquidator gives legal certainty in preventing loss of value in the bank's assets and ensuring an orderly wind-down.  I do not think any Senator could give me an example of a company that announced it would be liquidating some time in the future and then did not do so until the interval had passed.</p><p>I will now turn to the subject and objectives of the Bill.  Once the legislation is passed, joint special liquidators will be appointed to IBRC with immediate effect to wind up its business and operations.  It is intended that the net debt owed by IBRC to the Central Bank and its associated floating charge security will be purchased by NAMA, using NAMA bonds, in a way that ensures there is no capital loss for the Central Bank.  The ministerial guarantee underpinning the net debt owed to the Central Bank will also be transferred to NAMA.  The deposit guarantee scheme and eligible liabilities guarantee scheme will ensure that eligible depositors, bondholders and counterparties will be repaid.  There is also a derivatives guarantee in place.  As is common in liquidations, all employment contracts in IBRC are immediately terminated.</p><p>As indicated, the IBRC debt to the Central Bank, which is intended to be purchased by NAMA, is secured by a floating charge over the assets of IBRC and a ministerial guarantee.  Following an independent valuation process, the special liquidators will sell the assets of IBRC which are subject to the floating charge to third parties at or above their independent valuation.  Failing that, the special liquidators will sell the assets to NAMA at their valuation price.  The proceeds of these sales will be used to repay creditors in accordance with normal Companies Acts priorities, so that preferred creditors, including employees, are paid first and then the IBRC debt to NAMA is paid under the floating charge.  To the extent that proceeds are available after repayment in full of the NAMA debt, these proceeds will be applied to remaining unsecured creditors who have not been paid under the guarantee schemes - which, for clarity, do not include the deposit guarantee scheme.  These remaining unsecured creditors will include the Minister to the extent that he has paid out under guarantee schemes.  Similarly, if the proceeds are not sufficient to pay IBRC's debt to NAMA, the shortfall to NAMA will be met by the existing ministerial guarantee.  The remaining subsidiaries will be wound up or sold by the special liquidators to optimise value and once all of its obligations are resolved, IBRC will cease to exist.</p><p>I will now go through the sections of the proposed Bill.  Section 3 sets out the purposes of the Act.  Section 4 provides that the Minister will make a special liquidation order in respect of IBRC.  Section 5 provides, among other matters, for the publication of the special liquidation order.  Section 6 provides, among other matters, for an immediate stay on all proceedings against IBRC; that no further actions or proceedings can be issued against IBRC without the consent of the High Court; that no action or proceedings for the winding up of IBRC or the appointment of a liquidator or an examiner can be taken, issued, continued or commenced; for the removal of any liquidator or examiner appointed prior to the order; and that the order constitutes notice of termination of employment for each employee with immediate effect.</p><p>Section 7 provides for the appointment of the special liquidators.  Section 8 limits the power to grant injunctive relief in certain proceedings.  Section 9 provides that the Minister will issue instructions and may issue directions to the special liquidators, and requires the special liquidators to comply with such instructions and directions.  If the Bill passes successfully through the Seanad and is signed by the President in the early hours of the morning, I will be issuing instructions under that section to the liquidators and I will place copies of those instructions in the Oireachtas Library for the information of Members.</p><p>Sections 10 and 11 deal with the application of certain sections of the Companies Acts and Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011 in the context of the winding up.  Section 12 provides for the sale or transfer of assets and liabilities in IBRC.  Section 13 provides that the Minister may give directions in writing to NAMA in relation to the acquisition by NAMA of the debt of IBRC to the Central Bank; and the purchase of assets of IBRC from the special liquidators.  Section 14 provides that the Minister shall direct the special liquidators in respect of the independent valuation of the assets of IBRC prior to sale.  Section 17 provides that the Minister may issue securities.</p><p>The liquidation of IBRC does not affect other banks.  The vast majority of IBRC's deposit accounts moved to AIB and Permanent TSB last year and they are unaffected by today's announcement.  The deposit accounts that remain in IBRC are generally associated with a wider ongoing relationship with the bank.  It is important to state that all eligible deposits up to €100,000 for an individual and €200,000 for two individuals holding a joint account in IBRC are protected by the deposit guarantee scheme in operation in the State and eligible deposits beyond this limit are guaranteed under the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme.  It is critically important that deposit account holders, mortgage account holders and those indebted to IBRC understand that their situation following the liquidation should generally remain unchanged.  Guaranteed deposits will be repaid under the eligible liability guarantee and deposit guarantee schemes.  Mortgage account holders and other borrowers with IBRC will remain liable for their debts and should continue to make repayments.  If customers of IBRC have concerns they should make contact with the operators of the relevant schemes.  Contact numbers are available on the Department of Finance website. </p><p>I wish to emphasise that the reason these steps are being taken is entirely distinct from the performance or direction of the board of management of IBRC.  It is simply compelling in the larger public interest to take this action now, and the Government has made its decision on that basis alone.  I acknowledge, with much appreciation, the significant efforts the directors and staff of IBRC have made in the stabilisation of and maintenance of value in IBRC.  I regret the abruptness with which this decision is being communicated to management and staff, but due to the scale, sensitivity and complexity of the economic issues involved, it was necessary in the public interest to keep the matter confidential until now.  Unfortunately, as is common in liquidations, all employee contracts will be terminated on the winding-up of IBRC.  However, it has been indicated to me that the majority of staff will, if they wish, be rehired for the purposes of the orderly liquidation on such terms and for such duration as may be determined by the special liquidators.  Employees will rank, in the normal way, as preferential creditors ahead of NAMA and unsecured creditors in respect of certain amounts owing on a winding-up, including accrued wages, salaries, holiday pay, sick pay, statutory redundancy, pensions contributions and claims for damages arising from accidents.  I understand this announcement will come as quite a shock to employees of IBRC and to some of those who do business with the bank.  The special liquidators will be instructed to handle that as well as possible in the circumstances. </p><p>As I stated previously in the Dáil, I would have preferred to be introducing this Bill in tandem with a finalised agreement with the European Central Bank.  However, I understand that the European Central Bank will continue to consider the proposals made by the Governor of the Irish Central Bank in agreement with the Irish Government in Frankfurt tomorrow.  I commend this Bill to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-06a.319" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1139" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="18:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013020600056#FFF00300"><p>I thank the Minister for his contribution.  I believe I speak for most people when I say the manner in which this Bill has been brought to the Oireachtas is wholly unacceptable.  It is akin to asking people to bet on the blind.  I was in the Dáil Chamber for the Minister's speech, to which I listened with great intent, and where my party colleagues outlined a number of specific queries.  What the Seanad is being asked to do is to ratify the legislation outside the context of the overall deal the Minister intends to achieve, I hope, tomorrow.  Fianna Fáil has always wished the Minister and the Government the best in their endeavours to secure a better deal.  However, we have an issue with the way this is being done.  I have previous experience of late night-early morning sittings and the outcome of such sittings in 2008 and 2010 has been discussed since.  Personally, I have an issue with rushed legislation.  Will the Minister clarify for how long this legislation has been prepared?  I understand the Bills Office works extremely hard and that it has produced a Bill and an explanatory memorandum very quickly.  However, it is important that Senators know that the Bill has been subjected to the correct checks and balances because I have no doubt it will be challenged in the courts.  I hope the Minister will answer this question for us.</p><p>The Minister has been working hard to secure a better deal for the country, but, as public representatives and Members of the Oireachtas, all we know about the make-up of the proposed deal is what we hear, be it in whispers on the corridor or from the media, about how the promissory notes will be dealt with, how they will be transferred to NAMA, whether they will become a full part of the sovereign debt, the type of payments we will make and for how long we will make them.  The Minister must agree that it is not ideal for us to be debating the Bill in the early hours of the morning in the absence of any detail of how it will affect the country.  However, I take his word that he has, effectively, been bounced into doing this because of the leaks that occurred concerning the plans of the Government to liquidate the IBRC.  I welcome these plans.  Any of us who has been in politics in recent years - I have only been involved since 2007 - will welcome seeing the back of the IBRC or what was formerly Anglo Irish Bank.  As my colleague in the Dáil, Deputy Michael McGrath, said, this is only a technical liquidation and the assets held by Anglo Irish Bank and the IBRC will now be transferred to NAMA.  Therefore, it is important that the Minister give us a better indication of what is on the table.  I understand he cannot go into great detail, but we must know what we are signing up to before we support the legislation.  It is wholly unsatisfactory that we do not know.</p><p>The Minister has expanded on the explanation he gave in the Dáil of the real risk with regard to the €12 billion to €14 billion worth of assets remaining in the IBRC, which I welcome.  He has mentioned that he believes no developer will ever make a repayment on a loan to the IBRC while the bank is in limbo.  I agree with him.  However, how realisable are these assets?  Would there, as suggested by some of the Minister's colleagues, have been a run on them, causing the State to lose out on their value?  I ask the Minister to expand on this, if possible.</p><p>Fianna Fáil supported the Bill in the Dáil, indicating that, on balance, the Government could be trusted on this issue.  However, it is important that the Minister give us some indication of what the ECB plans to accept and whether that will be announced to both Houses tomorrow?  Is an announcement imminent?  Many of those to whom I have been talking are very concerned about the fact that the legislation has been introduced so quickly, without a detailed explanation being given as to why this must happen.  All of us welcome the liquidation of the IBRC and, obviously, the staff and those who have been working in the organisation, particularly its front-line staff, will take some solace from the Minister's statement that they will be offered jobs in and transfer to NAMA.</p><p>I do not like what we are doing here.  As legislators, we should have more information than what either House has received.  I listened intently to the Minister in the Dáil and the contributions of other spokespersons.  I acknowledge that while the Minister is engaged in detailed negotiations, he cannot tell us everything.  However, I am not satisfied as to why he and the Government considered it necessary to bring forward the Bill in such a short space of time or why it was necessary to bring it to the Seanad directly after being voted on in the Dáil, without knowing what the implications will be.  As I said, on balance, Fianna Fáil supported the Bill in the Dáil because it supports the Government's efforts to secure a better deal for the country.  The Minister had acknowledged it previously, but the Taoiseach acknowledged for the first time in the Seanad last July that the previous Government had had no other option but to do as it did, as there were no European mechanisms in place for us to deal with the banking problem which was not purely an Irish banking problem.  As Deputy Michael McGrath said in the Dáil, we have passed the European treaty, but the new mechanisms available to countries encountering banking difficulties are not available to us.  As a result, we still do not know how our retrospective banking debt will be dealt with.  That is the reason, following the debate in the Dáil and this debate in the Seanad, we must make a call on whether, on balance, we should agree to the passing of this legislation.  However, this is wholly unsatisfactory and many of the people to whom I have spoken in the past few hours are very uneasy about it, more than likely because of their experience of late night or early morning sittings to pass legislation.  </p><p>I ask the Minister to expand further on the few questions I have put to him so as to provide comfort that the Bill will stand up to legal scrutiny.  Will he also outline, in as much detail as possible, the prospective deal about which we expect to hear tomorrow?  I would rather hear about it in the Oireachtas than on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot;.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-06a.320" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1160" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="18:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013020600056#FFF00400"><p>I welcome the Minister at the early hour of 3.40 a.m.  I agree with Senator Darragh O'Brien on one point, namely, that there is a natural suspicion of legislation introduced late at night.  It is unfortunate that there is only so much information the Minister can give us, but such is the nature of negotiations.</p><p>On a human level, there are 850 people working with the IBRC who face an uncertain future in the short and medium term.  In this regard, I welcome the Minister's comments on their being paid their wages, salaries, holiday and sick pay, which is the minimum to be expected.  It is unfortunate that under section 6(5), notice of termination of employment will have immediate effect for each employee.  However, I welcome the view expressed by the Minister that, in all likelihood, many of the people concerned will be employed by NAMA or the liquidator.</p><p>It is important to touch on the reasons we are here.</p> <p>We are here to come to an affordable solution - the most relevant term that has been used here - to a €48 billion liability that the State has.  People can stick their heads in the sand and their backsides in the air if they want, but it does not alter the fact that the State will have to pay this bill at some stage.  This is about the restructuring of the promissory note.</p><p>I would like the Minister to answer a question.  He said in the Dáil Chamber that he would have liked to reach an agreement whereby the liquidation of IBRC and the decision on the promissory note could have taken place at the same time.  Why is there such a yearning on the part of the European authorities to ensure IBRC is liquidated in this manner?  Is there a legal reason for it?  What is the exact reason for the liquidation having to occur in this way?  I would like the Minister to shed some light on that, if possible.</p><p>I heard the conversation about the potential for significant risk and loss to the taxpayer.  We cannot expose taxpayers to anything beyond what they have already been exposed to.  This institution has cost the people of this country enough.  The Minister will certainly have my full support in anything he does to ensure this institution does not cost the people of this State any more money.</p><p>It is important to refer to the achievements of those who have taken over IBRC.  When legislation came before the previous Dáil and we were eventually given the figures, we were told the likely cost to the State was €34 billion.  The last time representatives of IBRC made a presentation to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, we were told that the figure is now closer to €25 billion, in their opinion.  As I said earlier, any time we are able to reduce the cost to the citizens of this country, I will applaud and support that.</p><p>During the debate on the promissory note in the other Chamber, I heard public representatives talking about the potential write-down we could get from the ECB.  We might hear something similar from Senators before the end of this debate.  I ask them to live in the real world of central banking, federal reserves or whatever they are called throughout the world.  If money is loaned, central banks will look for it back.  That is the way it works.</p><p>Those who talk about write-downs seem to ignore the fact that central banks throughout the world look for moneys to be repaid by destitute and poor countries where children die of starvation every morning.  Of course they are going to look for moneys to be repaid by this country too.  That is what they do.  While we might feel aggrieved about it, we cannot deny that the citizens of this country are now liable for this banking difficulty.  Children do not die of starvation on the streets of this country as they do in other countries from which central banks around the world are also looking for moneys.</p></speech>

It is good because it leads me to my next point.  I have seen some ashen-faced Opposition people around the place.  I call them the flat-earthers.  They do not want a good deal because they want to continue to be able to say "Sure you are being screwed by the establishment of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour".  These people want a bad deal so they can keep singing their song about "You are all getting done, but we are the ones who will save you".  They will not save anything.  The reality is that we would have loved to have started from a different place, but we were not given that opportunity.  This problem was handed over from one sovereign Government as it exited to another sovereign Government as it entered.</p><p>It is important to put some figures on the record of the House.  We are due to pay €3.1 billion, or €3,100 million.  Depending on whatever the outcome is, the euro rate at the moment is less than 1%.  I do not know what the deal - if we are able to get a deal - will be.  In the conversation that was leaked last week, it was suggested that we would not start to pay for a number of years.  I am not sure what that period of time is.  I want to put on the record what the difference in real numbers will be if we do not have to pay anything for a year, two years or five years and if the net figure for the euro rate is 1%.  The difference between that 1% payment and the €3.1 billion payment is €2,790 million.  Those are real numbers.  That is what I call cashflow.  That is the cashflow that every person in this House and the other House is talking about.  That is the cashflow that allows us to alleviate the difficult choices that have been made and which the Minister may have to make in budget 2014.  I support the Minister, Deputy Noonan.  I was in the other Chamber on the night in September 2008 when he was the only person in either House to ask whether it was a liquidity crisis or a capitalisation crisis.  We all looked around, scratched our heads and wondered what Deputy Noonan was talking about.  I trust the leadership and the abilities of the Minister and of Professor Honohan.  I hope a deal that helps the citizens of this country will be reached in the days to come.  If that happens, we will all benefit.</p></speech>

It has been said that there is no legal or moral obligation on Ireland to pay the bank debt.  I am not so sure, particularly with regard to the moral obligation.  I am sure that we do not know the future.  None of us is absolutely certain that the acceptance or rejection of the Bill will bring us what we all hope for.  As Senator Darragh O'Brien clearly articulated, we do not know all the details of the deal.  I agree that it would be better if we had more time, but we do not.</p><p>I would like to ask a few questions which, if answered, will help me and my Independent colleagues to come to a final view on this legislation.  Perhaps my first request should be to hear the Minister explain the meaning of the Bill in plainer English.  I guess I am wondering what the final outcome for the taxpayer will be if this Bill is passed.  Has the Minister calculated how much taxpayers can save?  I presume significant savings will accrue if we pass this legislation.  The Minister spoke forcefully when he said that one of the main purposes of the Bill is the protection of the national interest.  It was heartening to hear.  Can he assure the House that he is as certain as he can be that this will be the outcome of the passage of the Bill?  Can he say anything more about one of the objectives of this Bill, which is to ensure we move towards finally having a complete separation of bank and sovereign debt?</p> <p>I very much believe that ultimate separation is absolutely required for our recovery.  While I would agree it is time to wind down the IBRC with great awareness of, respect for and concern for the staff and employees - I heard the Minister attend to that in his remarks - my question, which perhaps has to do with the other side of the deal, is where the promissory note is going.  I think it is being transformed and I think it is becoming a bond and going to NAMA, but where is it going?  In transferring the promissory note to a longer-term bond so that it will be less costly for Ireland to pay its debt, it seems clear, at least from the debate today, that by passing the Bill, while reducing the overall interest payments and the overall amount in terms of interest, we are agreeing to absolutely no more negotiation in terms of any kind of write-down.  Is it the case, as they said in the other House, that Ireland intends to pay every last cent of the €28 billion?</p><p>I have thought a lot about this in the last hour as we were waiting to start the debate.  I have several questions in trying to decide to say &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; to the Bill.  On the one hand, are we jeopardising the future of our children and youth with too much debt for at least a generation by locking ourselves into not obtaining a write-down?  On the other hand, would we be jeopardising the present of our children and youth by doing something that lost the confidence of Europe and the international markets, causing our recovery to recede?  I will listen carefully to the Minister's response.  I want to support the Bill and I know some of my questions are shared by my Independent colleagues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-06a.329" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1117" speakername="John Gilroy" time="18:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013020600058#HHH00200"><p>I welcome the Minister and welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  It was noted by some speakers that the making of legislation late at night often leads to poor legislation and poor outcomes.  Of course, we forget it is not the hour on the clock that leads to the bad legislation; it is the decisions and the assumptions that underpin the necessity for such legislation in the first place that lead to poor outcomes.  We could spend the entire night discussing and speculating on what might happen in Frankfurt tomorrow but this would not be helpful.  It is probably best to constrain ourselves to discussing what is in the Bill before us.  It is vital legislation which is a necessary first step in a sequence that will see a satisfactory outcome, we hope, to the promissory note issue.</p><p>It has been said throughout the year and even for the past two years that a deal of any nature was not achievable and could not be done.  It sometimes seemed to me that some of the commentators were privately hoping we could not achieve a deal and that no deal was available or achievable.  It is disappointing to hear the language in which the debate is being framed tonight.  I heard one Deputy say in the other House that this was a day of humiliation for the country.  I cannot see how somebody could say that.  This has to be a good day for the country when we consider that two years ago we thought we were on the verge of ruin and bankruptcy and there was no way out.  There is a very clear pathway out of our difficulty with the deal that has been achieved today.  On Private Members' time earlier, the same Deputy had called for a unilateral non-payment of the promissory notes, knowing full well that is not achievable - it is not even legal.  His colleague, who supported that Private Members' motion, later stated in the same breath that what was possible in Private Members' time using one argument was impossible in the following debate using the same argument.  The level of confusion, to be charitable, in some of the commentary surrounding this deal is alarming.</p><p>Unfortunately, I fear the Opposition will try - I believe it has already tried - to frame a negative outcome in the way this will be reported and commented on tomorrow, which is unfortunate.  This is despite the fact that we do not have information available to us as to the outcome of the Minister's negotiations with Frankfurt tomorrow, although I suppose facts are sometimes irrelevant when it comes to scoring political points.  We know the Opposition has a job to do and we respect and acknowledge that.  I am particularly glad to see that Fianna Fáil has in this House and the other House taken a particularly responsible role in holding this Government to account.</p></speech>

The liquidation of a non-financial corporate institution could take place at any time under normal circumstances, but when €12 billion of taxpayers' money is at risk, we must move carefully to put in place structures to protect the people's asset - the State's asset.  The window between the close of business today and the opening of business tomorrow - perhaps it is now the opening of business today - has allowed us the opportunity to do this with the minimum of risk to the taxpayer and to the people.  As the Minister said, when information came into the public domain, the Government moved swiftly to secure the assets, which were national and international, because otherwise these assets could have been vulnerable.</p><p>This is no ordinary liquidation.  IBRC's banking licence will now expire, a point I will address shortly and to which the Minister might respond.  Managing risk is a necessity and the decision to secure the public asset was taken in the public interest.  We look forward in the coming days to the time when the second necessary step to find a satisfactory solution to the issue will become visible.  We are confident the resolution the Minister is negotiating will be widely and warmly welcomed by the Irish people.</p><p>I would like the Minister comment on several issues.  IBRC's consolidated balance sheet in its 2011 annual report contains an entry on the liabilities side entitled &quot;Debt securities in issue&quot;.  To assist the Minister's officials, that is on page 34 and it is accompanied by note 39 on page 93.  The value of these debt securities in issue is €5.3 billion, all but €900 million of which has already matured.  Are we to take it that this €900 million, which is not going to mature until 2015, might be the subject of burden sharing with the private sector?  On the liabilities side, does the Minister see any liabilities that we might be able to share with the private sector here to gain further advantage to the taxpayer?  There are other elements in the balance sheet which it is possible to liquidate.  I will not talk about section 17 at this point; I will wait until the next Stage.</p><p>What becomes of the banking licence on foot of this liquidation?  Does the existence of the banking licence have any bearing on the necessity to bring the legislation here?  In other words, is the banking licence in any way an impediment to the ECB's doing business with the IBRC, or is it just a technical matter?  In addition, what is the status of the Minister, or how does the Minister rank, among the unsecured creditors?</p><p>I am reassured by the Minister's comments in regard to the staff of the IBRC who will find themselves out of employment tomorrow.  I am glad the Minister has said that many or most of them will, he understands, find employment where their undoubted experience, expertise and loyalty will be utilised by NAMA.</p><p>I welcome the legislation and I acknowledge the work of the Minister's staff in producing substantial legislation in the timeframe achieved.  I will, of course, be supporting the legislation.</p></speech>

It is scant regard for democracy.  We have tried in this House to read every Bill thoroughly and table amendments, and several Ministers have complimented us on that.  That is the kind of Chamber the Seanad is.  It really is not good enough to bring in 59 pages of a Bill with notice of an hour or so.</p><p>I suspect our European masters are making the Minister do this, which is a shame.  We should not be abolishing the IBRC tonight; we should be abolishing the ECB.  It has been a disaster.  There is mass unemployment through Spain, Greece, Italy and Portugal.  When does the ECB stop?  It keeps conducting the experiment and the laboratory blows up.  That should be one of the stances that Ireland should take during the Presidency.  This currency has really been a shambles.  It has spread debt and unemployment throughout the continent and it is about time some of those people looked in the mirror and see what they have done.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-06a.336" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="18:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013020600059#JJJ00600"><p>I worry about so many places in the Bill.  The preamble states that, &quot;Whereas in the achievement of the winding up of IBRC the common good may require permanent or temporary interference with the rights, including property rights, of persons&quot;.  That theme goes right through it.  I would ask whether we are worried about losing the Hall case in the Supreme Court.  Why has the EU made us bring this legislation through this evening?  What is the reason for this disregard for democracy and what is the reason for the disregard for the courts that features in many places in the Bill?</p><p>  The explanatory memorandum says of section 11, that Part 7 of the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011, which makes provision for the liquidation of authorised credit institutions, shall not apply to the winding up of the IBRC.  One has to ask the reason for the exemption.  Earlier, it says of section 9 that a special liquidator shall comply with instructions or directions so received from the Minister and shall not be liable for anything done in accordance with such instructions or directions.  What is the reason for these exceptions?  There are two on one page.  It says of section 7 that people operating under the Act may exchange information in respect of persons believed to be depositors of the IBRC notwithstanding any legal or contractual restrictions that otherwise prevent them from doing so.  All of these things should be discussed, including the way rights are set aside repeatedly.  When one comes to the very last section, it says that it is important to bear in mind that the provisions are not amended.  They will continue to operate in their current form for other liquidations but their operation is modified for the purpose of their application to the liquidation of a body under this Act.  That is done repeatedly in the Schedule.  We need to debate these things in this House.  Why are there extra powers for NAMA and the Minister?  Why are rights, as the preamble said, set aside in this almost cavalier manner?  Why is there no opportunity to have a proper debate and discussion here?</p><p>  On page 19 of the Bill, it is stated: &quot;No cause of action of any kind shall lie against a special liquidator in respect of anything done or not done in compliance with instructions issued or any direction given under this Act.&quot;  Further on in the Bill, it is stated: &quot;Part 7 of the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011 shall not apply to the winding up of IBRC.&quot;  There are things we should be discussing here.  On page 25, it is stated that enforceability may not be challenged by any person.  Section 12(3)(<i>c</i>) states one cannot challenge it on the grounds that, in respect of the IBRC, it was <i>ultra vires</i>.  <i>Ultra vires</i> means beyond one's power and authority.  Is it not draconian to say that one cannot challenge the law because it was beyond the authority and was <i>ultra vires</i>?  According to my reading of that section on page 26, that is what the Minister seeks.  Why are we seeking to set that aside? </p><p>  The ministerial directions include credit facilities under the Minister's power of direction.  There does not seem to be any control by the Oireachtas over that.  The Bill states that NAMA shall have the power to employ the staff at the IBRC.  The problem is deeper than the IBRC; it is at the ECB itself at this stage.  The power of the Minister to create and issue securities, as laid out on page 34, has no reference to the Oireachtas.  Will we have these midnight and early morning sessions repeatedly?  There is an amazing set in the Schedule where it states on page 53 that &quot;submitted to the Minister for Finance&quot; is to be substituted for &quot;filed in the court&quot; and that all other references to &quot;the court&quot; are replaced by references to &quot;the Minister for Finance&quot;.  Why are the Minister's officials advising him to bypass the courts?  The substitution of the Minister for the court appears repeatedly in pages and is most worrying.  It is also stated in the Schedule that &quot;, with the sanction of the court or of the committee of inspection&quot; is deleted.  The Bill amends section 238 of the Companies Act 1963 by substituting &quot;special liquidator appointed under section 7 [of the Bill]&quot; for &quot;court&quot; in each place.  That occurs repeatedly on page 55.  On page 56, it states that the special liquidator may apply to the court to exercise all or any of the powers which the court might exercise if the IBRC were being wound up by the court.  I am really concerned.  There are so many sections which give the Minister extra power where laws are set aside, as the preamble says.  We needed far more time to discuss this.  I wish the Minister every success tomorrow but this is a bad night to be putting through this kind of legislation.</p></speech>

The nub of this matter is the provision of a satisfactory resolution or solution for this State of the promissory note issue.  On that question, the necessary first step was the liquidation of the IBRC by NAMA bonds.  In effect, the IBRC is being subsumed into NAMA.  The Minister identified the risk straight away because of the leaks.  I will not say his hand was forced but he moved swiftly to provide the necessary protection and put KPMG in place.  I salute what he has done and I think it was a proper provision and defence mechanism for the State.  These remaining assets are effectively going from one asset management agency to another in the best interests of the State.  This was a necessary action that was totally in the national interest.  It would have been catastrophic if we had acted otherwise considering what has happened in recent days and today in particular.  In view of the sensitivity of the matter, we all accept that the detail will follow tomorrow when the ECB, hopefully, signs off on necessary arrangements that the Minister, his team and the Governor of the Central Bank have negotiated at this meeting in Frankfurt, which has been referred to.</p><p>This legislation is the most significant and momentous decision in the financial history of this State since the night of the bank guarantee, which we will not revisit.  This is a problem which this Government inherited from its predecessor in office because of the commitments given.  The sovereign cannot renege on what was done.  There is no question of that.  This country will protect its own interests, sovereignty and good name.  This has been done and protected by this Minister.  Tomorrow, we will know the longer-term arrangements.</p> <p>The negotiations will be overseen by the Minister and I hope, please God, that the outcome to them will be signed off on.  There has been speculation with regard to longer-term bonds - with durations of perhaps 30 or 40 years - being issued at or near ECB rates.  If it is possible for him to do so - I accept that there might be sensitivities involved - perhaps the Minister might deal with this matter.  We would appreciate it if he could outline the position on terms and rates.</p><p>Ireland has returned to the markets and we have seen what the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, has been able to achieve already.  There are tangible signs of confidence returning, which is extremely important.  I am disappointed by some of the negativity which has been apparent during this debate.  I am of the view that such negativity is not helpful.  The Minister referred to the protections available in respect of the staff of the IBRC.  Please God, many or most of them will be rehired by the special liquidators and will continue to work in the best interests of securing the assets and selling them on.</p><p>The issues with which we are dealing are very sensitive and complex and they exist on a huge scale.  They have provided both the backdrop to and the necessity for the measure before the House.  The Minister indicated that he would have preferred to have introduced the Bill in tandem with a finalised agreement with the ECB.  The latter was not possible for reasons we do not know and that we do not need to know.  We are aware that the Minister's intentions are tremendous.  We are also aware that a good deal has been negotiated and we are waiting for this to be signed off on.  Tomorrow, the ECB will continue to consider the proposals made by the Government and hopefully a satisfactory resolution will be achieved in that regard.  I appreciate that the Minister may not be in a position to provide the House with further information during this debate but perhaps he will be able to do so either later today or on Friday.</p></speech>

In the first instance, people will be disappointed with what appears to be transpiring in the context of the country's debt.  In June, we were informed that sovereign debt would be separated from bank debt.  However, the legislation indicates that this will no longer be the case.  That is a concern because the ECB is going to get what it wants but we will not get what we want.</p></speech>

In fact, that is a much larger issue which is connected to the dithering taking place in Europe.  There is a policy of appeasement at present in respect of certain superpowers within the European landscape and where they stand politically and this is based on considerations such as the outcome of regional elections in Germany, elections in France or whether a particular development will please a particular coalition partner in a certain government.  What we do in this country does not matter.  We must build alliances with other small member states and force Europe to realise that, unfortunately, the ECB mission will not and cannot work any longer.  Ireland's economy constitutes less than 1% of the overall economy of the eurozone and it does not matter whether inflation here is 50% or minus 50% because the ECB does not care and interest rates across the EU will remain the same.  History will continue to repeat itself until the adjustment to which I refer is made.</p><p>As the prospect of Spain going over the cliff draws closer - which could involved the loss of many hundreds of billions of euro rests - those in Europe may finally be obliged to realise that there is going to be a need to consider debt write-downs and debt forgiveness.  That is a fact.  As sure as I am standing here, that to which I refer is going to happen.  Despite the best efforts of the Minister and his predecessor, the late Brian Lenihan Jr., in forcing the Irish people to accept so much austerity, the reality is there is not going to be a bounce as a result of what is taking place.  In the recessions of the 1980s, etc., global growth continued to take place and there were other tools at the disposal of Irish Governments in order that they might offset some of the pain.  Those tools no longer exist nor will they come back into existence for several years unless Europe begins to get its act together.</p><p>I am hugely uncomfortable with the prospect of voting in favour of the legislation but I will do so.  We have no choice but to accept the Minister's word that-----</p></speech>

That is why I will be supporting the legislation, which contains a number of draconian measures.  The enabling Act comes to mind when I contemplate the kind of powers that are going to endow the Minister with plenipotentiary control and that will ensure he will not be obliged to come near the Oireachtas to seek approval for setting prices, if he so wishes, in the context of asset transfers.</p><p>I am concerned by the fact that the enforceability of what is proposed in the Bill may not be challenged.  There is no doubt that if our proceedings stretched beyond 8 a.m. the queue of those wishing to challenge the constitutionality of the legislation in the context of property rights would run from here to the Four Courts.  I have no doubt that the Minister has been forced into this.  I do not doubt his bona fides in trying to obtain the best deal for Ireland.  We will always support him in that regard because - as is the case across Europe in general - this country's level of debt is unsustainable.  That is a fact and one can chalk it down.  It might be 50 years before anyone will admit this but it is a fact.</p><p>Spain may well have to go under before those in Europe will admit the need to restructure the way in which we consider matters of this nature.  They will have to accept that we should be looking to the European economy rather than to European inflation.  They will also be obliged to accept that the reason for this is the EU has too many constituent parts, that the latter all have either higher or lower levels of inflation and that, unlike Ireland, they cannot just be cast adrift.  We have the benefit of hindsight and, in that context, it is obvious that none of us would have wanted to guarantee the banks in 2008.  However, the Minister, Regling and Watson and so many others have admitted that there was no other option.  This was because Europe told us to take a particular course of action.  I know the following because the late Brian Lenihan Jr. informed me that it was the case.  On the morning of 29 September 2008 Ireland was going to burn the bondholders but by that night France and Germany were not prepared to put up with this.  I know that to be a fact.  We are where we are and we are trying to deal with this matter as best we can.  On the night of 29 September 2008, the Irish people saved the euro.  By God, they require some level of help as a result of what they did.  There are so many people in Europe who are now up the creek but we are too small to matter.</p></speech>

If we consider what happened during the term of office of his predecessor, the late Brian Lenihan Jr., the period prior to the 2008 bank guarantee and the arrival of the IMF and what is taking place this week, there is no doubt that the Minister never intended to come before the House in the middle of the night in order to have this legislation passed.  What is happening now must be plan B and it is a result of what, in my view, has happened consistently at critical times during Ireland's financial crisis, namely, a leak.  Who leaked the information regarding the proposed liquidation of IBRC and who stands to benefit from that leak?  Who at that highest level within the ECB has access to information which can be used to bury this country?</p></speech>

We are very much aware that any movement in that crisis brings all of us Irish people closer to a recovery that we all want and in which we all believe.  This should not be a party political issue.

I refer to Senator Barrett's most eloquent defence of our democracy and the most eloquent defence of the Seanad's proceedings.  I share his disquiet about what I term the undignified haste of this legislation.  I am not condemning this important legislation.  However, we have had to convene at great haste.  Even my own inarticulacy at 4.30 a.m. is a part of that problem.  Senator Hayden also eloquently described the issue.  We understand the issues involved but we have to come to terms with the haste and we have to try to complete the equation.  My criticisms are not intended to be negative of Senator Coghlan's views but rather it is a genuine reflection on what is occurring in the Oireachtas.  This is not the first time.  We know the way we were treated during the passage of the Social Welfare Bill before Christmas.  There is a disquieting habit creeping into this House.  This is no reflection on the Minister.</p><p>I am personally delighted that the IBRC will be terminated, liquidated, got rid of.  That is a good news story and I am proud to be connected with it.  Mar a deirtear as Gaeilge &quot;Téigh go tigh an diabhail acu&quot;, agus buíochas le Dia nach bhfeicfidh muid arís go deo iad.</p><p>However, I am trying to make sense of the Minister's challenge.  In my view we are in limbo.  The Minister is asking us to take a punt on his ability to deliver.  I do not underestimate his negotiating skills but we are taking a punt on the Government delivering on the promissory notes tomorrow.  That is the challenge as to how I will vote.  I am trying to reflect on my challenge in this vote.  I think Senator Coghlan agrees with me inadvertently again.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for his work in dealing with a very difficult area.  I have worked in the legal profession.  The difference between us and economists is that there are times when immediate decisions are required rather than allowing other people to dictate how we should manage our affairs.  This is one decision which we have to take here and now.  I refer to section 3(<i>b</i>) of the Bill which provides for the winding up of the IBRC in an orderly and efficient manner in the public interest.  The Minister and the Government are working in the public interest in bringing forward this legislation.</p><p>  I hope the Minister does not mind me raising one issue.  I refer to section 14 of the Bill and the appointment of valuers.  I have a concern about this provision.  The person appointed will be responsible to the special liquidator but the Bill does not state that the person is answerable to the Minister.  It is a case of transparency in the valuation of properties.</p> <p>We are talking about substantial properties and assets in this case.  Perhaps the Minister would deal with the transparency we must have on this issue, because there is public concern that there is a lack of transparency on some issues and about some of the decisions that have been taken, for example, with regard to NAMA.  While I am not questioning any of the decisions, there is a need for further clarification.  That is just one aspect of the Bill.  There are other aspects I would like to discuss but I do not have the time.  However, I ask the Minister to provide clarification on that to ensure there is full accountability to the Minister and the Government and accountability on the part of the Government to the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

Our timing might be a little askew but we are obliged to be here.  None of us would sign a deal without knowing the facts, but we are doing this tonight because we are trusting the Minister's judgment and infinite wisdom about what he cannot share with us tonight.  That is some responsibility for the Minister to us and to the Irish people.</p><p>The Minister was handed a poisoned chalice from the outset.  Of course a write down would have been preferable, but was it ever realistic?  In a way, this is a Collins-de Valera moment again.  Tomorrow we will try to secure a deal in which, as Senator Hayden said, we must accept that half a loaf is better than no bread.  That might be a put down, but I do not believe it is.  It is for today.  To refer to what Senator MacSharry said, it does not mean we will not be renegotiating again, but we must always get the best deal at every juncture.</p><p>There was a meeting of ordinary citizens in Oranmore last Monday night.  They told me was that we should not pay the promissory note in March but restructure it and spread it out over a long period.  Their reason was that the current unsustainable debt was too much for any generation to endure.  Is that not what the Minister is doing here tonight?  Can the Minister give the House an estimate of how much this deal will save the Irish people?  If our current debt to GDP ratio is 120%, what are we bringing it back down to?  I acknowledge the time we are saving, which is what the Irish people need now.  We need time to breathe, to get back on our feet and to get a bounce.</p><p>As the Minister knows, David Hall and New Beginnings is bringing a case to the Supreme Court at 10.15 in the morning regarding the promissory note.  Will the promissory note still exist, technically, by then?  Finally, will the Minister address the serious issue of property rights being set aside in this Bill?  It is the second highest right and I echo some of the concerns expressed by Senator Barrett.  I wish the Minister well.  He is flying the flag for our country in Europe.</p></speech>

Otherwise, we will have some difficulty getting through the next hour or so.</p><p>There have been frequent references to how inadvisable it is to have people making critical decisions in the middle of the night.  For the record, our junior doctors are one group of people in this country who make critical decisions in the middle of the night.

In general, the opinions will point in roughly the same direction.  There will be nuanced differences.  The extraordinary thing about the world in which I have been living for the last year and a half and in dealing with economists, planners and so forth is the unbelievably, widely divergent opinions one hears.  The medical equivalent of the different economics opinions we get would be somewhat similar to one doctor telling a patient they should have an operation and another doctor saying that they should become an opera singer.  It is extraordinary how unbelievably diverse the opinions are.</p><p>  In the middle of all this I, as an amateur, found out today that I must take part in this critical debate and cast a vote on the liquidation of the IBRC.  The reality is it will make no difference because we all know how the votes will go tonight.  We are being told there is a need to make the deal tonight or something very bad will happen tomorrow.  That something very bad will somehow involve the potential loss to the State of assets worth up to &#8364;14 billion.  As a result, we are rushing this and not considering it.  We are giving the Minister increased powers in the middle of the night and taking away powers from the courts.  We are doing a raft of things which are really only appropriately done in an emergency.  In fact, in seeking a precedent for this in history, I found only one.  It was what Abraham Lincoln had to do in 1861-2 when states started to secede.  He basically suspended chunks of the US constitution in the middle of the night, more or less, to save the republic.  Is that the level of emergency we are facing tomorrow?  This is what troubles me and the Minister must clarify it.</p><p>  The issue, as I understand it, is that we have been told over the past six years that the former Anglo Irish Bank, now the IBRC, is basically a failed, zombie bank which is on life support and has no money or assets.  Suddenly, it is some type of critical national assets reserve of &#8364;14 billion, all of which we might lose tomorrow if we do not make these decisions tonight.  I am very troubled by this.  I can understand how, on paper, there might be assets in the IBRC which are worth &#8364;14 billion.  I presume most of them are apartment blocks or houses.  It is not a bunch of threepenny pieces in a bank account, whereby people can form queues tomorrow and take them out of the bank.  I do not believe the assets are that movable or liquid, necessitating this level of emergency.</p><p>  Furthermore, there is a big elephant in the room.  It is interesting to hear the speeches tonight referring to the deal.  There is no mention of a deal in the Bill or in the Minister's speech.  We are discussing a Bill which will enable the Minister to liquidate the IBRC.  The elephant in the room is that there is clearly some type of <i>quid pro quo</i> involved.  There is a worst case scenario if we do not pass this Bill, and it might not just be the mythical &#8364;14 billion.  It might also be that we could undo our deal.  Again, I am troubled by this.  I believe that the potential losses tomorrow are a great deal less than &#8364;14 billion.  I do not know enough about this but the arguments advanced in the Dáil tonight from Deputy Stephen Donnelly and others were that there is a real worst case scenario in the long term as a result of passing the Bill and that there is a down side to changing the nature of our debt to something which becomes non-negotiable and intrinsically sovereignised.  We are being asked to play a game of chicken tonight.  There might well be some level of loss tomorrow so in return we are taking some, as yet unquantifiable, risk of a major loss or, perhaps, a benefit at some stage in the future.</p><p>  With respect, I do not believe the case has been made sufficiently strongly to me that we must rush this through as an emergency tonight.  Consider the quality of the thoughtful analysis that Senator Barrett was able to do in a few hours today.  He is sitting on my left and he is one more PhD economist than was available in the entire Department of Finance when it made the biggest mis-decision in the history of the State.  I do not know how many PhD economists were in that Department today and yesterday addressing the questions at issue or analysing them as thoughtfully as my colleague has.  After much thought and soul searching, I will oppose this Bill.</p></speech>

This Bill is crucial to the future of my children and future grandchildren.  I regard the Minister's advice as important.  People go to hospital for operations but they do not have time to think about it or to get a second opinion when it is an emergency.  This is an emergency and we must deal with it.  The thought of not passing this Bill tonight must be considered.  The best way to explain it to the ordinary person is that if this deal goes through, as I understand it, there will be a 40 year bond.</p> <p>Some 40 years ago, the average house price was £4,000 or €5,000.  It was less in country areas.  The average industrial wage was £1,500, so house prices were three or four times the average industrial wage.  If I had been told in 1973 that I could buy a house and pay the £5,000 for it in 2013, 40 years later, I would have been a cute hoor to get the deal at that time.  People try to tell the public that this is a bad deal for future generations but it is a good deal for future generations.  I listened to my colleague from County Donegal, Deputy Pearse Doherty of Sinn Féin-----</p></speech>

Can the Minister give me an example of Bills that have been rammed through the Oireachtas at 4.30 a.m. without proper scrutiny and without amendment?  Can he give me an example of that?  No he cannot because it is not how we do business.  A number of Senators on Government benches talked about promissory notes.  Senator Michael D'Arcy referred to the promissory notes as money we knew we had to pay.  A Labour Senator said that a debt writedown would not be living in the real world.  What about the summit last June when the Minister, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, came back and proclaimed to the people of Ireland that they had a game changer, that we had the separation of banking debt from sovereign debt?</p></speech>

This is stand-alone legislation.  I do not know whether the European Central Bank will agree a deal on the promissory notes tomorrow.  The ECB will discuss it tomorrow and discussed it this evening.  The ECB may agree or may not and there may be no deal.  This is a stand-alone item of legislation which, on its merits and unconnected to any deal, is worth putting through.  What can be said in respect of any prospective deal is that, at an early stage of negotiation, the authorities in Ireland, the Central Bank of Ireland, the Government, the European Central Bank and the Commission were <i>ad idem</i> that an opening position on restructuring the promissory note would be the liquidation of IBRC and the assets being rolled into NAMA.  One can speculate about the motivations on either side but one strong motivation was that it did not seem logical to have two bad banks in Ireland effectively doing the same work.  When NAMA proved itself, and was seen to operate successfully, it is logical to check the second bad bank, which was not functioning as a commercial bank but simply winding up assets, and to put it into NAMA and let NAMA deal with the issue.  That is obviously something the ECB would have liked to have done and we would also liked to have it done.  The arrangements for Anglo Irish Bank and subsequently IBRC were made before the troika arrived in town and before the commercially trading pillar banks were put in place.  The crisis was over a long period and if it had all happened together, it would be like Spain with one bad bank.  That is the position that motivated us.</p> <p>What I am telling the House is that if I had a full agreement to announce tonight, I would also be introducing this legislation and giving Members the explanations I am giving.  It would have the same powers.</p><p>The reason the legislation was produced so quickly was that we knew for months that this would be the position if we were successful in negotiating a deal.  Therefore, this legislation has been prepared for months.  It was introduced this evening because market-sensitive information was released in a credible way.  I do not know who released it.  By 4 p.m., I was put in a position in which I could not deny that the Government was contemplating the liquidation of IBRC, thus putting everybody with a vested interest in a position to determine what they could take out of it tomorrow.</p><p>Senator Crown should note I am not saying that all €14 billion in assets would disappear, or anything like that, but I am sure that, in the absence of this legislation, there would be those with vested interests in the High Court, the courts in London and perhaps the courts in the United States tomorrow to stop us from acting.  That would not be in the interest of the Irish taxpayer.  Of course, the IBRC is a non-trading bank but it does have assets.  The assets are variously valued between €12 billion and €14 billion.  We hope those assets can be realised for the Irish taxpayer over the years.</p><p>Senator D'Arcy raised a point about the total valuations.  The total package concerning IBRC amounts to approximately €40 billion.  Approximately €12 billion of that – to use a low estimate – is supported by assets.  The idea that we are suddenly transferring debt to the State to pay the European Central Bank reflects the position.  The European Central Bank provided the money through the ELA system and the promissory note is the method in place to pay it back.  One can call it what one likes but it is a State debt or liability in the final analysis.  The reason we face a promissory note payment at the end of March is that the State is liable for the payments on the promissory note.  The promissory note is the arrangement put in place to refund the European Central Bank for the provision of the liquidity that kept the show on the road.</p><p>With regard to the question of the transfer, there may be some theoretical explanation, but the facts are the ones I have outlined.  At 4 p.m. this afternoon, it was quite clear to me that we were in a position in which the liquidation could not be denied.  I am not in the business of making false denials so we had to act to protect our position. </p><p>I do not know whether we are making provision against something that would not happen but I know, based on our experience over the past couple of years, that without making such provision, people with a vested interest in assets valued between €12 billion and €14 billion would be in the High Court before we got up in the morning.  There is a conflict between the interests of the Irish taxpayer and those of these people.  That is what we had to stop.  The first step I took was to act under the Anglo Irish Bank legislation, which allows the Minister to nominate a person to take over the powers of the board of IBRC.  I did that.</p><p>Knowing that what we are doing would be part of any deal that might be struck, we have had this legislation prepared for a long time.  We agreed with KPMG to nominate a particular person as liquidator, when necessary.  KPMG had all its arrangements in place.  I nominated as liquidator under the Anglo Irish Bank legislation the same person who will be nominated in the morning if the Bill goes through and is signed by the President.  KPMG had made its plans and had staff in London, New York and Dublin ready to go immediately, as required.  There were several scares in the past about information being released.  On a number of occasions, I nearly had to act because we believed there was a substantial leak about the fact that we would move towards liquidation, which we would not be in a position to deny because it has been in the conversation all the time.</p><p>That is the background and why we are here tonight.  I certainly would not take the responsibility of allowing this to run for several days.  It is not so much that somebody might raid the assets but that there is a risk that somebody would take legal action to prevent us from protecting the interests of the Irish taxpayer.  We would get into a legal situation in which the interest of the taxpayer would be down the priority list, as has often happened.  That is the reason.</p><p>There is no denying that this is emergency legislation.  Senator Barrett has carried out a very good analysis of what one might consider to be objectionable if one were debating normal legislation.  However, we are not debating normal legislation.  If Senator Barrett wants a justification for what we are doing, he should note the Long Title of the Bill on pages 3 and 4.  Did he ever see such a Bill Title before?  At the end, it states: &quot;AND WHEREAS IN THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE WINDING UP OF IBRC THE COMMON GOOD MAY REQUIRE PERMANENT OR TEMPORARY INTERFERENCE WITH THE RIGHTS, INCLUDING PROPERTY RIGHTS, OF PERSONS&quot;.  When the Bill is signed by the President tomorrow, half the lawyers in town will be scrutinising it to look for gaps to determine whether they can serve their clients.</p></speech>

That is why the language is couched in this fashion.  If the Senator wants an explanation of where we are coming from, he should just read the Long Title.  He will see that a Long Title always outlines the scope of a Bill and its position.</p><p>If this were normal legislation, I would be first to the agree with Senator Barrett's analysis, but it is not; it is emergency legislation introduced for the common good.  A very simple definition of the common good is &quot;That which is best for the ordinary taxpayer&quot;.  By God, the ordinary taxpayers have suffered enough.  We are putting their interest ahead of any special interests.  We are blocking avenues of attack against the interests of the Irish taxpayer by these measures, which people might consider to be draconian.</p><p>I do not know whether there will be a deal tomorrow.  It was discussed in detail in Frankfurt this evening and it will be discussed again tomorrow.  I do not know whether the negotiating parties will sign off on a deal.  It would be untrue to say there is not a proposal on the table and that I do not know its details.  However, I do not know whether the details will emerge tomorrow; all I can say is that if the deal is agreed, it will be a very good one for the Irish taxpayer.  It will be one that I will be recommending to the Houses of the Oireachtas, and the Houses may debate its merits.  However, there may not be a deal tomorrow.  Despite this, it was vital for me to introduce this legislation tonight in order to protect the assets of IBRC from attack.  That is basically the position.</p><p>There were a number of questions and I will try to deal with some of them.  The special liquidator will appoint independent valuers – this was Senator Colm Burke's point – to value the assets of IBRC.  The special liquidator is subject to the instructions and directions of the Minister.  Therefore, there is a political or democratic hold.</p><p>The reason is really that, when the assets are accorded a certain value, we want them to be transferred to NAMA at that value at the least.  They can be offered publicly also.  Perhaps somebody wants to buy a bundle of debt.  That is what is happening with deleveraging anyway.  If a third party makes an offer that is above the valuation price, we will sell to that party.  We are not in the business of holding but of winding down.  I do not believe there will be many offers.  What will happen is that there will be valuations that will have to be matched by NAMA in the transfer of assets thereto.  They will be placed in a special purpose vehicle and treated the same as other NAMA assets.  As their values are realised, the NAMA bonds which will have gone to the European Central Bank will be redeemed.</p> <p>Many Senators spoke about the nature of the deal.  I do not think there is any mystery about what we are looking for.  We are looking for a deal that has long maturities at low interest rates.  I think Senator Hayden made the point that we all know about mortgages.  If one had to pay the mortgage over five years, it would be a far greater burden than if one had to pay it over 30 years.  I bought my house I think in 1968 for something over £3,000 and 20 years later, the mortgage was well covered by one month's salary.  That is what happens when one can put the date out further because one gets growth in the economy and inflation and one can service it.  </p><p>The interest rate on promissory notes is very high.  First of all, it was pitched at approximately 6.5% but because the Government of the day decided to take a two year interest rate holiday, when we had to deal with the holiday down on top of the interest, the actual interest rate jumped to approximately 8%.  If one looks at market rates at the moment, five year money is just over 3% while nine or ten year money in Ireland is not much more than 4%.  Obviously, we will be negotiating for a much lower interest rate.  If one combines longer maturities with the very big rate differentials, one changes the whole situation and one can get a good deal for Ireland.  That is the basis on which the negotiations are proceeding but there is no deal or agreement.  We will report to Senators if we get an agreement.  </p><p>I am sorry I cannot deal with all the other points made.  Again, I would like to thank all the Senators.  I think I have, more or less, replied to the main points in general but I did not have time to individualise them.  I appreciate the comments from Senator Darragh O'Brien, from the Fianna Fáil benches and, indeed, from everybody here.  There were very supportive comments from my own colleagues in the Labour Party and Fine Gael.  We will keep Senators briefed but I am looking for this legislation to be passed this morning.  The President is coming back from Italy and if the Bill goes through, he will sign it at approximately 6 a.m.   Then I will sign a whole load of legal documents.  The man from KPMG will have a change in legal status.  It will be the same person but he will be the special liquidator.  I will issue quite a lot of instructions to him on how to proceed and I will place those instructions in the Oireachtas Library so that Senators have full information on the mandate under which he will operate.</p></speech>

The legislation and the sections that we are dealing with are essential and are in the national interest.  While the Bill could be classified as emergency legislation certainly it is not a knee-jerk reaction.  It is a calm and well thought out, well prepared and well considered piece of legislation which has become active due to circumstances.  Obviously the Minister, in consultation with his officials, had properly prepared for the circumstances and had a contingency plan in place.  To compare the legislation in any way to the 2008 bank guarantee late night decision is completely inappropriate.</p></speech>

Cé go raibh ísliú ar na fiacha príobháideacha sna bainc, ní raibh ísliú riamh, ná ní bheidh, ar na fiacha oifigiúil.  Níl sé ar intinn ag an ECB ísliú mar sin a chur ar fáil do thír ar bith san Eoraip.  Ní dhearnadar é sa Ghréig.  Ba ísliú sna fiacha príobháideacha a bhí i gceist sa Ghréig.</p><p>On the section, it states: &quot;The expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of this Act shall be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.&quot;  I do not believe anything could be more democratic as that is the way business is done.  Moneys voted by the Oireachtas for the purpose will be used to pay any expenses incurred by the Minister.</p><p>If the employees are re-employed by the liquidator or by NAMA - there are two possibilities - they will be employed under contract on new negotiated rates.  I have said that already, and I believe that answers the Deputy's question.</p><p>I thank Senator Conway.  When the Bill was being drafted I had no awareness that the gentleman he referred to was engaged in any form of legislation.  As I said to him, the drafting of this legislation was done months ago because we were preparing for this for quite some time.  It is worth saying, and I am sure Senators are well aware of it, that the Government cannot introduce legislation until it receives a stamped copy from the Attorney General.  The stamped copy is a stamp to say that it is constitutional.  Saying that a Bill is unconstitutional is a challenge to the Attorney General's opinion.  The Government is legally obliged to get a stamped copy, and not to proceed until it has a stamped copy, and I have a stamped copy in my possession for several months.</p></speech>

The Minister has just mentioned that the Attorney General has stamped a copy of the legislation but in terms of precedent, the 1947 case Buckley <i>v.</i> Attorney General related to a disputed set of funds from the early 1920s.  I ask the Minister to give some clarity on that in terms of separation of powers and putting a stay on pending cases.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-06a.468" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="20:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013020600067#RRR01100"><p>The best thing I can do is read the speaking note on the section.  With effect from the making of the special liquidation order there shall, subject to some exceptions, be an immediate stay on all proceedings against IBRC.  No further actions or proceedings can be issued against IBRC without the consent of the High Court and the Minister may discharge or remove any liquidator or examiner that has been appointed to IBRC prior to the date of the special liquidation order.</p><p>This section also provides that the special liquidation order shall constitute effective and proper notice to each employee of IBRC that his or her employment with IBRC is terminated with immediate effect.  However, the special liquidator is not prevented from engaging or re-engaging any person as an employee if the special liquidator considers such employment to be necessary or beneficial for the purposes of winding up IBRC.</p><p>The effects of the special liquidation order set out in this section are consistent with the effect of an order to wind up a company in the ordinary way under the Companies Act.  It should be noted that since the State is the owner of IBRC it will be open to the State to wind up IBRC without legislation.  The legislation provides a framework to achieve this in a controlled manner in order to enhance financial stability.</p><p>On the separation of powers, the Senator will note from the first couple of sentences in the briefing note that proceedings can be issued by the IBRC with the consent of the High Court and the Minister.  The fact that the High Court is included in the section seems to me to preserve the separation of powers in that respect.</p></speech>

He indicated on Second Stage that negotiations have been ongoing with KPMG, that when he would have to instigate this Bill he had a deal done etc. but what will be the cost to the State?  How much will KPMG get out of this deal?  How much will it cost the State eventually to pay KPMG to put this liquidation in place?  How much of the assets that are to be transferred will end up being paid off to KPMG in this scenario?  Could the Minister indicate to us the kind of deal that has been done?</p></speech>

In the circumstance that, on the Minister's own admission, this was a prepared situation, albeit abruptly done this evening as a result of the leak, and it was known this was to be done, was provision made to adequately look after those people who would not be employed by NAMA or by the liquidator to carry out these functions under new conditions and contracts?  Will there be some form of a scheme to look after those people who will not be re-employed along similar lines to those who have retired or opted for the schemes offered to former Anglo Irish Bank staff over the course of two rounds of redundancies in recent years?</p></speech>

First, was there much discussion with NAMA regarding this measure?  Second, in terms of customers of Anglo or IBRC who may be in negotiations about distressed mortgages, I presume that process will continue as normal and that this legislation will not affect negotiations that clients who may be in financial difficulty will have with this new entity.</p></speech>

I accept that when there is a transfer of assets to NAMA some staff may be re-employed by NAMA but in normal circumstances where a company takes over the workforce of an existing company, even in a liquidation situation, the transfer of undertakings applies for 12 months and their terms and conditions of employment are protected.  The Minister appears to be saying that will not apply in this situation and that new contracts will be offered but how does that sit with this State's employment rights law where workers should be protected in terms of what they call the TUPE, the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations?  I am mystified as to the reason the Minister cannot clarify that for the House.</p></speech>

The Minister has mentioned that once the legislation is passed, joint special liquidators will be appointed.  I am not being pedantic.  However, in his contribution in the other House he mentioned an employee of KPMG, but here he is talking about joint liquidators.  Perhaps he might clarify the issue.</p></speech>

Is it expected that some of these rates will be higher or lower, or will the Minister have any say in the matter?  Is it envisaged that there might be a saving to the State in this regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-06a.479" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="20:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013020600068#SSS00300"><p>First, on the overall cost of liquidation, the assets being liquidated are valued at somewhere between €12 billion and €14 billion.  Therefore, we are talking about a liquidation of assets worth €13 billion.  The cost I was given earlier - it was more of a guesstimate than an estimate - was €30 million to €35 million based on standard NAMA fees.  It is in that space, which does not appear to be excessive, given the quantum of assets with which it is dealing.</p><p>On the staff issue, there are a number of questions to be asked.  I have answered Senator David Cullinane on the issue.  The liquidator will be responsible for the staff as of tomorrow morning if the legislation goes through and it is signed by the President.  In his other capacity, the legal capacity he took over in the afternoon, there would have been some communication with staff.  I understand his point of contact is the human resources section of the IBRC which has a designated officer.  Obviously, it is very traumatic for staff because there was no expectation this would happen.  It was surprising for the board also.  One of our difficulties was that we could not bring this in confidence to the board of the IBRC because if we did, under company law, as soon as it had been notified, it would have incurred legal liabilities on which it would have had to act.  If the board did not act, it could have been guilty of criminal offences and its members would have been disqualified from ever serving as directors again.  Their liabilities would have been in conflict in introducing the legislation tonight.  Unfortunately, while there were many people in the loop of knowledge, the IBRC was not.  It was not possible to have contact about voluntary schemes of employment or anything like it.  I am not familiar with the detailed arrangements concerning staff in the IBRC because I was not in a position where I could have prudently inquired to obtain that kind of data without triggering questions such as, &quot;What do you need that for?&quot; and &quot;What is the situation?&quot;  It might have brought about a worse situation than what we were in.  It is the liquidator who will deal with the staff and it is my information from the liquidator that the intention is to offer jobs to the majority; that is how it was put to me.  I am not sure of the exact number of staff in Ireland.  There are about 930 to 940 altogether, some of whom are in the United States and London, but the bulk of them are in Ireland.  It must be remembered that there is a lot of movement in the financial services sector.  These are highly skilled workers; they are not people who will find it find it very difficult to get jobs because the financial services industry is thriving in Dublin.</p><p>The gentleman going in from KPMG was acting in his sole capacity today.  He will be jointed by a colleague tomorrow. </p></speech>
