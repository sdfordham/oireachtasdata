Genuinely, I concur with the Leader's remarks and wish all my colleagues in the House a very happy Christmas.  We have had a decent year.  We have not agreed on everything, or we have hardly agreed on anything, probably, but the debates that have happened through this House have, in the main, been respectful.  I respect everyone's views here.  We sometimes cross swords, and that is fine.  If I have offended anyone over the year - tough.</p><p>I would like to thank Deirdre, Jody, the Cathaoirleach, the Leader of the House, all the people who work with me and all the ushers and staff of the House for their assistance throughout the year.  I look forward to locking horns again early in the new year.  However, we are not finished yet and we have a very important day today.</p><p>I have one question in regard to the Finance (Local Property Tax) Bill 2012, which the Leader said is to conclude at 5.30 p.m.  I assume that is Committee Stage.  When is it proposed to take the Report and Final Stages?</p></speech>

We have a number of amendments on the property tax Bill, which, as I said on Second Stage yesterday, is an anti-Dublin and anti-urban Bill.  I have put on the record of the House my views and that of my party that we oppose this Bill.  Unfortunately, I will have to oppose the Order of Business on the basis that the Leader is bringing in a guillotine on that.</p><p>Finally, I remind Members that we go back into the Social Welfare Bill today.  It was in one respect good to see a lively, informed debate yesterday.  I would like to say that I respect everyone's views on this debate and, while I do not agree with them, I would not question anyone's bona fides in regard to their contributions.</p></speech>

It is a genuinely held belief.  We disagree with it completely.  They do not have to agree with our position but what I will not accept is Members in this House questioning why we would actually oppose this cut, and also stating, as a Member did yesterday, that we are using the carers and those people who need care for political purposes.  I reject that charge outright.  I respect what Members on the Government side say, although I do not always agree with it, but I never call into question why they raise those issues or why they have a certain stance.  I would take people at face value, although maybe I am naive to do so.</p><p>We will go back into section 5, on the respite care grant, today.  The Seanad yesterday showed, in my view, and hopefully showed people outside, that it has a real purpose.  There is a chance again today to send back to the Dáil a flawed Bill, particularly section 5 and particularly the 20% cut to the carers.  I would ask Members to have a think, on the last day before we break for Christmas, as to what type of Christmas present a 20% cut to the respite care grant will be to the carers.  We will debate that on the Social Welfare Bill.  Unfortunately, I will have to oppose the Order of Business on the basis the Leader is bringing in the guillotine on the family home tax Bill.</p></speech>

I will leave it at that, Senator O'Brien.</p></speech>

I particularly sought measures that had achieved, in the main, all-party support.  First, I want to mention the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Bill 2011.  I genuinely believe that measure will not only change the political landscape but will change the political landscape with regard to the participation of women in Irish politics.  I also want to mention the Personal Insolvency Bill.  I know the Opposition has questioned aspects of that Bill, as indeed have members of the Government, and sought changes, which in the main were listened to and ceded to.  I believe the personal insolvency legislation will be a leading measure in dealing with the level of personal debt and insolvency in this country in future years.  With regard to children, it is noteworthy that, in the main, all of the measures relating to children that have come before this House have received all-party support in the past 12 months.  In particular, there was general consensus around the children's referendum, legislation relating to vetting and legislation relating to the withholding of information.</p></speech>

While there are challenges facing this country and the Government, I believe this country goes into the Presidency of the European Union with a clear agenda, which is to deal with the bank debt and deal with unemployment.  The Government has made its position clear.  As the Leader of the Labour Party, the Tánaiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore said, "Tús maith, leath na hoibre" - our priorities are going to be stability, jobs and growth.  I look forward in the next six months to a very active Irish Presidency of the EU that I am confident before March will have secured for this country a deal on the banking debt.</p><p>Like the Leader, I would also like to thank colleagues.  Our exchanges have been robust but, in the main, professional.  I would like to thank some of the people the Leader forgot to mention.  First, I thank our own staff, the staff who support the Members of this House.  I would like to also mention the library staff, who provide an excellent resource.</p></speech>

I thank the Cathaoirleach and the Leader for their unfailing courtesy at all times.  There may be problems in other debating chambers near here but they do not occur in this Chamber, which is a tribute to them both.  I agree with everything Senator Hayden said about all of our staff.</p><p>It was a momentous year, with a Nobel prize winner addressing the House and the Orange Order being here.  Those are momentous events which have not yet made the impression they should have on the outside world.</p> <p>If we keep at it, the media will form a better view of what we do here.  The Seanad must convince the public, as it has convinced me, that it does useful work in terms of scrutiny, checks and balances on how the country is run.  The year 2011 is in the past.  There are lawyers, which is a conservative profession, involved in the New Beginnings group.  Let us hope that when this House returns in the new year we will have new beginnings and will finally stop fighting last year's election.  There are huge problems facing this country.  We must move forward.</p><p> One of the headlines on the front of today's edition of <i>The Irish Independent</i> is, &quot;TDs sneak through own budget with just 2.5pc cut&quot;.  In a debate about ten days ago with the Minister of State, Deputy White, we heard that the cost of running Leinster House had been reduced by more than &#8364;60 million.  I ask the Leader to draw the attention of the wider public to this.  Let us have debate informed by the facts.  We are doing a good job but can do better.  It is regrettable that the &#8364;60 million saving announced during that debate with the Minister of State, Deputy White, was not reported in the media.</p></speech>

We were concerned prior to this deal being done that quotas for Irish fishermen would be cut.  However, many of the fisheries quotas have been increased, including the prawn quota, which is up by 6%, and the mackerel quota.  This will be of particular interest to the people along the west coast with whom I have spoken over the past year on fisheries issues, in particular small fishermen.  I often compare small fishermen to small farmers.  They go out on the sea in difficult times.  It is a difficult life for them.  It is important that the quotas are maintained and that they are looked after.  It is important also that the issue of disregards be addressed, which I know the Minister is working on.  I believe it will be abolished at EU level during the next year.  This increase in quotas will result in more jobs in the fishing industry.  Some 20 jobs were recently created in Galway as a result of the quota increase for small fishermen.  It is a good news story for the fishing sector.</p></speech>

I hope I did not let him down all of the time.  I also wish the best of luck to the staff of the Seanad Office, Deirdre, Jody and Aisling, the Leader, Senator Cummins, my colleagues in this House and our very affable Government Whip, Senator Paul Coghlan, who for a number of reasons, had many home runs this year but was almost bowled over yesterday but stood steadfast.</p></speech>

I understand the position in which Labour Party Senators found themselves, although some were flying kites and drew attention to it in another way.  One Senator, for whom I have great respect, unfortunately decided to jump ship.  There has been much comment in the media about Deputy Keaveney's use of Latin phraseology and verbiage, etc.  In terms of what occurred here yesterday in relation the final vote and what will happen today, I would use the following Latin maxim, <i>res ipsa loquitur</i>, which means &quot;the thing speaks for itself&quot;.</p></speech>

It is important that when the Government is successful it is given credit and praised.  Our fishing industry is, unfortunately, in a delicate state.  It is ridiculous that the Minister has to go to Brussels to negotiate on these matters every year.  I have previously stated that such negotiations should only take place every two or three years.  The scientists and fishing organisations involved, including the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation and the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation also deserve credit for this deal.  These negotiations always take place in the run up to Christmas.  They take place over two or three days and require a great deal of energy and effort.  I believe it should be possible to strike deals which would be valid for two or three years.  The scientists are correct that the fish will not disappear.</p><p>It is important to remember those fishermen who lost their lives in Union Hall.  The fishing industry is often forgotten.  I opposed the introduction by former Minister, Noel Dempsey, of the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2005, to which 130 amendments were tabled.  Although I was not happy with some of the aspects of that Bill I did vote in support of them.  The paucity of Members on the Government side of the House when it came to rural issues at that time was notable.  It is important that fishermen, who do a difficult job and are often a forgotten society, are remembered in our prayers, in particular at Christmas.  In this regard I am speaking not of those who indulge in caviar or prawn cocktails.  We must support our fishermen.  </p><p>I ask that the Leader provide time for a debate on the fishing industry in the new year, in particular given the upcoming review of the Common Agricultural Policy.  It is critical we have a full debate on that matter prior to March, which debate I hope will be engaging.</p></speech>

If it is today, I will be glad to have spent the day in the Seanad with all of my colleagues.</p><p>Like others, I wish Members, staff, the Cathaoirleach, the Leader and Whips a very happy Christmas and thank the Leader of the Labour Party group, Senator Bacik, for her efforts and hard work this year.  Like other speakers, I would like to draw attention to some of the good done by the Seanad this year, including establishment of the Seanad Public Consultation Committee.  It is hoped that next year we will begin to make an impact through that process.  There is much comment about the lack of attention paid to the Seanad.  It is important we keep working and introducing new ideas and continually remind the media and others in the community that we are here and are working hard.  I believe that those who attended the public consultation committees here know that we are reaching out to particular communities.  We should continue to do so.</p><p>I thank the members of the media office who have assisted me in organising the Young Senators Competition which will take place soon, the winners of which - 60 young people - will be made Senators for a day and will attend in this House.  I look forward to it.  It is another innovation on the part of the Seanad.</p></speech>

I am sure the Minister, Deputy Coveney, having been up all night, is having a well earned rest today.  If not, he might manage to do so tomorrow.  While there are still other difficulties in the fisheries area, it is important to pay tribute to the Marine Institute of Ireland, which in the context of the debate on the reduction in the prawn quota for Ireland took photographs of the prawn stock which enabled it to prove the calculations in that regard were wrong.</p></speech>

We should pay tribute to the institute, which is not often mentioned in fishery debates, for its contribution.  The confirmation on all sides that there will be no loss of jobs in the fishing industry in Ireland is important.</p> <p>There will still be difficulties and Senator Denis O'Donovan is right to raise the point.  It is good, however, that at the end of this year these fraught negotiations have concluded well.</p><p>I pay tribute to the four young men who managed to make it onto the Forbes 30 Under 30 list.  I cannot believe Ireland, with a population of 4.1 million, has managed to have four people on a list of 30 drawn from the whole world, people who are able, willing and capable entrepreneurs in their areas.  They are Patrick and John Collison from Limerick, James Whelton who introduced Coder Dojo, of which many Senators will have heard, and Jonathan Cloonan.  Such an achievement augurs well for the future.  As we seek to build a better economy, it is to people such as these we should look.  We are very grateful for their efforts and look forward to more.</p></speech>

She saved their lives, which was heroic and for which I salute her.  The thanks of our group have been passed on and I join my colleague, Senator Sean D. Barrett, in that regard.  </p><p>I refer to the Social Welfare Bill.  It is very disappointing that sections of it were effectively talked out.  I hope we can have a disciplined debate.  This is very important, even though it is obviously unlikely we will win a vote.  On the other hand, we can do some of the work we are supposed to do.  We never reached section 13, for example, which deals with the clawback of overpayments, fraud and so on, but it makes no distinction between these categories, which is a serious technical flaw in the Bill.  That section was not reached in the Dáil before the debate on the Bill was guillotined.  If it is not reached in the Seanad either, the Oireachtas will have completely failed.  I ask, therefore, that we co-operate in order that we will reach those sections the other House failed to reach.  That sounds like a beer advertisement.</p><p>Has the Cathaoirleach had any success in getting a reading from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on motion No. 12?  If it would be possible to pass it in ten minutes or so today, that would be helpful.</p></speech>

The comments yesterday of the former Minister, Ray MacSharry, at a committee of the Houses was nothing short of shocking.  He stated that in Permanent TSB there would be no debt forgiveness after the three year period of bankruptcy.  This was an outrageous statement.  It is hard to understand how he could not understand the legislation, being a former Minister for Finance, but one must wonder if he does understand it and its intent.  I call on the Minister for Justice and Equality to come to the House in the new year to discuss this problem.  I do not know whether other institutions will buy into this thinking, as there is some disagreement.  However, we need to debate the issue in full.  If the legislation we have worked through in recent months needs to be further bolstered, this should be done at the earliest possible opportunity.</p></speech>

I say the same to the Leader, the Cathaoirleach, the Leas-Chathaoirleach, all those who sit in the Chair from time to time, the group leaders, the Whips and all other Senators for their contributions in the course of the year.  No doubt next year will be as tough as this one, but it will provide opportunities for us to make a real difference and have an impact, as I am sure we will.</p><p>I draw to the attention of the Leader something that came into the public domain yesterday, namely, the withdrawal of contracts for newly qualified nurses from the 2012 group.  A memo was issued to all directors of nursing stating anybody among the 2012 group of newly qualified nurses would have his or her contract withdrawn; essentially, he or she will be made unemployed and then re-employed in February at reduced rates.  The unions involved, including the IMNO, are scathing about this move because, once again, it is young nurses who are being targeted and will be affected.  Many of them have said they will leave the country because they will not be able to survive on these wage levels, given that they have gone through college, being trained and do a very difficult job which they are being asked to do on a salary of €22,000 when their colleagues who were employed in 2010 and 2011 will be on higher salaries.  In many debates comparisons are made with the position in the United Kingdom and other countries.  In the United Kingdom newly qualified nurses earn £27,000, or €33,146.  This is, therefore, a very real problem.  The INMO and other unions are organising a press conference today on the matter.  It is serious and one we need to examine.  Will the Leader say what exactly has happened in this regard?  Is this Government policy and what action will the Government take?</p></speech>

When I was listening to the radio on my way here this morning, I heard the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, being interviewed on "Today with Pat Kenny".  I concur with Senator Aideen Hayden who complimented the Minister on the personal insolvency legislation and noted what it would do for everybody who found himself or herself insolvent as a mortgage holder or a business person.  The Bill will be a great asset and I compliment the Minister on bringing it through the Houses.</p><p>The issue I wish to raise was raised also by Senator Catherine Noone, namely, the comments of Mr. MacSharry who attended the finance committee yesterday.  The Minister stated he was amazed and shocked by Mr. MacSharry's contribution to the effect that the banks would engage - whatever that may mean - and negotiate but in the spirit of the Bill as written, rather than by acting to write down mortgages.  Public interest directors are on the boards of banks to represent the public interest.  What are their duties?  Where are they written down?  They should be taken in and schooled if they do not know them.  Obviously, Mr. MacSharry does not know what the public interest means and is working in the interests of the bank.</p></speech>

Senator Catherine Noone mentioned Margaret Hayes.  All bank boards have public interest directors.  I want to know what their duties are, where they are written down and what we can do about it.  Most important, there should be an audit at the end of the year to find out if these directors are performing their duties in the public interest.  We must discuss this issue again in the Seanad.  There is no point in having public interest directors who are on a fine fat salary if we do not know what they are doing.  That is the question.</p></speech>

We all agree that he has been exemplary in his work.  I am being genuine when I say this.</p><p>I concur with the Leader, Senator Maurice Cummins, in sending best wishes to all of the staff.  I say the same to him and the leader of our Opposition group, Senator Darragh O'Brien, as well as to our secretaries, the Clerk of the Seanad, Ms Deirdre Lane, the assistant clerk, Ms Jody Blake, and Ms Aisling Hart, who all do excellent work.  The Cathaoirleach knows that when one is in the Chair as an Acting Chairman, they all give such good advice because of their knowledge and experience.  I, therefore, share the Leader's sentiments.  Please forgive me for going on, but I am one of the longest serving Members of the House.  I also extend good wishes to the stenographers and sound engineers who do a wonderful job.  In terms of its quality and excellence, the reporting is unbelievable.  Lacking details of locations and townlands, the reporters put everything into legible form.  To them I say, &quot;Well done.&quot;</p> <p>It is only when one is out of the Houses that one realises the value of the staff.  There was a period when I was not a Member but the staff still displayed a level of respect towards me that was exemplary.  People think that we are shown respect because we are Members.  However, the staff of the Houses show respect to everyone else, including former Members, visitors, schoolchildren, etc.  This is a great Parliament and we should be very proud of it.</p><p>In appointing 11 extremely competent Independent Senators, the Taoiseach has done the House a great service.  Those Senators, of their own volition, took a particular action yesterday.  I commend all of them for the decision they made.  People have to do their jobs and vote in a certain way.  In my view, what happened yesterday showed the strength of this House.  It also illustrated the fact that the Taoiseach had the strength of character to appoint 11 people without attaching any preconditions to their membership of the Seanad, such as stipulating that they should vote in favour of Government legislation or whatever.  Those to whom I refer have done themselves proud and I am sure they will vote with the Government when it suits them to do so.  One of the 11 Senators actually voted for the first time yesterday.  He had other serious national commitments but he still came in and voted.</p><p>Without embarrassing my colleagues in the Labour Party, I wish to state that Senator Heffernan is a very courageous young man.

I take this opportunity to thank him and all the wonderful staff of the House.  We are all united in complimenting all the members of staff with whom we interact.  We receive nothing but courtesy, co-operation and assistance from those at every level in the organisation.  We should be very proud of the staff who work here in Leinster House.</p><p>It has been a fantastic year for Seanad Éireann.  We have engaged in some wonderful debates and there have been some very interesting and, at times, robust exchanges.  The public consultation sessions were most informative, helpful and innovative.  The country made good progress during 2012.  We have steadied the ship of state and achieved modest growth in respect of both the economy and employment.  As previous speakers stated, we ended the year on a high note in the context of the negotiations relating to fishing quotas.  I compliment the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, in this regard and I echo the words of praise directed towards the Marine Institute, which has its headquarters in Galway and the CEO of which is Mr. Peter Heffernan.  The work done by the institute ensured that we obtained the very best possible outcome from the negotiations.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, was very gracious when he paid tribute to those at the institute this morning.</p><p>I am of the view that 2013 is going to be a wonderful year.  We will have an opportunity to build on the positive things that happened during 2012.  When Ireland assumes the Presidency of the EU, it will be operating on the international stage.  We will also have the opportunity to make significant economic progress in 2013.  I urge all colleagues to remain safe on the roads during the Christmas period.  In addition, all of us should keep an eye on vulnerable people during the holiday season.  We should also think of those who are less fortunate than ourselves.</p></speech>

Senator O'Keeffe referred to the meetings of the Seanad Public Consultation Committee, which were held in the Chamber, as one of the highlights of our work programme for the year.  Those meetings were indeed very effective.  I do not know what sort of permission would be required - perhaps it would have to come from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, CPP, or the Cathaoirleach - but in view of the fact that the Seanad has shown itself to be the ideal forum for public consultation, I request that the Joint Committee on Health and Children be advised that the very important public hearings due to be held on 8, 9 and 10 January, inclusive, in respect of the abortion issue should be held here.  There will be a massive amount of interest in those hearings, not just among members of the public but also among Oireachtas Members, and I believe they should take place in the Seanad Chamber rather than in the committee rooms.  As everyone is aware, a maximum of 15 to 20 Members can be present and contribute at meetings held in the committee rooms.  A significantly higher number of Deputies and Senators will wish to be involved in the hearings that are due to be held.</p></speech>

The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, said that a key part of the Government's plan for jobs and growth is to reduce costs for businesses to make it easier for them to start up, expand and create the jobs we badly need.  Yesterday's announcement is part of a range of actions being taken by Government to improve competitiveness and to reduce red tape, including a series of tax measures aimed specifically at SMEs. </p><p>Ba mhaith liomsa freisin Nollaig shona dhiabh go leir sa Teach seo, leis an Cathaoirleach agus gach duine.

There is one matter I did not have a chance to raise on the Order of Business although I alluded to it when the Minister for Health was present.  I would like the Leader to get formal clarification from the Minister for Health of the status of public patients in hospital who do not have medical cards.  To my shame I was unaware of the financial and social service support lacuna in which these patients find themselves with daily charges for inpatient care to a maximum of €750 per annum and for day-care procedures of €75 to a maximum of €750 per annum.  Many of us are under the illusion that patients have access to a completely free public health system if they elect to use it or they may take out private insurance if they so wish.  While the system is largely supported and while the fees charged are not the real cost of their care, it is not a free service if they are being charged €75.  Many of us were unaware of this because historically these charges have been unevenly applied, sought and pursued.  In addition, there was a relatively liberal regime.</p><p>Members of this House and of the Joint Committee on Health and Children are aware of multiple representations made by our citizens about the difficulty of getting medical cards or having them renewed.  It appears that the process has slowed down and it is hard to escape the conclusion that there is some policy involved and a greater level of scrutiny of these applications in view of the increased demand at a time of decreased resources.  Cancer patients used to more or less automatically receive a medical card, regardless of means.  This apparently is no longer the case.  I do not wish to confine this request to the patients with the condition that I treat.  I am sure it applies to patients with many other chronic illnesses.  Many patients coming for chemotherapy, for example, may come every week for four or six weeks in a row.  If that incurs a charge of €75 that represents a burden.  I believe that the administration of one hospital, to its credit, has decided to charge only once.  Others are not charging at all.  It was reported during the week that some centres are sending out debt collection agents and threatening dunning letters to patients in this situation.  At the same time they were giving patients the guarantee that they would not withdraw services.  I would like to reassure patients that there is no evidence that their services will be withdrawn.  Could the Leader please ask the Minister to clarify the following points.  How much money is recouped from this scheme?  How much is spent in engaging debt collection agencies?  Do we have any evidence anywhere that patients are writing to say that they are not following up on treatment?</p><p>I do not wish to show the Leader any disrespect but I cannot stay to hear his reply today because I must attend the Joint Committee on Health and Children but I would be grateful if he could pass these questions on to the Minister for Health.</p></speech>

We need the Minister to come to the House to answer our serious questions about the banks, NAMA and other matters.  If there are questions about the public interest directors they should be put to the Minister.  I appeal to the Leader to arrange for that debate early in the new year.</p></speech>

People appointed to serve and look after the public interest play an important role and should be there.  We may not agree with their decisions or how they arrive at them but they do serve a useful purpose.</p><p>In the past few weeks some people came to me who had a loan of €5,000 on which the bank took a write-down of €2,500.  Their circumstances have changed and they are in a good position to borrow to buy property.  It is appalling that because of that write-down the banks are treating them as unsuitable to borrow money.  That is disgraceful and outrageous.  These people want to borrow 40% of the value of the property and they have more than adequate security and income to support that.  If we are going to discuss the banking sector before we talk about those who are insolvent let us talk about those who are capable of carrying the loans.</p></speech>

I want due process as well.  I have spoken about the role of the public interest directors in the banks before and I believe the whole lot of them should be sacked.  We need to redefine the role of public interest directors and introduce legislation to ensure their main role and responsibility is to serve the interests of the public and the country, not the interests of the bank or its board of directors.  As we saw yesterday with the behaviour of the public interest director in Bank of Ireland, their role is at variance with the public interest.</p><p>Will the Leader inquire of the Minister for Justice and Equality as to when we will see the legal services Bill?

I would also like to wish you, a Chathaoirligh, our excellent Deirdre, Jody and all the staff of the Seanad Office, and colleagues a very happy Christmas and the best for 2013.  Hopefully, next year will be marked by robust debates.  There are many serious issues for us to discuss and there will be times we have to disagree.  Hopefully, we can disagree without being disagreeable.</p><p>One of the highlights for this year was the visit of the head of the Orange Order to the House.  It was a positive occasion for the Seanad but also a contribution to the ongoing process of reconciliation on this island.  It is sad that we need to keep a watchful eye on a continuous basis on issues in the North of Ireland.  Will the Leader organise a debate for early in the new year on the situation in the North?  There are many problems arising with flags, emblems, riots and so on.  It would be appropriate that we would continue to discuss these issues and make the contribution we can on this important issue.</p><p>I noted Senator Bradford's point about the possibility of health committee hearings taking place in this Chamber.  I believe we should be very open to that.  Even if matters are more rushed than they ought to be, it is important there is a display of openness.  It is much easier for people to attend hearings in a forum like the Seanad Chamber than in a committee room.  If there were any requests to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, CPP, for this, it would not be acceptable that this could not be dealt with because the committee will not meet until the end of January.</p><p>I want to raise another issue, an issue on which I have been somewhat remiss in not raising sooner with the CPP.  We are losing our way slightly to some of the rules and procedures of the House.  It is a matter we should address in the new year.  It is entirely proper that privilege would never be abused by the making of comments in this House-----</p></speech>

I pay tribute to the Leas-Chathaoirleach and all the Acting Chairmen for doing a wonderful job throughout the year.  I thank the Leader of the House, the Leader of the Opposition, the leaders of the groups and the Whips for a very good year.  I also thank the ushers for the great courtesy they show, the reporting staff who do a wonderful job, as has been outlined, the sound staff, who do a magnificent job, the media, including in particular Jimmy Walsh for reporting the House everyday and "Oireachtas Report", on which the Seanad gets a mention from week to week, and the library staff who provide great expertise and backup to Members.  I thank the Clerk of the Seanad, Deirdre Lane, and the Clerk Assistant, Jody Blake, my secretary, Aisling Hart, and Debbie Canning, Rachel Breen and Karen Warren.  I wish everyone a happy Christmas and a prosperous New year.</p></speech>

Senator Darragh O'Brien spoke about taking Committee and Remaining Stages of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Bill 2012 today.  We are dedicating as much, if not more, time to Committee and Remaining Stages of the Bill than was the case in the other House, although that is not the barometer I like to use to measure our business.  We will have ample time to discuss amendments.</p><p>  Senator Hayden outlined the many positive legislative measures that were debated in and passed by this House.  She rightly noted that bank debt and jobs remain the No. 1 priority for this Government and we hope to make significant progress in the coming year in both areas.</p><p>  Senator Barrett pointed out that the Houses of the Oireachtas legislation was debated at length in the Seanad.  I did not read today's <i>Irish Independent</i> but it is not correct to suggest that it sneaked through both Houses of the Oireachtas or that it only imposed a cut of 2.5% in the budget of the Oireachtas.  We were told by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform that the Bill provided for &#8364;60 million in savings compared with the previous Bill.  Journalists can write whatever headlines they want.  They seem to interpret matters their own way but I cannot do anything about what headlines they put in newspapers.</p><p>  Senators Comiskey, O'Donovan, Healy Eames and others spoke about the good news on fish quotas.  All of us would like to compliment the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, and the Marine Institute on their efforts.  This is the second year in a row that we have enjoyed a very positive outcome from the talks.  A debate on fisheries is overdue at this stage and we will arrange a debate early in the new term.  As Senator O'Donovan pointed out, it makes sense to make agreements that last two or three years rather than renegotiate them annually because fishermen would have greater certainty.  I am sure the Minister will take up that point during the debate.  </p><p>  Senator O'Keeffe spoke about the Seanad Public Consultation Committee.  I thank the Senator for the excellent work she has done on that committee.  She also reminded us about the young senators who will be coming here in the new year.  We look forward to that and I am sure Members will be keeping an eye on them because they may replace some of us in the future.  I also commend the four entrepreneurs on the excellent work they are doing.</p><p>  Senator Norris recalled the heroic teacher in Connecticut who saved her students from a tragic and dreadful end.  Our hearts go out to all the families affected by that tragedy.</p><p>  I am glad to hear from the Members opposite that they are prepared to begin their debate on the Social Welfare Bill 2012 at section 5.  It was ludicrous that we spent one hour debating the Title of the Bill on amendment No. 1.  </p></speech>

Senator Bacik asked a lot of questions about the Title yesterday.  The discussion was staged by the Labour Party to filibuster and waste time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-12-20a.182" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1130" speakername="Maurice Cummins" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012122000009#H00600"><p>I hope we can do our job in a professional manner.</p><p>In regard to motion No. 12, I assure Senators that the matter is before the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  We can discuss the motion in the first week of the new year.  Senator Noone and others spoke correctly about the need to monitor the Personal Insolvency Bill 2012 in order to plug any loopholes that may arise.  Senator Cullinane spoke about the new starting salaries for nurses.  I am not aware of the case that he mentioned but I understand the salary for young nurses starting this year will be €22,000.</p><p>Senator Keane and others referred to yesterday's meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform on the role of directors of banks.  It is clear there are differences of opinion in the House.  We have had a number of debates on banking issues and I am sure there will be many more opportunities to raise issues pertaining to the directors of banks with the Minister for Finance.</p><p>Senator Leyden spoke about the business of the House.  It was wonderful to see 60 Members in the House.  It was the first occasion in quite some time that we have had full attendance for a debate on a Bill.  </p> <p>It was unfortunate that we had another very important Bill to deal with about two hours afterwards and the House was noticeably emptier for that debate.</p><p>Senator Terry Leyden also raised the issue of the release of prisoners for Christmas.  As I stated yesterday, the same situation that obtained in previous years will obtain in that regard.  </p><p>Senator Michael Mullins looks forward positively to 2013 and wishes God's blessing on the Irish Presidency of the European Union in the first six months of the year.  We all look forward and wish the Government well in its endeavours in that regard.</p><p>Senator Paul Bradford asked about the public hearings with reference to the expert group.  As far as I know, no request has been received from the committee by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for the use of this Chamber.  I think that committee is meeting today and I am sure that if the issue arises, it will be given consideration.  However, there has been no request from the committee for the use of this Chamber.</p></speech>

These points can be made in a future debate on banking.  </p><p>Senator Terry Brennan outlined the position on the announcement made by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, yesterday on cutting the red tape with regard to licensing requirements and applications from small and medium-sized enterprises.  The reduction of bureaucracy to make life easier for small and medium-sized enterprises is welcome and of paramount importance.</p><p>Senator John Crown spoke about the status of public patients.  There has been a massive increase in the numbers of medical cards allocated in the past couple of years.  I did not get an opportunity to record the three questions the Senator asked me to put to the Minister for Health, but if he provides them for me, I will obtain answers for him.  </p><p>Senator John Gilroy also raised the matter of bank directors.  Senator Brian Ó Domhnaill raised the issue of amnesia and mentioned the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan.  I do not think I should comment further on that issue.  I commented on the suggestion of amnesia last night.</p><p>Senator Colm Burke complimented the Bills Office which he has kept very busy in preparing a Private Members' Bill that he has ready for introduction in the new year.  He also outlined the plight of those whose debts were written down by the banks and who could not get credit to buy a property.  </p><p>Senator Martin Conway said we needed to change legislation dealing with bank directors.  This is a matter that can be discussed in a debate on banking in the new year.  I will find out why the Legal Services Bill has not been brought before the House.  It is an important Bill and should be brought before the House early in the new term.  I will get back to the Senator on the matter and notify him when we expect to have the legislation before us.</p><p>Senator Rónán Mullen called for a debate on Northern Ireland which we can arrange in the new year.  </p><p>On the abuse of privilege, Senator Michael Mullins is a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and any proposal he has to make will certainly be considered by it.</p><p>I wish everybody a very happy Christmas and a peaceful new year.  I have responded to most of the issues raised.  Unfortunately, I cannot accept the amendment proposed to the Order of Business.</p></speech>

I listened to what the Minister and those on the Government benches had to say in respect of it.  We must remind ourselves of the matters on which we are voting in the context of the contents of the Bill.  The legislation provides for cuts to child benefit, which we will not have an opportunity to discuss because the amendments we have tabled in this regard have been ruled out of order.  The Bill also makes provision for a cut in the respite care grant.  We engaged in a fairly extensive debate on that matter on Committee Stage.  The Bill makes further provision in respect of cutting the entitlement period for jobseeker's benefit by three months.</p><p>  There are other provisions within this legislation which go beyond the scope of what one might define as social welfare.  I refer, in this regard, to changes to pension entitlements.  We discussed this issue on Committee Stage, at which point the Minister tried to misrepresent both my party's position in respect of it and also what I said.  The Bill also contains provisions in respect of a number of anomalies that were created when the relevant legislation was rushed through last year.  Furthermore, the Bill makes provision for changes to PRSI.  These will have a disproportionate impact on low-income families.  For all of these reasons, we want the name of the Bill to be changed.  We are of the view that it should be styled the Social Welfare, Pensions and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2012.</p><p>  I welcome the commitment the Minister made yesterday in respect of coming before the House early in the new year in order to discuss next year's social welfare Bill.</p></speech>

I have no doubt the Minister will return to us next year with legislation in which she will be seeking to take further moneys from social welfare recipients.  I want to take part in constructive and helpful discussions during which we might consider where savings can be made, not just in the area of social welfare but across the board.  We should seek to discover those other areas in which revenue might be raised.  It would be extremely worthwhile to have a debate on this matter.</p><p>I also welcome what the Minister said on Committee Stage with regard to ensuring that we invest in services and examining exactly how the money in the Department of Social Protection's Vote is spent.  In the context of how we support children, carers and people with disabilities, I am of the view that service provision is as important as the financial supports on offer.  I agree with a great deal of what the Minister said in this regard on Committee Stage.  If she comes before the House early in the new year and takes part in genuine discussions in respect of this matter, it would make things a great deal better for everyone involved because we could all do our job as legislators.</p><p>It is regrettable that almost all of the amendments tabled in respect of Report Stage have been ruled out of order.</p></speech>

That is regrettable, but it is a matter for the Cathaoirleach.  I accept that this is more of a procedural problem than anything else.</p><p>I strongly disagree with many of the provisions contained in the Bill.  However, I acknowledge the contributions made by Senators on all sides yesterday in seeking a more robust and genuine engagement early next year on how we can ensure that we protect the vulnerable in society, carers and those for whom they care and people with disabilities.  I am of the view that there will be a constructive engagement by Senators from all parties and none if the Minister keeps her promise to come before us early in the new year to discuss the matters to which I refer.</p></speech>

My party and I completely and utterly disagree with the ruling of the Chair in respect of amendment No. 3 and related amendments tabled by Independent Senators and Sinn Féin.</p> <p>I have been told that we cannot seek to delete the Government's proposal to cut €26 million from the respite care grant.  We are being told we cannot discuss it because it is a potential charge on the State.  That is not correct.  The State is proposing to make this saving but it has not come to pass.  It was voted on yesterday,.  It was supposed to come back on Report Stage.  It is not a potential charge on the State.  I fundamentally disagree with the ruling and I put the House on notice that my party and I will seek independent legal advice on the ruling on this amendment.</p><p>I do not wish to cast aspersions on an individual, but I completely and fundamentally disagree with the ruling because it is not a potential charge on the State.</p></speech>

I am afraid that it will be repeated today.  If we must vote on it, let us vote.  It is regrettable because there are serious problems technically with the Bill, in particular in regard to section 13.  I believe the claw back is highly dangerous.  There is no discrimination between people who have received over-payment and people who are responsible for fraud.  There is a possibility that people can be driven below the minimum wage, below poverty level as they will be able to take 15% from them.  I want to discuss the claw back of 15% of the payment, not some clap trap about the Title of the Bill, which is a waste of time.  We have an opportunity to do a little bit of good.  We have no possibility of doing anything else.  May I advise my colleagues in the Fianna Fáil Party - I hope they take legal advice on it - that I support them very strongly but they should take the strongest case, which I think is on amendment No. 4, which was ruled out of order.  Draft orders pursuant to subsection 4 should be debated by the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection prior to their finalisation.  I demanded yesterday to know the cost.</p></speech>

This is a device to frustrate the democratic operation of Seanad Éireann and it should be resisted and if possible by legal means.  I request them to include that and take the strongest amendment and do not choose a ruling on which one can be defeated.  Take a case where any nincompoop can see it is an insult to reason.

Tá an Bille seo ag bualadh clanna.  B'fhéidir gur cheart dúinn "Bille buille don chlann" a thabhairt air.  Tá an Bille seo ag gearradh siar ar dhaoine a bhraitheann ar sochar leanaí.

Ní chóir dúinn dallamullóg a chur ar dhaoine.

Ba chóir dúinn bheith cruinn faoi sin.  Is léir go bhfuil an Rialtas ag iarraidh an Bhille seo a bhrú tríd.  Tá sé soiléir nach bhfuil fonn ar an Rialtas páirt a ghlacadh in aon díospóireacht domhain ar na buncheistanna a ardaíonn an reachtaíocht seo.  Is léir go bhfuil cleasaíocht polaitiúla ar siúl ag an Rialtas.  Ba cheart go léireodh an Teideal atá ar an mBille na hábhair sin ar fad.  Is mór an náire é don Rialtas go bhfuil an méid seo á dhéanamh acu.  Is mór an náire é gur cuireadh gilitín orainn aréir nuair a bhíomar ag iarraidh dul tríd na ceisteanna éagsúla seo.  Is mór an náire é gur vótáil an dream eile an Bille seo tríd leis an Teideal seo air inné.

Tá áthas orm go mbeidh 10,000 suíomh breise ar fáil dóibh siúd atá ag iarraidh filleadh ar an gcóras oideachais nó an áit oibre.  That is a considerable achievement in the Bill.  Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh only sees the negatives, but there are many positives.  I have mentioned the 10,000 extra places we are providing.  We are also providing 6,000 extra after-school and child care places.  These issues were of some significance to Members on all sides of the House last year.</p><p>We are trying to take the positives out of this process.  I notice that a number of Senators spoke about the positives.  I repeat that I intend to publish the Mangan report which relates to proposals for significant and important changes to the child benefit system by the end of January.  That will present very difficult choices to Senators of all parties and none.  We will have to decide where the balance lies, taking account of the current state of the economy.  Some of these choices will relate to people on middle incomes.  I remind the House that from early next year anyone in the United Kingdom or the North of Ireland who earns over £60,000 will receive no child benefit.  It is going to be withdrawn entirely on the basis of the principle that it should be targeted.  We have to bear in mind, in social terms, that a generation of people in their 30s and 40s, many of whom have two or three children or more, are heavily indebted in relation to their mortgages.  Many of them regard the direct child benefit payment in cash as being of importance to them.</p><p>I hope I will be invited to return to discuss the Mangan report some time in February, after Senators have had an opportunity to examine it.  On that occasion, if we were to get an indication from parties and individuals of how agreement might be reached on certain difficult choices and the administrative implementation of these choices, it would be a breakthrough in the country's budget tradition.  If the Seanad were prepared to assist in the process of reaching agreement, it would represent a strong endorsement of the case for the retention of the Seanad and the type of debate that takes place in this House.</p><p>A Sinn Féin speaker made a comment about taking things off people.  I do not know how closely Senator David Cullinane looked at Sinn Féin's proposal to mandatorily increase the distribution from approved retirement funds without any lower limit, but I can tell him I had a good look at it.</p> <p> With regard to the many women on low and middle incomes in saving for pensions, I advise Senator David Cullinane that if he consults some actuaries, he will find that the current distribution regime which has been supported by all parties is deemed to be severe enough for many people.  Sinn Féin's proposal would increase the mandatory distribution rate by about 50%.  I know it did not receive much attention, but it would penalise highly those with very low pensions who may not be public servants and who may not have other sources of savings.  Sinn Féin's proposal does not provide for a free ride either.  When we are discussing the nuances of the positives and the negatives of the proposals of different parties, if we are entering a period of honesty, let us be honest about all the proposals made because they are not free.  If one asks an actuary to examine them, one will find that for people on low incomes, particularly women, about whom the Senator has spoken, his proposals deserve a great deal of careful consideration.</p></speech>

I understand, as Senator David Norris said, that the amendment is a vehicle to allow a wider discussion on the Bill.  Members will appreciate that I have nothing to do with the rulings, but technically and legally the advice of the Parliamentary Counsel is that there is no requirement to extend the Title of the Bill.  I accept that advice and that is all I can say on the matter.  </p><p>I remind Members that there will be a social welfare Bill in the spring in which pension issues will be addressed.  In the debate in the Dáil we had time to deal with these matters, even though we lost a good deal of time in the discussion, rather like what happened this morning when about an hour was lost in the debate in the Seanad.  I will bring forward proposals to deal with requests made by the various organisations which have an interest in defined benefit schemes.

I hold to the view that the Title of the Bill should be changed.  It is regrettable and outrageous that we have to use this provision to have a discussion on the Bill on Report stage, but that is where we have ended up because of the technicalities which may not be particularly relevant.  I hope that, as we progress the debate, the Minister will listen to what we have to say, which is something that should happen.  I did not mention taking money off people.  What I said, if the Minister had listened, was that I welcomed some of what she had to say yesterday and that I would take part productively in discussions on the overall social welfare spend of more than €20 billion which I agree is significant, how that money was spent, where we could achieve savings or find money elsewhere.</p></speech>

Many Senators made impassioned pleas to the Minister yesterday to do the right thing by carers and the people in receipt of this grant but also in respect of the child benefit cut, which will have profound implications for many working families and those families whose members are not working.</p> <p>As the Minister said previously, mná na hÉireann depend on child benefit as a core part of their incomes.  Any cut in child benefit - the Government has cut the allowance twice - has a profoundly negative effect on women, children and families.  The reduction of eligibility for jobseeker's benefit from 12 months to nine months is happening at a time when we are paying more through PRSI, the universal social charge and taxation, and entitlements are less.</p><p>I remind the Minister of the ESRI's commentary on the budget but, more specifically, on the social welfare provisions and their impact on low-income families.  There is no doubt that the PRSI changes and the changes to the allowance will have a disproportionate impact on low-income families, regardless of whether one earns €200,000 per year or €30,000 per year or less. </p><p>I disagree with the contents of the budget.  However, I welcome the Minister's statement that she will come back early in the new year to discuss the overall social welfare spend, how we can improve spending in this area and how we can ensure that people who need core services - whether they are carers, people with disabilities or others who depend on funding from the Department - get them and that we get value for money. </p></speech>

The Minister will be aware that the IMF's report, widely reported in today's media, was positive in respect of Ireland, and as a proud Irish man I welcome it.  We all want the Government to succeed in terms of regaining our place in the world economically and getting the people back to work.  One aspect of this has been a continuum with the IMF in that it seriously questions the austerity measures being introduced by the Government.</p><p>This side of the House has been criticised for the budgetary measures taken during our last couple of years in office, but I want to put that in context.  The IMF and all of the other independent commentators suggest that the budgetary measures introduced by the Fianna Fáil Administration, particularly in 2010, were fair, equitable and across the board.  The main criticism that has been levelled at this budget and specifically at the Minister's proposals is that they are not fair, equitable, or just and are targeting the most vulnerable.  That is the reason there is great disappointment.  I tried to explain that disappointment yesterday.  It is disappointing that the Minister, of all people, would support these cuts, considering her background, which she has mentioned repeatedly, and the fact that she is proud of the time she spent in a third world country.  I am sure the whole ethos and philosophy and culture she brings to the job is against what she has proposed.  I hope that in the new year the Government will reassess these proposals, particularly as they relate to the Department of Social Protection, that a stop will be put to cuts and that other areas will be considered.</p><p>There is no monopoly of wisdom in the Government, nor is there a monopoly of wisdom in the Opposition or on the part of political commentators.  However, in the round, there is within the country a wealth of creative talent that can look at other alternatives to ensure that those who are inevitably being targeted - the most vulnerable - will not be targeted in the next budget.  If it means a slippage in our targets, as has been indicated by economic commentators, so what, if means we will be able to stimulate the economy?  We are currently flatlining.  The Minister has said repeatedly that the amount of money she is paying out of her Department - €20 million plus - is a boost to the economy.  It is trickling down into the economy and is being used by people across the whole economy.  I know the Minister has to fight these issues when it comes to the Estimates debate after July and into the autumn.  I hope the Minister will have the strength of international and domestic commentators going into the new year when she is looking at the next budget.  All Departments are thinking about what will happen next year.  We hope there will be growth in the economy and domestic demand.  If not, I hope we will not come back next year for a fight on another proposal or series of proposals that will target those who can least afford it.</p><p>I cannot let the occasion pass without responding to what was said about the Fianna Fáil position in respect of some of these measures.  This was a general view, held particularly by the Labour Party, which opposed tooth and nail the proposals being made by the Government at that time.  Not only that, but all those who are working in the area of children and families have come out strongly against the proposals being made.  For example, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul said that the changes in the budget gave the lie to Government rhetoric about protecting vulnerable people.  The director of the National Women's Council of Ireland emphasised the cost of child care and said that child benefit had become an essential part of the household budget for many families.  As a person who works in child care, I know that child care costs have soared.  The Minister said that for couples who are trying to cope with mortgages in distress and to provide care for their children, this is what is hurting them.  Although I do not wish to dwell on a number of quotes, there is one that stands out.  It comes from the Minister's party leader, who said in October 2010: &quot;Does Labour see room for some cuts?  No, we do not.&quot;  It is clear from any of the studies on poverty that the people who are worst affected are children.  The cutting of child benefit makes that worse.  At the pre-election child care policy launch in February 2011 it was stated that child benefit is often the lifeline that helps keep food on the table and the house warm.  For parents with large mortgages and high child care costs, any further cut in child benefit would be a genuine crisis.  </p><p>It does not give me any pleasure to put those statements on the record but it shows that all political parties can, from time to time, be accused of being hostages to fortune.  Perhaps there are lessons to be learned by all of us in terms of what we promise the electorate at a difficult time, particularly when politics takes over, rational thought goes out the window and there is the scent of power.  At such times it is inevitable that these commitments will be made.</p><p>I do not wish to take away from those others who wish to speak, and I wish to allow the Minister to respond.  I empathise with the Minister because I understand perfectly the challenges she is facing.  Like all sides of the House, I welcome the commitments given, particularly with regard to reviewing child benefit, because we all agree that is an area that needs to be examined and it is an area in which the Minister will have great flexibility.  I wish her well and hope she will get her way through it.  Everybody agrees there must be reform in that area.  I welcome the opportunity to debate the issue with the Minister when the Leader provides the time in the new year.  This disappointment, in the sense of the amount of money saved, was a step too far.</p></speech>

A special edition of the census of population reported last month that there are 187,000 carers, of whom 72,000 are men and 114,000 are women, amounting to 4.1% of the population.  This number increased by 22,000, or 13%, between the 2006 census and the 2011 census.  They are heavily represented in low-income areas of the country, with 5% in Mayo, 4.8% in Sligo, 4.7% in Roscommon and 4.7% in Kerry, and are least represented in south Dublin, Kildare, Meath and Galway City.  The age groups that the Minister and her colleagues opposite decided to target are primarily older people.  There has been a large increase of 33.6% in the number of carers aged 60 to 74 and an increase of 39.5% in carers aged 75 and over, a declines in the number of carers aged between 15 and 29, and a modest increase of 6% in the number of carers between the ages of 30 and 44.  Any idea the Senators opposite have that this money was used to park one's wheelchair at the airport and go skiing in Switzerland is not borne out by any of the numbers.</p> <p>I recommend that the Department of Social Protection get the numbers from the Central Statistics Office before it embarks on a measure like this in the future.  The proportion of carers in rural areas is 43%, whereas they represent 38% of the overall population.  The Minister has gone out of her way today and yesterday to target those in dire need.  It is shameful that the Members opposite sought to prevent us from voting on the respite care grant.  I voted with the Minister the first day, but would not do so again after the way she and the Members opposite conducted themselves yesterday.  To target the respite care grant is mean and low.  The Minister annoyed about 400,000 people to save €26 million.  The ramming through of the measure has been the low point of the year in the House.  I ask the Minister to obtain the numbers from the CAO which will not cost her anything and revisit the issue.  I would have supported her on the other measures were it not for the way in which the business of the House was conducted yesterday.</p></speech>

Senators Marie Louise O'Donnell and O'Brien expressed views which are very much my own.  I listened carefully to what Members had to say and then recalled that on 26 September our group had tabled a Private Members' motion on children with life limiting conditions, which proposal would have saved the State several million euro, but it was parked, as we were asked to give the Government a chance to work on it.  I spoke to Senator O'Brien earlier and found out that no movement had been made on the proposal.  There are choices.  We have brought forward in this House proposals to save the State millions, yet this is the choice we face on the respite care grant.</p><p>For several years I have called for reform of the child benefit scheme.  Why was there no cushioning for those on low incomes?  I understand the children plus initiative, but it will only be based on particular geographical areas and will not cover all low-income families.  The Minister has said she will discuss with the House the report of the advisory group on tax and social welfare and family and child income supports in the new year.  If, as I understand, the report was sent to her several months ago, why are we waiting until the new year to publish it?  Why was it not published in advance of the budget to have the necessary discussions?  I will have these hard discussions and have proved myself in the House.  I do not object to everything and will take tough decisions.  We are very keen on meeting our obligations to the troika, but the State has an obligation also to the United Nations under Article 18 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child which obliges the State to support parents and legal guardians to care and provide for their children.  An attack on the child benefit payment is unacceptable because it impacts on children living in poverty.</p><p>The cuts to child benefit in the last budget came to €44.7 million, but this year the Government proposes cuts amounting to €136 million, which is enormous.  On Tuesday the Minister told the House that the cut would be €10 in respect of the first, second and third child, but that is not true.  The rate for the third child will be cut by €18 and the fourth by €20.  These are the facts and they should be given correctly.  I welcome plans for reform, but I regret what has happened in the past few days in the House.  I have tried to play a constructive role, but we have been dealt with unfairly.  I will, however, continue to play my role.</p></speech>

I would have liked to have had a debate on a number of issues which I would have liked to tease out, including the reduction in jobseeker's benefit.  I am very concerned about people who are contractually obliged to finish work at 65 years of age who will be left with jobseeker's benefit for only nine months.  They have worked all their lives only to find they will have no income for three months.  This is the sort of measure that needs to be teased out.  I do not envy the Minister her job and I would not like to have it.  However, she is a reformer and I welcome her agreement to come to the House early next year for a long discussion on these matters.  Yesterday we received constructive criticism and ideas from Members across the House which could be taken into consideration.  I look forward to the debate in February on the Mangan report on taxation and the family, to which Members will have a great deal to contribute.  I ask the Minister to work on the child care measure and ensure its inclusion.  She should not forget rural Ireland in establishing it, as people can find it difficult to get from their job in an urban area to their child's school in a rural area.  There should, therefore, be a focus on rural schools.</p></speech>

As I said on Second Stage, I have a great deal of regard for the Minister and acknowledge that she has a tough job to do.  I wish to take her up on two offers.  She referred to her next meeting with the troika, but she did not state on Second Stage the true facts in relation to the troika and decision-making.  I take her up on the offer she made, as I am sure other Members would wish to do, to invite a delegation from the Seanad to attend her next meeting with the troika.  I respect her as a Minister who is representing us.  I meet the troika as part of the finance grouping.  However, I have yet to meet one person who can tell me that the cut to the respite care grant was right.</p></speech>

We are in a terrible financial position.  While confidence is improving, as are our international standing and reputation, Ireland continues to be a programme country, which is reflected in the deficit.  We are making decisions today which are the result of bad decisions made in the past.  These are the facts.  We are carrying debts forward.  A number of recommendations have been made in the House which it would be good to see adopted, as we do not want to be here this time next year saying the same things.  As a reformer, I ask the Minister to consider bringing these suggestions to the social protection committee, as well as the House.  I commend her for the publication of the Mangan report and a range of choices as early as possible in the new year.  That is the way forward and if we debate them, we will have a stake in them.  We could not then give out to the Minister this time next year.</p> <p>If we all debate them we will all have a stake in them and then we cannot give out to the Minister this time next year because that is what is happening.  </p><p>If we continue to exist within the straitjacket of the programme for Government and the Croke Park agreement we will find ourselves back here.

We oppose the property tax, which is not necessarily a property tax but a family home tax.  Under our amendment No. 1 the Minister could have explored the possibility of introducing a wealth tax.  Last year he said that a French-style wealth tax would yield up to €500 million a year and he has said that the tax that will be introduced in this legislation will also bring in €500 million in a full year.  By the Minister's own admission, therefore, he could have introduced a French-style wealth tax.  Since he made that statement the French Government has strengthened its wealth tax laws and it expects that yield to double in the coming year.  A wealth tax is part of economies across Europe.  Sweden, Finland, Norway, Iceland and France operate successful wealth tax systems.  Spain recently introduced a wealth tax and the leading opposition party in Germany, which is a sister party to the Labour Party, has published legislation and is committed to introducing a wealth tax if elected this September.</p><p>We believe a 1% wealth tax on net wealth, excluding 20% of the family home, business assets, pension pots and all debts and liabilities would not only raise more revenue than the tax being introduced in this Bill but would do so in a way that is fair and without damaging the domestic economy.  It would be a much better option than the one before the House today.</p><p>The second amendment to this section, which has also been ruled out of order by the Cathaoirleach, sought to change the name of the Bill.  We believe the current title is incorrect.  The tax being proposed here today is not a tax on property but a tax on the family home.  If it was a tax on property it would include all buildings, land, stocks, shares, dividends, savings, yachts, cars and art collections.  Under current law, all of those assets are considered property but the only property the Minister is seeking to tax in this legislation is the family home.  Why not be up-front and honest about that?  He should call it a family home tax.  Why is he trying to conceal that?  Is it an embarrassment to the Government that the Minister is taxing people's homes?  If that is the case, why not be up-front with people about that?</p><p>I am disappointed these amendments have been ruled out of order, especially amendment No. 2, which seeks to give the Bill its proper title.  We will oppose this section.</p></speech>

What is happening here is that the report commissioned in 2006-07 was followed by the introduction by the previous Government of a tax on second homes.  That is now being annulled.  There is now no tax on the second home.  One can have two, three, four, five or six homes, but one will not have to pay the extra €200 per house on the second or third home.  What is happening here is that the principal primary residence - in other words, the family home - is being taxed.  I accept that if one has a second or third house it will be taxed also, but there is no additional taxation measure on a subsequent property.  The primary family home, therefore, is taxed as an additional property.</p><p>The family home tax title proposed by Sinn Féin may not be exactly right, but what is proposed is a home tax.  The home may not be a family home but it is a home tax because someone lives in the house.  There are exemptions in the Bill which exclude developers, but I am not sure if NAMA properties are excluded.  We did not get an answer to that on Second Stage but I would like to know if NAMA is included.  Does NAMA have to pay the property tax?  I am sure the Minister will clarify that in his address.</p><p>The Sinn Féin argument for a wealth tax on property is something that should be explored.  I would be opposed to the introduction of a taxation measure on farm lands, farm buildings, farm structures or capital from which people derive an income or provide employment, but it is an idea that should be explored.  The Minister may know the figures in terms of what the Sinn Féin proposals would yield.  I am not sure what that would be but I pose the question in the hope the Minister might be able to answer it.  This is not a property tax; it is a home tax.</p></speech>

Liquid assets were moved across the border into Belgium within hours.  That is what Sinn Féin would do.  It would drive the remaining assets in the country out of it immediately.  That would be the unintended consequence of its action.  It talks about a tax on farm land.  I do not know if that would go down well in rural Ireland.  Its proposed new section refers to assets over €1 million.  Regardless of how bad our circumstances are now, Sinn Féin would make them a lot worse.  It is a crazy idea in view of the position we are in now.  If we put a tax on liquid assets in this country they will disappear.  Sinn Féin is talking about taxing illiquid assets, which it says would bring in €500 million in a full year.  As we said yesterday, if the choice is between €500 million from this measure or an increase which would bring in €15.7 billion in income tax, that is an easy choice.</p></speech>

First, in terms of legalities, it cannot be called a family home tax because it encompasses property that is not the family home.  For the sake of argument, it encompasses rental properties and a number of other forms of property.</p><p>Second, yesterday I posed a question as to whether this was genuinely a local property tax, but following a conversation with the Minister's adviser I was satisfied that it will be a local property tax, that the money that is spent in my locality will go back to my locality - not in 2013 but in 2014 - and that there will be some redistribution to other areas of the country where the taxes would not be sufficient to pay for local amenities and so forth.</p><p>The reality is two-fold.  First, it is not correct to call this a family home tax because it covers more than the family home.  Second, it is what it says it is; a local property tax for the provision of local services.  I could not support the amendments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-12-20a.495" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012122000026#AA01100"><p>The title is correct.  First, it is a tax.  Second, it is a tax on property.  The receipts from the tax will be spent locally and therefore local property tax is the name for it.  As Senators have pointed out, it applies to property portfolios as well which are held for investment purposes and rented. If somebody has 30 apartments and rents them, the liability for tax is not on the occupier but on the owner.  It stretches well beyond the family home situation.</p><p>Neither members of Sinn Féin nor members of Fianna Fáil are in a strong position in arguing the case here because the average property tax in Northern Ireland, where Sinn Féin is a partner in government, is just over €900 and there appears to be no objection to that.  It seems to me that Sinn Féin has a partitionist attitude to this particular tax.</p><p>Fianna Fáil's position is that it negotiated the provisions of the property tax with the troika when it was in Government.  When it presented its alternative budget it proposed that the flat rate household charge be maintained.</p> <p>In terms of principle, Fianna Fáil is in favour of a property tax and I do not believe there should be flat-rate property taxes.  It was done for one year to introduce the concept.  By and large taxes on property should be related to the value of the property because in general terms that corresponds to ability to pay, when the deferrals are taken into account.</p><p>We do not agree with the proposition for a wealth tax.  Sinn Féin has it in its alternative budget but the yield it claims would run from it is totally exaggerated.  Sinn Féin did not take the opportunity to have these items costed by the Department of Finance.  There was an offer to the Opposition of costing by the Department of Finance, but Sinn Féin did not take it up.</p><p>Much of the yield from the wealth tax in France derives from the family home.  The cut-off point is €500,000 for all assets, including savings, pensions and property - everything goes in.  As in most parts of Paris a two-bedroom apartment might cost €800,000, €900,000 or €1 million, it is clear that family homes and family apartments go straight into the wealth-tax net.  The French wealth tax is largely a family home tax.  People are quite used to the concept of this kind of tax, which exists throughout Europe.  Ireland is the outlier, the exception.  Many reasonably well-off people in Ireland have properties in Spain, Portugal or the south of France and do not seem to have any problem paying the local property tax on those.  The same principles apply here.</p><p>We cannot keep taxing income because a tax on income is a tax on work.  The higher we put the price of something the less we get.  We must stop taxing work and broaden the tax base.  People's incomes may not be immediately identifiable, but if they have a very large mansion it is very identifiable and it is possible to broaden the tax base that way, which is worth doing.  I do not believe this will be a serious imposition on anybody because the thinking behind the tax is that everybody will pay something with very few exclusions.  With a base of 1.9 million units it is possible to have quite a low average on this.  We are tying in both the valuations and the rates for three years.  There will be no revaluation until November.</p><p>We are strengthening the local element of the tax by giving discretion to the local authorities to vary the tax by plus or minus 15%.  In practice, candidates in the local elections in 2014 will propose to their electorates either that they will leave the tax the same or that they will increase or reduce it.  When they vote for the next set of councillors, the public will have a direct say on whether they want property tax to increase or decrease.  If this becomes a stable element of the tax code, future governments may decide to entrust the entire scheme to local authorities, which would be normal enough.  In the first instance and as long as we are in government, this will be a tax to be collected by the Revenue Commissioners and put into the Local Government Fund to be spent locally on local services.  There will be a direct relationship between the level of tax collected in an area and the amount of money spent on the services in that area.</p></speech>

The Minister stated that in principle the properties that I have raised in these categories, those held by trusts for children and youth activities, would be exempt in a similar manner to that of the household charge.  I would prefer to hear from the Minister first.</p></speech>

It considered that it would be relatively easy for a property owner to place the ownership of properties into a discretionary trust and for the trustees to rent the house back to the person setting up the trust or to a family member for a nominal or no rent.</p><p>As regards Senator van Turnhout's amendment of an exemption for charitable bodies, the Thornhill group considered that the local property tax should be centred on principles of equity, transparency and simplicity.  Accordingly, I consider that a universal liability should apply to all owners of residential property with a limited number of exemptions.  In an effort to keep the rate of tax low and to ensure equity between taxpayers, the Government decided to minimise the number of exemptions to the tax and to limit deferral arrangements to cases where there is a real and material inability to pay the tax.</p><p>There will not be a blanket exemption for charitable bodies and in this context, the recommendation to provide an exemption for local authority or social housing providers was limited to special need cases.  In practice, the majority of housing provided by registered charities would be expected to be exempt from the tax as it is provided to those who require special accommodation and support to enable them to live in the community.  Revenue will be providing guidelines in this regard.</p><p>I understand that Senator van Turnhout's interest is related to her association with the Irish Girl Guides, which organisation owns some properties which are used for breaks and holidays for members.  I appreciate that groups such as the girl guides and many other organisations in the community and voluntary sector provide facilities and work with young people and with other sectors for social and personal development purposes.  Such organisations were granted exemption from the household charge for the buildings in question and I am disposed to ensuring that the exemption would continue.  The matter will be examined and will be dealt with in the finance Bill.</p><p>I will not accept the amendment as currently cast because I will not give a blanket exemption to discretionary trusts.  However, I will examine the possibility of extending an exemption to bodies such as the girl guides in the context of the finance Bill.</p></speech>

I suppose the background to this one, which is offered in the spirit of suggestion to the Minister if it is of use to him in the finance Bill or elsewhere, and on which I will not seek a vote, is to ask the Minister what is the open market value of a house at present.</p><p>  My view is we should let the prices fall.  It would improve the competitiveness of the Irish economy.  However, for other purposes which I understand and appreciate, such as not having to bail out the banks again, we have allowed ghost estates, NAMA's intervention in the property market and forbearance which has other good side effects, but it means that the taxation of an individual under the Bill is based on a price that is being artificially kept high and, in general, is not related to the ability to pay of the person in the house.  It would be better, for economic reasons, if the price fell.  It would also mean that the liability under this tax would fall.</p><p>  I am trying to get a handle on what is the open market price.  I believe it is seriously distorted upwards by the policy measures to which I referred.  I would ask the Minister to consider whether an adjustment downwards in people's liability to the tax is justified by the current state of the property market.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-12-20a.528" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1116" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012122000028#DD01100"><p>I compliment Senator Barrett because the main talking point around the country on the property tax is how we will value our homes.  There are so many developments in the property market, for example, banks are selling houses off very cheaply.</p><p>Senator Barrett spoke more on the other side of the equation, referring to policy measures which, he states, distort the market the other way, but people are asking how they will value their house.  People tell me that no house has sold in my area for the past number of years, except one that was repossessed at a very low price, and they will need considerable guidance.</p><p>I have looked at average property values in towns across my constituency, but only in one town were there 50 or more properties sold.  One is looking at a small sample of properties.  In one town, the valuation looks quite low but there were many low-priced houses sold.  Those who think their house is worth more would look at this and say that their property is worth much less by comparison, and might get a shock.  In other towns, they will get a shock when they see the sale of properties and the prices that they are going for on average, but they do not know the type of property being sold - whether it is a five-bedroom detached house or a three-bedroom semi-detached house.  There is little guidance available.  The property price register is good in so far as it goes but it does not give the detail necessary to allow people to value their homes.  The question of what constitutes market value, which we oppose as a basis for the tax as we oppose the tax itself, is on the tip of people's tongues all around the country.  It really needs to be addressed and clarified in the best possible way.</p></speech>

Like other Senators, I had queries from constituents who asked how would one value a property that was valued at €500,000 five years ago.</p><p>There are two ways of valuing a property.  One is comparable valuation where the house next door was sold, but that is not very accurate at present.  The other is the cost of rebuilding, that is, the cost of bricks and mortar plus the site value, where the site value creates the difficulty with valuation.</p><p>Would the Minister clarify whether self-assessment will be the method used by everyone or will there be guidelines from the Revenue or the Department stating that in a town, such as Letterkenny, most properties will be within a certain band?  At present, there is a difficulty in valuing a property because finance is not available.  However, every property has a value.  As I said to someone, if he was left a property and wanted to dispose of it reasonably quickly, there is a market value on it.</p> <p>What that value is now is difficult to pinpoint.  There needs to be clarity in areas where sales, particularly in country areas, can be non-existent for several years.  Will self-assessment be allowed?  What discretion has the occupier?</p></speech>

The big talking point, as Senator Byrne touched on, is how we value property.  To me the open market seems the best option but as Senator Barrett explained, it has to be distortion free.  It will be a challenge and will probably lead to more debate and legal steps.  Senator Barrett's suggestion is the best approach.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-12-20a.532" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1123" speakername="Brian Ó Domhnaill" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012122000029#EE00300"><p>This amendment cuts straight to the faults of the Bill.  We are living in an era of a distorted property market and no one really knows the value of property.  The value of property should be based on the ability of an individual to buy it.  However, there are few buyers because the banks are not lending and no one is in a financial position to purchase property.</p><p>Recently, a four-bedroom house in Donegal was sold at auction for €30,000.  Fianna Fáil put down a parliamentary question on this and other houses around the country which sold at the same value.  Will all similar properties in this Donegal town, which is a lucrative and well-developed town, also have to pay €90 in a full year on property tax?  Will those homeowners be in compliance with the law?  Revenue will publish its documentation based on stamp duty figures.  That is flawed because these figures are out of date in the current market.  There is no stamp duty transaction based on the past ten years in the current market.  Property valuations have to be based on what the sale price will be today, not on the stamp duty valuations in the past.</p><p>Will owners of such homes be hit with a liability of an interest penalty when they sell the property ten years from now based on the Revenue's assumption of what the valuation could be?  We need clarity on this matter.  I commend Senator Barrett for tabling this amendment because it cuts to the chase of what this tax is all about.  It is a tax on the sale value of a property.  However, no one is in a position to sell because none of the banks will provide mortgages to potential buyers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-12-20a.533" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1126" speakername="Jim Walsh" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012122000029#EE00400"><p>This is a fundamental plank in the Bill and I can see the motivation behind Senator Barrett's attempt to deal with the distortions in the market.  Valuations of property will vary.  Why was there no consideration given to regional guidelines on a square footage cost?  In the past, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government used to supply certificates of reasonable value which were used to value properties that were sold.</p><p>Everyone agrees that it is difficult in the current property cycle to accurately value residential properties.  It strikes me that the €50,000 band is too narrow in that regard.  There should be some consideration for having them wider so that there is greater degree of scope to get the valuation accurately.  I agree with Senator Ó Domhnaill on the issue of contingent liability if someone unintentionally misvalues a property.</p><p>Does this section contradict section 14?  This section deals with the chargeable value and the market value of properties.  If someone buys a property six months after the first tax is paid on it, he or she will have to pay that original tax for the following three years when the actual price of the house will be established by the actual sale.  That seems a contradiction.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-12-20a.534" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012122000029#EE00500"><p>Senator Barrett seeks to amend the definition of chargeable value of residential property to the price the unencumbered fee simple of the property might reasonably fetch on a sale in a distortion-free open market were the property to be sold on a particular date.  The Thornhill group recommended that market value of residential properties should be the basis for the assessment for the tax.  Full market value is a tried and tested basis of assessment that is internationally accepted.  This is underlined by the fact that it is so widely used internationally and, by implication, is readily understood by taxpayers all over the world.  At any point in time, most homeowners will have a reasonable sense of the market value of the home in which they live by reference to recent sales and to officially and privately published data on house price movements.  One would expect distortions, to which Senator Barrett referred, tended towards increasing the market value of a house or the price paid for it would be reflected in the self-assessment by the property owner and, consequently, a higher property tax payment.</p><p>Where there is a doubt in individual cases, estimates can be obtained from professional auctioneers or valuers.  The initial valuation of property to be self-assessed by liable persons as of 1 May 2013 will be valid up to and including 2016.  This will provide certainty for taxpayers.  Revenue will provide guidance on how to value a property early next year.  It will engage in a comprehensive information campaign, including writing to residential property owners in March 2013 enclosing a detailed explanatory booklet on the operation of local property tax, valuation procedures and the payment methods, as well as a return form for completion.  Where taxpayers follow Revenue's guidance honestly, Revenue will accept their property value assessment.  The register of residential property sales published by the Property Services Regulatory Authority will be of assistance in valuing property.</p><p>I am aware of the current difficulties in the residential property market.</p> <p>I have attempted to bring some stimulus to the market by way of limited exemptions from the property tax for purchasers of new and previously unused properties purchased between 1 January 2013 and the end of 2016.  Such properties will be exempt until the end of 2016.  There is a further exemption in respect of second-hand properties purchased by first-time buyers between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2013, which will also be exempt until the end of 2016.</p><p>It is quite legitimate for the Government to intervene in the property market in order to achieve policy ends.  Mortgage interest relief and interest relief for landlords both distort the property market to some extent.  Other policy measures such as varying stamp duty rates in order to cool or stimulate the market or the current capital gains tax relief for properties bought from December 2011 to December 2013 also distort the market.  The property market in Ireland was considerably distorted in the past by oversupply of financing to certain sectors.  This probably created a far greater distortion than any measures undertaken by the Government or the National Asset Management Agency.  This form of distortion is not catered for in Senator Barrett's amendment.  For example, it is not clear how precisely the distortion-free market value to which it refers will be arrived at.  This will make it impossible to determine with certainty what will be the assessable value of the property for tax purposes.  The latter would undermine a core principle of taxation, namely, that what someone is being taxed on and what is his or her liability should be certain and clear.  I am not, therefore, disposed to accept the amendments.</p><p>On the questions that were posed by Senators, according to the Revenue some 90% of houses in the country are valued at €300,000 or less.  The bulk of property tax will, therefore, be paid in respect of amounts from €300,000 down.  If we introduce bands of €50,000, then most people will have a fair shot at placing an X beside the band which applies to them.  We are not asking someone to indicate that his or her house is worth €176,000, we are asking him or her to estimate whether it is valued at between €150,000 and €200,000.  The latter is a much easier question to answer and most people will have a reasonable shot at it.  If anyone is in doubt, he or she can have an auctioneer value the property and obtain from him or her a letter which can be included with the return.  The Revenue will provide extensive information with regard to the value of houses in particular localities.  It has been accumulating an amount of information in this regard since late spring, when it was first asked to take on the task of collecting the property tax.</p><p>It is much more reasonable to introduce a property tax at the bottom of the market rather than at the top.  If the property tax had been introduced in 2007, what has happened to property values in the interim would have ensured that a major imposition was placed on householders.  At least we are building from the bottom up at this point.  The market has stabilised, certainly in Dublin where values have risen marginally for three of the past four months.  Money is available again and Bank of Ireland in particular is providing quite a number of mortgages and AIB is following it into the market.  Some new overseas banks are also operating in the Dublin market.  This sector of the economy was damaged but it is being repaired on a progressive basis.  I do not believe there is a major difficulty in the context of people having a view on what their homes are worth.  If one lives in a housing estate, it will probably be easier to value one's home.  If someone low balls in respect of the value of his or her home and states that it is worth €50,000, while his or her neighbours value theirs at €250,000, this will stick out a mile in the returns when Revenue is carrying out its review.  That person might be required to explain why his or her house was of such a uniquely low value.  I accept that here might be a reason for this but an explanation will have to be provided.</p><p>The difficulty with regard to valuations will arise in respect of one-off houses.  Many such houses are unique in nature and there can be a variation in value between two houses located next to each other, despite the fact that the square footage, etc., of both might be similar.  I trust the Revenue to come to terms with this matter.  The first step from its point of view is to get people to self-assess the value of their homes in order that it can get the register up and running.  The Revenue can iron out the distortions as time goes by.  Anyone who, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, completes his or her form honestly will not be chased for penalties or anything of that nature.  He or she may be written to if it appears that the value submitted is excessively low.  However, such an individual will not have penalty clauses or anything of that nature invoked against him or her.</p><p>I would like the property market to rise again.  I hope it will do so.  Regardless of whether it does, there will be no revaluation until November 2016.  That is the reason for the apparent competition between the sections to which Senator Walsh drew attention.  What we are saying is that if someone values his or her house and if he or she sells it six months later - even at a higher price - the valuation for property tax which has been accepted by the Revenue will apply until the general revaluation date.  That is an acceptable way to approach this matter.  We want to keep it simple, ensure certainty and have the tax collected.  In addition, we want it to contribute to the taxation base.  Income taxes are at a high level and we do not want to drive them up further.  The latter are taxes on work.  If one were to identify all of the problems we face, the one that is most in need of remediation is the high level of unemployment which obtains.  When the price of something goes up, one tends to get less of it.  That also applies to work.  If one taxes work, one will get less of it.  As soon as we have the resources available to us, it would be our policy to reduce rather than increase personal taxes.  When this happens, we want to broaden the base and introduced other taxes similar to that under discussion.</p><p>The property tax places a low enough imposition on people.  When one considers the various tables, etc., one will come to the conclusion that, particularly in view of the deferrals which will be in place, it will not be penal in respect of anyone.  There are always cases where an inability to pay applies.  However, the deferral system should cater for these.</p></speech>

If, as happened in the past, a banker were to become deranged and pay a wild price for a house in a neighbourhood located not too far from the Oireachtas, I presume this will not affect the liabilities of everyone else in said neighbourhood.  From what the Minister indicated, I understand that the price paid by the banker would not become the lead value for the neighbourhood.  Will the Revenue take the view that the individual in question had more money than brains and that he overpaid massively for the house in question?  If it does not take such a view, those who live in the neighbourhood in question will be concerned because their incomes have not increased and they bought their houses to live in rather than as an investment.  I appreciate the Minister's point with regard to the fact that the low rate should not put distortions in place.  I hope the system will pick up the sort of one-off cases to which I refer.  I accept that someone might pay over the odds for a house in which his great-grandfather lived.  Would this affect everyone else in the area?  From what the Minister said, I believe it would not.</p></speech>

It seems that it will be relatively simple for those who live in housing estates.  With once-off houses, it is a little more difficult.  In the context of houses in rural areas which are encumbered by farm buildings, slurry tanks or whatever, the market value would be lower because it is more difficult to dispose of them.  On the other hand, there are some very big houses on large sites in rural areas and they will attract whatever value the Revenue decides in respect of them.  The Revenue will give guidance in this regard and I am of the view that the system will work.  The system will be one of self-assessment in accordance with guidelines.  The fact that one will not be asked to decide the precise worth of one's house but that one will rather be obliged to place its value within one a certain €50,000 band leads me to believe that what we are attempting to do will work.</p></speech>

The guidance the Revenue Commissioners will provide will be very helpful to people throughout the country.  I am of the view that they will provide better advice than that offered by the previous Leader of the House on 10 April 2008.</p> <p>He stated: <blockquote><br />Now is the right time to buy ... We have a duty to tell first-time house buyers, young couples with no previous experience, that there is unbelievable value in the marketplace today.  It will not last forever.  It is never the wrong time to do the right thing.  I offer the House the benefit of my experience and my opinion which is all any Member can do.  I will remind the House, perhaps in 12 or 18 months, when prices have again increased by 25% or 30%, that they were told this by the Leader of the House on this historic day.</blockquote>I am confident that the Office of the Revenue Commissioners will give better advice than the former Leader of the House.</p></speech>

That is our position.</p><p>My question relates to the Minister's response on exemptions, not that on charities.  When the measure is introduced, a review will be important.  A fundamental mistake is to provide for exemptions, for specified periods, for first-time buyers and the purchasers of new or vacant houses.  Without making any prediction on future values, most independent experts, people involved in the property market and lay people such as me recognise the value to be had.  I find it hard to marry the provision for an exemption for those who can afford to buy good quality houses with the failure to provide one for others.</p><p>The Government is proposing that someone who buys a house in a certain estate for €200,000 with a very sustainable mortgage should be exempt from the property tax, provided the house meets certain criteria, while a person who had to pay €500,000 for the same type of standard house in the same estate and who may be struggling to pay his or her mortgage should not be exempt.  The same applies to a new house.  I really do not understand this and believe it would have been better to consider exemptions for the tens of thousands who paid large amounts of stamp duty, as referred to in the Thornhill report.  I understand the Minister's difficulty in that people who pay must pay more to cover exemptions, but I make this point on the basis that he is providing for an exemption for those who can – fair play to them – buy good houses at a great discount of 50% or 60%.  The latter are winning in both ways.  I am not trying to crucify the people concerned, but I do not understand the logic in doing what is proposed, considering that those who paid more and paid stamp duty will not be exempt.</p><p>The Minister has stated it is appropriate for the Government to use measures to try to stimulate the housing market.  I am not actually sure, based on what occurred when Governments did get involved.  I recall the clamour in 2002 and 2003 when there was an insufficient supply of houses.  There was a general discussion before I became a Member of the fact that not enough houses were being built.  The market went nuts from approximately 2005 or 2006.</p></speech>

Those who did not pay stamp duty and bought brand new houses paid considerable sums in VAT.  This is never discussed in the debate.  I do not understand the Minister's policy.</p></speech>

Yesterday I asked in the Minister's absence about the collection of the property tax.  The question was not answered yesterday.  People may wish to pay by way of deferred payments, perhaps on a monthly basis.  Who will do the collecting?  Will it be existing staff in the Revenue Commissioners or will new staff be taken on?  Will jobs be created?</p><p>Yesterday I referred to three public representatives from Northern Ireland, two of whom I met in the Houses yesterday.  One lives in an affluent part of Belfast and pays almost £2,000 in household rates.  This is the equivalent of €2,400.  The second man who lives on the outskirts of Newry pays £1,400.  The third pays €1,700.  There is a significant difference between what is charged for one house and the next.  I acknowledge that those living in more affluent places pay more.</p><p>How will collection be achieved?  Will it be through direct debit?  Will there be a deferred payment arrangement for those who cannot afford to pay a lump sum?  How will the revenue benefit local authorities?  Will the Minister confirm that the money will be spent in respective local authorities and be a major boost to those that have insufficient operating revenue?</p></speech>

The value of the charge will not be based on stamp duty paid.  It is incorrect to contend that it will.  The charge will be determined in the manner I explained.</p><p>When the Government made its decision in July, additional resources were allocated to the Revenue Commissioners for the employment of additional staff in the central unit to administer the charge.  Generally, there are many ways of paying the tax.  One could pay it by cash, cheque, credit or debit card, or have it deducted from one's salary.  For the 1.8 million who work, the easiest approach is to accept a weekly deduction if one is paid by the week or a fortnightly deduction if one is paid by the fortnight, etc.  The Revenue Commissioners will make the deduction and the tax will be collected in the same way as PRSI or the universal social charge.  It will be another deduction from a wage or salary.  This is not a compulsory means of payment.  If people opt to pay through deductions, that is how it will be done, but there is nothing to stop someone sending a cheque to the Revenue Commissioners for the whole amount on the due date.  The only point to remember is that the default arrangement will be a deduction from wages, salaries or any payment from the State to the individual.  A direct farm payment, for example, is an obvious example.</p><p>Senator Darragh O'Brien asked about the logic of the exemptions for first-time buyers and those with empty houses.</p> <p>There might be good value in the market now but value is not a fixed issue.  There is no value if one buys today and the price reduces by a further 20%.  The purpose of this measure is to try to repair the property market.  Last year, I introduced additional mortgage interest relief for people who purchased houses in 2012.  This has worked well during the last three or four months.  We are now coming to the end of the year and people are scrambling to get their transactions completed.  I stated several times previously that this would not be continued.  However, so as not to risk the property market coming to a halt again, I have introduced incentives of a lesser value.  It is hoped these will keep the property market going.  That is the logic of this measure.  Estates wherein only one third of the properties are occupied are not in anybody's interest.  It is hoped this incentive will assist in the sale of the remaining houses, thus turning ghost estates into living communities.  Some measures work and others do not.  However, they are well worth trying.  That is the justification for this measure.</p></speech>

Sinn Féin has a problem with the definition of the gross market value of the home.  In basing the tax on the gross market value the Minister is failing to take account of a wide range of issues central to any true valuation in that regard.  For example, account is not taken of the outstanding amount of the mortgage or negative equity or that in such cases the tax could be considered a tax on debt as opposed to tax on an asset.</p><p>  Account is also not taken of any increase in the gross value of the home as a result of adaptations to make the property suitable for people with physical, sensory and intellectual disabilities or mental health difficulties.  This amendment to the definition of chargeable value seeks to make calculation of the value of the family home a net value, taking into account some of the liabilities such as negative equity, adaptations to the house and so on as provided for in subsection (<i>c</i>).  That a person would be punished because a member of his or her family is disabled, is morally wrong.  Such adaptations are not a luxury, rather they are a necessity.  It is unacceptable that such works would be taken into consideration in calculation of the value of the home.  It is unfair that a family home will be levied on the basis of the gross value of the property, in particular if that property does not have a value.</p></speech>

In other words, where a property is valued at €100,000, on which the mortgage is €90,000, the remaining €10,000 will be the amount on which property tax liability will be based, which sounds straightforward.  However, there are many properties worth €2 million to €3 million, on which the mortgages are large but the owners of which are earning €500,000 per annum.  In most cases, negative equity bears no relation to the person who occupies a house.  I believe rich people rather than people on modest incomes would benefit were this amendment accepted.  Where a person owns a house worth €2 million, on which the mortgage is €2 million, that does not mean that person is badly off rather it means he or she made a bad purchase choice.  Such a person could be earning €1 million per annum.  I do not believe we should exempt people from this tax just because they have a large mortgage, even though it would be deserving in particular cases.  I do not believe this would be a good move as it would benefit those who are well off, leaving others to cover that loss.</p></speech>

As I see it, there are two issues involved here.  People with mortgages do not own their homes because the banks have a hold over them.  The level of a person's mortgage generally reflects his or her wealth.  In general, those who have high mortgages are first-time buyers.  A person who sells his or her home for €200,000 and has a mortgage on it of €180,000, will only retain €20,000 from that sale.  The legislation as currently drafted is a disincentive to any person who wants to upgrade his or her property.  The property tax is fixed until 2016, with local authorities having the power to increases or decrease this by 15% in 2015.  However, where an individual makes improvements to his or her home between now and 2016 this will add value to the property.</p><p>The particular group of people that comes to mind in terms of adaptations to property is the disabled.  While grants for such adaptations are small they are of benefit to disabled people who cannot go upstairs and need to install a walk-in shower or bathroom downstairs.  Where this is done, value will be added to the property.  Post-2016 the saleable value of that home will have increased, resulting in an increase in property tax liability under this legislation.  There is a need for a provision to protect the elderly and disabled in terms of adaptations to their properties.  These people do not undertake adaptations to add value to their homes rather they undertake them for mobility purposes.  The alternative for such people is to go into a nursing home, at a cost to the State of at least €1,300 or €1,400 per week in respect of any publicly funded nursing home in this country.  It would be crazy to ask these people to pay more when they are saving the State money in the long term.  Perhaps the Minister would consider an exemption for the disabled and elderly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-12-20a.562" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1126" speakername="Jim Walsh" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012122000032#HH01300"><p>In the run up to the budget, there was much discussion about fairness.  The point made by Senator Harte can be easily undermined.  For example, two people living in adjacent homes, one of whom is on a salary of 40% more than the other person and living in a rented property and will not be liable for the property tax and the other person, who is on the lower salary but is above the exemption limit and has a mortgage more than twice the value of the property, who will be liable for this tax.  There is an element of inequity in the system.  This amendment proposes that account be taken of the mortgage on a home.</p> <p>That point is not addressed in the Bill.  I am not saying it would be easy to address but it is a problem and it is inequitable tax application.</p><p>On the stamp duty, I agree with Senator O'Reilly in that regard.  People bought at the height of the property boom, and also in recent years, and there should be some amelioration, perhaps a discount of 10% each year or whatever, in terms of the tax being paid to allow for the fact that they paid stamp duty at the higher rate.  Arguments can be made for that which are founded on fairness, and I urge the Minister to examine that between now and the publication of the Finance Bill to see if some amelioration can be given.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-12-20a.564" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012122000033#JJ00200"><p>I thank the Senators.  I have an extensive speaking note which I will read but Senator Ó Domhnaill made a point about the grants from local authorities with which we would all be familiar where some elderly person can no longer take the stairs because of a particular ailment and a bedroom with a shower and toilet is built downstairs aided by grants.  The likelihood is that will not drive them into the next band.  It should be remembered that the value is not on a precise figure.  It is in the €50,000 band and the kind of extension the Senator is talking about would probably leave people in the same band if they did that kind of work.  However, if an extensive costly extension was built on to a house in other circumstances that might take them up into the next band and that would be picked up in the next valuation date.</p><p>I will read the speaking note because it contains a lot of information.  The amendment covers a number of issues - mortgage arrears, stamp duty, negative equity on houses adapted for disabled persons.  Section 2 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Bill defines the chargeable value of residential property.  On mortgage arrears the Senators are seeking to amend the section to ensure that the value of any outstanding liabilities in regard to a mortgage on a relevant residential property is deducted from the market value of the property before calculating the tax liability.</p><p>The Government agreed with the recommendations of the interdepartmental expert group on the design of the property tax, known as the Thornhill group, in its consideration that as a tax, the local property tax should be centred on the principles of equity, transparency and simplicity.  In terms of these principles, it was also considered that a universal liability should apply to all owners of residential property, with a limited number of exemptions.</p><p>In making its recommendations for deferrals the group had regard to the following criteria: ability to pay - reliefs create costs which have to be paid for either by taxpayers who do not benefit from the relief or by a reduction in public expenditure; reliefs should be designed to address clear economic and social policy needs; care needs to be taken in designing reliefs to ensure they are targeted based on need and are not unintended and inequitable distribution gains.</p><p>The local property tax is intended to be a tax on the benefits from ownership of a residential property.  Such residential properties have monetary and non-monetary values which are independent of incomes, and the local property tax is not assessed on incomes.  The system of deferrals outlined in the Finance (Local Property Tax) Bill 2012 is more targeted in cases of need than a relief for outstanding mortgages and does have reference to income stressed homeowners, allowing enhanced deferrals where there is low income and liability to mortgage interest.  An outstanding mortgage on a property does not mean that there is necessarily an inability to pay.  Where there is inability to pay, relief is available in the form of a deferral.  Mortgage interest relief is also available to many homeowners on interest up to €20,000 per annum.  Individuals who bought properties since 2004 can continue to claim mortgage interest relief until 2017.</p><p>The Thornhill Group recommended against providing for reliefs specifically related to stamp duty paid.  In making its suggestions for deferrals, the group had regard to ability to pay - reliefs create costs which have to be paid for by other taxpayers.  This is more or less a repeat of what I have said already.   The group recommended against allowances for stamp duty because it would not be targeted at need.  The tax structure was known to house purchasers and so on.  While some individuals have a significant stamp duty liability they may also be in a position to claim mortgage interest relief.  We are dealing with the deferral situation there.</p><p>The Government also decided against using negative equity as a ground for deferral or waiver of the property tax.  Instead, the deferral system was recommended by the Thornhill report and is modified in the Bill before the House and it focuses on the ability to pay the tax and is based on the income of the liable person.  The fact that a house may be worth less than when it was bought does not necessarily mean that the owner cannot pay the tax.</p><p>The Government is conscious of the difficulty some homeowners are experiencing in meeting their mortgage obligations.  The main focus of attention is on those mortgage holders who are experiencing genuine difficulty in meeting the commitments in respect of their home.  It is to those that the large deferrals based on mortgage interest payments are directed.</p><p>The Senators are also seeking to amend the section to ensure that the valuation would be net of the value of any adaptation made to residential property to meet the needs of a person with a physical, sensory or intellectual disability or mental health difficulty.  I have dealt with that.</p><p>In an effort to keep the rate of the tax low and to ensure horizontal equity, that is, as between taxpayers, the Government decided to minimise the number of exemptions to the tax and to limit deferral arrangements to cases where there is a real and material inability to pay.  The initial valuation of the property to be assessed as on 1 May 2013 will be valid up to and including November 2016, and valuations will be valid for three-year periods thereafter.</p><p>Senator Walsh made some comments about equity.  It comes down to one's concept of fairness.  Sometimes an argument on fairness is made which seems to suggest that there is a small group of very wealthy people and if we tax them enough, nobody else would have to pay anything.  That is one well-recited measure of fairness but the concept of fairness for those of us who know their constituencies on a door-to-door basis, like many of the Senators here, and for most people is that everybody should pay something in accordance with their ability to pay.  That is the fairness.</p><p>If we consider situations in large housing estates where 80% or 85% of social houses have been bought out and are owner occupied under the rental purchase schemes but 15% are tenants, it is only fair that the tenants in similar houses should not make some contribution, no matter how small, when everybody else in the same street who bought out their house is making a contribution.  The same applies, and accentuates the sense of unfairness, where local authorities, as a matter of housing policy, and it is a housing policy with which I agree, go into a private housing estate, buy a house and put somebody in it as a tenant.  It is not fair that that family should not pay something as well when everyone along the road who bought their houses and are paying heavy mortgages are paying also.  If the Senator thinks of fairness in terms of everybody making some contribution, no matter how small, to the situation in which we find ourselves he will get a better idea of where I am coming from in the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-12-20a.565" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1159" speakername="Mark Daly" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012122000033#JJ00300"><p>I want to pick up on the issue of ability to pay and speak about valuations of which I have some knowledge.  That will be a huge issue.  In terms of ability to pay, which is what the amendment is about, some people paid their stamp duty up-front as part of their mortgage and therefore every month they paid back that stamp duty in their mortgage payment which they gave to the Government and which it took.  It is a form of double taxation.</p><p>In terms of how people will do their own valuations, it will be a nightmare for the Government.  It will put the €100 household charge into the shade, so to speak, because having been a valuer I know that if we ask people to value their own houses it will not work because various issues arise in that regard.</p> <p>If one is living in Limerick and a farmer down the road has sheds all around his house, who would buy that farmhouse on its own with sheds around it?  That is one of the issues that has not been thought out.  The issue comes down to one's ability to pay the tax.  Ability to pay is what one has in terms of one's income and not how much one's house is worth.</p><p>We all know that the abolition of the property tax in 1977 was the wrong step.  It had huge consequences and it took a number of years to filter through the system but now we are taking an equally wrong measure at the wrong time in that we are foisting this tax on people who do not have the ability to pay it.  Not everybody will be unable to pay it but many people who paid stamp duty in the past ten years feel they have already paid their property tax and that they pay it every month in their mortgage repayment.  Account is not taken in the legislation of whether people have lost their jobs since they purchased their properties.  All those are issues in determining one's ability to pay.  The abolition of the property tax in 1977 was the worse taxation measure decision and it probably had the worse consequences in the 1980s of any measure taken.  When people look back on this measure in a few years this decision to start taxing a depressed housing market with no account being taken of people's ability to pay will be considered the worst thing that could have been done in terms of taxation.  </p><p>I do not believe the Minister was here when Senator Crown offered to pay more in income tax rather than pay this tax because that takes account of ability to pay.  The Minister spoke about the Government not wanting to be seen to be taxing jobs and I understand that issue but this measure boils down to one's ability to pay.  People have paid stamp duty on their property and they are in financial difficulty.  Tens of thousands of people in different categories will find it very difficult to pay this tax.  The Bill, which I read last weekend, does not take into account the exceptional circumstances in which people find themselves.  We are in a very dire economic situation in terms of revenue generation but the introduction of this property tax at this time will make a dire situation disastrous.</p></speech>

We all know that from our neighbours, friends and the communities we live in but the deferral sections of the Bill are aimed at dealing with that problem.  For single people on an income below €15,000 and for a couple with an income below €25,000, there will be a deferral.  Those who are badly off because they are paying huge mortgages can add €20,000 interest on to the top of that income for a couple and still get deferrals.  There is quite a good deferral system.  If one has to pay €300 a year and one defers that for ten years, that is only €3,000 on the value of the house plus 4% interest, which would probably bring it up to some hundreds of euro beyond that.  The deferral system is not a big penalty on the value of the house and it is there for persons who have an inability to pay.  However, a lot of people have an ability to pay and we should not take the hard case as the typical case.</p><p>The Senator will recall a few weeks ago there was a change in the television signal and a good deal of data came across my desk when that was being done.  Does he know that 82% of households in Ireland have pay television packages?  Most of them do not have the basic package, they also have sport and film channels.

There are people who are very badly off and there are more people badly off now than ever before but there is a whole generality of people who are paying their way.  I am only using what people pay for a television product in their homes as an example and this measure is an awful lot less.  Many people will pay less in property tax than they will pay for a television licence.  The charges are quite modest and they will be spread across 1.9 million household units and that allows us to keep the rates down.  Some 90% of houses in this country, according to the Revenue Commissioners, are valued at €300,000 or less.  There are real issues but we should not exaggerate the position by speaking in generalities.</p></speech>

It was a feature of the Celtic tiger that many people bought or built very large properties and they will attract fairly significant property tax as a consequence.  Some 29% of mortgage holders are in arrears or have had to make some arrangement with their lenders.  I take the point the Minister made about people having different alternatives in terms of television packages and other items that involve discretionary spending, but it must be accepted that a very significant proportion of the population are in great difficulty and are struggling exceptionally hard to make ends meet.  It is the cumulative effect of measures that create difficulties for people.  No one single measure tips people over but when added together at some point the effect of them will put people into serious difficulties.</p><p>The Minister spoke about exemptions.  There is an exemption limit on incomes but would it not be appropriate to factor in people's disposable income rather than gross income.  Many people will have far less than €15,000 a year once they have paid their mortgages and dealt with the commitments they have.  That is something that needs to be examined.  I can understand why the Minister provided for an exemption, although whether the threshold is high enough is questionable, but I have some difficulty with the concept of people who are unable to pay tax accumulating a liability for the future.  That is wrong.</p><p>Another point I wish to raise with the Minister is why we are ramming through this measure.  It will come into effect well into next year.  There are sections of the Bill, particularly the Revenue powers, that need to be properly and fully debated in this House and a guillotine will probably be applied to the debate in a few hours.  That is unacceptable.  It is a disservice to the Bill, to what the Minister is trying to do and, more particularly, to the people we represent.  I do not see any good reason this debate cannot resume next January when we return after the recess.  That would at least allow us to tease out the provisions of the Bill, as we are doing now in a reasonable fashion.  I ask the Minister to consider that.  I cannot see a good reason for ramming this Bill through now.</p></speech>

If one takes a couple who have an income of €25,000 before they come to having earned the that amount, they can deduct up to €20,000 of interest payments from their income.  The concept the Senator is taking about is already provided for in the Bill.</p><p>On the question of rushing to bring in the legislation, the Revenue Commissioners are being charged with the collection of this tax. </p> <p>The Revenue Commissioners informed me that if we waited to do this in the finance Bill it would be too late in the year to allow them to make detailed preparations for collecting the tax.  They sought certainty about the actual terms of the tax and that certainty is only provided on enactment.  This is why we separated it from the finance Bill and introduced it as separate legislation to be done before Christmas.</p><p>If good ideas arise today I am perfectly prepared to consider them and then amend this legislation in the finance Bill.  For example, I have already made a commitment to introducing an amendment for pyrite houses.  I will introduce an amendment on the obligations on the executors of wills.  I do not have a solution yet but there must be a better way of doing this than what is described in the Bill.  I discussed an issue with another Senator this morning at the start of the debate.  She is particularly interested in exemptions for weekend residences for girl guides and for when they go away to scout dens and so on.  We will consider that as well.  If other issues arise I will not close the door on reasonable amendments, but I will have to do it in the context of the finance Bill.  Then it would apply retrospectively to this legislation.</p></speech>

There is a dialogue going on and that is very valuable.  There are people at a critical stage and we all recognise that.  The Minister has indicated the sensitivities in this area as well.  There are people who have a certain amount of money.  Then there are people who have a great deal of money, apparently.  I gather the Prada handbags in Brown Thomas are floating out the door and the agents have taken over neighbouring stands previously occupied by Cartier.  However, for the people in the middle and the people who are concerned, worried and upset I believe there is a genuine psychological fear.  There is a palpable fear in the country and people feel it.  They maybe on some form of dry land now but they feel they are getting quite close to a cliff and they can feel an abyss opening up.  We have all felt this type of sensation at some time.  The Government will have to get the reasonable attitude the Minister has been displaying here during the debate out into the public mind to reassure them.  Clearly, he has attempted to protect people who cannot pay.</p><p>I am unsure about all the methods and I do not like post-mortem taxes.  I thought at least if one died one could get away from tax.  The real problem is a psychological problem of terror.  This is a real fear.  It may not be a justifiable or justified fear but people are afraid.  People are afraid they will not have the capital if something happens to the roof.  They must pay €300 in this case but it is a cumulative effect because there are so many demands.  All of us are encountering different demands all the time because of different cuts, nicks, bites and so on.  It is a psychological condition for people who may have the money and who might in most circumstances be prepared to pay but there is a feeling of terror.  The reasonable attitude of the Minister might help to address that.</p></speech>

He has explained the work that must be done with the Revenue in preparation.</p><p>I realise the Minister does not schedule the business here but, unfortunately, there will be a guillotine at 5:30 p.m.  There are several well thought out amendments on each section which we will not get to at this stage.  We have tried to consider the issues as individual Senators, particularly those of us who oppose the imposition of a property tax at this time.  Having said that and knowing the reality that the Bill will come through, we are considering some suggestions.  I am grateful for and I am pleased to hear the Minister's openness to accepting suggestions.  On Second Stage yesterday I commended the Minister on the basis of his willingness to move forward with an exemption for those affected by pyrite.  I have tabled an amendment to section 11, amendment No. 25.  However, I can see no way that we will get to it at this stage.  Work is ongoing in this area but how will that exemption be framed?  Is there a mechanism for I and others who are involved in the pyrite groups?  My area in north Dublin is particularly badly hit.  Is there a way for me to submit to the Department suggestions on how any exemptions should apply?  It will be difficult.  I will finish on this point and I thank the Cathaoirleach for his indulgence.  Many people cannot afford to get the pyrite test.  A pyrite test costs in the region of €2,000.  The material must be sent to England for a proper test to be carried out.  We know there is pyrite in certain estates but will the Department of Finance seek independent, verifiable test results that a given house in a given estate in north Dublin has been affected?  Will the Department then take the view that consequentially the entire estate is affected, or will it deal on the basis of the pyrite report of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, and take the view that the report should determine the group of estates affected?  In the interim, how can we make submissions on this matter in advance of the finance Bill?  My concern generally with the finance Bill is that there are time constraints.  There were 88 amendments tabled for this Bill and it was put through the Dáil in three hours.  The same applies in the Seanad.  I would appreciate even a quick clarification on that point because I do not believe we will get to section 11 at this stage.</p></speech>

The Minister has made a credible argument in favour of why the Bill should be done before the finance Bill.  I also welcome the Minister's receptiveness to any good ideas that might emerge.  However, the problem is that we are on section 2 and there are 157 sections in the Bill.  If we get another two sections done, it is probably as much as we can do.  This means the Bill will not get the scrutiny that it is entitled to get and that the people want us to give it.  The Leader will be guided by the Minister.  We have held good debates in the House on several issues and this is not a Bill that should be rammed through.  There is no reason why we cannot either come back one week earlier or deal with it in the first week of our return in January.  Were the Minister to indicate to the Revenue that he does not intend to accept any amendments but that he may make some changes in the finance Bill, then we could have the Bill done and dusted by the end of January.  I appeal for that to be done.  We owe it to the public.</p></speech>

The Minister mentioned that he may be willing to make an exception.  The Minister stated that adaptations to the houses of people who have disabilities or who live with people with disabilities would likely be in the same bands and that any adaptations would not push such houses into a higher band because of the works.  If works moved the value of the house up one band would the Minister be willing to accept amendments or make an amendment in the finance Bill to exempt such houses from the valuation?</p></speech>

If it costs €2,000 to test each house it would almost be worth the Government's time to set up a special laboratory because it is so expensive.  Is there no joint facility?  We have received varying numbers in respect of how many houses in Dublin are affected and how many in the west of Ireland and so on.  The costs for testing seem outlandish.  One could prospect for gold with that type of money.  I commend the Minister on bringing forward the facility to ensure that pyrite houses are included in the exemptions.  Well done to the Minister.</p></speech>

However, the object of the amendment was to provide revenue for the Exchequer on the basis of the difference in valuations between zoned and unzoned land.  In preparing the finance Bill perhaps the Minister will reflect on the question of how the appreciation of property values of a house surrounded by rezoned land compares to a house on lands that have not been zoned.  Might this be a means of capturing a source of revenue?  That was the purpose of my amendment, although it was probably bungled in the way I phrased it.</p></speech>

The amendment is intended to protect the family home so that people are not compelled to move to different neighbourhoods, thereby losing connection with their schools, friends, churches and GAA clubs.  Forced transfers might have a significant impact on families' well-being and welfare.  It would protect the family home in the event that individuals lose their jobs - unemployment increased from 4% to 14.8% at its peak - or if they face a loss of income in the event of a recession, illness or going out on a pension.  People would not be required to move or sell the family home in order to pay the tax.</p></speech>

A significant number of people in Ireland face serious arrears and negative equity on buy-to-let mortgages.

Many of them were advised by their banking institutions to purchase their properties and were incentivised to do so by successive Governments.  It was suggested that there would not be sufficient provision for pensions for people in this country when they reach old age and that individuals should be putting something by.</p></speech>

However, the object of the amendment was to provide revenue for the Exchequer on the basis of the difference in valuations between zoned and unzoned land.  In preparing the finance Bill perhaps the Minister will reflect on the question of how the appreciation of property values of a house surrounded by rezoned land compares to a house on lands that have not been zoned.  Might this be a means of capturing a source of revenue?  That was the purpose of my amendment, although it was probably bungled in the way I phrased it.</p></speech>

Does the Minister envisage any situation where the family home could be repossessed in the event of non-payment of property tax?  Surely deferral schemes are there to prevent that happening.  Will the Minister clarify whether he envisages the home being repossessed in situations where the property tax has not been paid for some time?  Will that happen, given the family home is one's shelter and part of one's dignity?</p></speech>

The intention is that the amount of local property tax that will apply will be quite small in relation to the value of the house.  In the event of somebody losing his or her job and the family income reducing, the deferral system will kick in and that person can apply for a deferral within the guidelines for deferral.  I do not see any circumstances in which anyone would be forced to sell up and move because of the imposition of this charge.  As I mentioned, according to the Revenue Commissioners, some 90% of homes in the country are now valued at €300,000 or less.</p><p>On the issue of the principal private residence, we could do as suggested if it was not administratively difficult.  What we should have done was to apply the flat rate property tax and the second home tax for the first six months of the year and then introduce the property tax for the second six months of the year.  What we have done is we have abolished the flat rate charge of €100 for the first six months of the year, and the property tax which replaces it only kicks in for the second half of the year.  Therefore, some people with houses of less value will pay less next year than they paid under the flat rate system.</p><p>Due to administrative and Revenue reasons, we decided not to discontinue the second home charge until 2014, so those with second homes will pay the full amount on them for this year.  We felt it was a reasonable approach to let that run for another year rather than for those people to pay the local property tax for six months of the year.  The argument could be made that that is an anomaly, but that is how we decided to do it, for both administrative reasons and reasons of Revenue flow.  The second home tax brings in approximately €70 million.  Our option was whether we should keep that tax for another 12 months or whether we should cut something else.  That is the same kind of argument the Seanad had on the Social Welfare Bill about a cut of €26 million.  By keeping this tax for another year, we bring in €70 million.  One can see how tight things would be if we had to find that amount elsewhere in the budget.  I agree there is an anomaly, but it is not a very significant one.</p><p>In terms of legislation for this, there are provisions in the legal system to collect the second home charge.  Therefore, when we discontinue that charge, we can pick up on it in the Finance Bill for 2014 or on some other suitable occasion and remove it from the system.  The intention is that the flat rate charge will be discontinued from 1 January, the new local property tax will commence on 1 July and the second home charge will continue for 2013, but will be discontinued from 1 January 2014.</p></speech>

The expert group commissioned by the Minister's colleague, Deputy Phil Hogan, argued that this category of housing should not be liable for property tax.  Why is the Minister going against that argument and applying the property tax to local authority housing?  This will have one of two consequences.  It will either result in the local authority having to pick up the tab, thus reducing spending on local services, or the local council will end up passing it on to tenants.  In the first scenario the local community will lose out and in the second, people who do not own their own homes - council tenants - will end up paying the tax.  This makes no sense.  Either the Government should tax people because they own homes or it should not.</p><p>  Given the precarious state of local government funding, it is highly unlikely councils will be able to cover the significant cost of this tax, especially large urban councils with a large number of council tenants on their books.  People who do not own the properties in which they live will end up having to pay.  There is some kind of skewed logic involved.  No other country in the EU or OECD area has such a property tax charge, where people who do not own the property in which they live are, effectively, made pay for it.</p><p>  This argument extends also to housing associations, the not-for-profit bodies that provide social housing to people in our communities with the greatest level of need.  Whether this tax is paid by the housing association or the tenants, it will cause significant hardship for these people.  Many of these people are homeless or have mental health issues.  If the Minister imposes this tax on housing associations, these groups will reduce their spending in other areas, including support services and housing maintenance.  If the tax is applied to the tenants of the housing associations, this will cause financial hardship, increase emotional distress and affect their general overall well-being.  I see no credible argument for the inclusion of these two categories in the Bill and I urge the Minister to support or take these amendments on board.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 18 and 27 are in my name and they make similar proposals to what has been outlined by Senator Reilly.  I mentioned on Second Stage that the Minister has gone against the recommendation of the Thornhill report in this regard.</p><p>On Second Stage, I provided specific figures with regard to Fingal County Council and Dublin City Council.  Based on the number of social housing units they have, a full year cost for Fingal Council based on an average payment of approximately €325 would be approximately €1.6 million and more than €3.5 million for Dublin City Council.  This money must be provided for in the budget passed just this week.  This property tax is being sold as something that will fund local government, which is fine.  However, the issue is that we have a situation where two local Dublin authorities - three if we include Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown - will either have to increase rents for social housing tenants or reduce services.  This is contrary to what the Government has argued this Bill is about.  It says the Bill is about broadening the tax base and funding local services.  I will not labour this point further as I made the same point yesterday.</p><p>There is an issue with regard to the voluntary housing sector, such as organisations like the Iveagh Trust, Clúid and the North and East Housing Association.  The Thornhill report recommended that these associations should be exempt from the tax.  The Minister mentioned on Second Stage that he would look into this area and that his officials were talking to the housing associations.  I welcome that.  Does the Minister envisage addressing this further in the Finance Bill?  Can we take it that there is a commitment or at least a desire on the part of the Government and the Department to deal with the voluntary housing sector?</p><p>Clearly, the Minister is not going to deal with the issue of the charge on local authority housing, which the Thornhill report said was effectively a circular tax.</p> <p>From what has been said already, it appears that 65% of the money raised will go back to local authorities.  The remaining 35% will be retained in the central Government pot.  If Fingal County Council pays €1 million, it will get back €650,000 while the Government retains €350,000.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on that.</p></speech>

There is confusion in this measure as to whether the tax is a property tax or a local services tax.  It is drafted as though it is a tax on the owner of a property rather than the occupier.  If it were a true local services provision, it would be levied on occupiers.  I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator O'Brien and I am interested to hear the Minister's response on how it is intended to deal with this.  It is a significant issue.  One can talk about moving money from one section of a local authority to another and call it a paper transaction, but that does not reflect reality.  In reality, the income will have to be generated.  I sit on the strategic policy committee on housing of Dublin City Council and I am aware of significant rent arrears within the local authority area.  There are similar problems in other local authorities across the State.  It is difficult for me to see how a local authority will generate this income.</p><p>That is one side of the coin.  The other side, which will be even more problematic, involves the voluntary housing associations.  In many instances, voluntary housing associations are already levying service charges on tenants, while local authorities do not.  There are historical reasons for that relating to the Housing Act 1966 and the definition of &quot;deferential rents&quot;.  There is no ability within the voluntary housing sector to levy greater charges on tenants.  Clúid has between 5,500 and 6,000 units and it is impossible to see how the sums in question can be raised.  I ask the Minister to give the matter very serious consideration.  Government policy relies on the voluntary housing sector to provide increased housing stock for the poorest, most vulnerable people.  I would hate to see a measure introduced which had the unintended consequence of completely undermining the voluntary housing association sector.</p></speech>

We have done so in the interests of fairness between different householders.  Those Members who are practising and practical politicians know the situation in private and public housing estates.  In publicly provided estates, when families move to the second generation many buy out the lease.  Tenant purchase has turned tenancies into owner-occupier situations.  It is a great scheme, which I support fully, and it runs to between 80% and 85% on the estates I know best.  I did not want to differentiate between those who have bought out their houses and those next door who are still renting.  Some people would be paying while others were not.  It is an underlying principle of the Bill that everybody makes some contribution, no matter how small.  Those Members who are practising and practical politicians know there is even greater aggravation in private housing estates on which local authorities have acquired houses which they provide to social housing tenants.  I approve of that policy.  For too long, we differentiated between people on the basis of where they lived.  To integrate housing is sound social policy, but I do not want to aggravate those situations which are already difficult by providing that those who bought houses on an estate pay a property tax while a handful of local authority tenants do not.  It is the owner who pays, not the occupier, which means the local authority is liable.  If that leads to a circular payment, it is worth doing in the interest of social harmony.  If a local authority wishes to recover the charge, it is for that body to do so.  The rate will be €1 or €2 per week and it will be for the local authority to raise its rents by that amount.  I am conscious that adjustment of rents is a reserved function of the elected members of local authorities, not the manager.  I am also conscious of the fact that in the real world, local councils will play political games with such decisions.  It is for that reason that the onus will be on a local authority to write a cheque to Revenue on the basis of the quantum of houses it owns.  It will be up to the members to decide.  Some very wealthy local authorities which receive significant sums from the new tax may decide not to pass on the charge to tenants.  Others may have to do so.  It will be a matter for local discretion.  The many Members who know their communities will know exactly what I am talking about.</p><p>I would like to treat those voluntary housing associations which are analogous to local authorities - providing houses to people who could be housed by the latter and pay rent in the same way - in the same way I have outlined in respect of local authorities.  However, the voluntary housing sector provides other categories of accommodation also.  Across rural Ireland, there are schemes provided by communities with grants from the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, including homes for the elderly.  Members will know those clusters of nine to 15 houses with a community centre at their heart.  I wish to exempt those schemes.  Therefore, I wish to distinguish on the basis of tenancy and use between the housing provided by voluntary agencies.  On Second Stage in the Dáil, I discussed refining that approach.  I have an idea of the general outline of the approach to take but I need to think about it between now and the Finance Bill.  I must ensure that what I propose is as focused as I intend.</p></speech>

Recently, I received a briefing on this issue from groups representing the voluntary housing associations.  The Minister said his reasoning was that he wished to ensure an equitable regime.  There are voluntary housing projects and there is accommodation for people with special needs.  I doubt anyone would resent that.  In fact, I took the trouble to welcome it.</p></speech>

I do not know if that is the case, but it is welcome that the Minister has indicated he will look at these matters again.  I will pass on the submission I received in case he has not already been given it.  It may well be that he has.  Voluntary housing associations contribute 14,000 houses to the national supply, which is significant.  Regrettably, 100,000 people are awaiting housing, which is why the associations should be encouraged as much as possible, particularly as they are voluntary.  We should not penalise constructive social efforts.  Therefore, I will pass this information to the Minister and his officials to permit him to take it into account, in case he has not already had access to it.  I appeal to people to make submissions as early as possible to allow us to deal with them efficiently.</p></speech>

I agree completely with the Minister on the need for everyone to contribute something.</p> <p>It may not be palatable to say a voluntary housing group must pay.  I take it properties in County Donegal will probably be at the low end of the €90,000 to €100,000 range.  It is fair that everyone should pay something and if the figure will be only €90 in County Donegal, it will not be an inordinate amount of money.  The Simon Community, Respond! and other groups are always fund-raising and also receive good Government grants.  Even though on the surface this seems to be hammering social housing organisations, at the same time the voluntary housing element of local authorities is very important and has been working very well.  I hope voluntary housing associations will see extra services being provided in their areas to justify the charge of €90 or however much it will be.  I share the sentiments of the Minister.</p></speech>

Is not likely that the local authority will use the proceeds from the property tax it will take in from others to pay this bill?  Will this not just amount to a paper exercise, or does this matter?  I like the point that houses for older people in voluntary housing associations will be exempt.  The Minister has stated he needs to think this out a little further, but presumably he will base it on age.  Will it be above the age of 66 years?</p></speech>

It is also clear that if they provide houses in the same way as a local authority and draw from the same pool of tenants, it is totally analogous to housing provided by local authorities.  However, there are now several hundred voluntary housing organisations, which means there is an area in between these two examples about which I am not clear at this stage and I want to assess it between now and the time the finance Bill is introduced to see what should be in and what should be out.</p></speech>

I take it properties in County Donegal will probably be at the low end of the €90,000 to €100,000 range.  It is fair that everyone should pay something and if the figure will be only €90 in County Donegal, it will not be an inordinate amount of money.  The Simon Community, Respond! and other groups are always fund-raising and also receive good Government grants.  Even though on the surface this seems to be hammering social housing organisations, at the same time the voluntary housing element of local authorities is very important and has been working very well.  I hope voluntary housing associations will see extra services being provided in their areas to justify the charge of €90 or however much it will be.  I share the sentiments of the Minister.</p></speech>

Is not likely that the local authority will use the proceeds from the property tax it will take in from others to pay this bill?  Will this not just amount to a paper exercise, or does this matter?  I like the point that houses for older people in voluntary housing associations will be exempt.  The Minister has stated he needs to think this out a little further, but presumably he will base it on age.  Will it be above the age of 66 years?</p></speech>

It is also clear that if they provide houses in the same way as a local authority and draw from the same pool of tenants, it is totally analogous to housing provided by local authorities.  However, there are now several hundred voluntary housing organisations, which means there is an area in between these two examples about which I am not clear at this stage and I want to assess it between now and the time the finance Bill is introduced to see what should be in and what should be out.</p></speech>

These regulations were introduced in 1996, following a comprehensive review of this area, in response to a series of major difficulties that arose with livestock shipments from Ireland at that time.  Since then, our policy has been that given the potential risks associated with live shipments from Ireland, it is necessary for Ireland to maintain these high standards.  I wish to reassure the House that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, is continuing all its efforts to secure markets abroad for our valuable cattle industry be it in live trade or beef.  Live exports continue to be an important outlet for Irish cattle, providing an essential element of competition with the beef trade.</p></speech>

It is welcome that the ship will be available in January to transport the cattle but what was the delay?  The Minister made the announcement in April that the market was reopening.  Why has it taken so long for the regulations to be put in place in order to make the ship available?  I implore the Minister to ensure there will be no delay in making the ship available in the new year.  This is a vital market for the beef industry.</p></speech>

Some 26,000 pupils are being educated in 55 fee-paying schools in the country.  It was announced in the budget that the pupil-teacher ratio would be increased to 23:1 in fee-paying schools from next September.  This follows on from last year's increase in the pupil-teacher ratio.  It is estimated this measure will save the Department €2 million in 2013 and €6 million in 2014.</p><p>The cost to the State of educating a pupil in a fee-paying school is €4,500 per year while the cost of educating a pupil in a non-fee-paying school is €8,000 per year.  This means a saving to the State of €3,500 per pupil per year.  Many parents, teachers and pupils are concerned about the future of their school should this increase in pupil-teacher ratio continue or if funding were not available.  If even 10% of the 26,000 pupils were to leave the fee-paying schools this year and opt for places in the non-fee paying schools, it is estimated this will cost the State €9 million.  The issue of capacity in the free education system also arises.  The Minister has stated that schools may enter the free education system but pupils will also leave fee-paying schools and look for places in the non-fee-paying schools.  I can foresee the issue of capacity arising in the schools in my own area should the fee-paying schools no longer exist.  I hope it will not get to that point.</p><p>I am articulating the concerns of these schools.  Does the Minister foresee them continuing in existence?  In many cases, parents have opted for a fee-paying school in order to have their children educated in a certain religious ethos.  These parents are taxpayers and this is how they have chosen to spend their after-tax income.  The figures do not bear out the argument that the system is unfair.  In fact, the figures show that the fee-paying schools are saving the State.  At a time when the Minister wants to reduce the departmental budget, it would be a retrograde step to continue to support the fee-paying schools sector.  </p><p>Parents need to have certainty with regard to the future of fee-paying schools when they are considering the long-term educational needs of their children.  It is certain that the increase in the pupil-ratio will result in higher fees.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-12-20a.671" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="16:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012122000043#VV00600"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  It affords me the opportunity to outline to the House the policy of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, on fee-paying schools.</p><p>This Government has protected front-line services in schools to the greatest extent possible in the recent budget.  There will no reduction in teacher numbers in primary schools and in free second level schools for the 2013 to 2014 school year as a result of the recent budget.  The DEIS scheme for disadvantaged schools is also fully protected with no overall changes to staffing levels or funding as a result of the budget.</p><p>The Department's current expenditure budget for 2013 is €8.514 billion.  Savings of some €90 million are needed for next year.  This is made up of €77 million of savings announced under last year's comprehensive expenditure review, together with a further €13 million in order to meet upward pressures mainly associated with the pay costs for teachers and special needs assistants.</p><p>Given that four in every five euro in the gross current budget is spent on pay and pensions, it has not been an easy task to identify the savings of €90 million needed.  However, the Minister for Education and Skills has sought, in so far as possible, to meet the programme for Government commitment to prioritise education and to protect front-line services.</p><p>In order to promote fairness in funding second level schools, a two-point increase in the pupil teacher ratio in fee-charging second level schools will be introduced in September 2013.  There are currently 55 schools out of 723 post- primary schools, charging fees ranging from €2,550 to €10,065 for day pupils.  At present, the State pays the salaries of one teacher for every 21 pupils in these schools compared with one teacher for every 19 pupils in schools in the free education scheme.  A ratio of 18.25 pupils to one teacher, applies in DEIS schools.  This will rise to 23:1 in fee-charging schools.  However, these schools have the resources, through fees charged, to employ teachers privately, an option which is not available to schools in the free education scheme.  A report on the analysis of the tuition income of fee-charging schools carried out by the Department of Education and Skills will be published in the new year.  This report is expected to show that fee-charging schools have considerable discretionary income and are best placed to manage with reduced public funding.</p><p>I am aware of some concerns within the Protestant community on the recent budget measure.  I assure the House that this Government recognises the importance of ensuring that students from a Protestant or Reformed church background can attend a school that reflects their denominational ethos while at the same time ensuring that funding arrangements are in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.</p><p>With regard to the fee-charging Protestant schools, an arrangement exists whereby funding is provided by the Department of Education and Skills to the secondary education committee, SEC, an organisation run by the churches involved in managing the Protestant secondary schools.  This committee disburses funds to the Protestant fee-charging schools on behalf of pupils who would otherwise have difficulty with the cost of fees and who, in the absence of such financial support, would be unable to attend a second level school of a Reformed church or Protestant ethos.  Funding amounts to €6.5 million annually.  This fund ensures that necessitous Protestant children can attend a school of their choice.  I thank the Senator for providing the opportunity to outline the position to the House.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the support to the Protestant schools.  The joint committee has had discussions with those schools.  I refer also to Catholic fee-paying schools who need to be considered because parents chose to send their children to those schools for that specific type of religious education.</p></speech>

Tá mé thar a bheith buíoch go bhfuil sé i láthair ar an lá gnóthach seo chun na ceiste seo a phlé.</p><p>I raise an issue in which many farmers are interested, namely, the Libyan and Egyptian live export market for beef.  In April 2012 the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, issued a statement on the reopening of the Libyan market, in particular, which was valuable for live cattle exports in the past.  In 1995 that market took 81,420 cattle valued at more than €70 million but the business came to an abrupt end in 1996 when Libya banned beef imports because of the outbreak of BSE.  I understand some headway has been made on reopening those markets and that efforts are being made at diplomatic and technical levels but there have been no major announcements in the interim.  This is an important market which would open up many doors and potential streams of income for farmers in the context of the suckler cow welfare scheme cutbacks and also the virtual monopoly where farmers are held to order by the factory system here which is able to keep prices low.  Farmers' incomes would be increased dramatically if they had other markets into which they could sell, such as the Egyptian and Libyan markets.  </p><p>I note that the Irish Farmers Association national livestock chairman, Mr. Henry Burns, said the live cattle market to Libya and other Middle East and north African countries was extremely important for Ireland's €2 billion livestock sector.  If these markets are open, do we have the transport capability to take the livestock from Ireland to these countries? </p></speech>

Ba mhaith liom Nollaig shona a ghuí oraibh go léir.</p><p>I am taking this Adjournment debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney.  I wish to thank the Senator for raising the issue of markets abroad.  The priority of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and its agencies is to support the beef sector through its efforts to open new markets for Irish beef and to ease the conditions of import in markets which are already open.  These efforts have yielded a number of positive results in countries such as South Africa, Tunisia, Russia, United Arab Emirates, Singapore and Egypt in the past year or so.  In this context the Senator will also be aware that market access for beef was at the heart of Minister's visits earlier this year to China and the US, and that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is pro-actively engaged with a range of third countries in an effort to open markets.  That being said, the Department will continue to treat the question of market access, both for beef and for live animals, as a priority.</p><p>We will and are continuing to facilitate live exports, which it is acknowledged, offer cattle price competition, and serve a real market demand.  The live export trade provides alternative market outlets for cattle producers.  There are two main components to the live export trade, namely, calf shipments to the Continent and the movement of forward stores and finished cattle to the UK.  Data for the period from January to date in 2012 shows that overall live exports reached some 155,000 head.</p><p>Exports to Great Britain accounted for 70,094, while those to Italy, the Netherlands and Spain - the main continental markets - stand at 80,770.  While the figures for the UK market represent an increase of 4%, the exports to continental EU countries are down some 40% on 2011.  This is due simply to economic factors.  The slower live export trade reflects the higher prices being paid by domestic beef producers.</p><p>The Senator raises the issue of live cattle to the Libyan and Egyptian markets.  I am pleased to say that these markets are open to Irish cattle insofar as the veterinary certification that is the fundamental prerequisite has been agreed.  The question of when trade will begin is dependent on a number of factors, including commercial factors such as price and demand and the availability and cost of suitable sea transport.  Other non-EU countries open to cattle from Ireland and to which trade is taking place are Kazakhstan, Morocco and Tunisia.</p><p>The Egyptian market is open to fattening cattle under 20 months and to slaughter cattle less than 30 months and I would like to pay tribute to the efforts of Ambassador Moylan in securing this good outcome.</p><p>The Libyan market is currently open to fattening and slaughter male cattle under 24 months.  However, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has been endeavouring to have this age limit increased to 30 months in response to requests from interested exporters, and has submitted a certificate to allow for this for counter signature to the Libyan authorities.  We await final confirmation on this and our diplomatic services in Rome are doing everything they can to expedite the matter.  Our ambassador in Rome met with senior Ministers in Libya earlier this week and raised with them the outstanding responses regarding the health certificates in the cattle sector.  They indicated that they saw no particular difficulty and undertook to respond within a short period.  In terms of promoting trade with Libya they stressed that this was now mainly in private hands and, of course, such trade is always commercial.</p><p>Even though the necessary veterinary certification is in place, there remains the question of suitable sea transport.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has made every effort to facilitate ship approval and the Department is hopeful that a ship will be approved early in the new year.  Three potential boats have been applied for and one application is at a more advanced stage.  The current plan is that the boat, which is currently in Istanbul, will arrive in Waterford for re-inspection on or around mid January.</p><p>Ireland has a strict system of transport rules in respect of both national and international journeys.  </p> <p>The current Irish regulations on the approval of ships for livestock transport set a high standard, higher than that which applies in other EU member states.  These regulations were introduced in 1996, following a comprehensive review of this area, in response to a series of major difficulties that arose with livestock shipments from Ireland at that time.  Since then, our policy has been that given the potential risks associated with live shipments from Ireland, it is necessary for Ireland to maintain these high standards.  I wish to reassure the House that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, is continuing all its efforts to secure markets abroad for our valuable cattle industry be it in live trade or beef.  Live exports continue to be an important outlet for Irish cattle, providing an essential element of competition with the beef trade.</p></speech>

It is welcome that the ship will be available in January to transport the cattle but what was the delay?  The Minister made the announcement in April that the market was reopening.  Why has it taken so long for the regulations to be put in place in order to make the ship available?  I implore the Minister to ensure there will be no delay in making the ship available in the new year.  This is a vital market for the beef industry.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-12-20a.686" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1114" speakername="Deirdre Clune" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012122000045#VV00500"><p>I wish to raise the matter of the Minister's plans for fee-paying schools and their place in the future provision of education. Some 26,000 pupils are being educated in 55 fee-paying schools in the country.  It was announced in the budget that the pupil-teacher ratio would be increased to 23:1 in fee-paying schools from next September.  This follows on from last year's increase in the pupil-teacher ratio.  It is estimated this measure will save the Department €2 million in 2013 and €6 million in 2014.</p><p>The cost to the State of educating a pupil in a fee-paying school is €4,500 per year while the cost of educating a pupil in a non-fee-paying school is €8,000 per year.  This means a saving to the State of €3,500 per pupil per year.  Many parents, teachers and pupils are concerned about the future of their school should this increase in pupil-teacher ratio continue or if funding were not available.  If even 10% of the 26,000 pupils were to leave the fee-paying schools this year and opt for places in the non-fee paying schools, it is estimated this will cost the State €9 million.  The issue of capacity in the free education system also arises.  The Minister has stated that schools may enter the free education system but pupils will also leave fee-paying schools and look for places in the non-fee-paying schools.  I can foresee the issue of capacity arising in the schools in my own area should the fee-paying schools no longer exist.  I hope it will not get to that point.</p><p>I am articulating the concerns of these schools.  Does the Minister foresee them continuing in existence?  In many cases, parents have opted for a fee-paying school in order to have their children educated in a certain religious ethos.  These parents are taxpayers and this is how they have chosen to spend their after-tax income.  The figures do not bear out the argument that the system is unfair.  In fact, the figures show that the fee-paying schools are saving the State.  At a time when the Minister wants to reduce the departmental budget, it would be a retrograde step to continue to support the fee-paying schools sector.  </p><p>Parents need to have certainty with regard to the future of fee-paying schools when they are considering the long-term educational needs of their children.  It is certain that the increase in the pupil-ratio will result in higher fees.  </p></speech>

It affords me the opportunity to outline to the House the policy of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, on fee-paying schools.</p><p>This Government has protected front-line services in schools to the greatest extent possible in the recent budget.  There will no reduction in teacher numbers in primary schools and in free second level schools for the 2013 to 2014 school year as a result of the recent budget.  The DEIS scheme for disadvantaged schools is also fully protected with no overall changes to staffing levels or funding as a result of the budget.</p><p>The Department's current expenditure budget for 2013 is €8.514 billion.  Savings of some €90 million are needed for next year.  This is made up of €77 million of savings announced under last year's comprehensive expenditure review, together with a further €13 million in order to meet upward pressures mainly associated with the pay costs for teachers and special needs assistants.</p><p>Given that four in every five euro in the gross current budget is spent on pay and pensions, it has not been an easy task to identify the savings of €90 million needed.  However, the Minister for Education and Skills has sought, in so far as possible, to meet the programme for Government commitment to prioritise education and to protect front-line services.</p><p>In order to promote fairness in funding second level schools, a two-point increase in the pupil teacher ratio in fee-charging second level schools will be introduced in September 2013.  There are currently 55 schools out of 723 post- primary schools, charging fees ranging from €2,550 to €10,065 for day pupils.  At present, the State pays the salaries of one teacher for every 21 pupils in these schools compared with one teacher for every 19 pupils in schools in the free education scheme.  A ratio of 18.25 pupils to one teacher, applies in DEIS schools.  This will rise to 23:1 in fee-charging schools.  However, these schools have the resources, through fees charged, to employ teachers privately, an option which is not available to schools in the free education scheme.  A report on the analysis of the tuition income of fee-charging schools carried out by the Department of Education and Skills will be published in the new year.  This report is expected to show that fee-charging schools have considerable discretionary income and are best placed to manage with reduced public funding.</p><p>I am aware of some concerns within the Protestant community on the recent budget measure.  I assure the House that this Government recognises the importance of ensuring that students from a Protestant or Reformed church background can attend a school that reflects their denominational ethos while at the same time ensuring that funding arrangements are in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.</p><p>With regard to the fee-charging Protestant schools, an arrangement exists whereby funding is provided by the Department of Education and Skills to the secondary education committee, SEC, an organisation run by the churches involved in managing the Protestant secondary schools.  This committee disburses funds to the Protestant fee-charging schools on behalf of pupils who would otherwise have difficulty with the cost of fees and who, in the absence of such financial support, would be unable to attend a second level school of a Reformed church or Protestant ethos.  Funding amounts to €6.5 million annually.  This fund ensures that necessitous Protestant children can attend a school of their choice.  I thank the Senator for providing the opportunity to outline the position to the House.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the support to the Protestant schools.  The joint committee has had discussions with those schools.  I refer also to Catholic fee-paying schools who need to be considered because parents chose to send their children to those schools for that specific type of religious education.</p></speech>
