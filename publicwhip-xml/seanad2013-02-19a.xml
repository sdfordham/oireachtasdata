I proposed an amendment to the Order of Business to the effect that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, come into the House to make a statement on the basis that he had lost the confidence of rank and file gardaí, the GRA and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors.  This is a very serious issue.  It is unprecedented that the Garda representative associations would pass motions of no confidence in the Minister.  Yesterday in the basketball stadium in Tallaght over 4,500 public service workers, predominantly front-line workers, let the Government know what they felt about its disproportionate attack on front-line services.  I would like the Minister to come here to explain what he proposes to do now that he has lost the confidence of An Garda Síochána.  We used our Private Members' time to discuss this issue.  Policing is at crisis point and I stand over what I said last week, that within a week or two there will be industrial action, about which there is no question in my mind and as gardaí have stated already.  They deserve respect for the job they do, but they are not receiving due respect from the Minister.  Members on the Government side may disagree that this is a very serious issue.  However, I am putting forward the view of normal gardaí all over the country, which has been reinforced by the votes of rank and file gardaí in every county who have said they have no confidence in the Minister.  I am again proposing an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister come into the House to explain how he intends to rectify the fact that he has lost the confidence of rank and file gardaí.</p><p>Last week Senator Jillian van Turnhout said the Mangan report should be debated urgently.</p> <p>What angers me is that we have had a budget and Social Welfare Bill, with the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, indicating that we would have a debate.  I welcomed that and we should consider the options.  She has had the report since last March and it is only going to the Cabinet today.</p><p>I sat in this Chamber for hours debating the Social Welfare Bill with the Minister and I did the same with the budget but she has had the bloody report for almost 12 months.  It has not even come to the House for debate.  It is outrageous-----</p></speech>

I welcome the fact that we will, in early course, have a debate on the findings of the Magdalen report from former Senator, Dr. Martin McAleese.  We might have the debate next week and it is very important we have it soon, given the amount of public interest and long delay experienced by the survivors of the Magdalen laundries in seeking justice.  We all anticipate the Dáil debate this evening and the Taoiseach's words in particular, as we anticipate that an apology will be given, as the report found a level of State involvement.  The report indicates that the State was directly engaged in over a quarter of referrals to the laundries.  That alone requires State acknowledgement and an apology, and we look forward to that.  I know many colleagues and I will be partaking in the vigil at 5 p.m. outside Leinster House in supporting the survivors.</p></speech>

I hope we will debate the issue at the earliest opportunity, and I hope that today is day one of justice.  When we have the debate I ask for appropriate time to scrutinise any proposed redress scheme; there should not just be reflection of the past but also consideration of how to restore into the future.</p><p>I welcome the publication yesterday by the Children's Rights Alliance of its report card for 2013, which is a really comprehensive report on the Government's promises to children.  Overall, the Government got a C grade, and I will refer to Senator O'Brien's comments with regard to child poverty.  I do not know if it is &quot;the&quot; Mangan report but the first report of the Mangan group was put online today, and it is dated March 2012.  I would like to see clarification on the report and its content.  I am concerned by the leaks we read over the weekend.  As a legislator, I cannot believe I must speak about leaks of a report.  We have had debates on the Social Welfare Bill and we have been asked to act responsibly but we have not been provided with the relevant information.</p><p>In the Children's Rights Alliance report and relevant to child poverty, the Department of Social Protection got an F grade.  Rarely does the Children's Rights Alliance hand out an F grade.  We have seen increasing child poverty figures in Ireland and if child poverty is left unaddressed, the issue can continue into a person's teenage years and cause significant life poverty risk.</p> <p>Reading the reports at the weekend on whether we should means-test or tax child benefit, as well as what the Mangan report would come out with, it felt like it was Groundhog Day.  It was first mooted in April 2009 by the then Minister, the late Brian Lenihan, that we should examine this issue and I recall when debating it that I used the same speaking points that I am using now.  I have not had to change them.  The debate should be moving on.  I ask for a debate on the matter in this House.</p><p>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice and Equality for clarity on when the family leave Bill will be published and the consultation process on it with the social partners is envisaged?  As the EU parental leave directive needs to be transposed into law by March 2013, the clock is ticking.  I know the Bill is on the legislative list, but when will it be published in order that we can uphold our obligations?</p></speech>

I am amazed, however, to hear that this appears to be the approach Galway County Council may take with home owners who have homes and residential units on which development levies should have been paid but were not collected by the local authority.  It is proposed to target these home owners with bills of up to &#8364;5,000 each.  This seems to be an unjust state of affairs.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government should attend the House to discuss why &#8364;800 million is owed to county councils nationwide in unpaid levies.  It appears some developers, having gone bust in some cases, did not pay the levies connected with their being granted planning permission in the first place.  It also appears that it is proposed in some quarters to target the home owners in such developments.  People in a number of housing estates in the Wicklow area have been hit with bills of up to &#8364;2,270.  In Donegal, by the end of last year, the council was owed &#8364;4.7 million in unpaid levies.</p><p>  Another principle comes into play, that of Equity's Darling.  The bona fide purchaser for value without notice is always seen as the one which equity protects.  It will be inequitable if councils which failed to collect levies when they should have done now turn on home owners.  There also may be issues about the way solicitors behaved in signing over ownership of the homes to the buyers.</p><p>  Frankly, this is not a bill ordinary people can afford to pay and the State must take an interest in the matter.  County and city councils may well have been dilatory or even negligent.  I would like the Minister to come to the House to discuss the Government's attitude to this issue.  Will the Government side with home owners or let them be targeted by local authorities in a way that would be extremely unfair?</p></speech>

I know constitutional change through a referendum is required to effect any change to the courts system.  However, it is an issue that needs to be examined, as justice delayed is justice denied.  The Supreme Court acts like a kitchen sink in that all appeals go through it.  Some kind of interim court or a filtration system in the Courts Service should be considered.  Will the Leader arrange a debate on the courts system with the Minister for Justice and Equality?</p><p>I acknowledge the vital contribution to the arts that many of our cultural institutions make.  Last weekend I attended a performance by Lyric Opera Productions and was blown away by the depth of talent.  The one point that resonated with me was that practically all of the talent was Irish.  In conversations afterwards I discovered, however, that it was not always the case.  I speak about buying Irish generally.  When it comes to operatic talent, I acknowledge the hard work done by Lyric Opera Productions in getting Irish artists working abroad to come home for such events.  We must encourage this more.</p> <p> Finally, although it is not a point of order, could the Leader provide briefing material for the public consultation committees that will take place on Thursday?  We would appreciate having it beforehand.</p></speech>

It is a very important issue because of the vote of no confidence.  The Leader of the House, Senator O'Sullivan and I have been nominated by the Garda Representative Association, GRA, and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, AGSI, which are both tolerant groups and powerful organisations.  When they voted no confidence in the Minister it became serious indeed.  Therefore, the Minister should come to the House.</p><p>Will the Leader of the House arrange for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, to come to the House to give us an outline of the present state of play with regard to the recent controversies?  I particularly resent the comments by the chief executive of the retailer Iceland about the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, which was the first organisation to highlight the difficulties and the crisis within the industry due to the entry of horsemeat into the system.  The authority was courageous in highlighting this issue, which is now a European and international issue and one in which the Garda Síochána is involved.  I know from farmers in my area and as someone coming from an organic farm that the standards required of primary producers by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are stringent.  These farmers feel let down by organisations that have not respected the quality of food from the farm gate to the fork.  We will have to restore that respect again throughout the world, but the Food Safety Authority of Ireland should be credited.  I believe the Minister should come to the House to give us a full outline of exactly what is happening at this point.  It would be worthwhile from the point of view of contributions from very enlightened Members.</p></speech>

The authority has worked hard and has made a great breakthrough in what has become a worldwide crisis relating to the food we eat, especially processed food.  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland has led the way and behaved in a calm and co-ordinated fashion.  It never jumped up and down but has simply kept on doing the hard work and doing it well.  We owe the authority a debt of gratitude - these are not words I use lightly or often.  Those who choose to shoot the messenger should perhaps look to themselves in the first instance.</p><p>I know the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is busy and that this matter is taking up his time.  However, given the stories and rumours I am hearing behind the scenes with regard to Ireland's involvement in the scandal of horsemeat in processed food, I would very much appreciate it if the Minister came to the House.  We should reiterate our request to have him here given the even more serious nature of the crisis now as it extends beyond Europe.</p></speech>

Previously, no such records were kept, and we are indebted to the organisation for monitoring this situation.  Last spring on Tramore beach a considerable number of seals were found suffering from gunshot wounds.  The animals were investigated by local veterinary surgeons and the seals had to be euthanised on what is actually a Blue Flag beach.  It is both remarkable and sad.  One of the seals had its flippers tied together and several others were decapitated.  These animals are protected, as are all marine mammals, under Irish and European Law.  The Irish Seal Sanctuary wrote to several Ministers - namely, Deputy Coveney, Deputy Deenihan and Deputy Hogan, and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd - but the net result was that the letter was passed around from Department to Department and absolutely nothing was done.  I understand that veterinary surgeons in Scotland and in Cornwall in England have taken an interest in this and we may well be not only reported to the European Commission but brought before the European Court of Justice.</p> <p>It would be helpful if the Leader would communicate this situation to the Minister he deems responsible for this area.</p><p>I support the call for an informed debate on the Magdalen laundries report.  We rushed to congratulate the authors of this report but now we are beginning to see a more complex picture.  It is regrettable that people are attempting to displace the blame.  Attempts are also being made to divide the former inmates of these institutions.  That is particularly nasty.  We hear about infanticide and single mothers.  All of these women were placed in a terrible situation by their society.  We also hear about families.  I reject the idea that families should be blamed.  If we listen to their evidence, parents were on many occasions approached by priests and nuns who said they would arrange for an education to be provided.  They received no education.  They were enslaved and there is a duty on all of us in Parliament to attempt to redress this wrong.  It is not just a question of an apology.  Laws were consciously broken and we need proper independent assessment and restitution.</p></speech>

I hope we bring finality and that justice will be done in a way that is meaningful and fitting for the servitude in which these women, girls and children were placed for decades.  I thank the Leader and the Seanad Public Consultation Committee for arranging the public consultation that will take place on Thursday.  I encourage all Members to attend that session.  Several months ago I made a request to the Leader that Ashoka, Change Nation and Social Entrepreneurs Ireland be invited to appear before the committee.  Senators Quinn and Mac Conghail supported my request.  This Thursday an array of solutions will be put before us by social entrepreneurs from all over the world who are making a difference to the quality of life of citizens.  We will hear solutions in health, education, civic participation and enterprise.  I met these individuals in Farmleigh when they were here last spring and I was so impressed that I decided we must hear from them in this Chamber.  We are the decision makers and the influencers who can make a difference.  I believe Members will be as impressed as I was and, if they can spare an hour on Thursday afternoon, I strongly encourage them to attend the session.</p><p>I have come to the conclusion that it is time for training about online behaviour to be made obligatory at primary and secondary level.  I was alarmed to learn while listening to Newstalk this afternoon that parents are signing up children as young as seven and eight years of age to Facebook.  This is incredible behaviour.  Some  of our youngsters are doing what is known as sexting, which means they are texting sexual images of themselves.</p></speech>

Several Senators asked specifically for a debate on youth unemployment and the Leader has facilitated a number of debates on jobs.  In that context I welcome the report published today by the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation which focuses on youth and long-term unemployment and makes 30 clear recommendations on what the Government and State agencies could do to tackle the high level of youth unemployment that obtains in this State.</p> <p> I am undertaking work for the same committee to develop a jobs action plan for the south east, which has one of the highest unemployment levels in the State currently.  In Waterford city we have 25% unemployment and 35% youth unemployment.  Figures presented to us recently indicate that 48% of young people in Waterford city do not even finish second level education.  These are startling figures and they will only be tackled and resolved if we put the resources behind the kind of policies that have been agreed at all-party level by the joint Oireachtas committee.  It is incumbent on all of us to put our collective weight behind these proposals.</p><p>Perhaps the Leader will, rather than provide for a debate in a vacuum, facilitate a debate on youth unemployment in this House in the context of the all-party joint Oireachtas committee report that has been agreed and published.  Is that something the Leader will agree to do in the next couple of weeks?</p></speech>

I would rather propose that Deputy Micheál Martin come to the Chamber and explain to the nation why he did nothing for 14 years in this regard.  This was reflected by a representative of the Magdalen laundries, Sally Mulready, who said Micheál Martin should hang his head in shame for the lack of action taken by him when in government.  Many of these women are now elderly, but at no stage during the last Administration were they given any hope.  They were shunned by it.  Therefore, for Deputy Martin to ask for an apology from the Government smacks of where the Fianna Fáil Party has got itself in the opinion polls.  Anything Fianna Fáil says now is based on an opinion poll, not on the welfare of the women.</p></speech>

I also call for a debate on the issue of front-line service providers, including emergency crews in the ambulance and fire brigade services, the Garda Síochána, paramedics, nurses and doctors.  What we saw last night is only the tip of the iceberg with regard to what is coming down the line.  The Government has failed to realise that it cannot renegotiate the Croke Park agreement until it tackles the mortgage issue, because when we start cutting the pay of gardaí, nurses and paramedics, their ability to pay their mortgages decreases and they become stretched to the limit.  Like many people around the country, they will end up in arrears.  Some 30% of mortgages have already either been restructured or are in arrears.  By cutting these people's pay and changing their terms and conditions of employment, the Government will force gardaí, nurses, doctors, paramedics, ambulance drivers and those in the fire brigade service to default on their loans.  If the Government had put in place a structure whereby people in mortgage difficulty could extend the terms of their loans or renegotiate them, perhaps it could have tackled the Croke Park agreement.</p> <p>As it has not tackled the mortgage crisis, it cannot turn around now and start renegotiating the Croke Park agreement.  If it does so, thousands of additional people will no longer be able to pay their mortgages.  We do not want gardaí to be unable to pay their mortgages.  I have referred previously to the root of this problem.  President Clinton told the Government over 12 months ago that it needed to tackle the mortgage issue.  It is the root cause of many of our problems, including the decrease in private sector spending and the difficulties in renegotiating the Croke Park agreement.  I have heard Senators on the other side of the House asking the banks to do something.  The banks will do nothing other than create profit for themselves and their shareholders.  It is the Government's responsibility to put legislation and structures in place to ensure the banks negotiate with people.  That is necessary if people are to be able to spend money in the economy, put fuel in their oil tanks, pay their mortgages and put food on their tables.  We are seeing activity from the Government but no action.</p></speech>

In the past, rogue builders used to leave the landscaping and lighting of estates unfinished.  Rather late in the day, the councils introduced a bonding system whereby developers have to pay a bond so that the work can be finished willy-nilly if they go away.  County councils have been somewhat tardy in collecting these development levies, which should have been front-loaded.  I do not believe individual householders should be given bills of more than €5,000 or €6,000, as has been speculated in the media.  I ask the Leader to bring this to the attention of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government as a matter of urgency.</p><p>I would also like the Leader to ask the Minister, Deputy Hogan, to clarify the exact position regarding the constituencies that will be used in next year's European Parliament elections.  A report published some time ago recommended that no changes should be made.  Some changes have taken place away from home since then.  Eastern European countries like Croatia will be entitled to additional seats.  That could have an impact on the configuration of the constituencies in Ireland.  I am calling on the Leader to ask the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to clarify the position.  Perhaps a revised report can be published at the same time as the report on the local electoral areas, which we hope is due imminently.</p></speech>

Subsequently, the Sunday newspapers published interviews with the heavy hitters in the Irish wind energy sector.  They claimed that living close to wind turbines, which have increased in size from 54 m initially to 100 m and then to 120 m, does not have any ramifications.  They are now 185 m high and turbines that are 350 m high are being developed.</p> <p>On "Prime Time" last week, Mr. Eddie O'Connor said that he and the Finnish President were beside a wind turbine and they could not hear it.  I want to put on the record of this House a real-life story that happened last week.  A distraught couple from County Roscommon gave up the fight to live beside two wind turbines and left their home last Thursday with no intention of going back to it because of the ill effects this has had on them.  That is the sad reality of what wind turbines are doing.  Instead of that, what we hear from the likes of Mr. Eddie O'Connor is "Take the turbines and we will give you swimming pools".  We do not want swimming pools.  All people want is to live in peace and tranquility in their own homes.  They are being deprived of a human right.  I ask the Leader to fast-track any debate with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in regard to wind energy.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-19a.82" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1165" speakername="Eamonn Coghlan" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013021900010#J00500"><p>Most times when we stand up to speak in the Seanad, we speak about areas that are of interest to us.  We speak about causes that we want to support or defend, whether it is the Magdalen laundries, industrial disputes, bank bailouts, mortgage arrears, homelessness, health, cyber-bullying, suicide or unemployment.  Generally, they are bad news stories where we want to help.  However, I have a good news story I want to bring to the Seanad today, one that brings a lot of positivity.  It is in an area that is very close to me, namely, the opening of the Athlone Institute of Technology's indoor arena last weekend by An Taoiseach.</p><p>Whether people are young, old or in-between, like most of us here, they would certainly be highly inspired when they walk in the door of the arena.  To see the smile on the young people's faces, to see the awe in the eyes of the older people and to see how inspired people are is quite moving.  As they walk in there, it exudes everything in life.  I would like to offer my congratulations to Professor Ciarán Ó Catháin of Athlone Institute of Technology for his leadership, his entrepreneurial skills and his ability to deliver something that we have been trying to deliver here in Ireland for the past 40 years. </p><p>I note the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport contributed to the tune of €750,000 towards this almost €13 million project.  This is not just about sports; it is all about the community and tourism in the area.  It is amazing to see the shops, restaurants and hotels which will improve their incomes over the coming years.  I want to point out that Dublin is the only capital city in the world, perhaps, not to have an international indoor arena and, again, this is not just for sports.</p><p>I call on the Leader to communicate with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, and the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, and perhaps all of the other Departments, because while in the past they said they would look at this idea, I would like them to now commit to it for the very near future.  In the next round of sports grants, it is very important that we would follow suit and deliver something similar to what Professor Ciarán Ó Catháin has delivered so, when we look towards Abbottstown, we are looking to deal with physical fitness, literacy, health, tourism and the well-being an arena like that will deliver to the people of Ireland and this capital city.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-19a.83" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1126" speakername="Jim Walsh" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013021900010#J00600"><p>Like other Senators, I want to make reference to the negotiations on a replacement for the Croke Park agreement.  It strikes me that a couple of the building blocks are missing.</p> <p>I encourage the Minister to take action to address the significant cost of the public service.  As someone who worked in management for most of my life and often negotiated with unions, it strikes me that if one does not put in place the background reasons, one finds it much more difficult to achieve the necessary objective.  There should have been an announcement regarding the benchmarking of various positions across the public service, including front-line services, with their counterparts in other jurisdictions, particularly those in western Europe.  That would enlighten and assist the negotiations.  I am sure the Department has all that information.  I know the late Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan, embarked on that in 2010.</p><p>There has been much comment from many people within the public service who are struggling, and are probably in negative equity, about the difficulty they have in trying to make ends meet.  This needs to be recognised.  I agree fully with Senator Daly that addressing the mortgage crisis is a real priority.  It is a sad reflection on these Houses, the Government and officials in the relevant Departments that we are still talking about it five years down the line.  We put an insolvency Bill through this House, but we still do not have the architecture necessary to give effect to and implement its various component parts.  Until we deal with that, it will be very difficult to advance negotiations in these areas.  It would be very wrong if it became the stumbling block because, obviously, a proportion of public servants are caught in that but many are not.  We cannot pass on the significant costs of public administration to future generations.  If we are to correct the significant deficit we have, we need to look at it in a much more enlightened, energetic and focused way.</p></speech>

I rarely find myself disagreeing with Senator Norris but I am afraid I must partly disagree with him on this point.  I accept that there were many instances in which families gave up members to the laundries in the hope that they would receive an education and achieve betterment.  We must face up to the reality that we used both State and other institutions to house those who were considered undesirable or were simply unwanted.  I am talking about prisons, county homes, institutional schools and places such as the Magdalen laundries.  We had no official statistics on homelessness in this country before the 1980s.  This was because those who were homeless were considered vagrants and were housed in prisons or county homes.  Giving a full apology and granting full redress to the residents of the Magdalen laundries is, for our society, a step on the way to acknowledging the role we played in shelving our responsibility towards those others in our society.</p><p>I wish to raise one issue with the Leader.  It relates to the destruction of records in Government Departments, particularly those in the Department of Education and Skills, which has had such a detrimental effect on the lives of people and stood in the way of their having basic knowledge about their past and their lives and being able to seek redress.  When we have the debate on the Magdalen laundries, perhaps we could consider that important issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-19a.86" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1145" speakername="Feargal Quinn" time="15:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013021900011#K00300"><p>I ask that the Leader find time to debate the recent Health Protection Surveillance Centre report, which is frightening.  Surveys are done all around Europe, and although there are no accurate statistics for Ireland, it is suggested that between ten and 20 people die each week from hospital-acquired infections, primarily MRSA.  This adds up to hundreds each year.</p> <p>One of the problems is that it is possible to open a private hospital without a licence and there being a guarantee that such a facility will be inspected.  I was unaware that this was the case.  People need licences for their dogs and televisions sets and in order that they might drive their cars.  It is horrific, therefore, that one does not require a licence to open and operate a hospital.  If the figures to which I refer are correct - those who produced them do not claim they are accurate - it appears that between ten and 20 people die each week from the diseases in question.  This means that hundreds are dying each year.  The report also suggests 31% of all doctors do not wash their hands when they are visiting hospitals.  I do not know whether this information has been thrown out in order to encourage discussion.  However, the matter is worthy of debate and the Minister of Health should be invited to come before the House in order to assist Members in their deliberations on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-19a.88" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1118" speakername="Michael Mullins" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013021900012#L00200"><p>I agree with a great deal of what Senator Jim Walsh stated about benchmarking in the public service and the need to examine the salaries, rates of pay and allowances of everyone in the service, from politicians right down.  The country is seriously broken and there is a massive deficit between income and expenditure.  Unless we bite the bullet now, we will be obliged to grapple with this problem for many decades.  I was alarmed by a report in one of this morning's newspapers on the operation of a supplementary payroll system at Tallaght Hospital between 2005 and 2010.  Under the system in question, huge salary top-ups were given to various individuals who worked at the hospital.  They ranged from €25,000 to €249,000 in the five year period in question.  One individual's salary of €802,000 was topped up by €225,000.  There is no documentation available by means of which it might be possible to explain the rationale for these payments.  That is the broken system the Government is trying to fix.  There is a need for calm among public service and other unions as we try to come to terms with the country's appalling financial situation.  If the case to which I refer is an example of what happened during the Celtic tiger era, heaven knows what else is hiding underneath the surface about which we do not yet know.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-19a.89" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1115" speakername="Labhrás Ó Murchú" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013021900012#L00300"><p>Will the Leader consider arranging an early debate on Northern Ireland?  Such a debate would be both timely and helpful.  All decent people on the island welcome the progress made and changes for the better which have emanated from the Good Friday Agreement.  I would go so far as to say that, from a global point of view, the agreement is probably unique in the context of conflict resolution.  At same time, however, it requires constant attention and nurturing.  We need to identify areas in which difficulties might arise in the future.  The prisoner issue is one which requires attention.</p><p>I was a member of an all-party delegation which visited some of the prisoners in question last week.  Any fair-minded person who hears what some of the prisoners told us during our visit would immediately be able to identify the fact that a number of human rights issues arise and that there is a lack of due process.  One of the high profile prisoners we visited - she is being held at a psychiatric hospital - is Ms Marion Price.  She is extremely frail and confined to bed and it is quite evident that she does not pose a threat to anyone.  There is an underlying and important issue at stake, as Ms Price received a royal pardon.  That fact is not denied, but the British Administration has indicated that the pardon has been lost, which is very difficult to understand.  If there had been a pardon, Ms Price could not have been arrested in the manner in which she was because she is not a political activist in any sense of the word.  For this reason, we must ensure action is taken in respect of her.</p> <p>Her case is coming up for review in a couple of weeks time, but the review process is very flawed.  She cannot have her own legal representative, but must use the legal representative supplied to her.  She will not be made aware in advance of the evidence that will be presented against her.  The hearing is private and held in secret.  I think anybody would agree that has an echo with other parts of the world down through the decades.  It is not typical of a civilised society.  My hope is that Marian Price will be released.  If she is not released - given her background there is a very serious danger that she may make a decision to go down a road of protest, which we do not want to have again and would not be helpful.</p><p>I hope we might have a debate in the manner in which I have outlined.  I accept we have progress and our commitment to the British-Irish Agreement and the peace process.</p></speech>

Morale is at a very low ebb, not alone do the Garda not have the resources to carry out their jobs to the best of their ability, they are looking at pay and conditions being cut.  This is not acceptable.  I join our Leader in calling for the Minister, Deputy Shatter to come into this House to answer our questions.</p><p>May I request the Leader to communicate with the Minister for Finance?  I understand that the Revenue Commissioners have been unable to process rebates that were due to PAYE workers for the past five weeks due to a difficulty with the computer system.  As we are to task the Revenue Commissioners with the complicated matter of setting the property tax, could the Minister ascertain the difficulty in sending out rebates to PAYE workers, whom Revenue notified of their entitlement before Christmas?  They were looking forward to receiving the rebate and in many cases they are depending on it.</p></speech>

This is a very important issue that needs to be considered.  There was a proposal to have a court of civil appeal.  We already have a court of Criminal Appeal, which has worked very effectively.</p><p>The reason it is important to deal with this issue in the Supreme Court relates to the area of family law, where there is substantial delay.</p> <p>In fairness to the Courts Service, it is doing everything possible to try to prioritise issues and cases.  However, the delays are causing considerable problems.  This needs to be dealt with at a very early date.  If we need a constitutional amendment to create a court of civil appeal, we should make it.  The last thing we need is a three or four year delay between dealing with a case in the High Court and its admission to the Supreme Court.  This issue needs to be tackled with as much urgency as possible.</p><p>A large number of cases in the Supreme Court involve lay litigants, which is causing problems.  I have no difficulty with lay litigants – people acting for themselves – but the procedure is not straightforward, thereby causing complications.  People may not fully understand the procedure involved.  We need to consider this issue if we are setting up a court of civil appeal with a view to having cases dealt with at an early date, rather than having prolonged delays in dealing with them.  I ask that the Minister for Justice and Equality take on board the comments being made.</p></speech>

Section 7(4)(<i>b</i>) relates to &quot;different circumstances&quot;.  The request is that these be specified.  Is it too broad a power?  We may have asked if this could be considered on Report Stage.  The notion is rather broad; everything happens in different circumstances.</p><p>  Section 7(4)(<i>c</i>) mentions &quot;different areas of the State&quot;.  I feel stronger about pressing this deletion because we abolished different areas of the State for the taxi sector.  The entire country was deregulated, mostly due to the decision of Mr. Justice Roderick Murphy, but it was upheld in three other High Court decisions emanating from Mr. Justice Paul Carney, who did the judicial review of the Murphy decision, Mr. Justice Hugh Geoghegan and Mr. Justice Declan Costello.  I am unsure why we are trying to reintroduce area licensing.  The courts deregulated the sector for the entire country and the section seems to contradict that decision.  The decision of Mr. Justice Roderick Murphy meant that people have the right to enter a sector for which they have the skills and training and that the public has a right to the services of such people.  There were two addendums to the judgment: first, that the idea of restricting entry contradicted the notion of public service; and second, a warning that most of the people in the then system, on the inside of an insider-outsider system, were citizens of this State, while in a single European market most of the people outside were probably not Irish and in this way we were probably contravening European law in persisting with the previous system, under which the issuing of licences was confined to incumbents, with a minuscule number for others.</p> <p>Entry to the sector nationally was opened up by that decision.  I am informed by the legal people whom I consult on occasion that it is not permissible to introduce in a Bill something that is at variance with or seeks to contradict a court ruling.</p><p>It was pointed out in our last discussion that some parts of the country are perceived to have a shortage of taxis on the open market.  The entire country has seen a large increase in the number of taxis since the courts opened the market for us.  The increase in taxi numbers outside Dublin was larger than within the city.  I tried to relate the current stock of small public vehicles in the province of Leinster to the population figures recorded in the latest census.  They do not seem to follow any particular pattern.  I do not know what problem this is supposed to address.  The results differ for counties Carlow, Laois and Kilkenny but a taxi can easily travel between these counties.</p><p>I do not see the point of this section and my legal advice is that it will contravene what the courts decided when they opened the entire country to the market.  I do not see any flaw in the working out of that decision and I do not understand how restricting the numbers or confining them to particular geographic locations agrees with the decision of the High Court.  We are compelled to avoid a situation where, due to mistakes made between the late 1970s and 2000, pieces of paper called taxi licences acquired values of €100,000 or more because we did not issue enough of them.  All of the partial deregulation schemes proved to be far less radical than what actually happened in the market and I look askance at any attempt to unpick a decision of the High Court backed by three other decisions.  What is the point of area licensing and does it contradict the aforementioned decisions?</p></speech>

They will tie in with future legislation that the Minister of State may propose in regard to all aspects of rural transport.  One licence may not fit all of Ireland.  Rural Ireland stacks up very differently against urban Ireland and this will give the Minister of State flexibility if, for example, he needs to introduce regulations to provide hackney licences to publicans who transport people home.  I ask Senator Barrett to reconsider his amendment.</p></speech>

Paragraph (<i>b</i>) enables the NTA to make regulations, if needed, to deal with items such as drivers operating in the voluntary sector or other such circumstances.  Paragraph (<i>c</i>) enables the NTA to make regulations for the area of restrictions that currently exist with regard to standing or plying for hire.</p><p>  A number of Senators spoke on this when we met to discuss this previously, so I am trying to remember and cover some of their comments.  Many Senators are correct that this flexibility is required for a number of reasons.  One of those reasons is that we are looking at provisions relating to different hackney licenses for rural Ireland.  This provision will allow that flexibility.  I am aware there is market failure in some parts of the country.  Where I come from, in Tipperary, there are virtually no taxis.  We need to look at what licensing arrangements we can make so that we can deal with the social issues that exist as a result of isolation and the lack of transport facilities that can be availed of by people living in urban areas.  This is a legitimate and worthwhile move and people will appreciate it.  This is the reason we need this flexibility.</p><p>  A number of Senators have raised the issue of the areas to which taxi licences apply.  There is an issue in this regard, and I note Senator Barrett has figures on this.  We must take into consideration the conurbations that exist in Ireland and whether they are part of the greater Dublin area, Cork, or another area.  Many people operating in Dublin do not live in Dublin.  Probably we need some filtration done on the figures.  We also need flexibility when it comes to distinguishing between limousines, taxis, hackneys and so on.</p><p>  The Senator should appreciate the spirit of the legislation.  From an area point of view, we need to ensure those driving taxis are knowledgeable about the area in which they operate.  That is the reason we need different licensing for different areas.  If somebody drives a taxi in Tipperary, Cork or Dublin, that driver must know how to get the passenger to his destination.  A sat-nav system does not always do the business.  I am always worried when I get into a taxi and the taxi driver is relying on the sat-nav to get me to my destination.  I had an experience in Dublin a few months ago in which I got into three taxis, one after the other, but the drivers did not know where I wanted to go.  That is unacceptable. </p><p>  I hope Senators will accept this legislation in the spirit in which it is meant and accept that the flexibility allowed under this section is there for a reason.</p></speech>

There are 262 in Laois and 289 in Carlow.  I do not see the need for area licensing and I oppose its reintroduction as I do not see it as necessary.</p><p>The Minister of State is interested in rural transport and he suggested the use of the school bus service when he was here previously.  I showed my support then and I still support that.  However, I do not believe area licensing is the way to solve the rural transport problem.  The idea of the school bus service being available during the day and at other times is well worth developing and I support him on that, but I do not wish to withdraw the amendment on area licensing.</p></speech>

It is obviously clear to most people that the Senator and I come from different philosophical backgrounds with regard to this issue.</p> <p>As has been reported in a number of reviews, there is an over-supply in many areas.  However, we simply do not have enough taxis in some areas and we will have to consider how we can license vehicles in certain areas to meet that failure.  That is a simple fact.  If the Senator cares to visit my part of County Tipperary and tries to get a taxi at certain times, he will quickly find that the supply is not sufficient.  It is necessary to provide for flexibility, from a licensing point of view, to ensure we can address these issues into the future.</p></speech>

None of these issues is mentioned in the screening regulatory impact assessment of the Bill.  This completely inadequate document was published approximately six weeks after the Bill was published.  It does not attempt to analyse in any way why the Minister wishes to be at odds with four High Court decisions, documents published by the previous regulator in this sector and with the Goodbody report.  Can we have a proper regulatory impact assessment, rather than this highly inadequate document of two and a half pages which was published after a delay?  I am running up against obstacles all the time and I am not sure the Department has worked through the implications of this measure.  It seems to be throwing out things in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner.  We should have protested at the time because the regulatory impact assessment was totally inadequate.  One cannot include things in the Bill that are not included in the assessment.  No mention has been made of the case for this provision.  We are relying on the Minister of State's good faith, which I share.  Has any thought being put into some of these provisions?  Why is the Department so at odds with four decisions, the Goodbody report and the work of Kathleen Doyle when she was the regulator?  It is not enough to say, &quot;We decided to do it, so we did it.&quot;  The Minister of State must agree that the regulatory impact assessment of the Bill is entirely inadequate.  If we could have a new assessment in advance of Report Stage, that might soften my attitude towards the introduction of provisions which do not appear to have any economic rationale.</p></speech>

When we discussed the legislation previously, he said standards would be tough.  He wondered whether many Deputies or Senators would be able to find their way around their neighbourhoods and constituencies.  This amendment queries whether applicants should have to learn all of the street names and numbers, etc., and proposes that technology be used.  The Minister of State has said his Sat Nav did not work the last time he used it.  Is this almost like the requirement to be proceeded by a person with a red flag when the first cars were on the road?  Technology will evolve to allow people to find their way around.</p> <p>I allow that this is permitted "in the area of a passenger journey and in-vehicle navigation and guidance systems to guide route selection".  That is the purpose of the amendment.  People can find their way around using technology rather than learning it off by rote.</p></speech>

I cannot agree to this amendment.  The existing paragraph (<i>b</i>) in section 8(1), to which the amendment refers, relates to a regulation concerning the assessment of area knowledge of a licence applicant with regard to the area in respect of which the licence is being sought.  Section 8 of the Bill provides for the NTA to make regulations concerning the assessment of applications for licence, including the person's suitability to hold the licence; knowledge of geography etc. in the area of the licence; knowledge and ability to meet the needs of passengers, including people with disability or reduced mobility; and knowledge of the SPSV regulations and standards and requirements for SPSV driving and operation.  Standards set already by regulations, including the area knowledge tests, which were made up under section 34 of the Taxi Regulation Act 2003, are saved for the purpose of this section.</p><p>  I would like to refer to Senator Barrett's previous comments which implied there was an attempt by the NTA or, indeed, under this legislation to return to area-based licensing control as operated in the past under the responsibility of the local authorities.  It is wrong to compare a regulatory standard for drivers to have knowledge of the area of SPSV operation with the licensing system prior to liberalisation, whereby the number of licences issued to local authority areas was, in effect, controlled by the local authority.</p><p>  The real issue is that we cannot have a situation where we are relying on technology.  While I come from a technological and IT background, as I said previously, we must have the regulations and legislation as set out to ensure a consistent approach.  I do not consider that a reliance on technology would be acceptable despite the fact the accuracy of such technology is improving all the time.</p></speech>

If I had been a taxi driver, I would have charged close to €15 extra in fares.  I believe Senator Barrett is wrong to include this.  Sat Nav can be a help but there has to be local knowledge because Sat Nav always sends the driver on the main road, not the shortest route.</p></speech>

It is too open and draconian and the track record is bad on using it.  It will be and has been used to set up barriers to new entrants.  We previously asked the Minister whether he would accept an amendment that would ensure quantity licensing was not reintroduced.  He said he would not reintroduce it, but that he would not accept the amendment.  Again, the regulatory impact assessment makes no reference to this or to the four court decisions we spoke about.  If this is a way to keep out new entrants, I will keep proposing the amendment, because the Bill gives the body a power that contradicts the decisions of the courts.  My legal advice is that one cannot use legislation that is at variance with or seeks to set aside, undermine or negate the decisions of the courts.  Quantity licensing was reintroduced by SI 250 of 2010, and this was the wrong decision.</p></speech>

Section 9(10) provides that when granting a licence, the licensing authority may attach such terms and conditions to it as it sees fit.  This seems to be an integral part of the functioning of a licensing authority.  This reflects the similar provision under section 34(1)(<i>e</i>)(i) of the Taxi Regulation Act 2003 allowing the NTA to regulate on matters relating to licences, including terms or conditions relating to the granting of a licence.  Among such terms and conditions attached to a licence are the areas of operation of a SPSV driver.  This amendment may arise from the unfounded concerns of Senator Barrett, to which I have referred on numerous occasions, that there is an attempt to control the number of licences in any area of the country.  There is no such attempt, and therefore I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

There is joined-up thinking on the part of the Government on this matter.  We are involved in discussions.  Section 10 of the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill expressly provides that the general effect of section 5 of that legislation which relates to the right of non-disclosure of certain convictions shall not apply to applications for certain licences, including applications for SPSV licences under the Taxi Regulation Act 2003.  The requirement for disclosure of convictions set out in the Bill before the House relates to convictions to which the mandatory disqualification provisions apply.  In accordance with amendment No. 43, the Minister may make regulations requiring disclosure of convictions for other offences into the future.  These disclosure requirements are essential to put in place the necessary measures to protect the safety of passengers, which, as I am sure all Senators will agree, is paramount.</p><p>The provision in section 10 to which amendment No. 16 relates concerns the assessment of the suitability of persons to hold licences.  In that context, the licensing authority can have regard to convictions of which the Garda has knowledge.  In undertaking assessments licensing authorities will not be limited to considering those convictions which applicants are required to declare.  If the Senator is proposing - I believe this is no longer the case - that spent convictions should not be taken into account, I am afraid I would not be in a position to agree with him.  In fairness, he did qualify his position.</p><p>There is a requirement on licensing authorities to be measured and reasonable in the assessments of suitability which they undertake.  If they were to do otherwise, it could render their decisions liable to being overturned on appeal.  All decisions on the refusal to grant, revoke or suspend a licence can be appealed in accordance with section 12.  I am satisfied that this provides for an appropriate balance in seeking to protect the interests of consumers in the context of ensuring there will be no unjustified treatment of applicants or licence holders.</p> <p>I thank the Senator for raising the issue.</p></speech>

I will not be pressing my amendment.</p><p>There must be some occupations in which people can engage, given the difficulties they face in trying to get paid employment, otherwise it is almost a case of lock them up and throw away the key.

(b) working such number of hours at an employment which exceeds the amount specified in regulations made under subsection (8),in making his or her application&#8212;(i) inform the licensing authority of this fact, and
(ii) show evidence to the satisfaction of the licensing authority that he or she has informed any employer of his or hers who is connected with that occupation of his or her intention to make an application for such a licence.(2) The holder of a licence to drive a small public service vehicle, if he or she becomes engaged in another occupation which involves driving a vehicle or working in excess of the hours specified in regulations under subsection (8), shall&#8212;(a) inform in writing the licensing authority of this fact, and
(b) show evidence to the satisfaction of the licensing authority that he or she has informed any employer of his or hers connected with that occupation that he or she is the holder of a licence to drive a small public service vehicle and carries on the business of driving a small public service vehicle for hire or reward.(3) Where a person who is the applicant for or the holder of a licence to drive a small public service vehicle is engaged in another occupation which involves driving a vehicle or working in excess of the hours specified in regulations made under subsection (8), the licensing authority may&#8212;(a) attach a condition to the licence restricting the number of hours that, or the times when, the person may drive a small public service vehicle for hire or reward after having been driving a vehicle or working a specified number of hours while engaged in that other occupation, or
(b) if it considers that the other occupation is such that the person as a result of the number of hours the person is required or is likely to drive a vehicle, or is required to work in the other occupation and the person were to drive a small public service vehicle after being engaged in that other occupation could pose a risk to the safety of passengers in a small public service vehicle and other road users&#8212;(i) in the case of an applicant, refuse the licence, and
(ii) in the case of a licence holder, revoke the licence or, until such time as the holder is no longer engaged in that other occupation, suspend the licence.(4) The licensing authority may issue documentation to a person for the purposes of subsection (3) which shall be carried by the person when he or she is driving a small public service vehicle for hire or reward.  The person shall produce any such documentation, if requested to do so by an authorised person, to the authorised person.
(5) Where a person who has been issued a document for the purposes of subsection (4) is not carrying the document with him or her in the vehicle when driving the vehicle for hire or reward, it shall be presumed until the contrary is shown, that he or she at the material time was driving the vehicle in contravention of the condition attached to his or her licence to drive a small public service vehicle in respect of the hours or times when he or she may drive such a vehicle for hire or reward.
(6) Where an authorised officer has reason to believe that a person is driving for hire or reward a small public service vehicle during the hours or times the person is restricted from driving the vehicle for hire or reward under conditions attached to the licence to drive such a vehicle held by the person, the officer may require the person to cease driving the vehicle for hire or reward and not to ply for hire with the vehicle during the restricted hours or times.
(7) A person who fails to comply with a requirement of subsection (4) or (6) commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a class A fine.
(8) The Authority may by regulations specify the number of hours for the purposes of subsection (1)(b) and different hours may be specified for different occupations and in different circumstances.
(9) A member of the Garda Síochána may, where the member is  of the opinion that a person has failed to comply with a requirement of an authorised officer under subsection (1), arrest the person without warrant.&quot;.</p></speech>

Senators will recall that this issue came under the spotlight in the &quot;Prime Time Investigates&quot; programme in May 2011, whereby part-time SPSV drivers were found to be engaged in other employment, driving public service vehicles and were driving excessively long hours at a risk to the safety of passengers, to themselves and to other road users.  This is a very serious issue.</p><p>This new section provides for a system of notification to the NTA by SPSV driver licence applicants or holders concerning their alternative employment, involving driving.  The licensing authority, where it is considered appropriate and necessary, can attach conditions to the licence which relate to the permitted SPSV driving hours.  The amendment also provides for a related offence concerning breaches of the permitted driving hours attached to a licence and powers for authorised persons to request an SPSV driver to cease driving if the authorised persons consider that the SPSV driver is in breach of the permitted driving hours as well as powers for members of An Garda Síochána to arrest without warrant an SPSV driver who fails to comply with such a request of an authorised person.</p><p>Amendment No. 29 provides that the NTA can make regulations concerning the display of signage indicating the permitted driving hours under the new section 11 for the purposes of identification and enforcement.  Amendment No. 45 provides that the offence under section 11(7) for non-compliance with the permitted driving hours requirements is a specified demerit offence for the purposes of Part V of the Bill.</p></speech>

This is a fundamental change to the Bill as circulated on 3 December 2012.  However, the proposed new section was circulated as late as Monday of last week.  The proposed change is not covered in the regulatory impact assessment which was circulated on 17 January.  I am advised this violates people's contracts of employment.  It violates privacy.  I am told the provision in subsection (1)(ii) that he or she has informed any employer of what he or she will be doing infringes the rights to privacy under the European Court of Human Rights.  One is allowed to have part-time jobs, as the Minister of State said, as there is no law against having more than one job.  Why is an employee compelled to tell his or her employer that he or she has another job?</p> <p>The effect restricts part timers, who are vital.  Some 85% of the business is transacted between Thursdays and Sundays.  Those who enter as part-timers are serving the market.  There is no point in having rules stipulating they should sit around on Monday morning at 9.30.</p><p>I am advised this amendment is probably unconstitutional.  It is definitely designed to set aside the decision of the High Court to open up the business.  It infringes upon the rights of part-time workers, Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 40.3 of the Constitution.  I cannot agree to introducing such draconian measures by way of amendment at short notice.  I cannot agree with requiring people to disclose information to their employer that has no bearing on their employment, bearing in mind that disclosure is not in their contract.</p><p>This should have been brought to our notice before last Monday week.  It should have been in the highly inadequate regulatory impact assessment.  Given its implications for the laws that I have mentioned, I am advised that I should in no way accept this amendment.</p></speech>

I ask the Minister to withdraw the amendment until Report Stage.  There is doubt about certain aspects of this section.  I refer to people involved in agriculture, who may be working in a field all day driving a tractor, and those who commute to work, for example.  There is no table produced on the number of hours one may work.  While the hours worked by the driver of a truck or school bus, for example, can be determined through a tachograph, one should consider the hours worked by others in any ordinary form of business, such as a salesman who may travel in his vehicle for four or five hours per day.  Will the number of hours the latter can work as a part-time taxi driver be affected under the legislation?  A table needs to be produced on this.  I ask the Minister of State to withdraw the amendment until Report Stage.</p></speech>

No issue arises over privacy, nor does one arise over contracts of employment.  This legislation has been examined by the legal advisers in the Office of the Attorney General.  What we are doing is addressing an issue of safety.  It is quite clear that if somebody’s job requires driving for a long time, his driving a taxi after work - which would involve continuous driving - would comprise a serious safety issue.</p><p>We are empowering the National Transport Authority to make provisions in regard to the hours one can work.  The legislation is not an attack on part-time drivers.  The industry needs them.  I come from an area where the job of taxi driver is a part-time occupation in most cases.  On Report Stage, I will be elaborating more on this matter so as to meet the request of my learned colleague.</p></speech>

Would I have to tell my employer?  What business is it of my employer what I do after 5 p.m.?  I appreciate that my employer would not want me to make biscuits for a rival biscuit maker but it would be none of his business if I were active and entrepreneurial enough to earn some money in an industry in which demand has peaked, as the Minister stated, and if I were not doing anyone any harm.  I would be serving customers and contributing to customer waiting time reductions worth €780 million, as calculated by Goodbody.

Where an appeal is not made, the suspension or revocation commences on the expiration of the appeal period of 28 days.

I understand the Minister of State has indicated that people made representations to him, and Senator O'Sullivan also commented on it.  The section deals with the prohibition on the transfer of a licence.  The representations made to the Minister of State related to what was deemed to be a family business, if I recall correctly.  I imagine the Minister of State will make his own statement on it.  Senator O'Sullivan may have had something in mind as well.  Section 13(1) states: "A licence, whether granted before or after the commencement of this section may not be transferred or assigned or be mortgaged or otherwise encumbered."  Section 13(2) states: "The prohibition on the transfer of a licence under this section does not affect a licence lawfully transferred before the commencement of this section."  I do not intend to deal with the property rights aspect that other Senators have mentioned but the economic aspects of it are most important.  I believe this section is probably unenforceable as well.  The advice we got outside was that ingenious lawyers will find a way around this section.</p><p>The interest of economists in the transfer of licences arises because it reflects the degree of monopolistic rent inherent in a licence and those who hold licences achieve what is termed regulatory capture over the licence-issuing body.  That is occurring in this case.  A disagreement arises between the parties involved.  We say deregulation was a great success but those who oppose it are attempting to re-regulate the sector in several areas.  It is most useful to know that taxi licences in Ireland sold for €100,000 at one stage, although they were simply pieces of paper with no intrinsic value save for the fact that the Government would not issue any more.  That is because Governments always listen to producers and never listen to consumers.  There is a mountain of literature on regulatory capture.</p><p>The aviation industry captured the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and turned it into a downtown office.  CIE has turned the Department into a downtown office as well.  The Department was found to have twice disadvantaged the Swords Express company on the issue of bus licences in a decision by Mr. Justice Bryan MacMahon in the High Court.  It is a Department prone to capture by producers.</p><p>We knew the degree of incompetence and excess costs incorporated into the licensing regime precisely because people were willing to pay €100,000, or €130,000 in some cases, for a piece of paper called a licence.  This market is remarkably valuable because it enables us to keep an eye on the current and future Ministers in order that they do not yield to the degree of capture that occurred in the country previously and which the courts - we keep coming back to this - addressed by abolishing quantity licences.  The fact that a licence commands a premium is a useful measure and suggests that the Minister is issuing too few licences.  Economists value this information and we know some cities that carried out reports on the sector sought to compare favourably with us.</p><p>We know the cities that ban new entry.  In New York a licence owner can earn $1 million worth of super-normal profits.  Hence, he pays for the licence.  It is a huge barrier to entry.  At one stage it cost €100,000 to get a licence here, but at that price we could have put five or six vehicles on the road.  The licence price is absolutely crucial to know who is making a shambles of taxi regulation.  It is valuable information that economists seek.  In our case, one could have bought a taxi vehicle and a couple of books for €100,000 but the taxi licence was not included.  Lawyers will find a way through this; that is what lawyers are for.  We cannot stop people selling a business.  If it has a monopolistic rent built in due to the way the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport always caves in to producers, then those licences will have an intrinsic value.  Trying to pretend the problem of excessive restraints on new entry does not exist will not solve it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-19a.279" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1161" speakername="John Kelly" time="16:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013021900018#GG02000"><p>It will not take four minutes.  I thank the Minister of State for coming in to address this Adjournment matter.  It relates to fire services and the new document launched recently entitled Keeping Communities Safe.  I am at a loss to understand how by implementing this new document the Government can keep communities safer because the document proposes to cut the number of firemen attending emergencies, such as car accidents and chimney fires, to five per brigade.  Under health and safety rules and regulations this may be considered to be unsafe given that a typical incident command team has nine present.</p><p>On numerous occasions I have called for a national fire and ambulance service.  It would have the blessing of all Ministers.  There was a recent incident in my neck of the woods.  We have been discussing shared services.  We need to establish whether shared services are simply an aspiration on the part of the Government or a principle to be implemented in all cases.</p><p>Through the blessing of the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, the chief fire officer and the chief ambulance officer for the western region agreed to co-locate an ambulance in a fire station in my home town of Ballaghaderreen, but a civil servant blocked it.  Yet it is Government policy to have shared services and two Ministers were in favour of the move.  It defies logic.  I am looking for assurances that nothing in this document will be implemented which would put the lives of firefighters or the public at risk.</p><p>When one is asked to save money one probably discusses the matter with those in management circles and asks how they would go about saving money.  In the case of Ireland, there are 30 chief fire officers, approximately 350 assistant chief fire officers and hundreds of support staff, while in Northern Ireland there is one chief fire officer, two assistants and only a dozen administrative support staff.  If the Government wishes to save money in the fire services, this is where it should look.  If it is good enough for one chief and two assistants to run the whole show in Northern Ireland, then having 30 chiefs and 350 or more assistant chiefs in the South is not justified.  I suggest we are probably looking in the wrong direction for savings.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-19a.280" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1069" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="16:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013021900018#GG02100"><p>I thank Senator Kelly for raising this matter, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, who is unavoidably absent.  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, recently adopted and published Keeping Communities Safe, the national policy for fire services and fire safety.</p> <p> Keeping Communities Safe is the blueprint for changes which will align fire services and fire safety in Ireland with international best practice.  The policy document was prepared by the Department's national directorate for fire and emergency management in a collaborative process which included the expert input of chief fire officers and fire services personnel and an extensive round of consultation with stakeholders.  The overarching objectives of the policy are to ensure as far as possible that people and property are protected from fire and that fire service personnel are as safe as possible when going about their work.  The challenges are to reduce the incidence of fire through better fire safety and prevention, ensure an effective response when fires occur and maximise the safety at work of the fire service personnel.  To address these challenges, Keeping Communities Safe is underpinned by a risk management approach in which identified risks are balanced with appropriate prevention, protection and response strategies.</p><p>For the first time in Ireland, Keeping Communities Safe puts in place an approach to setting national standards for our fire services.  The standards, and associated targets, cover the full range of tasks, including mobilisation, initial pre-determined attendance, normal crewing levels and incident reductions.  These are intended for use locally but will give us a consistent national approach.  The area risk categorisation is one of the first tasks to be undertaken locally by each fire service.  This will enable a benchmarking of local services against the associated response service targets.  These targets are graded according to risk-rating and national pre-determined attendances are set for the various categories of incidents.  Using this approach we can appropriately gauge quality, performance and effectiveness into the future.  The risk management approach supports the ability to target resources at fire prevention in our communities and thereby reduce incidents which lead to loss.</p><p>The question of whether we should move to a national fire service structure was also considered.  In the context of local government's excellent track record in providing effective fire services and the vision for local government set out by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government in Putting People First, which was published late last year, the Minister concluded that local authorities are best placed to continue providing fire services for our communities.  This will ensure that provision of fire services are underpinned by local democracy and local accountability.  However, in the interests of efficient, quality and value-for-money services, we are moving towards a more shared service structure by reducing the current 30 fire service delivery units to 21, comprising 14 single fire authority services and seven multi-authority shared services arrangements serving populations in the region of 120,000 to 200,000 generally.  One of the seven shared service delivery units is Roscommon-Sligo-Leitrim.</p><p>The importance of safety for our 3,200 fire fighters and officers as they go about their work cannot be over-emphasised.  The risk management approach is intended to ensure that, despite the hazardous nature of the job, all fire service personnel are as safe as possible in their work.  Keeping Communities Safe prioritises the development of a safety management system which will complement other safety at work initiatives introduced into the fire service over the last decade, as well as the ongoing training programme within the fire services.</p><p>In summary, Keeping Communities Safe will help make Ireland a safer place to live, work and visit.  It has been developed using a collaborative approach between central and local government, and involved extensive consultations with all stakeholders.  The same ethos and approach will be adopted as we now move to its implementation.</p></speech>

Two years ago an incident occurred in Limerick in which one fire tender responded and a Garda and a fireman lost their lives on the road because health and safety requirements were not being fully observed.</p><p>We should be selling the property tax to people on the basis that we are providing a service to them.  We are not charging for fire services.  A considerable number of people are getting bills from local authorities following call-outs but the reality is that house insurance only covers a proportion of the cost.  It was recently suggested that whatever portion of a house insurance policy is paid to the insurance companies should be paid to local authorities to provide the service.  That is one way of financing it.</p><p>An individual from Scotland contributed extensively to this report.  In Scotland there is one fireman for every 500 of population.  In Ireland the ratio is 1:1,600.</p></speech>

I regret the loss of anybody's life, and particularly the two people who died while responding to an incident.</p><p>In regard to the potential impact of these proposals on staff working in the fire services, should matters arise at the implementation stage which could affect the terms and conditions of employees they will be dealt with through the national directorate's consultative committee, at which unions, including SIPTU and IMPACT, are represented.  I take the Senator's point, however.  Some policies included retained firemen who, while they would not be officially firemen, were trained and available to respond in the event of a serious fire.  Whatever complement of personnel our fire services need to respond to a fire should be assigned.  I cannot envisage a situation arising under the Minister's proposal where that will not obtain.  There will always be adequate and proper cover for any fire.  Clearly, however, a chimney fire would not require as many responders as a major industrial or commercial incident.</p></speech>

I ask that breeders be admitted to the AEOS 3 scheme for this purpose.  Galway sheep have been granted rare status due to the steady decline of flocks in recent years.</p><p>National statistics show that the percentage of Galway ewes relative to all lowland ewes decreased from 61% to 8% between 1975 and 1992, which is a remarkable change.  The Galway Sheep Breeders Association has 70 members and, while not every member is active, most are endeavouring to preserve a unique part of our agricultural heritage.  The major decline in the number of Galway sheep is a worry for those who are actively involved in the industry.  We have worked hard as a country to retain a degree of breed development since the 18th century but if we are not careful this breed could be lost forever.  Galway sheep have already been listed as a breed in danger of extinction and, as such, qualified for financial support under REPS.  This was a great initiative in terms of encouraging sheep enthusiasts in various parts of the country to keep purebred Galway sheep and it led to an increase in the number of registered breeders and the size of the pedigree population of Galway sheep.  At this juncture we need the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to support a similar facility to encourage breeding.  We need to conserve this industry for cultural, scientific and agricultural reasons and on that basis I urge the Department to introduce a special scheme under AEOS 3 to ensure the continuity of the breed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-19a.288" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1069" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="16:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013021900018#HH00800"><p>I thank Senator Higgins for raising this matter, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, who regrets that he cannot be here.</p><p>I emphasise the commitment of both the Minister and the Government to the agri-environment schemes operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The schemes put environmentally friendly farming to the forefront and they recognise the vital role farmers play in delivering public goods and protecting the environment and the natural heritage for the benefit of society as a whole.  This commitment is evident in the fact that more than €750 million was spent by the Department on agri-environment schemes in the last three years alone and also in the fact that, despite the financial pressures facing his Department, the Minister made a further €200 million available in 2013 under the rural environment protection scheme and the agri-environment options scheme, commonly known as AEOS.</p><p>REPS, which was the first of the agri-environment schemes, was introduced in 1994 to promote ways of using agricultural land which are compatible with the protection and improvement of the environment, biodiversity, the landscape and its features, climate change, natural resources, water quality, the soil and genetic diversity.  Currently there are just under 30,000 participants in REPS and their contracts will continue until expiry of the five-year contract period in each case.  AEOS, which is the successor to REPS, is a more targeted agri-environment scheme for which funding is provided from modulation funds under the Common Agricultural Policy health check.  Not only is it mandatory to spend the modulated funds on the so-called new challenges but the EU regulation also stipulates the type of actions to be funded and the kinds of effects that are required to be achieved in dealing with those challenges.  This Government's commitment is also illustrated by the fact that, despite serious budgetary pressures, AEOS was reopened again last year.  </p> <p>The Government commitment is also illustrated by the fact that, despite serious budgetary pressures, AEOS was re-opened again last year.  Given the background of serious economic and budgetary constraints, the Minister's decision to re-open the scheme in 2012 was a very challenging one and involved very difficult choices.</p><p>As the House will be aware, AEOS, as currently framed, specifically targets three challenges that have been assigned the highest priority at EU level as needing urgent action.  These are: halting the loss of biodiversity; contributing to the improvement of water quality; and combating climate change.  The format of AEOS is a menu-type approach, as distinct from the whole-farm perspective, consisting of actions which can be demonstrably linked to those three important challenges.  The range or menu of individual measures available to farmers include traditional hay meadows in the case of biodiversity, riparian margins in the case of water quality, and minimum tillage practices in the case of climate change.</p><p>There are currently approximately 15,000 participants in AEOS 1 and 2, which were opened to new participants in 2011 and 2012.  The scheme builds on the important environmental work that commenced with REPS in 1994 and will go some way towards addressing the serious challenges of sustainability and conservation which we face.  The Minister is very conscious of the number of farmers who have left REPS and who are anxious to continue to participate in an agri-environment scheme, hence the re-opening of AEOS late last year with an annual budget of €20 million.</p><p>Both the REPS and AEOS schemes operated by the Department provide support for breeds in danger of being lost to farming, including Galway sheep.  Under schemes 1 and 2, a total of 541 farmers have selected the rare breed measure, declaring between them a total of 2,250 livestock units.  The rate of payment is €200 per livestock unit of the breed per annum and evidence of the registration of the animals claimed with the relevant breed society is required.  Payment is made retrospectively, after the livestock units on the holding have been verified in respect of the claim year.</p><p>As the Senator is no doubt aware, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, recently announced the re-opening of AEOS to new applicants and approximately 9,500 applications were received by the Department by the 7 December 2012 closing date.  The initial processing of the applications has been completed and acknowledgement letters have issued to all applicants.  The detailed actions listed in each application will now be recorded and all applications will be ranked and selected according to the predetermined selection criteria.  It is expected that just over 6,000 farmers will be successful in this process and they will be awarded contracts of just over five and a half years.  As under previous AEOS schemes, Galway sheep will be considered eligible for support and it is expected that ranking and selection will take place in the second quarter of 2013 when letters will issue to all applicants informing them of the outcome.</p></speech>

I am glad to see Galway sheep will be considered eligible for support and I urge the Minister to ensure that all such applicants who apply for assistance will be furnished with moneys.  It is important to ensure the continuity of the breed, which is under a significant threat of extinction.  There are cultural, scientific and agricultural reasons this is necessary.</p></speech>

I was hoping the Minister for Education would be able to be here, but I know he has been detained for the sake of the Magdalen apology in the Dáil.</p><p>The story I will bring to the attention of the Minister of State is one I expect he will hear a lot more about and I believe it is a national story.  It is a national disgrace to leave the children and the teachers of Gaelscoil de hÍde in Oranmore in their school in its current condition.  I make the case that the building project for Gaelscoil de hÍde, a school on the capital building programme for 2015-16, should be expedited and brought forward.  The school is experiencing chronic over-crowding and this poses serious risks to children in terms of their education and health, and they are losing class and teaching time.  </p><p>The demographics of the school are as follows.  There are 292 children and 11 teachers on a site of less than half an acre.  Most of us have half an acre of a site, but there are almost 300 children and teachers on this particular half an acre.  When the children want to go to the toilet, they must put on their caps and coats.  There is no circulation space or hallways in the school.  These children are losing out in every way.  The risks are increasing for the school and the Department and next September, the school is due to admit another 81 children.  No gaelscoil spaces exist in the locality for some and it is unlikely there will be space for any new families as there is no other gaelscoil capacity in the local area.</p><p>There is no room for site expansion after 2014, which is the reason I make the case the building project for this school should be brought forward on the capital programme for 2013-14.  At the latest, building should begin on the project in January 2014, or otherwise September 2014 when the rental of another interim site will be required.  That rental will be a waste of public moneys and is a strong reason to bring forward the works for this school on the capital programme.  The risk is that as well as the current €200,000 rent per annum, a unnecessary extra €1.2 million will probably have to be spent or &quot;wasted&quot; on a new temporary site in 2014.  In times of austerity, that is a big waste of money.  It would be unwise to pay out this money and far better to spend it on the new school, which I stress is on the current capital programme.  All I am asking is that the project be brought forward.</p><p>The Minister of State will appreciate that the time spent in school is a serious concern for the infant year in education.  These children are losing two and a half hours per week or half an hour a day.  This is against Department of Education and Skills guidelines.  Why is this happening?  They are getting full tuition time, but their yard breaks are curtailed.  Infants now get only ten minutes per day instead of 40 minutes per day.  Breaks are staggered for all other pupils, but that does not allow for the full time for infant breaks.  Therefore, these children lose two and a half hours per week of play.  We all know play is extremely important for learning, for the development of the brain, for socialisation and for the prevention of obesity.  These children are being deprived in this regard.</p><p>I checked the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and can verify that play has been enshrined as a childhood right within it since 1989.  Chronic play deprivation, particularly during the period between birth and seven years, has been linked to impaired brain development, lack of social skills, depression and aggression.  Having been an infant teacher myself, I assure the Minister of State that aggression is a strong likelihood when children do not get enough time at play and enough fresh air.  The risk is that school play time will continue to be denied to these children.</p><p>The current school is on a half acre site, with only 29% of recommended classroom and circulation space.  Therefore, pupils and teachers suffer a loss of up to 70% of space.  Four pupils have serious, unusual medical conditions and the school has no medical room to act as a holding centre for these pupils.  There is no car-parking space on site and the road outside the school is a narrow country road.  There are severe health and safety risks and one can only imagine what would happen if, God forbid, there was an outbreak of meningitis.  It would run through the school because of the cramped physical conditions, with less than 70% of the recommended space.  On public health grounds, I would be fearful of an epidemic in the school.</p><p>I have not touched on the issue of traffic on the narrow, bog road on which the gaelscoil is situated.  I know the Minister wanted to hear this motion but is unable to be here.  I urge him to look seriously at expediting the case of Gaelscoil de hÍde.  We now have the signed agreement on the site and have outline planning permission for the new school as of yesterday.  I urge the Minister to bring the project for the school forward from the 2015-16 programme and start it in January 2014 at the latest, so that the children can move into their new school in September 2014, saving the State over €1 million.  This will improve the quality of education for the children, save gaelscoil education for local children and provide a healthier and safer place for them.  I have not even touched on the risks to the teachers.</p></speech>

Glacaim leis go bhfuil an díospóireacht seo an-tábhachtach don Seanadóir Healy Eames, a d'ardaigh ceist Gaelscoil de hÍde in Uarán Mór.  B'fhéidir go dtuigeann an Seanadóir cé chomh práinneach is atá an scéal ó thaobh an méid daoine óga atá ag teacht ar an saol faoi láthair.  Total enrolment in primary and post-primary schools is expected to grow by níos mó ná 70,000 by 2018 - níos mó ná 45,000 ag an bunleibhéal agus 25,000 at post-primary level.  Leanfaidh an fás seo ar aghaidh go dtí 2024 ar a laghad at post-primary level.  Recent birth rate data published by the Central Statistics Office show that almost 20,000 births were registered in the first quarter of 2011.  Is é seo an méid breitheanna is mó riamh ó thosnaíomar ag comhaireamh na figiúirí sa bhliain 1960.  The birth data also show that 19,313 births were registered in the first quarter of 2012.

Glacaim leis go bhfuil an díospóireacht seo an-tábhachtach don Seanadóir Healy Eames, a d'ardaigh ceist Gaelscoil de hÍde in Uarán Mór.  B'fhéidir go dtuigeann an Seanadóir cé chomh práinneach is atá an scéal ó thaobh an méid daoine óga atá ag teacht ar an saol faoi láthair.  Total enrolment in primary and post-primary schools is expected to grow by níos mó ná 70,000 by 2018 - níos mó ná 45,000 ag an bunleibhéal agus 25,000 at post-primary level.  Leanfaidh an fás seo ar aghaidh go dtí 2024 ar a laghad at post-primary level.  Recent birth rate data published by the Central Statistics Office show that almost 20,000 births were registered in the first quarter of 2011.  Is é seo an méid breitheanna is mó riamh ó thosnaíomar ag comhaireamh na figiúirí sa bhliain 1960.  The birth data also show that 19,313 births were registered in the first quarter of 2012.  This indicates a continuation of the high birth rates experienced in recent years.  In the light of such recent population growth, we will have a much increased enrolment at all levels of education.

Section 7(4)(<i>b</i>) relates to &quot;different circumstances&quot;.  The request is that these be specified.  Is it too broad a power?  We may have asked if this could be considered on Report Stage.  The notion is rather broad; everything happens in different circumstances.</p><p>  Section 7(4)(<i>c</i>) mentions &quot;different areas of the State&quot;.  I feel stronger about pressing this deletion because we abolished different areas of the State for the taxi sector.  The entire country was deregulated, mostly due to the decision of Mr. Justice Roderick Murphy, but it was upheld in three other High Court decisions emanating from Mr. Justice Paul Carney, who did the judicial review of the Murphy decision, Mr. Justice Hugh Geoghegan and Mr. Justice Declan Costello.  I am unsure why we are trying to reintroduce area licensing.  The courts deregulated the sector for the entire country and the section seems to contradict that decision.  The decision of Mr. Justice Roderick Murphy meant that people have the right to enter a sector for which they have the skills and training and that the public has a right to the services of such people.  There were two addendums to the judgment: first, that the idea of restricting entry contradicted the notion of public service; and second, a warning that most of the people in the then system, on the inside of an insider-outsider system, were citizens of this State, while in a single European market most of the people outside were probably not Irish and in this way we were probably contravening European law in persisting with the previous system, under which the issuing of licences was confined to incumbents, with a minuscule number for others.</p> <p>Entry to the sector nationally was opened up by that decision.  I am informed by the legal people whom I consult on occasion that it is not permissible to introduce in a Bill something that is at variance with or seeks to contradict a court ruling.</p><p>It was pointed out in our last discussion that some parts of the country are perceived to have a shortage of taxis on the open market.  The entire country has seen a large increase in the number of taxis since the courts opened the market for us.  The increase in taxi numbers outside Dublin was larger than within the city.  I tried to relate the current stock of small public vehicles in the province of Leinster to the population figures recorded in the latest census.  They do not seem to follow any particular pattern.  I do not know what problem this is supposed to address.  The results differ for counties Carlow, Laois and Kilkenny but a taxi can easily travel between these counties.</p><p>I do not see the point of this section and my legal advice is that it will contravene what the courts decided when they opened the entire country to the market.  I do not see any flaw in the working out of that decision and I do not understand how restricting the numbers or confining them to particular geographic locations agrees with the decision of the High Court.  We are compelled to avoid a situation where, due to mistakes made between the late 1970s and 2000, pieces of paper called taxi licences acquired values of €100,000 or more because we did not issue enough of them.  All of the partial deregulation schemes proved to be far less radical than what actually happened in the market and I look askance at any attempt to unpick a decision of the High Court backed by three other decisions.  What is the point of area licensing and does it contradict the aforementioned decisions?</p></speech>

They will tie in with future legislation that the Minister of State may propose in regard to all aspects of rural transport.  One licence may not fit all of Ireland.  Rural Ireland stacks up very differently against urban Ireland and this will give the Minister of State flexibility if, for example, he needs to introduce regulations to provide hackney licences to publicans who transport people home.  I ask Senator Barrett to reconsider his amendment.</p></speech>

Paragraph (<i>b</i>) enables the NTA to make regulations, if needed, to deal with items such as drivers operating in the voluntary sector or other such circumstances.  Paragraph (<i>c</i>) enables the NTA to make regulations for the area of restrictions that currently exist with regard to standing or plying for hire.</p><p>  A number of Senators spoke on this when we met to discuss this previously, so I am trying to remember and cover some of their comments.  Many Senators are correct that this flexibility is required for a number of reasons.  One of those reasons is that we are looking at provisions relating to different hackney licenses for rural Ireland.  This provision will allow that flexibility.  I am aware there is market failure in some parts of the country.  Where I come from, in Tipperary, there are virtually no taxis.  We need to look at what licensing arrangements we can make so that we can deal with the social issues that exist as a result of isolation and the lack of transport facilities that can be availed of by people living in urban areas.  This is a legitimate and worthwhile move and people will appreciate it.  This is the reason we need this flexibility.</p><p>  A number of Senators have raised the issue of the areas to which taxi licences apply.  There is an issue in this regard, and I note Senator Barrett has figures on this.  We must take into consideration the conurbations that exist in Ireland and whether they are part of the greater Dublin area, Cork, or another area.  Many people operating in Dublin do not live in Dublin.  Probably we need some filtration done on the figures.  We also need flexibility when it comes to distinguishing between limousines, taxis, hackneys and so on.</p><p>  The Senator should appreciate the spirit of the legislation.  From an area point of view, we need to ensure those driving taxis are knowledgeable about the area in which they operate.  That is the reason we need different licensing for different areas.  If somebody drives a taxi in Tipperary, Cork or Dublin, that driver must know how to get the passenger to his destination.  A sat-nav system does not always do the business.  I am always worried when I get into a taxi and the taxi driver is relying on the sat-nav to get me to my destination.  I had an experience in Dublin a few months ago in which I got into three taxis, one after the other, but the drivers did not know where I wanted to go.  That is unacceptable. </p><p>  I hope Senators will accept this legislation in the spirit in which it is meant and accept that the flexibility allowed under this section is there for a reason.</p></speech>

There are 262 in Laois and 289 in Carlow.  I do not see the need for area licensing and I oppose its reintroduction as I do not see it as necessary.</p><p>The Minister of State is interested in rural transport and he suggested the use of the school bus service when he was here previously.  I showed my support then and I still support that.  However, I do not believe area licensing is the way to solve the rural transport problem.  The idea of the school bus service being available during the day and at other times is well worth developing and I support him on that, but I do not wish to withdraw the amendment on area licensing.</p></speech>

It is obviously clear to most people that the Senator and I come from different philosophical backgrounds with regard to this issue.</p> <p>As has been reported in a number of reviews, there is an over-supply in many areas.  However, we simply do not have enough taxis in some areas and we will have to consider how we can license vehicles in certain areas to meet that failure.  That is a simple fact.  If the Senator cares to visit my part of County Tipperary and tries to get a taxi at certain times, he will quickly find that the supply is not sufficient.  It is necessary to provide for flexibility, from a licensing point of view, to ensure we can address these issues into the future.</p></speech>

None of these issues is mentioned in the screening regulatory impact assessment of the Bill.  This completely inadequate document was published approximately six weeks after the Bill was published.  It does not attempt to analyse in any way why the Minister wishes to be at odds with four High Court decisions, documents published by the previous regulator in this sector and with the Goodbody report.  Can we have a proper regulatory impact assessment, rather than this highly inadequate document of two and a half pages which was published after a delay?  I am running up against obstacles all the time and I am not sure the Department has worked through the implications of this measure.  It seems to be throwing out things in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner.  We should have protested at the time because the regulatory impact assessment was totally inadequate.  One cannot include things in the Bill that are not included in the assessment.  No mention has been made of the case for this provision.  We are relying on the Minister of State's good faith, which I share.  Has any thought being put into some of these provisions?  Why is the Department so at odds with four decisions, the Goodbody report and the work of Kathleen Doyle when she was the regulator?  It is not enough to say, &quot;We decided to do it, so we did it.&quot;  The Minister of State must agree that the regulatory impact assessment of the Bill is entirely inadequate.  If we could have a new assessment in advance of Report Stage, that might soften my attitude towards the introduction of provisions which do not appear to have any economic rationale.</p></speech>

When we discussed the legislation previously, he said standards would be tough.  He wondered whether many Deputies or Senators would be able to find their way around their neighbourhoods and constituencies.  This amendment queries whether applicants should have to learn all of the street names and numbers, etc., and proposes that technology be used.  The Minister of State has said his Sat Nav did not work the last time he used it.  Is this almost like the requirement to be proceeded by a person with a red flag when the first cars were on the road?  Technology will evolve to allow people to find their way around.</p> <p>I allow that this is permitted "in the area of a passenger journey and in-vehicle navigation and guidance systems to guide route selection".  That is the purpose of the amendment.  People can find their way around using technology rather than learning it off by rote.</p></speech>

I cannot agree to this amendment.  The existing paragraph (<i>b</i>) in section 8(1), to which the amendment refers, relates to a regulation concerning the assessment of area knowledge of a licence applicant with regard to the area in respect of which the licence is being sought.  Section 8 of the Bill provides for the NTA to make regulations concerning the assessment of applications for licence, including the person's suitability to hold the licence; knowledge of geography etc. in the area of the licence; knowledge and ability to meet the needs of passengers, including people with disability or reduced mobility; and knowledge of the SPSV regulations and standards and requirements for SPSV driving and operation.  Standards set already by regulations, including the area knowledge tests, which were made up under section 34 of the Taxi Regulation Act 2003, are saved for the purpose of this section.</p><p>  I would like to refer to Senator Barrett's previous comments which implied there was an attempt by the NTA or, indeed, under this legislation to return to area-based licensing control as operated in the past under the responsibility of the local authorities.  It is wrong to compare a regulatory standard for drivers to have knowledge of the area of SPSV operation with the licensing system prior to liberalisation, whereby the number of licences issued to local authority areas was, in effect, controlled by the local authority.</p><p>  The real issue is that we cannot have a situation where we are relying on technology.  While I come from a technological and IT background, as I said previously, we must have the regulations and legislation as set out to ensure a consistent approach.  I do not consider that a reliance on technology would be acceptable despite the fact the accuracy of such technology is improving all the time.</p></speech>

If I had been a taxi driver, I would have charged close to €15 extra in fares.  I believe Senator Barrett is wrong to include this.  Sat Nav can be a help but there has to be local knowledge because Sat Nav always sends the driver on the main road, not the shortest route.</p></speech>

It is too open and draconian and the track record is bad on using it.  It will be and has been used to set up barriers to new entrants.  We previously asked the Minister whether he would accept an amendment that would ensure quantity licensing was not reintroduced.  He said he would not reintroduce it, but that he would not accept the amendment.  Again, the regulatory impact assessment makes no reference to this or to the four court decisions we spoke about.  If this is a way to keep out new entrants, I will keep proposing the amendment, because the Bill gives the body a power that contradicts the decisions of the courts.  My legal advice is that one cannot use legislation that is at variance with or seeks to set aside, undermine or negate the decisions of the courts.  Quantity licensing was reintroduced by SI 250 of 2010, and this was the wrong decision.</p></speech>

Section 9(10) provides that when granting a licence, the licensing authority may attach such terms and conditions to it as it sees fit.  This seems to be an integral part of the functioning of a licensing authority.  This reflects the similar provision under section 34(1)(<i>e</i>)(i) of the Taxi Regulation Act 2003 allowing the NTA to regulate on matters relating to licences, including terms or conditions relating to the granting of a licence.  Among such terms and conditions attached to a licence are the areas of operation of a SPSV driver.  This amendment may arise from the unfounded concerns of Senator Barrett, to which I have referred on numerous occasions, that there is an attempt to control the number of licences in any area of the country.  There is no such attempt, and therefore I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

Section 10 of the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill expressly provides that the general effect of section 5 of that legislation which relates to the right of non-disclosure of certain convictions shall not apply to applications for certain licences, including applications for SPSV licences under the Taxi Regulation Act 2003.  The requirement for disclosure of convictions set out in the Bill before the House relates to convictions to which the mandatory disqualification provisions apply.  In accordance with amendment No. 43, the Minister may make regulations requiring disclosure of convictions for other offences into the future.  These disclosure requirements are essential to put in place the necessary measures to protect the safety of passengers, which, as I am sure all Senators will agree, is paramount.</p><p>The provision in section 10 to which amendment No. 16 relates concerns the assessment of the suitability of persons to hold licences.  In that context, the licensing authority can have regard to convictions of which the Garda has knowledge.  In undertaking assessments licensing authorities will not be limited to considering those convictions which applicants are required to declare.  If the Senator is proposing - I believe this is no longer the case - that spent convictions should not be taken into account, I am afraid I would not be in a position to agree with him.  In fairness, he did qualify his position.</p><p>There is a requirement on licensing authorities to be measured and reasonable in the assessments of suitability which they undertake.  If they were to do otherwise, it could render their decisions liable to being overturned on appeal.  All decisions on the refusal to grant, revoke or suspend a licence can be appealed in accordance with section 12.  I am satisfied that this provides for an appropriate balance in seeking to protect the interests of consumers in the context of ensuring there will be no unjustified treatment of applicants or licence holders.</p> <p>I thank the Senator for raising the issue.</p></speech>

As we attempt to let bygones be bygones in respect of convictions, as the Minister for Justice and Equality was doing, it will be difficult for many of those people to get employment, so self-employment is very important for them.  The Minister of State has shown himself to be fully aware of that.  I will not be pressing my amendment.</p><p>There must be some occupations in which people can engage, given the difficulties they face in trying to get paid employment, otherwise it is almost a case of lock them up and throw away the key.  We could create a permanent underclass in society.  I am sure that is not the Minister of State's goal.</p></speech>

In page 15, before section 11, to insert the following new section:
11.&#8212;(1) A person who makes an application for a licence to drive a small public service vehicle shall, if he or she is engaged in another occupation which involves&#8212;(a) driving a vehicle, or
(b) working such number of hours at an employment which exceeds the amount specified in regulations made under subsection (8),in making his or her application&#8212;(i) inform the licensing authority of this fact, and
(ii) show evidence to the satisfaction of the licensing authority that he or she has informed any employer of his or hers who is connected with that occupation of his or her intention to make an application for such a licence.(2) The holder of a licence to drive a small public service vehicle, if he or she becomes engaged in another occupation which involves driving a vehicle or working in excess of the hours specified in regulations under subsection (8), shall&#8212;(a) inform in writing the licensing authority of this fact, and
(b) show evidence to the satisfaction of the licensing authority that he or she has informed any employer of his or hers connected with that occupation that he or she is the holder of a licence to drive a small public service vehicle and carries on the business of driving a small public service vehicle for hire or reward.(3) Where a person who is the applicant for or the holder of a licence to drive a small public service vehicle is engaged in another occupation which involves driving a vehicle or working in excess of the hours specified in regulations made under subsection (8), the licensing authority may&#8212;(a) attach a condition to the licence restricting the number of hours that, or the times when, the person may drive a small public service vehicle for hire or reward after having been driving a vehicle or working a specified number of hours while engaged in that other occupation, or
(b) if it considers that the other occupation is such that the person as a result of the number of hours the person is required or is likely to drive a vehicle, or is required to work in the other occupation and the person were to drive a small public service vehicle after being engaged in that other occupation could pose a risk to the safety of passengers in a small public service vehicle and other road users&#8212;(i) in the case of an applicant, refuse the licence, and
(ii) in the case of a licence holder, revoke the licence or, until such time as the holder is no longer engaged in that other occupation, suspend the licence.(4) The licensing authority may issue documentation to a person for the purposes of subsection (3) which shall be carried by the person when he or she is driving a small public service vehicle for hire or reward.  The person shall produce any such documentation, if requested to do so by an authorised person, to the authorised person.
(5) Where a person who has been issued a document for the purposes of subsection (4) is not carrying the document with him or her in the vehicle when driving the vehicle for hire or reward, it shall be presumed until the contrary is shown, that he or she at the material time was driving the vehicle in contravention of the condition attached to his or her licence to drive a small public service vehicle in respect of the hours or times when he or she may drive such a vehicle for hire or reward.
(6) Where an authorised officer has reason to believe that a person is driving for hire or reward a small public service vehicle during the hours or times the person is restricted from driving the vehicle for hire or reward under conditions attached to the licence to drive such a vehicle held by the person, the officer may require the person to cease driving the vehicle for hire or reward and not to ply for hire with the vehicle during the restricted hours or times.
(7) A person who fails to comply with a requirement of subsection (4) or (6) commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a class A fine.
(8) The Authority may by regulations specify the number of hours for the purposes of subsection (1)(b) and different hours may be specified for different occupations and in different circumstances.
(9) A member of the Garda Síochána may, where the member is  of the opinion that a person has failed to comply with a requirement of an authorised officer under subsection (1), arrest the person without warrant.&quot;.</p></speech>

Senators will recall that this issue came under the spotlight in the &quot;Prime Time Investigates&quot; programme in May 2011, whereby part-time SPSV drivers were found to be engaged in other employment, driving public service vehicles and were driving excessively long hours at a risk to the safety of passengers, to themselves and to other road users.  This is a very serious issue.</p><p>This new section provides for a system of notification to the NTA by SPSV driver licence applicants or holders concerning their alternative employment, involving driving.  The licensing authority, where it is considered appropriate and necessary, can attach conditions to the licence which relate to the permitted SPSV driving hours.  The amendment also provides for a related offence concerning breaches of the permitted driving hours attached to a licence and powers for authorised persons to request an SPSV driver to cease driving if the authorised persons consider that the SPSV driver is in breach of the permitted driving hours as well as powers for members of An Garda Síochána to arrest without warrant an SPSV driver who fails to comply with such a request of an authorised person.</p><p>Amendment No. 29 provides that the NTA can make regulations concerning the display of signage indicating the permitted driving hours under the new section 11 for the purposes of identification and enforcement.  Amendment No. 45 provides that the offence under section 11(7) for non-compliance with the permitted driving hours requirements is a specified demerit offence for the purposes of Part V of the Bill.</p></speech>

This is a fundamental change to the Bill as circulated on 3 December 2012.  However, the proposed new section was circulated as late as Monday of last week.  The proposed change is not covered in the regulatory impact assessment which was circulated on 17 January.  I am advised this violates people's contracts of employment.  It violates privacy.  I am told the provision in subsection (1)(ii) that he or she has informed any employer of what he or she will be doing infringes the rights to privacy under the European Court of Human Rights.  One is allowed to have part-time jobs, as the Minister of State said, as there is no law against having more than one job.  Why is an employee compelled to tell his or her employer that he or she has another job?</p> <p>The effect restricts part timers, who are vital.  Some 85% of the business is transacted between Thursdays and Sundays.  Those who enter as part-timers are serving the market.  There is no point in having rules stipulating they should sit around on Monday morning at 9.30.</p><p>I am advised this amendment is probably unconstitutional.  It is definitely designed to set aside the decision of the High Court to open up the business.  It infringes upon the rights of part-time workers, Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 40.3 of the Constitution.  I cannot agree to introducing such draconian measures by way of amendment at short notice.  I cannot agree with requiring people to disclose information to their employer that has no bearing on their employment, bearing in mind that disclosure is not in their contract.</p><p>This should have been brought to our notice before last Monday week.  It should have been in the highly inadequate regulatory impact assessment.  Given its implications for the laws that I have mentioned, I am advised that I should in no way accept this amendment.</p></speech>

I ask the Minister to withdraw the amendment until Report Stage.  There is doubt about certain aspects of this section.  I refer to people involved in agriculture, who may be working in a field all day driving a tractor, and those who commute to work, for example.  There is no table produced on the number of hours one may work.  While the hours worked by the driver of a truck or school bus, for example, can be determined through a tachograph, one should consider the hours worked by others in any ordinary form of business, such as a salesman who may travel in his vehicle for four or five hours per day.  Will the number of hours the latter can work as a part-time taxi driver be affected under the legislation?  A table needs to be produced on this.  I ask the Minister of State to withdraw the amendment until Report Stage.</p></speech>

No issue arises over privacy, nor does one arise over contracts of employment.  This legislation has been examined by the legal advisers in the Office of the Attorney General.  What we are doing is addressing an issue of safety.  It is quite clear that if somebody’s job requires driving for a long time, his driving a taxi after work - which would involve continuous driving - would comprise a serious safety issue.</p><p>We are empowering the National Transport Authority to make provisions in regard to the hours one can work.  The legislation is not an attack on part-time drivers.  The industry needs them.  I come from an area where the job of taxi driver is a part-time occupation in most cases.  On Report Stage, I will be elaborating more on this matter so as to meet the request of my learned colleague.</p></speech>

Would I have to tell my employer?  What business is it of my employer what I do after 5 p.m.?  I appreciate that my employer would not want me to make biscuits for a rival biscuit maker but it would be none of his business if I were active and entrepreneurial enough to earn some money in an industry in which demand has peaked, as the Minister stated, and if I were not doing anyone any harm.  I would be serving customers and contributing to customer waiting time reductions worth €780 million, as calculated by Goodbody.

Could we not have it in contracts of employment that people who drive buses cannot drive rather than a blanket ban on everybody else from driving and requiring them to register that with their current employer?

Where an appeal is not made, the suspension or revocation commences on the expiration of the appeal period of 28 days.  To enable the licensing authority to determine the commencement date in each case, amendment No. 23 ensures a person notifies the licensing authority whether he or she has made an appeal to the District Court.

I understand the Minister of State has indicated that people made representations to him, and Senator O'Sullivan also commented on it.  The section deals with the prohibition on the transfer of a licence.  The representations made to the Minister of State related to what was deemed to be a family business, if I recall correctly.  I imagine the Minister of State will make his own statement on it.  Senator O'Sullivan may have had something in mind as well.  Section 13(1) states: "A licence, whether granted before or after the commencement of this section may not be transferred or assigned or be mortgaged or otherwise encumbered."  Section 13(2) states: "The prohibition on the transfer of a licence under this section does not affect a licence lawfully transferred before the commencement of this section."  I do not intend to deal with the property rights aspect that other Senators have mentioned but the economic aspects of it are most important.  I believe this section is probably unenforceable as well.  The advice we got outside was that ingenious lawyers will find a way around this section.</p><p>The interest of economists in the transfer of licences arises because it reflects the degree of monopolistic rent inherent in a licence and those who hold licences achieve what is termed regulatory capture over the licence-issuing body.  That is occurring in this case.  A disagreement arises between the parties involved.  We say deregulation was a great success but those who oppose it are attempting to re-regulate the sector in several areas.  It is most useful to know that taxi licences in Ireland sold for €100,000 at one stage, although they were simply pieces of paper with no intrinsic value save for the fact that the Government would not issue any more.  That is because Governments always listen to producers and never listen to consumers.  There is a mountain of literature on regulatory capture.</p><p>The aviation industry captured the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and turned it into a downtown office.  CIE has turned the Department into a downtown office as well.  The Department was found to have twice disadvantaged the Swords Express company on the issue of bus licences in a decision by Mr. Justice Bryan MacMahon in the High Court.  It is a Department prone to capture by producers.</p><p>We knew the degree of incompetence and excess costs incorporated into the licensing regime precisely because people were willing to pay €100,000, or €130,000 in some cases, for a piece of paper called a licence.  This market is remarkably valuable because it enables us to keep an eye on the current and future Ministers in order that they do not yield to the degree of capture that occurred in the country previously and which the courts - we keep coming back to this - addressed by abolishing quantity licences.  The fact that a licence commands a premium is a useful measure and suggests that the Minister is issuing too few licences.  Economists value this information and we know some cities that carried out reports on the sector sought to compare favourably with us.</p><p>We know the cities that ban new entry.  In New York a licence owner can earn $1 million worth of super-normal profits.  Hence, he pays for the licence.  It is a huge barrier to entry.  At one stage it cost €100,000 to get a licence here, but at that price we could have put five or six vehicles on the road.  The licence price is absolutely crucial to know who is making a shambles of taxi regulation.  It is valuable information that economists seek.  In our case, one could have bought a taxi vehicle and a couple of books for €100,000 but the taxi licence was not included.  Lawyers will find a way through this; that is what lawyers are for.  We cannot stop people selling a business.  If it has a monopolistic rent built in due to the way the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport always caves in to producers, then those licences will have an intrinsic value.  Trying to pretend the problem of excessive restraints on new entry does not exist will not solve it.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State for coming in to address this Adjournment matter.  It relates to fire services and the new document launched recently entitled Keeping Communities Safe.  I am at a loss to understand how by implementing this new document the Government can keep communities safer because the document proposes to cut the number of firemen attending emergencies, such as car accidents and chimney fires, to five per brigade.  Under health and safety rules and regulations this may be considered to be unsafe given that a typical incident command team has nine present.</p><p>On numerous occasions I have called for a national fire and ambulance service.  It would have the blessing of all Ministers.  There was a recent incident in my neck of the woods.  We have been discussing shared services.  We need to establish whether shared services are simply an aspiration on the part of the Government or a principle to be implemented in all cases.</p><p>Through the blessing of the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, the chief fire officer and the chief ambulance officer for the western region agreed to co-locate an ambulance in a fire station in my home town of Ballaghaderreen, but a civil servant blocked it.  Yet it is Government policy to have shared services and two Ministers were in favour of the move.  It defies logic.  I am looking for assurances that nothing in this document will be implemented which would put the lives of firefighters or the public at risk.</p><p>When one is asked to save money one probably discusses the matter with those in management circles and asks how they would go about saving money.  In the case of Ireland, there are 30 chief fire officers, approximately 350 assistant chief fire officers and hundreds of support staff, while in Northern Ireland there is one chief fire officer, two assistants and only a dozen administrative support staff.  If the Government wishes to save money in the fire services, this is where it should look.  If it is good enough for one chief and two assistants to run the whole show in Northern Ireland, then having 30 chiefs and 350 or more assistant chiefs in the South is not justified.  I suggest we are probably looking in the wrong direction for savings.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-19a.425" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1069" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="17:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013021900032#GG02100"><p>I thank Senator Kelly for raising this matter, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, who is unavoidably absent.  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, recently adopted and published Keeping Communities Safe, the national policy for fire services and fire safety.</p> <p> Keeping Communities Safe is the blueprint for changes which will align fire services and fire safety in Ireland with international best practice.  The policy document was prepared by the Department's national directorate for fire and emergency management in a collaborative process which included the expert input of chief fire officers and fire services personnel and an extensive round of consultation with stakeholders.  The overarching objectives of the policy are to ensure as far as possible that people and property are protected from fire and that fire service personnel are as safe as possible when going about their work.  The challenges are to reduce the incidence of fire through better fire safety and prevention, ensure an effective response when fires occur and maximise the safety at work of the fire service personnel.  To address these challenges, Keeping Communities Safe is underpinned by a risk management approach in which identified risks are balanced with appropriate prevention, protection and response strategies.</p><p>For the first time in Ireland, Keeping Communities Safe puts in place an approach to setting national standards for our fire services.  The standards, and associated targets, cover the full range of tasks, including mobilisation, initial pre-determined attendance, normal crewing levels and incident reductions.  These are intended for use locally but will give us a consistent national approach.  The area risk categorisation is one of the first tasks to be undertaken locally by each fire service.  This will enable a benchmarking of local services against the associated response service targets.  These targets are graded according to risk-rating and national pre-determined attendances are set for the various categories of incidents.  Using this approach we can appropriately gauge quality, performance and effectiveness into the future.  The risk management approach supports the ability to target resources at fire prevention in our communities and thereby reduce incidents which lead to loss.</p><p>The question of whether we should move to a national fire service structure was also considered.  In the context of local government's excellent track record in providing effective fire services and the vision for local government set out by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government in Putting People First, which was published late last year, the Minister concluded that local authorities are best placed to continue providing fire services for our communities.  This will ensure that provision of fire services are underpinned by local democracy and local accountability.  However, in the interests of efficient, quality and value-for-money services, we are moving towards a more shared service structure by reducing the current 30 fire service delivery units to 21, comprising 14 single fire authority services and seven multi-authority shared services arrangements serving populations in the region of 120,000 to 200,000 generally.  One of the seven shared service delivery units is Roscommon-Sligo-Leitrim.</p><p>The importance of safety for our 3,200 fire fighters and officers as they go about their work cannot be over-emphasised.  The risk management approach is intended to ensure that, despite the hazardous nature of the job, all fire service personnel are as safe as possible in their work.  Keeping Communities Safe prioritises the development of a safety management system which will complement other safety at work initiatives introduced into the fire service over the last decade, as well as the ongoing training programme within the fire services.</p><p>In summary, Keeping Communities Safe will help make Ireland a safer place to live, work and visit.  It has been developed using a collaborative approach between central and local government, and involved extensive consultations with all stakeholders.  The same ethos and approach will be adopted as we now move to its implementation.</p></speech>

Two years ago an incident occurred in Limerick in which one fire tender responded and a Garda and a fireman lost their lives on the road because health and safety requirements were not being fully observed.</p><p>We should be selling the property tax to people on the basis that we are providing a service to them.  We are not charging for fire services.  A considerable number of people are getting bills from local authorities following call-outs but the reality is that house insurance only covers a proportion of the cost.  It was recently suggested that whatever portion of a house insurance policy is paid to the insurance companies should be paid to local authorities to provide the service.  That is one way of financing it.</p><p>An individual from Scotland contributed extensively to this report.  In Scotland there is one fireman for every 500 of population.  In Ireland the ratio is 1:1,600.</p></speech>

I regret the loss of anybody's life, and particularly the two people who died while responding to an incident.</p><p>In regard to the potential impact of these proposals on staff working in the fire services, should matters arise at the implementation stage which could affect the terms and conditions of employees they will be dealt with through the national directorate's consultative committee, at which unions, including SIPTU and IMPACT, are represented.  I take the Senator's point, however.  Some policies included retained firemen who, while they would not be officially firemen, were trained and available to respond in the event of a serious fire.  Whatever complement of personnel our fire services need to respond to a fire should be assigned.  I cannot envisage a situation arising under the Minister's proposal where that will not obtain.  There will always be adequate and proper cover for any fire.  Clearly, however, a chimney fire would not require as many responders as a major industrial or commercial incident.</p></speech>

I ask that breeders be admitted to the AEOS 3 scheme for this purpose.  Galway sheep have been granted rare status due to the steady decline of flocks in recent years.</p><p>National statistics show that the percentage of Galway ewes relative to all lowland ewes decreased from 61% to 8% between 1975 and 1992, which is a remarkable change.  The Galway Sheep Breeders Association has 70 members and, while not every member is active, most are endeavouring to preserve a unique part of our agricultural heritage.  The major decline in the number of Galway sheep is a worry for those who are actively involved in the industry.  We have worked hard as a country to retain a degree of breed development since the 18th century but if we are not careful this breed could be lost forever.  Galway sheep have already been listed as a breed in danger of extinction and, as such, qualified for financial support under REPS.  This was a great initiative in terms of encouraging sheep enthusiasts in various parts of the country to keep purebred Galway sheep and it led to an increase in the number of registered breeders and the size of the pedigree population of Galway sheep.  At this juncture we need the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to support a similar facility to encourage breeding.  We need to conserve this industry for cultural, scientific and agricultural reasons and on that basis I urge the Department to introduce a special scheme under AEOS 3 to ensure the continuity of the breed.</p></speech>

The schemes put environmentally friendly farming to the forefront and they recognise the vital role farmers play in delivering public goods and protecting the environment and the natural heritage for the benefit of society as a whole.  This commitment is evident in the fact that more than €750 million was spent by the Department on agri-environment schemes in the last three years alone and also in the fact that, despite the financial pressures facing his Department, the Minister made a further €200 million available in 2013 under the rural environment protection scheme and the agri-environment options scheme, commonly known as AEOS.</p><p>REPS, which was the first of the agri-environment schemes, was introduced in 1994 to promote ways of using agricultural land which are compatible with the protection and improvement of the environment, biodiversity, the landscape and its features, climate change, natural resources, water quality, the soil and genetic diversity.  Currently there are just under 30,000 participants in REPS and their contracts will continue until expiry of the five-year contract period in each case.  AEOS, which is the successor to REPS, is a more targeted agri-environment scheme for which funding is provided from modulation funds under the Common Agricultural Policy health check.  Not only is it mandatory to spend the modulated funds on the so-called new challenges but the EU regulation also stipulates the type of actions to be funded and the kinds of effects that are required to be achieved in dealing with those challenges.  This Government's commitment is also illustrated by the fact that, despite serious budgetary pressures, AEOS was reopened again last year.  </p> <p>The Government commitment is also illustrated by the fact that, despite serious budgetary pressures, AEOS was re-opened again last year.  Given the background of serious economic and budgetary constraints, the Minister's decision to re-open the scheme in 2012 was a very challenging one and involved very difficult choices.</p><p>As the House will be aware, AEOS, as currently framed, specifically targets three challenges that have been assigned the highest priority at EU level as needing urgent action.  These are: halting the loss of biodiversity; contributing to the improvement of water quality; and combating climate change.  The format of AEOS is a menu-type approach, as distinct from the whole-farm perspective, consisting of actions which can be demonstrably linked to those three important challenges.  The range or menu of individual measures available to farmers include traditional hay meadows in the case of biodiversity, riparian margins in the case of water quality, and minimum tillage practices in the case of climate change.</p><p>There are currently approximately 15,000 participants in AEOS 1 and 2, which were opened to new participants in 2011 and 2012.  The scheme builds on the important environmental work that commenced with REPS in 1994 and will go some way towards addressing the serious challenges of sustainability and conservation which we face.  The Minister is very conscious of the number of farmers who have left REPS and who are anxious to continue to participate in an agri-environment scheme, hence the re-opening of AEOS late last year with an annual budget of €20 million.</p><p>Both the REPS and AEOS schemes operated by the Department provide support for breeds in danger of being lost to farming, including Galway sheep.  Under schemes 1 and 2, a total of 541 farmers have selected the rare breed measure, declaring between them a total of 2,250 livestock units.  The rate of payment is €200 per livestock unit of the breed per annum and evidence of the registration of the animals claimed with the relevant breed society is required.  Payment is made retrospectively, after the livestock units on the holding have been verified in respect of the claim year.</p><p>As the Senator is no doubt aware, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, recently announced the re-opening of AEOS to new applicants and approximately 9,500 applications were received by the Department by the 7 December 2012 closing date.  The initial processing of the applications has been completed and acknowledgement letters have issued to all applicants.  The detailed actions listed in each application will now be recorded and all applications will be ranked and selected according to the predetermined selection criteria.  It is expected that just over 6,000 farmers will be successful in this process and they will be awarded contracts of just over five and a half years.  As under previous AEOS schemes, Galway sheep will be considered eligible for support and it is expected that ranking and selection will take place in the second quarter of 2013 when letters will issue to all applicants informing them of the outcome.</p></speech>

I am glad to see Galway sheep will be considered eligible for support and I urge the Minister to ensure that all such applicants who apply for assistance will be furnished with moneys.  It is important to ensure the continuity of the breed, which is under a significant threat of extinction.  There are cultural, scientific and agricultural reasons this is necessary.</p></speech>

I was hoping the Minister for Education would be able to be here, but I know he has been detained for the sake of the Magdalen apology in the Dáil.</p><p>The story I will bring to the attention of the Minister of State is one I expect he will hear a lot more about and I believe it is a national story.  It is a national disgrace to leave the children and the teachers of Gaelscoil de hÍde in Oranmore in their school in its current condition.  I make the case that the building project for Gaelscoil de hÍde, a school on the capital building programme for 2015-16, should be expedited and brought forward.  The school is experiencing chronic over-crowding and this poses serious risks to children in terms of their education and health, and they are losing class and teaching time.  </p><p>The demographics of the school are as follows.  There are 292 children and 11 teachers on a site of less than half an acre.  Most of us have half an acre of a site, but there are almost 300 children and teachers on this particular half an acre.  When the children want to go to the toilet, they must put on their caps and coats.  There is no circulation space or hallways in the school.  These children are losing out in every way.  The risks are increasing for the school and the Department and next September, the school is due to admit another 81 children.  No gaelscoil spaces exist in the locality for some and it is unlikely there will be space for any new families as there is no other gaelscoil capacity in the local area.</p><p>There is no room for site expansion after 2014, which is the reason I make the case the building project for this school should be brought forward on the capital programme for 2013-14.  At the latest, building should begin on the project in January 2014, or otherwise September 2014 when the rental of another interim site will be required.  That rental will be a waste of public moneys and is a strong reason to bring forward the works for this school on the capital programme.  The risk is that as well as the current €200,000 rent per annum, a unnecessary extra €1.2 million will probably have to be spent or &quot;wasted&quot; on a new temporary site in 2014.  In times of austerity, that is a big waste of money.  It would be unwise to pay out this money and far better to spend it on the new school, which I stress is on the current capital programme.  All I am asking is that the project be brought forward.</p><p>The Minister of State will appreciate that the time spent in school is a serious concern for the infant year in education.  These children are losing two and a half hours per week or half an hour a day.  This is against Department of Education and Skills guidelines.  Why is this happening?  They are getting full tuition time, but their yard breaks are curtailed.  Infants now get only ten minutes per day instead of 40 minutes per day.  Breaks are staggered for all other pupils, but that does not allow for the full time for infant breaks.  Therefore, these children lose two and a half hours per week of play.  We all know play is extremely important for learning, for the development of the brain, for socialisation and for the prevention of obesity.  These children are being deprived in this regard.</p><p>I checked the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and can verify that play has been enshrined as a childhood right within it since 1989.  Chronic play deprivation, particularly during the period between birth and seven years, has been linked to impaired brain development, lack of social skills, depression and aggression.  Having been an infant teacher myself, I assure the Minister of State that aggression is a strong likelihood when children do not get enough time at play and enough fresh air.  The risk is that school play time will continue to be denied to these children.</p><p>The current school is on a half acre site, with only 29% of recommended classroom and circulation space.  Therefore, pupils and teachers suffer a loss of up to 70% of space.  Four pupils have serious, unusual medical conditions and the school has no medical room to act as a holding centre for these pupils.  There is no car-parking space on site and the road outside the school is a narrow country road.  There are severe health and safety risks and one can only imagine what would happen if, God forbid, there was an outbreak of meningitis.  It would run through the school because of the cramped physical conditions, with less than 70% of the recommended space.  On public health grounds, I would be fearful of an epidemic in the school.</p><p>I have not touched on the issue of traffic on the narrow, bog road on which the gaelscoil is situated.  I know the Minister wanted to hear this motion but is unable to be here.  I urge him to look seriously at expediting the case of Gaelscoil de hÍde.  We now have the signed agreement on the site and have outline planning permission for the new school as of yesterday.  I urge the Minister to bring the project for the school forward from the 2015-16 programme and start it in January 2014 at the latest, so that the children can move into their new school in September 2014, saving the State over €1 million.  This will improve the quality of education for the children, save gaelscoil education for local children and provide a healthier and safer place for them.  I have not even touched on the risks to the teachers.</p></speech>

Glacaim leis go bhfuil an díospóireacht seo an-tábhachtach don Seanadóir Healy Eames, a d'ardaigh ceist Gaelscoil de hÍde in Uarán Mór.  B'fhéidir go dtuigeann an Seanadóir cé chomh práinneach is atá an scéal ó thaobh an méid daoine óga atá ag teacht ar an saol faoi láthair.  Total enrolment in primary and post-primary schools is expected to grow by níos mó ná 70,000 by 2018 - níos mó ná 45,000 ag an bunleibhéal agus 25,000 at post-primary level.  Leanfaidh an fás seo ar aghaidh go dtí 2024 ar a laghad at post-primary level.  Recent birth rate data published by the Central Statistics Office show that almost 20,000 births were registered in the first quarter of 2011.  Is é seo an méid breitheanna is mó riamh ó thosnaíomar ag comhaireamh na figiúirí sa bhliain 1960.  The birth data also show that 19,313 births were registered in the first quarter of 2012.  This indicates a continuation of the high birth rates experienced in recent years.  In the light of such recent population growth, we will have a much increased enrolment at all levels of education.  This is expected to continue in the medium term.  It is vital that there is sufficient school accommodation to cope with this increase, as the Senator pointed out.</p><p>In order to meet the needs of our growing population of schoolchildren, the Department of Education and Skills must establish new schools, as well as extending or replacing existing schools in áiteanna ina bhfuil an daonra ag fás, ach go háirithe.  The delivery of these schools, together with extension projects to meet future demand, will be the main focus of the budget of the Department in the coming years.  The five year plan the Minister announced in March 2012 outlines the major school projects planned to proceed to construction over the duration of the plan.  This represents a major advance in how the school building programme is publicised.  It provides certainty for patrons and school communities, including those at Gaelscoil de hÍde, that the Department is in a position to progress.  The schools included in the five year plan know when their projects will proceed to construction.  This will facilitate schools in planning to meet the educational needs of children in their areas.  I gcás Gaelscoil de hÍde, tá sé pleanáilte go mbeidh an scoil nua á thógáil idir 2015 agus 2016.</p><p>The Senator will appreciate that the scheduling of schools within the plan takes into account the funding available, the progression of other major projects required to meet significant demographic needs, the stage of progression reached by individual projects in the architectural design process, the availability of sites, where appropriate, and the technical readiness of projects to proceed.  It is not possible to advance all projects in the early stages of the programme.  Maidir leis an ngaelscoil seo, b'fhéidir go mbeidh an Seanadóir sásta an scéal seo a ghlacadh ón Aire: contracts have been signed and acquisition is expected to be completed by the end of mí Márta i mbliana.  Once the site has been acquired, the project will be progressed through the architectural planning processes.  The Department will be in direct contact with the school.  </p><p>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Seanadóir arís as ucht an cheist seo a chur faoi bhráid an tSeanaid.

I will make a final point and ask a final question.</p><p>I appreciate that the Minister of State is speaking on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, and I am aware of his commitment to education.  If this school has to wait until 2015 or 2016 for a new building, it will be too late.  It would be short-sighted of the Department to take such an approach in this case.  A brand new school may well be needed to accommodate the 300 children and the further 81 who are expected next year.
