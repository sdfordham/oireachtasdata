On this side of the House we have argued vociferously for months against the cuts to home help hours.  I note with interest some of the Government's plans to replace the Seanad should the people opt for abolition in a referendum.  A missed opportunity for the Seanad, specifically on the Government side, was not stopping the passage of the Social Welfare Bill which was passed by only two votes.  Senator John Kelly and two of his Labour Party colleagues, including Senator John Whelan, argued against most points of the Bill.  However, they were assured by the Minister for Health, in particular, that the cuts to home help services would be reversed.  The fact is that they have not been.  What is the information of the Deputy Leader on the &euro;8 million cut that was brought forward?  My information is that no additional hours have been allocated.  There are more people in home help services, with the same amount of funding, and the cut has not been reversed.  I will be very interested to hear the Minister's response to Senator John Kelly.  Effectively, the three Labour Party Senators were sold a pup on the basis of their support for a grossly unfair attack on the most vulnerable in the Social Welfare Bill.  The Seanad could have stopped the Bill at the time, but did not do so because of Government Senators.  If it had stopped the passage of the Bill, there would not even be a need to campaign for the retention of the House.  There was a missed opportunity in that some Labour Party Senators supported the Bill on the basis of a lie.  Has the cut affecting home help hours been reversed?</p><p>Another move by one of our great pillar banks, Allied Irish Banks, is the increase from next week in business charges of 165% for the lodging of money.  We own the bank, yet the Government has consistently failed to bring it to heel.  From 5 June, in the very same bank, the 0.4% increase in the variable interest rate for hard-pressed mortgage holders will come into effect.  Not only is the bank crucifying variable rate mortgage holders, it is now also trying to crucify businesses by increasing by 165% the charge for the lodgement of money, not the charge for loans.  I simply want to know what the Government will do about it, if anything.</p></speech>

Perhaps the Deputy Leader will arrange it in early course.  The Leader has given such a commitment already and the Deputy Leader might have something further to say on it.</p><p>As with most Members on all sides of the House, I continue to be concerned about the way parking charges threaten the vitality of town centres right across the country.  This is not a new problem as it has featured for a while.  Local authorities should be doing much more to save town centres from destruction.  Counter-productive parking charges are crippling businesses, as we know, and unless we deal with the matter, it will affect the ability of many in business in town centres to pay rates.  The system is counter-productive.  The sooner local authorities realise that they must match in-town and out-of-town parking charges, the better.  A standardised arrangement could give them much-needed additional funding, as well as helping town centres which face appalling prospects in many instances.  All Members can refer to towns that have suffered greatly as a result of what I describe.  We should take up this matter with Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  I suggest this is a suitable matter for an early debate.</p></speech>

It was unimaginable for parents with children at the locations in question.  I e-mailed the Cathaoirleach earlier this morning to invoke Standing Order 30.  I seek the adjournment of the Seanad to deal with a motion on a specific and important matter of public interest that has arisen suddenly.  Senators know their Standing Orders off by heart-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-05-29a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1171" speakername="Jillian van Turnhout" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013052900003#B00500"><p>The reason I have invoked the Standing Order is that it allows for a debate of up to an hour and a half.  All Senators have concerns about this issue.  I had hoped in the lead-in to the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme that what would be described would be once-off bad practice.  Having watched the programme, however, I noted several instances of maltreatment and emotional abuse at the three locations.  For me, it raised some serious child protection concerns.  The researcher in each case had reported to management, but no action was taken.  Obviously, the programme focused on specific cr&egrave;ches, on which there had been bad reports.  A serious question must be asked.  Why did it require an RTE investigation unit to expose what was happening?</p><p>There has been considerable debate about the quality of child care and investment in child care.  We should also focus on child protection.  I want to be assured that action will be taken by the HSE and the Garda, where appropriate.  The HSE should publish the inspection reports without delay.  We need to ensure child care places that have not been inspected within the past 12 months will be inspected immediately.  The Children First Bill was launched in April 2012 and the Joint Committee on Health and Children considered the heads.  The legislation needs to be published and enforced to ensure there will be a statutory obligation to report a child protection concern.  We need to invest in workforce development.  These are just starting points for debate.  The HSE child and family services have answers to give to us, not just on quality assurance.  For me, what has occurred is not good enough and is unacceptable.  I hope we can have a debate on this matter of urgent public interest.</p></speech>

I secured such a debate on the economy; therefore, what the Senator desires is possible; it has been done during this session.  The welfare of children is a very important issue.</p><p>Has the Deputy Leader an update on the question I have raised repeatedly for many months, namely, the registration of various lobbying groups with the Standards in Public Office Commission.  I instance, in particular, the Iona Institute which has consistently given inaccurate and misleading information.  It has been disowned on at least three occasions by the scientists whose papers it purported to quote.  What I propose should apply right across the board.  People on all sides should be registered if they are lobbying in this way, as we need to know who they are.  This matter has become more urgent since the commission has expressed concern about this issue and the cavalier attitude with which various organisations treat requests for registration.  Apparently, it has no power of sanction or enforcement.  This matter cannot be allowed to go away because it is part of our democratic process, as is the question of the survival or abolition of this House of the Oireachtas.  If the Seanad is abolished, the Oireachtas will effectively be abolished, as it will only be left with the D&aacute;il.  I continue to raise the subject because of the massive concentration of power in the Government.  The reports in yesterday's newspapers were alarming.  The Taoiseach has, apparently, decided to toy with the idea of establishing a super-D&aacute;il committee, although the Minister for Finance said it was impossible when this House wanted to use such a mechanism for information gathering purposes. This issue was raised excellently yesterday by Senator Sean D. Barrett.</p><p>Today we are to discuss the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill which will give the Government power to cancel contracts.  That is an extraordinary and swingeing power.  There are massive cutbacks in local democracy.  The Government has been intent on preventing discretion as far as it can.  The members of the super-committee or yellow-pack Senate to replace the House would, apparently, be nominated by the Taoiseach.  It would have various experts, a new kind of golden circle, precisely the kind of phenomenon from which we are trying to get away.  It would have a cost.  One should consider the cost incurred already, including that of ministerial advisers, which amounts to more than the cost of the Seanad.  What is proposed is a complete tissue of lies.  As part of the proposal, the Government is tinkering with the Presidential election process which would make it more difficult for anybody to be nominated.</p> <p>I managed to raise this issue, despite attempts by the Government to frustrate me, with the Constitutional Convention. In a vote, 97% said there should be greater public participation.  This is a Government that ignores the wishes of the people.  If the Irish people want to put a bit of restraint on the Government and show their dissatisfaction with politicians they should not vote in favour of the abolition of the Seanad.  Rather, they should vote in a way that will teach the Government a lesson - namely, that the people of Ireland are tired of the whittling away of democracy in every aspect of our lives by the Government that they voted in because they thought it would be more democratic than Fianna F&aacute;il.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-05-29a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1172" speakername="Aideen Hayden" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013052900004#C00200"><p>I would also like to raise the issue of the "Prime Time" programme last night on cr&egrave;che care.  I express my sympathies to the parents of the children featured in the programme and those whose children were being cared for in the various cr&egrave;ches.  I can fully understand why the programme is not being rebroadcast on the RTE Player website.</p><p>I raised this issue in the House last week.  While I have every respect for the investigations unit of RTE, it is entirely inappropriate that a matter that is being investigated by the Garda has to be brought to public attention by RTE and not in the manner in which it ought to have been - namely, via proper and appropriate supervision by the HSE. </p><p>I found the statements made by the HSE spokesperson today disturbing and unacceptable.  Some of the justifications it gave were insufficient, to say the least.  I support the call for the Minister to come in to the House, a call that I made last week.  I am not aware whether that could happen today.  If it could, it would be most welcome.  It should be done at the earliest possible opportunity. </p><p>This matter raises long-term and short-term issues. Senator van Turnhout referred to a difficulty in the formal child care sector, but there is also a sincere and serious difficulty in the informal child care sector, which is subject to little or no supervision.  In the current environment, where parents are very stretched, many children are being cared for informally, including increasingly by au pairs.  There is no vetting or supervision whatsoever.  A lot of children in formal situations are being cared for by people who are earning the minimum wage with no training to speak of.  This is an important issue and it behoves us to take it seriously.  Nothing will suffice but for the Minister to come to the House to answer questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-05-29a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1128" speakername="Paschal Mooney" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013052900004#C00300"><p>I also support Senator van Turnhout's call for the Minister to come to the House and hope the Cathaoirleach will look benignly on a request that rarely succeeds.  In this instance, we are facing a crisis of enormous proportions.</p><p>I want to put on the record my appreciation of RTE's investigative unit, which has done itself and the country a great public service in highlighting what many of us involved in child care - I am chairman of the county Leitrim child care committee - suspected was happening in some parts of the country but were not sure to what extent.  It amazes me, in the immediate aftermath of the report, that the Taoiseach and, more pertinently, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald - a former Member of the House - as well as the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, have not rushed to bring in the heads of the HSE to ask them to account for what has been going on.  Why have they not brought them in?  I could not help but reflect on my way in here that if the much-maligned former Taoiseach of the country, Charlie Haughey, was in office, not only would he bring in heads but he would ensure they rolled.  It is time the Taoiseach and the Ministers, Deputy Reilly and Deputy Fitzgerald, came out from whatever cover they have been under over the past 24 hours, brought in the people concerned and asked them to account for what has happened.  What we saw on television last night was shocking and appalling.  As a parent and as someone who is involved in child care I cannot understand how something like that can happen in the country.  We have lauded the development of our child care services over the past 15 years - in many cases, rightly so - but things such as this have been going on.  </p><p>Yesterday I raised a matter on the Adjournment based on a report carried out by the Leitrim child care committee.  Since 2004, 234 child care workers have taken FETAC courses to level 5 in child care but cannot continue to university standard because they cannot afford the part-time fees, which amount to &euro;12,000 for a four-year bachelor of arts course at Sligo Institute of Technology.  The people concerned are mainly women working in the home or in part-time occupations and are looking for some support from the Government.  It should get its act together and not be crying crocodile tears over what happened and what we saw on television last night.  Let us see some real action in this case.  I was reminded of a Nazi concentration camp when I saw some of the things that went on and the abuse that was meted out to innocent children.  The people concerned should not only be brought to account but be brought before the courts and charged with child abuse.  I want to hear something from the other side on this.  I do not want to hear any more platitudes or crocodile tears.  I want some action, and it is past time something was done.</p></speech>

On several occasions since I first came to the House two years ago, Members have heard me speak about the Narrow Water Bridge between Omeath and Warrenpoint.  I first spoke about it 35 years ago, when I was less than half the age I am now.  Yesterday the Northern Ireland Minister of Finance and Personnel, Mr. Sammy Wilson MP MLA, announced the final allocation of funding to ensure the bridge goes ahead.</p><p>The project came from humble beginnings, with a committee that was not recognised by any government, North or South.  It is an historic day for me, some of my colleagues and some of those who have gone to their eternal reward.  When one has an ambition, one must keep going.  It is unbelievable news for Newry, Mourne, the Gullion region, the Cooley Peninsula and the north-east of the country.  The tourism and jobs benefits are unbelievable.  Some &euro;21 million is involved.  The job started today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-05-29a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1122" speakername="Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013052900004#C00500"><p>I would like to extend a welcome to those from Galway in the Visitors' Gallery, who are campaigners on behalf of people with disabilities.  They are welcome to Leinster House and it is good to see them here.</p><p>I concur with Senators who have spoken about the &quot;Prime Time&quot; programme.  It is a great example of public service broadcasting by RTE.  We should commend it for raising issues of such serious concern.  I am a former chair of Galway city and county child care committee and director of a community child care facility in Connemara.  I was appalled by the programme, which highlighted breaches of regulations.  Some 75% of cr&egrave;ches have inadequate staff numbers and records.  There was an over-emphasis on business interests, and the current regulations and HSE inspection regimes are totally inadequate.  These problems did not start today or yesterday; they are historic.  There has always been light-touch regulation from the HSE in this area because such sectors are grossly understaffed.  I remind Senators that the same happened under the previous regime as well as this one.  When cutbacks to health services are introduced, this is the kind of result one gets.  It is about time we got real about this issue.  It is time the Minister came to the House.  I wholeheartedly support Senator van Turnhout's call for an immediate debate on this issue.  It is a hugely important and distressing issue for parents.  I also recognise the many health care and child care workers who do a fantastic job every day and earn very little money.  They mainly do such jobs because they love them, and they have to be praised.  This matter must be taken very seriously.  What we saw last night was very close to abuse and we need a wholehearted and serious debate on the issue immediately.</p></speech>

I commend Senator Terry Brennan for his 35 years of campaigning to see that project through to fruition.  It proves that, although it might take a long time, if one sticks with it, anything is achievable.</p><p>On a much more sombre note, I was truly appalled by last night's &quot;Prime Time Investigates&quot; programme.  I commend RTE for exposing the issue because, unfortunately, the apparatus of the State did not do so.  Senator Jillian van Turnhout's proposal should be given favourable consideration and I look forward to the Cathaoirleach's ruling in that regard.  I feel sorry for the thousands of mothers and fathers going to work this morning with a heavy heart, wondering whether one of them should give up his or her job in order to stay at home and mind their children. These parents are working to provide a stable financial future for their family and are relying on the State to ensure their children are safe while they are in the cr&egrave;che.  It is appalling should even one child's safety be compromised, never mind numerous children in numerous facilities, as we saw last night.  It was not an isolated or once-off incident.  Unfortunately, this is happening in cr&egrave;ches at various locations in counties Dublin and Wicklow and elsewhere.  The &quot;Prime Time Investigates&quot; team secretly filmed what was going on in these facilities and went through the inspectors' reports filed on many more cr&egrave;ches which were found not to be up to standard.  I have sympathy, too, for the many child care workers and cr&egrave;ches that are doing their jobs properly.  However, we are facing an emergency.  The children being cared for in the identified facilities must be protected and the State must intervene immediately to ensure that is done.</p></speech>

Sadly, his remains are still lying in the grounds of Cork Prison.  This is not appropriate and is a black mark on our national record.  As we approach the centenary of the 1916 Rising, it would be timely and proper to do the right thing, even at this late stage.  Volunteer Kent is due national honours and his remains should be re-interred at a much more respectful and appropriate location.  Members will recall what happened some years ago when the Forgotten Ten Volunteers buried in Mountjoy Prison were eventually given national honours and had their remains re-interred in an appropriate place.  There was a huge welcome throughout the country for that action, with thousands lining the streets of Dublin as the remains of Kevin Barry and the other Volunteers were brought to their final resting place.  It is a pity we are waiting so long to ensure Thomas Kent will be granted the same honour.  His remains could easily be re-interred with those of his family.  I appeal to the Deputy Leader to bring this matter to the Government.  No more time should be allowed to pass before we do the right and honourable thing, not just for the memory of Thomas Kent but for that of all those who sacrificed themselves for our independence and sovereignty.  I hope there will be action in this regard in the very near future.</p></speech>

I note in the submission on the bridge order that the mussel men of Kilkeel are looking for the bridge to be manned 24 hours a day.

We should bear in mind, however, that the vast majority of cr&egrave;ches are run professionally.  The vital element is the system of inspection in force.  In County Louth, for example, where the Health Service Executive is rigorous in its inspections, there are very few problems.  The difficulty is the lack of standardisation throughout the country.</p><p>Senator Jillian van Turnhout will be aware from her work on the referendum on children's rights that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, is wholly committed to the welfare of children.</p></speech>

While there are undoubtedly problems, I have full confidence that the Minister and her officials, working with the HSE, will tackle them.  We must not tolerate a situation where conditions in a small minority of cr&egrave;ches are such that they could be considered to be the industrial schools or Magdalen laundries of the 21st century.  We are, however, talking about a small number of facilities.</p></speech>

There are many people throughout the country, both male and female, who are experiencing financial difficulty, which is a factor in the increased level of suicides in recent years.  The pressure being brought to bear on families by financial institutions that were bailed out by the taxpayer is wholly disgraceful.  Members on all sides of the House have spoken about this issue, yet we have had no proper and meaningful debate.  What is to stop us from bringing the directors or chief executive officers of the financial institutions before the House?  If we want to ensure the survival of the Seanad, we will have to do it ourselves.  Let us give this Chamber teeth by bringing in the people in question to answer our questions.</p><p>Second, we must have a debate on mental health in general and the failure to provide resources for the prevention of mental illness.  Despite the increase in the number of suicides across the country, there has been no comparable increase in services to support those who are experiencing mental health difficulties.  I call on the Deputy Leader to facilitate a debate on this issue and reflect on what I said about the banking crisis.  I am sure the Labour Party, of which the Deputy Leader is a member, would agree that the individuals concerned should answer questions in this House.  That is certainly what its Members were calling for when they were in opposition.  I hope the Deputy Leader has not changed that tune since entering government.</p></speech>

As Chairman of the Seanad Public Consultation Committee I have been contacted by several Members, including the Leader, Senator Maurice Cummins, and our leader, Senator Darragh O'Brien, who believe we should look at this in our next tranche of investigations.  We are having a meeting the week after next and it would be an appropriate topic.  Subject to approval by the committee we might look at the whole area of adult mental health and the knock-on effects.</p><p>I wish to support a strong point made by Senator Paul Coghlan about town zoning and the negative effects on town planning with regard to the doughnut effect.  It is becoming a problem in this country.  I am surprised because we have had a tribunal into planning difficulties.  Yet in 2013 town planners and planners throughout our country are still allowing incredibly poor and bad zoning of out-of-town shopping centres or whatever.  This is doing considerable damage to the centres of our towns.  Youghal is an example of where considerable damage has been done in Cork.  An example of where this has not occurred is Kinsale, a wonderful town where the people are conscious of the beautiful streetscape.  They are building the town as the epicentre of what it should be.  I am concerned that other towns in Cork and Kerry are being damaged.  It is an area worthy of debate.</p><p>I fully support the call by Senator van Turnhout on the whole area of the appalling &quot;Prime Time&quot; programme we saw last night.  I was talking to an international journalist who rang me looking for a restaurant in west Cork.  He was tuned in to the programme last night.  He cannot believe the fact that we have a Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and we have had profound problems with abuse of children in the past, nevertheless here we are in 2013 when a situation is unfolding that our cr&egrave;ches are unsafe.  It is an incredible and appalling situation and one that must be addressed.  I have great respect for the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald.  She was the Leader of the Opposition in the last Seanad.  I wish her well in her role but she needs to roll up her sleeves.  It cannot be allowed to go on.</p></speech>

Senator Mary White was mentioned as well in this regard.  Building bridges between North and South is of great importance for the country.</p><p>I rise today on the child care issue.  I go back a long way with Montessori education.  I was not involved in the actual child care section but in the Montessori section.  I was on the expert working group on child care set up in 1991 or 1992.  For years a cry has been going out from the child care sector for proper education and training for staff in child care.  This is a serious issue.  There is absolutely no excuse for what happened last night.  I was crying last night watching the television.  I was absolutely upset.  No one could look at that programme and say what was happening to those poor children in the cr&egrave;ches was acceptable.  It was absolute abuse.  There is no excuse for that at all and there can be none.</p><p>It has been found that in 75% of inspections carried out the HSE regulations have been breached.

Fully 80% of their intelligence is developed before they are three years of age.  The period between nought and three years is the most important time in a child's life.  We have to talk of society as well as an economy.

I believe she is doing an excellent job given the resources she has.  It is up to her Cabinet colleagues to back her in getting extra resources in order that these cr&egrave;ches can be properly inspected.  It is not acceptable that quite a few counties throughout the country have no inspectors and there are no inspections, not even once each year.  There has been none for the past four years or so and that is unacceptable.  What we witnessed last night was horrific child abuse, to which my colleague, Senator Mooney, alluded.  It included force-feeding children, shouting at them, tossing them around and tying them into chairs.  It was totally unacceptable.  This type of situation occurred in the orphanages in Romania some years ago and we were all horrified.  It cannot be allowed to continue.  Inspections should be carried out as a priority and published on the Internet, just as the whole school evaluations are published on a monthly basis.</p><p>Child care workers are all qualified at a minimum of FETAC level five, a very good qualification.  It has been tossed around by some of the media as being irrelevant and useless but it is an excellent qualification.  We should try to ensure that all child care workers in these cr&egrave;ches have this qualification.  Cr&egrave;ches are only required to have 50% qualified people.  I maintain a good start would be 100% of staff with the FETAC level five qualification.  Let us be honest about it and start paying qualified people properly.</p></speech>

I have been a mother who entrusted her children to child care facilities.  It is obviously not the case everywhere.  In condemning the abusive practices that "Prime Time Investigates" revealed we should be careful not to condemn all facilities.  I know some facilities and one's own home would not be run as well as them.  I know some facilities that are inspected frequently and those responsible are never notified of an inspection.  Clearly what is coming out in the debate is that the practice is not consistent or standardised across the country.  Above all, as some people have said in the Seanad today, it comes down to the integrity and character of the person in charge and the person minding the children.  No matter how good our inspections, if the person in question is not properly background-checked and if she is not meeting the standards, there will be problems.  No inspection regime can be in there every day.</p><p>I am calling on the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to do two things.  She must ensure that the people who have been found to be abusive are tried.  That is an example of the standard that we want at a minimum for our children.  I want to hear her address the issues raised today, including the issues that Senator Wilson raised relating to minimum qualification.</p><p>There is a major issue around pay.</p> <p>While pay is an issue, corners will be cut.  We are in grave danger today of painting everyone with the same brush.  That is not fair or true.  I look forward to a very open and inclusive debate on this topic.</p></speech>

It revealed 75% of cr&egrave;ches are in breach of regulations, a horrific statistic for us to face up to.  One of the cr&egrave;ches in question received over &euro;1 million from the State last year.  As Senator Wilson said, these are organisations receiving moneys from the State in circumstances where they are actually abusing children.

Yesterday, the Minister for Finance in Northern Ireland, Sammy Wilson, agreed to sanction funding for the bridge.  As a member of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and a native of Dundalk, I have long campaigned for this project to come to fruition.  I am delighted on the 15th anniversary of the agreement that the funding for this project has been secured.  I have no doubt this will be a significant economic and tourism boost for north Louth and south Down.  The building of this bridge has been alluded to on many occasions by myself and others.  It will also be a significant symbolic significance and will be the first bridge to unify both the North and the South.</p><p>The excellent news is a tribute to the unified and concerted work by many people both North and South.  I commend everyone involved in working together.  It shows what a community can do and shows how far we have gone when we have the trust and work of both county councils and chambers of commerce both North and South.  I look forward to this bridge being built with local jobs being provided.  I also look forward to a lot more water flowing under this particular bridge.</p></speech>

As the Senator knows, the HSE has responsibility for the delivery of home help services.  The 2012 service plan provided for 10.3 million home help hours with a budget of &euro;185 million.  The HSE in its 2013 service plan has committed to maintaining the home help and home care package services at levels planned for 2012.  This means that 10,870 people will be in receipt of home care packages and 10.3 million hours of services will be provided with 50,000 people receiving the service.  I have some breakdowns on that if the Senator wants them.  Senator John Kelly has also raised this matter on the Adjournment, so more details will be provided later.</p><p>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien also raised the issue of bank charges and AIB.  Senator Paul Coghlan also asked for a debate on banking.  The Leader did give a commitment before that we would have a debate on this matter as Senator Hayden and others had been looking for one.

This is a concern for many city and town centre traders and we will see if the Minister will attend the House for a debate.</p><p>Senator van Turnhout raised the issue that went on to dominate the rest of today&rsquo;s Order of Business, namely, last night's RTE &quot;Prime Time&quot; programme, &quot;Breach of Trust&quot;, which investigated cr&egrave;ches.  Senators Norris, Hayden, Mooney, &Oacute; Clochartaigh, Conway, Jim D&rsquo;Arcy, Harte, O&rsquo;Donovan, Keane, Wilson, Healy Eames, Noone and Moran also raised that issue.  It is rightly the pressing issue of the day.  I saw the programme myself and, as a mother of young children in cr&egrave;ches, it was deeply affecting.  I commend the RTE &quot;Prime Time&quot; team for its excellent and superb work.  It should not have taken a TV programme to do this.  It was upsetting and harrowing to watch the abusive, inappropriate and harsh treatment of young children and to hear about the extensive breaches of the regulations taking place.  This is unacceptable.</p><p>Other Members pointed out, however, that this does not reflect the experience the majority of parents of children in cr&egrave;ches.  It is hard for decent and dedicated child care workers today to watch the programme.  I spoke to one earlier this morning who told me she could not watch it as it was too upsetting.  The majority of cr&egrave;ches provide an excellent service and the majority of parents are happy with the child care services they are getting.  Of course, that does not excuse in any way the minority.  We need to take action on this issue.</p><p>Many of us will have heard the statement by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs this morning.  Both sides of the House paid tribute to her commitment to taking action to ensure these sorts of breaches and abusive behaviour do not go unsanctioned.  It would be useful for the Minister to attend the House on the matter but I am not sure about today.  It might be more helpful to have her attend in the coming days or weeks when we can hear what exactly is going on.  There is a thorough and comprehensive investigation under way by both the HSE and, appropriately, the Garda.  Those of us who saw the programme will have seen abusive behaviour towards very young children.</p> <p>It is appropriate that the Garda should be involved.</p><p>Clearly, the Minister is conscious of the need to deliver improvements in the quality of the child care provided in the early years.  She appreciates that improvements are particularly needed in the inspections and sanctions regimes.  She has instructed the HSE to commence the online publication of HSE inspection reports shortly.  The need for greater transparency about the HSE inspection reports came through strongly in last night's programme.  Parents are entitled to see these reports, but they are not made available to them, unless they ask their child care providers to make them available or make a freedom of information request to the HSE.  That is not transparent.  It is impractical to require parents to make requests in respect of a number of cr&egrave;ches.  Having a more transparent regime of publication would be much more appropriate.  The Minister is standardising the reporting processes and formats to pave the way for publication.  I understand from speaking with child care providers that there is a difficulty in this regard.  There would have to be a standardised format for publishing not only the initial report, but also the follow-up letters and the engagement between child care providers and the HSE on compliance.  Over 2,600 child care providers were subject to inspections by the HSE in 2011 and 2012.  That represented an inspection rate of over 60% of all providers in each year.  That overall figure does not reflect the discrepancy between areas, as we saw last night and which is a matter of real concern.</p><p>The issue of qualifications was raised by a number of Senators.  Some 87% of all staff working in child care have a qualification that is equal to or higher than FETAC level 5.  That figure increases to 98% in the case of core staff working in the preschool year.  Some improvements have been made in that regard.  Plans are being advanced to require the registration of all child care providers.  This represents a move away from the current system which requires prospective child care providers merely to notify the HSE of their intention to set up a service.  It is clear that improvements are in train.  Senators will be aware that the Government has updated the Children First guidelines.  Garda vetting of child care staff is required under the revised regulations.  The National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill 2012 has been passed.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has granted sanction for an additional 25 staff to be redeployed to the Garda central vetting unit from other Departments.  We are seeing great improvements and great progress is being made.  It would be useful if the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, were to come to the House to update us on the measures being taken to improve regulation and inspection facilities for the formal and informal child care sectors.  The informal child care sector was mentioned by Senator Aideen Hayden and others.  As parents and citizens, we need to ensure these improvements continue.</p><p>I appreciate the concerns that have been expressed which I think we all share.  We have to be mindful of our language.  It is not helpful to the parents of the children filmed to hear people speaking, for example, about &quot;a Nazi concentration camp&quot;.  Such language is inappropriate.</p></speech>

I commend RTE for its decision which was taken in conjunction with the parents not to put the programme on the RTE player and not to repeat it.  The parents of the children shown were concerned about this aspect of the matter.  They did not want the footage to be repeated endlessly or to be put on the RTE player.

I followed up the matter when the Senator raised it on a previous occasion when I was responding to the Order of Business and have not yet received a response.  I will certainly pursue it again.  I share the Senator's specific concern about the commission's lack of power of sanction.

While many disasters are inevitable and it is impossible to eliminate all risk, the loss of life and damage caused can be mitigated if we have adequate disaster and risk reduction strategies and plans.  As the United Nations has pointed out, there are many technical measures, traditional practices and public experience that can reduce the extent or severity of economic and social disasters.</p><p>In November 2008 the United Nations Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, appointed Ms Margareta Wahlstr&ouml;m as the first Special Representative of the Secretary General for Disaster Risk Reduction.  Ms Wahlstr&ouml;m is based in Geneva and heads the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction.  The international strategy for disaster reduction reflects a major shift from the traditional emphasis on disaster response to disaster reduction and in effect seeks to promote a culture of prevention.</p><p>Ms Wahlstr&ouml;m has more than 30 years of extensive national and international experience in humanitarian relief operations in disaster and conflict areas, and in institution-building to strengthen national capacity for disaster preparedness, response and for risk reduction.  The oft-quoted phrase &quot;By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail,&quot; is one of Benjamin Franklin's many pearls of wisdom.  It is through the work of people such as Ms Wahlstr&ouml;m that globally we are not failing to prepare.  Instead, we are planning, organising and readying ourselves to deal with problems caused by disasters before they arise.  Given this hugely important role, I am delighted to welcome Ms Wahlstr&ouml;m to Seanad &Eacute;ireann and now invite her to address this House.</p></speech>

Twenty years ago, disasters were perceived to be a problem affecting poor countries.  Today, of course, nobody believes this remains a poor-country issue.  On the contrary, disasters affect all countries, including the United States, as the Cathaoirleach mentioned.  Perhaps the most dramatic of all, just to set us off thinking about the significance of the issue, the Christchurch earthquake took account of 20% of the GDP of New Zealand, a rich, highly developed country.  Thus, we are talking about a very significant impact.  The OECD countries are the countries with the biggest increases in annual disaster losses to their GDP.  Of course the poor countries have the highest and most significant proportional impact on their development, so it really is a unifying issue today.</p><p>The Cathaoirleach mentioned my many years working with disasters.  When I started working with disasters, there was almost complete focus on saving people's lives.  People's lives are increasingly being saved by better early-warning systems and evacuation procedures.  There is much greater respect for what can be done to get people out of harm's way.  Traditionally, disasters were handled by every country in the world - I do not discriminate between poor and rich in this regard.  When something happened, big or small, a country paid for it and moved on, and it pays for it when it happens again.  It was an events-driven approach to disasters, as if there were nothing that could be done.  Gradually we are trying, through national and international work, to change this deeply ingrained attitude.  In many countries I still get wise advice from religious leaders not to interfere in what is only partially created by man but is nature's own way.  Having said that, we are trying to be very practical.  We started looking at the economics of disasters.  How much does a disaster actually cost?  It is not just what we pay up-front, but what are the indirect costs?  What are the poverty consequences?  What long-term consequences does it have on health and education?  Every country uses its schools as evacuation sites.  Senators should just think about the weeks and months of school time being used up by using schools as evacuation centres.  So there are very many practical issues to do with the disaster event itself.</p><p>We need to look at the bigger picture.  Disasters are events that destroy society's capability to maintain its economic and social development.  They represent a development issue and challenge which is closely linked to climate change, with the increasing impact of warming.  Seven or eight years ago I had a meeting with climate scientists and meteorologists, who explained the long-range projections.  We tried to conceptualise it and establish what it means for us.  People who work today with disasters and social and economic planning predict more of the same extreme events, and more unexpected and totally unimaginable events.  I believe that is what we have today.  There is more flooding and more high winds - many more extreme events.</p><p>I do not know how many Senators have heard of the cloudburst in Copenhagen three years ago.  My colleagues in the Copenhagen city council tell me that the Danish political leaders did not believe in climate change.  Then, in the summer of 2011, there was an enormous cloudburst and Copenhagen was under meters of floodwater for approximately a day.  Because Copenhagen is a very old city and does not have modern plumbing, the sewerage and freshwater systems were not segregated.  I do not need to remind Senators what the consequences were.  To this day no one knows how to pay for it.  It has created all kinds of debates over local government municipality partitions of infrastructure.  No country has the preparedness to pay for such events.  Extreme things about which we did not know happened, and now the Danes believe in climate change.</p><p>The other aspect of warming is the unpredictability of weather, with longer droughts and unpredictable sowing periods.  This is the case everywhere in the world, including in Europe.  Long warm periods are causing forest fires and wildfires.</p> <p>The health impacts of the new weather conditions are very well documented.  One has only to look at easily accessible material on the return of malaria in Europe.  Our planning and looking forward must be much more informed by all these areas.  The extremities - the disastrous events - have not been fully factored in because we do not count them.  Most countries, including in Europe, do not have records of disasters and their costs.  Local governments normally have, but if nobody in the central government asks for them they do not go into the national statistics, even today, when we have statistics on everything.</p><p> One of the major issues arising in our work for a new disaster risk management framework post-2015 is how to govern disaster risk reduction.  How does one plan to reduce risk and exposure?  Vulnerability is one aspect, while exposure is the other closely linked aspect.  Vulnerability is really about people's soft spots, and those of society, where the risk associated with an extreme event is multiplied several times.  It it is about health, education and damage to cultural heritage.  Exposure, in its most critical form, is associated with more than just infrastructure.  Some countries have very old infrastructure and do not keep up with wear and tear.  What about IT infrastructure?  One has only to think about New York.  I do not know if any Senators were there during Hurricane Sandy.  In Manhattan it looked good, but just across the river in New Jersey they had no telephone contacts, no electricity and no idea of what was going on.  How can we make these infrastructures much more resilient?  Think about big cities that are better prepared, such as Tokyo, which is planning for an earthquake.</p><p> The reality check for us all in recent years was represented by incidents such as the flooding in Thailand and Australia, when all the supply chains in the highly integrated international economies started to break down.  The break in supply chains due to the Thai floods had an 3% impact<b></b>on GDP, which was a wake-up call for many mega-companies.  I believe Toyota said that the lesson it learned from this, which made it a better company today, is that it did not know who its suppliers were.  It might have had hundreds or thousands of suppliers but it could not find them because it had not thought of them as critical links and did not even have their telephone numbers.  It now knows the telephone numbers, and it has fewer suppliers and believes it is more resilient.  These are some of the critical areas for poor countries.  Most of the countries we used to think of as really poor are now rapidly growing economies.  They are joining the lower middle income countries and their outlooks are changing radically.</p><p> Before I explain who we are, the reason we pay so much attention to the issue of risk is that, from east Asia, which used to be the fastest growing part of the world economically, there are good data showing that the risk accumulation curve and the economic growth curve have exactly the same trajectory.  What this means is that countries with fast-growing economies are cutting many corners on long-use planning, quality of infrastructure and urban planning.  Officials from China and Vietnam, for example, say that they cut too many corners in the past and now they are paying for that.  If the Chinese are not going to accept all the losses they incur - they are protesting - the government needs to look after the future social and economic resilience of the country, and that requires looking back to see what it can do to catch up.  That is a major issue.  I do not know to what degree Ireland is ready to compare itself to China - the scale is a bit different - but China has done something unique.  It is the first country  in the world to do this.  In its new five-year development plan it has put a ceiling on what it considers to be an acceptable economic impact on GDP, which is 1.5%.  This is a public policy now.  Its strategy for managing risk is actually mitigation, to ensure it does not supersede that figure.  That means engaging in flood management, improving infrastructure such as schools and hospitals, and all the practical things one does to ensure a resilient country.  I do not know how many countries are likely to follow that policy, but it is a manifestation of how politically important it is for China, as a country, to maintain the credibility of economic growth and social development. </p><p> What is UNISDR?  It is a relatively young office in the United Nations which was created in 2000 but was the continuation of 20 years of previous work within the UN, mainly by scientists and technologists.  They knew that disasters would overwhelm societies one day but nobody listened to them, so they decided to set up an advocacy and outreach office, which is UNISDR.  In 2004 the Indian ocean tsunami occurred.  At the same time - this was coincidence, of course - UNISDR had been working with countries and organisations on what we call the Hyogo Framework for Action, which was agreed in Kobe in Japan in January 2005.  Kobe is a tragic example of the impact of disasters.  When the Kobe earthquake occurred in the mid-1990s, Kobe was the sixth largest commercial port in the world.  Enormous damage was caused.  The Japanese Government invested hundreds of millions of dollars to get Kobe back in business, but today nobody sees Kobe as a major commercial port any more.  Thus, the losses we do not account for are the ones that happen over years or decades.</p><p> Kobe's name is in history not because of that but because of the Hyogo Framework for Action, which is a voluntary framework for building the resilience of communities and nations.  In five priority areas, it has concrete proposals on what to do to build resilience.  We have used that framework as a structure for working with countries and organisations in the past eight years.  That is what we are introducing, including in Europe.  Europe was probably the last continent to recognise that disaster is a very costly enterprise - unnecessarily so.  Five or six years ago development started here, and now Europe is the geographical area that is most quickly taking measures to organise itself nationally and with the help of the European Union.  Much in European co-operation is focused on resilience, disaster risk reduction, strengthening civil protection mechanisms and working together in an integrated fashion.  It has also been a major help for the United Nations, in our work with the rest of the world, to see how strongly Europe is coming together on this issue.</p><p> We work a good deal with regional and national technical institutions and we work closely with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the development agenda.  We are trying to focus on the fact that none of these segments is a stand-alone segment; they are totally interdependent.  One cannot manage the development agenda unless one recognises the risk and the losses.  Some of those losses are strongly linked to climate change and weather variability.  In the global policy agenda, this is what we are trying to get through.  We are also stimulating the building of national structures for responding to disasters and getting it right.</p> <p>We are now in the process of designing the post-2015 disaster risk management framework.  Our first framework was for the period 2005 to 2015.  We fall into this pond of the post-2015 development agenda, the hope for a new climate agreement and also this framework.  It could be questioned how this will all work out.  The Hyogo framework action 2, as we call it, is actually a free space in a way in which everything comes together.  Neither is it a negotiated space.  Our partnership with countries is a very interesting one because in this space are contained local governments as well as the strong and extremely vocal participation of parliamentarians from around the world; community representatives, women and also people living with disability; community organisations, the Red Cross and the Red Crescent and our colleagues in the UN system.  We are all in the same space.  We have just concluded our fourth global meeting last week.  The agenda is set for 2015 which includes measures to govern disaster risk reduction, how to put local communities more at the centre, and to help governments to become comfortable with an all-of-society approach.  I know Ireland has just agreed on an all-of-society approach for international co-operation.  That is the trend that we have to follow through.  We need to achieve a much more comfortable policy and programmatic integration of climate change and disaster risk agenda in order not to delay implementation.  We need to achieve a much clearer focus on what is called the natural hazards and technological disasters coming together. </p><p>It is about the big challenges we face such as what happened at Fukushima and also the challenges associated with any major chemical factory infrastructure.  I refer to  very practical things like infrastructure, the very rapid global urbanisation and whether countries and communities can get ahead of this very rapid risk accumulation for the future through using already well-known practical instruments.</p><p>Every country in the world has a building code but too few countries believe that their building codes are respected, enforced and utilised.  Every country and city in the world has land-use planning regulations but it is a question of whether these are taken seriously.  We are not respecting some basic rules of nature.  A colleague of mine who is a water expert said that water never disappears, it just takes a new path.  These new paths are what creates urban flooding and more flash floods.  All in all, we must realise that increasingly, disasters are not created by natural forces but rather as a result of how we organise society.  We create them but we have the knowledge to reduce and minimise these risks.</p><p>Research is one of our instruments for sharing knowledge.  Every two years we issue a global assessment report of disaster risk.  I will leave a few copies here for Members to use as reference.  Our first report was on poverty and disasters.  Today it is very clear how poverty and disasters are closely interlinked with one driving the other.  The second report was on public investment and disasters, how governments use their financial instruments and what they know about the future risk.  It is a very practical guide.  This year's report was launched ten days ago and it deals with the private sector and disaster risk.  I have tried to reduce this to a very simple perspective since the private sector in most countries in the world is responsible for about 80% of all investment.  Unless we can get private sector closely engaged by means of its self-interest and resilience in its investment and contributing to an environment which is much better for their investment income and viability, then we are not likely to succeed.  We are working on mobilising private business both globally and, in terms of small and medium enterprises, locally.  The SMEs are the ones who have no margin and they go under after a disaster in very large numbers.  They are very important for communities.  </p><p>These are some of the big items on the table.  Ireland is a very close partner with us in the European collaboration and it is also internationally strongly engaged in the work on the post-2015 risk management agenda.  We then legitimise and try to create politically binding engagement is all this work.  The Secretary General reports to the General Assembly every year on the work of the international strategy.  The General Assembly then gives guidance through its resolutions and commitments and that is what we are trying to use to mobilise governments even more now.  We are making some progress but I must confess that I think it needs to become a lot more real for many more countries.  The poorer countries are very aware.  The very dry countries see an acceleration in droughts.  In our part of the world we are still a little bit hesitant to see this as something that we ought to integrate very strongly in our policy and practice agendas as one of the things that would secure sustainability of our lifestyle models while having to make a few compromises on the way.</p><p>I have described some of the most important issues.  I have taken a look at Ireland in preparation for my coming here.  I have an Irish colleague in my office who keeps talking about the floods in Cork.  We can see the infrastructural challenges that many countries share with Ireland.  I look forward to hearing comments from Senators on how we can inspire the work of the House.  I thank Mr. Gay Mitchell MEP, who is a member of our parliamentarian advisory group.  This is a group of very determined and strong advocates who influence thinking on these issues.  I am doing everything I can to support them.</p></speech>

We are indeed honoured to have such a distinguished guest as the special representative of the Secretary General of the United Nations with responsibility for disaster risk reduction.  I have done some research on our guest.  Ms Wahlstr&ouml;m  has a glittering career, spanning more than 30 years in international disaster response and humanitarian work in more than 100 countries, including many across the Middle East, north Africa, south-east Asia, southern Africa and Latin America.  She holds a most important position in a world that has seen a dramatic rise in the incidence of natural disasters, many as a result of climate change.  She referred to situations here in Ireland.  We never thought that we would be importing grass as has been the case in recent times as a result of unusual weather patterns that have continued over a period of 12 months.</p> <p>Ms Wahlstr&ouml;m referred to the flooding in Cork.  We have had severe flooding over a number of years, in particular in 2009 when a significant number of homes were flooded in my home town of Ballinasloe, County Galway.  The homes of more than 150 people were severely damaged and some people had to be relocated.  Extensive remedial works were carried out after the flooding, with the local authority and local community working closely together.</p><p>In many of the world's least-developed countries, extreme events occur so frequently that resources, which are badly needed for poverty reduction and economic development, are being diverted to disaster relief and reconstruction.  Many countries and communities are ill-prepared to cope with extreme events and climate change threatens to undermine many decades of effort in the areas of poverty reduction, development assistance and disaster risk management.  The loss of life resulting from natural hazards is considerable and the number of people affected and the associated economic losses have substantially increased since the 1970s.  I saw a figure that 90% of all people killed by disasters since the 1970s were victims of climate-related hazards.  </p><p>As the world climate changes, climate-related extremes will become more prevalent and we will see more extreme events such as heat waves, cold waves, extreme floods, droughts, tropical cyclones and storms.  These events will present huge challenges for governments and communities.</p><p>As Ms Wahlstr&ouml;m said, we will only build resilience to disasters by working together as inhabitants of this planet.  As our Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Joe Costello, said recently in a speech in Brussels, we need to strengthen our resilience to disasters by linking relief, rehabilitation and development and we need to strengthen partnerships and work better together.  We need to realise the most important stakeholders are the local people living in the environment at risk.</p><p>I read an extract from a speech Ms Wahlstr&ouml;m delivered recently in which she spoke about communities and involving women who are at the coalface in terms of protecting their families and looking out for their environment.  They need to be involved in the decision-making process as we plan to reduce risk throughout the world.  </p><p>Ms Wahlstr&ouml;m referred to the framework for action 2005-15, Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters.  That has served as a guiding document in strengthening and building international co-operation to ensure disaster risk is reduced as a foundation for sound national and international development policy.  I was not really aware of that document until I did some research for today but it is very comprehensive and prioritises some very significant actions.  It refers to the political commitment required at national and international levels and community participation, to which I referred.  The speech Ms Wahlstr&ouml;m made in Bangkok in October 2012 laid out a very significant marker.  There is a need for early warning systems, which are people-centred, and for the use of the wonderful technology we have today to alert people in a timely fashion.  The document refers to the need to educate people and to use knowledge and innovation to build a culture of safety.  Public awareness is very much highlighted.  There is little public awareness throughout the world of what is happening and of the plans and policies we need to put in place.  </p><p>The life of that framework document will expire in two years' time.  It will need to be reviewed and updated given that the world is changing so rapidly.  Since that document was put in place there has been huge population growth, rapid urbanisation, huge industrial development, environmental challenges and climate change which are all increasing risk at an alarming rate.  Governments and communities face huge challenges if they are to reverse the upward trend in disasters and to protect lives, jobs, homes and food and water supplies.</p><p>I read Ms Wahlstr&ouml;m's speech on the value of water and what a scarce resource it is.  Every government and local authority would do well to read that.  We will only succeed if there is political commitment, strong leadership and involvement of all stakeholders in a bottom-up approach.  </p><p>The world is fortunate to have Ms Wahlstr&ouml;m at the forefront of the challenge of disaster risk reduction.  I wish her continued success and hope she will come back for further dialogue when we may have more time to expand and expound on some of the very pressing issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-05-29a.143" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1126" speakername="Jim Walsh" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013052900012#L00200"><p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh Bean U&iacute; Wahlstr&ouml;m go dt&iacute; an Teach.  I welcome Ms Wahlstr&ouml;m who has a very good track record in this area given her 30 years of experience.  I thank her for sharing her expertise and experience with us.  I also compliment her on the fact she was appointed by the Secretary General of the UN in 2008 as the first special representative of the UN in this area of disaster risk.</p><p>Over many decades, this House has had debates on disasters, in particular in Africa in which Ms Wahlstr&ouml;m has taken a keen interest, and on all sorts of humanitarian challenges which face the international community, in particular African countries.  It is good we have moved from a situation where we tended to give food to get over the immediate crisis to one where more sustainable issues are addressed and where development going forward will be sustainable.  Economic progress in Africa in recent years has been quite impressive.  The old adage that if one gives a man a fish, one feeds him for one today but if one teaches him to fish, one feeds him for life is coming through.</p><p>I welcome the recent negotiations on the arms trade treaty at the UN.  I hope many countries will subscribe to it because many conflicts and disasters are caused by indiscriminate and illegal arms trading, often done for selfish reasons by countries and inflicting much hardship and torment on very vulnerable and very poor people in many of these countries.  </p><p>I was surprised to hear of the impact on GDP of the disaster in Christchurch, New Zealand.  I visited New Zealand a few years ago with my wife and we spent some time in the beautiful city of Christchurch.  It was horrendous to hear what happened but I was unaware that one disaster resulted in a 20% reduction in GDP across New Zealand.  It really brings home the economic impact of these disasters.  As Ms Wahlstr&ouml;m rightly pointed out, increasingly these will have serious impacts on the global economy.  I do not think Ms Wahlstr&ouml;m mentioned it but the tsunami off the coast of Japan which led to the disaster at the Fukushima nuclear power plant certainly had reverberations across the global economic field not only in Japan but elsewhere.  I am sure it will have a considerable national and regional affect for decades to come.  </p><p>There is now an acknowledgement that efforts to reduce disaster risks must be systematically integrated into politics, plans and programmes for sustainable development and poverty reduction.</p> <p>We have a saying that prevention is better than cure so I welcome the comments of my colleague, Senator Mullen, who emphasised the early warning mechanisms using modern technology for evacuation procedures etc.</p><p>Some three or four years ago, I did a course on crisis management and we looked at 9/11 in New York and the hurricane in the Mississippi.  Part of the study brought us into individual areas like fires and aeroplane crashes.  From all the case studies, it is extraordinary that people who had planned how to deal with such an eventuality stood a much better prospect of surviving disasters than those who had not planned.  I subsequently paid close attention to the safety announcements at the start of the flight by air hostesses on a flight I was on.  I must have been the only boy in class paying attention because, when she came around with the drinks afterwards, she gave me a free gin and tonic for having paid attention.  Most people do not pay attention and, as a consequence, they do not react quickly enough.  If one is prepared when a disaster happens, immediately one's mind kicks into action and one will take the planned decision.  Without going through that, one's chances of survival are much less.</p><p>Ms Wahlstr&ouml;m mentioned the Hyogo framework on disaster reduction, which has five main areas.  Perhaps these can be specified in the reply.  More than 2.7 billion people were affected and &euro;1.3 billion people were lost through international disasters between 2000 and 2011.  These are astronomical figures that I did not fully appreciate.  Risk assessment is a critical part of this.  A number of years ago, I saw a programme that received little amplification in the media or elsewhere.  It was a Channel 4 documentary on the Canary Islands and the fact the islands' mountains lay on a fault line.  The programme talked about the possibility of the fault line causing a landslide to the sea and how this would have disastrous consequences for Europe and wipe out almost all of the east coast of the United States.  I have not seen anything about it since but I wonder if it figures in the UN assessment.  Fail to prepare, prepare to fail.</p></speech>

It is a great opportunity to have someone held in such high esteem as Ms Margareta Wahlstr&ouml;m to address the House.  Every Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann is privileged to have her here to debate the issue.  It is not often we have the opportunity to debate such an issue.  I speak on behalf of all Members when I say that we welcome warmly this departure.</p><p>The increasing frequency and intensity of disasters is posing a major threat to the long-term development and economic progress of the poorest and most vulnerable people in developing countries.  Large-scale emergencies have occurred every year over the past decade, from the Darfur conflict, which started in 2003, to the earthquakes in Haiti, Chile and China in 2010.  In 2011, there was a food crisis in the Horn of Africa and in 2012 a major food security crisis in the Sahel region of Africa, where acute food shortages devastated the area.  This was driven by chronic poverty, malnutrition, high food prices, drought and low agricultural production.  It affected almost 18.7 million people across the region.</p><p>It is clear there is some degree of repetition and predictable crises require co-ordinated and predictable responses.  Whether a natural disaster or a conflict situation, it is more cost-effective to prevent and prepare for a situation crisis than to wait for it to happen.  It is estimated that every US$7 spent on responding to natural disaster could be offset by US$1 preparing for it through early warning.  Likewise, US$1 spent on conflict resolution saves US$4 in humanitarian response.  There is a significant saving and it makes sense to avoid such disasters or, at least, to have a risk management plan in place.  In these situations, it is increasingly accepted that consistent investments in disaster risk reduction and humanitarian and development intervention will result in more resilient communities that are able to anticipate and recover from risk, shock and distress of this nature.</p><p>Many of the advances made throughout the development assistance have been eroded or lost due to the increasing frequency and recurring nature of the crises we have seen.  There is some degree of repetition.  It is predicted that the nature and intensity of natural hazards will continue to increase as climate change generates more severe weather related events.  The world also faces new types of hazards, such as soaring fuel and food prices and the threat of pandemics and increasing conflict.  Disaster damages infrastructure and affects productivity and growth.  In 2011 alone, 302 disasters claimed 29,782 lives and affected 206 million people and inflicted damage worth a minimum of US$380 billion.  The reality is that the poor and marginalised die in greater numbers and endure higher economic losses because of these disasters.  Their food and nutrition security is more at risk because they eke out their livelihoods in the riskiest environments.</p><p>In situations of conflict, in drought prone areas, in swamps and flood prone riverbanks of congested urban settlements, scarce resources are diverted from development programmes to rehabilitation and reconstruction activities and escalating food import bills.  At household level, a succession of crises deepen poverty and increase food insecurity and undernutrition.  The effects of undernutrition can be devastating, as referred to earlier.  Maternal and child undernutrition during the crucial 1,000 day period between pregnancy and a child's second birthday can have a permanent impact on the physical and cognitive development of children.</p><p>Disasters rarely just happen, they often result from failures of development, which increase vulnerability.  As the number of predictable crises increase, the need for a plan for them as part of a development assistance becomes more critical.  It is vitally important that reducing disaster risk is of central concern to our development, as well as our humanitarian work.  It is most cost effective to prevent and prepare for a crisis rather than wait for it to happen.</p><p>Internationally, the 2005 Hyogo framework for action, to which Ireland is a signatory, provides the global blueprint for disaster risk reduction efforts.  It called on states to work jointly on the issue of disaster risk reduction and a common approach is quite clearly more effective than separate national approaches.  The United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, of which Ms Margareta Wahlstr&ouml;m is a member, serves as a focal point for the implementation of the framework for action.  Ireland supports this and all that is done in this initiative.  We have played our part in intensifying collective efforts to fulfil our obligations in promoting a more systematic approach to disaster risk reduction in disaster prone developing countries.</p><p>In putting flesh on the bones of the commitment, I understand Ireland has provided &euro;900,000 to support the UN international strategy for disaster reduction 2012-13 biennium.  I am over time and I appreciate the endurance of the Leas-Chathaoirleach.  I appreciate and commend Ms Wahlstr&ouml;m on all she has done in this important aspect of development and change.  Disasters are shattering the lives of poor people throughout the globe.  Without the guidance and foresight provided by Ms Wahlstr&ouml;m, there may have been no attempt at prevention.  It is something we must recognise and acknowledge.  Ms Wahlstr&ouml;m is a fantastic individual for all she has done in this regard.  Through investing in the reduction of risks, we are putting in place a plan for before a disaster strikes.  This pays huge dividends.</p> <p>I strongly commend Ms Wahlstr&ouml;m on all her efforts in this regard.</p></speech>

I also welcome Mr. Gay Mitchell, with whom we had an excellent exchange on development issues in the House earlier this year.  The work of Ms Wahlstr&ouml;m as the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction and head of the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, particularly with the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, and her role as the Secretary-General's special response co-ordinator during the initial phase of the international reaction to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and her current role, which has brought her to the House today, as well as all of the work she has done in the past 30 years, show to us the expertise she has and the honour it is for us that she is addressing the House.</p><p>When we see the aftermath of events such as the 2004 tsunami, the Christchurch earthquake or, most recently, the Oklahoma tornado, we here in Ireland often feel quite insulated from the effects of such dangers because of our geographical position.  However, reflecting on the work of the United Nations international strategy for disaster reduction, it is clear that in many ways this is a false sense of security which belies our ever-increasing levels of global interconnectedness, which, while bringing countless benefits, also increases our sensitivity to the effects of events originating far beyond our borders.</p><p>Several colleagues have raised the very important human consequences of such disasters.  Specifically, I was struck by how a disaster can undermine long-term competitiveness and sustainability, not only at the epicentre of the disaster but also in those areas with which it shares economic ties.  For example, in preparing for this contribution, I was very interested to read a report by Ms Wahlstr&ouml;m's organisation entitled &quot;Shared Risk to Shared Value: The Business Case for Disaster Risk Reduction&quot;, and I advise my colleagues that it is well worth a read.  An example in the report cites how damage to one maker of microchips in Japan resulted in 150,000 fewer cars being manufactured in the United States.  When one microchip manufacturer is damaged, that is the effect it has across the world.  As another example, we saw in the wake of the floods in Thailand that global GDP fell by 3%.  In an open economy such as ours, this is something with which we must be concerned or, as the report more succinctly states, we must be aware that disaster risk does not stop at the factory gate.</p><p>I am mindful that disasters disproportionately affect lower-income countries, communities and households, and those who benefit least from the wealth created owing to economic globalisation.  I would be interested to hear Ms Wahlstr&ouml;m's opinion on the social justice aspects of reduction programmes and, specifically, how business interests can be used as a vector and whether she believes increasing business sensitivity towards investing in risk-prepared nations will encourage governments to become more risk aware.  What does Ms Wahlstr&ouml;m believe we can do at a national level to maintain the stability of our supply chain, which is an issue we need to consider? </p><p>In looking ahead to 2015 and the renegotiation of a new risk reduction framework, what does Ms Wahlstr&ouml;m feel will be the key elements in which we, as a Seanad and as an Irish nation, can play a role when supporting this awareness and ensuring the plan will be fit for purpose?</p></speech>

We are fortunate in this country that we have not suffered any major natural disaster for a long number of years, although we sometimes take this for granted.  When one looks at some of the disasters in Asia, such as that in Japan, in Haiti and most recently in Oklahoma, we find ourselves very fortunate, but many citizens across the globe are not so fortunate.  We need to have strategies and policies that can enable us to beat nature and at least try to mitigate the worst excesses of nature when it strikes, which it unfortunately does.</p><p>We have seen huge advances in recent years in research and in the development of new technologies with regard to early warning systems.  The Leader of the House, Senator Cummins, and I were in Waterford last Friday at a research and development agency, TSSG, at the ArcLabs Research and Innovation Centre, which is a co-location of research and development companies and agencies with private companies.  Two of the companies located there are involved in developing new technologies, one of which is a virtual world which would link people who have real expertise in the geography of an area with, for example, emergency services.  Again, this is using technology in a very creative but powerful way.  If a natural disaster does happen, people who know exactly where a particular building is, what people might be in the building and the layout and design of the building, can link in very quickly with the emergency services.  This technology can be used to save lives and help people.  Similarly, a technology known as Water World has been developed jointly with Facebook with the aim of helping people who suffer from a lack of proper water provision.  It is a software technology that allows people to pay, say, 50 cent a week to be linked directly into a network of people who are supporting a person on the ground in a country where there is a water shortage, providing relief and providing water.  I was struck - and I know the Leader of the House was also - by the huge level of research and development in this area which is done in this country.  I was blown away by the potential for that technology.  On a related question, what relationship does Ms Wahlstr&ouml;m have with research and development agencies and what work is being done to encourage more of such innovation in this area, which is important?</p><p>While some disasters are natural disasters, some are not natural.  Global warming has obviously played a part also, and I would be interested to hear Ms Wahlstr&ouml;m's view on this issue.</p></speech>

I was attracted to the topic of her speech.  Last summer I volunteered in Rwanda and, looking at Ms Wahlstr&ouml;m's 30-year career, I see she was <i>in situ</i> during the genocide there.  What struck me is that, while it is a small country the size of Munster, it has 11 million people and is very much at risk of drought.  It is already a country that has been defined by genocide.  Following up on what Senator Mullen said about the role of women, that country has really been rebuilt by widows and orphans, because the majority of the men were killed.</p><p>  What is the UN doing in areas that are particularly vulnerable?  Rwanda has already suffered a human disaster and, in my view, is at risk of a natural disaster.  What does the UN do in such areas and what special measures does it have in place for people who have already suffered?  In her summation, will Ms Wahlstr&ouml;m comment on how communities rebuild after natural disasters such as hurricanes, knowing they may happen again?  I often wonder about this as I do not have that experience myself.</p><p>  What percentage of government finances, in Ms Wahlstr&ouml;m's view, should be set aside in budgets to be ready for the cost of natural disasters?  We are now suffering for the first time from climate change in the form of flooding.  Senator Mullins referred to flooding in Cork and in Galway, where I saw it happen.  We need to be ready for this.</p> <p>As well as having the emergency planning in place, we also need to have the funds.  I thank Ms Wahlstr&ouml;m for her time.</p></speech>

To put my question in context, I served on the Council of Europe until 2008 and my last report as rapporteur was on Europe's response to humanitarian disasters, on which I worked with Mr. Sergio Piazzi, now based in Malta and with whom I believe Ms Wahlstr&ouml;m also worked.  I am interested in an update on the situation from Ms Wahlstr&ouml;m, given that the aforementioned report is now five years old.  The report found that the problem facing Europe then, with regard to its role in developing an international co-ordination framework for humanitarian assistance, was political.  It found that there was no political agreement between European states as to how humanitarian assistance and civil protection, respectively, should be effectively organised.  The report states:<blockquote><br />The separate and distinct mandates for funding aid (DG-ECHO) and intervention (DG-Environment) at European Union level are symptomatic of this lack of synchrony.  As such, the current ambiguity surrounding the role of the Community Mechanism for Civil Protection is a further endorsement of this lack of political unity.  If a united co-ordination platform is to be achieved, European states first need to decide which of their interested national ministries (whether foreign affairs, home affairs, justice or other) should play the central role in co-ordinating humanitarian aid ... European-OCHA relations have therefore reached a critical stage of their development.  On the one hand, it is imperative that both parties ensure that the human values of humanitarian intervention ... remain the fundamental goal underlying any reform processes.  </blockquote>The report went on to say that &quot;the key to success of European/UN shared humanitarian assistance responsibility relates to OCHA's ability to sensitise European states to the fact that its strengths do not lie in building separate systems with distinct and autonomously activated capacities, but rather by creating a united and participative system that allows all actors involved to bring their capacities to it in a co-ordinated and complementary manner.&quot;  I invite Ms Wahlstr&ouml;m to comment on these findings.</p></speech>

We are honoured to have her here today.</p><p>An issue that is dear to Ms Wahlstr&ouml;m's heart and which she mentioned earlier is that the idea of disaster is not real for many countries.  It is not real in the way the internet was not real 20 years ago, yet now we cannot live without it.  We have not yet worked out how to make this real.  Does Ms Wahlstr&ouml;m have a view on how schools might be involved with this?  Starting with the little ones is key.  They already criticise their parents for smoking and so forth.  How can we engage with them?</p><p>More particularly, Ms Wahlstr&ouml;m mentioned the enormous investment by private companies.  In that context, what is the balance between the effort she makes with regard to private companies as against politicians?  How can politicians influence the private companies that make those investments?  Very often, private companies will write into their bottom line the penalties they know they will pay for breaching rules on the abuse of water, air, land and so on.  We have seen the evidence of that across the world.  They know already that they will have to pay and they write off &euro;5 million, &euro;50 million or whatever is appropriate.  How do we stop that?  How do we change that culture?  Without such a change, as Ms Wahlstr&ouml;m pointed out, we will not make progress, because 80% of the world's investors are private companies and they are the biggest abusers of the countryside and the land.</p></speech>

My question relates to high-risk areas in particular.  I was in Chad and the Sudanese border area in 2008.  At that time there were over 500,000 people in refugee camps.  In terms of bringing in food, the choice was to bring it through Libya to the north, Cameroon to the west or Sudan to the east.  Some of the camps were 2,500 km away from the nearest port.  At the time of my visit in March 2008, an estimated 53,000 tonnes of food had to be moved in between then and the start of June.  Has the UN identified particular areas where access is a problem?  Are plans in place to deal with areas where access is very restricted and where response times could be far longer than appropriate?  Have areas like that around the world been identified as part of the UN's risk management plan?</p></speech>

I was fascinated by her presentation and was struck, in particular, by the point she made that disasters are not just happening in poor countries but are also very much a feature in wealthier countries too.  In that context, she made reference to the US, New Zealand and Japan.  How does that change the nature of Ms Wahlstr&ouml;m's role and of UN intervention?  Are wealthier countries less likely to seek assistance from the UN?  In particular, in countries within the European Union, for example, does the EU take over the role of the UN?  How does the UN engage with the EU in the context of a disaster within the EU itself?  Ms Wahlstr&ouml;m spoke about a parliamentary advisory group but is there a formal liaison between the EU and the UN in the context of disasters in EU countries?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-05-29a.156" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Margareta Wahlstr&ouml;m" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013052900015#O00600"><p>I thank the Senators for their interesting and significant questions.  Indeed, I may have to take up the invitation to come back again another time.  I will start with the last question, which is significant not only for risk management but also in terms of understanding how the UN works with countries.  I did not mention earlier that my office is staffed by 100 people worldwide.  Some people believe that we are punching above our weight, given the number of staff we have.  In terms of the way we operate, we are leveraged by the richer countries, which do not need our money but do need co-operative engagement with us.  They need to share experiences and expertise with us.  Countries exercise a lot more peer pressure on each other than any UN official can even inspire them to think about.</p><p>What we see in the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction, or the ISDR system, as we call it, is a forum in which countries freely talk about issues that in other political settings would have a different spin.  A very senior Indian official said that the reason he liked this forum was that he got a lot of ideas and talked to a lot of people and there was no agenda, which he found unusual.  I can this is developing very rapidly.  In fact, there are some enthusiastic people who see this as the future for global collaboration among countries.  South-south co-operation is developing rapidly because it is no longer a question of the rich north and the poor south.  We are in a very different phase globally.  </p><p>The European Commission and the European Union are not filling the UN space but they do understand how the UN can be useful to the EU.  They have engaged strongly in formulating the Hyogo Framework for Action II, known as HFA II, the post-2015 framework, and putting it high on their agenda.  They are very active in this.  This follows on from the rather painful period some years ago when the European entities did not work together.  We had a very tense situation between the civil protection entities and the so-called humanitarian work.  I happened to be working in a different post at that time but I can assure this House that there has been a complete transformation since then.  The Europeans now work together in crisis response.  There is one crisis response.  The Monitoring and Information Centre, MIC, has become a very effective instrument and there is a joined-up approach with the rest of the world, including the UN agencies, to disaster response.</p> <p>In the European Commission, for internal reasons or because it was originally a very strongly humanitarian issue, the Director-General for Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection has the lead role in driving the European Commission post-2015 agenda, and she is doing that in an inclusive way.  When she came to our global platform meeting last week, she had consulted seven different DGs in order to represent the Commission's perspective on resilience and disaster risk.  I must commend the Commission because, in many ways, it is a little ahead of the UN in this strong internal mainstreaming work.  The UN has also been doing this but we have not globalised it as strongly as the Commission.  It has covered the environment, health, climate, finance and humanitarian and development agenda.  The Irish Presidency has been strongly driving the resilience approach and that is becoming a well-packaged external framework for all of this thinking.  I am pleased as a participant, a beneficiary and an observer, and I am quite impressed by how Europe is coming together on this.</p><p>I was asked whether the UN had identified areas that are particularly challenged in terms of access as part of a risk management approach.  It has from the perspective of peace and security, political affairs and humanitarian assistance and it is very much linked to how the UN operates in different countries.  Access is not always related to political issues but to a genuine conflict issue and getting in the way of open conflict.  The UN has tried to develop a much more practical approach to its own security management, but that is only part of the parcel.  The largest security management element is the people we are trying to assist and how they are affected by the presence of international organisations.  It is not always positive.  In countries of which I have much more experience, such as Afghanistan, it has a negative image today but I have just been there to try to engage more strongly in disaster risk reduction and building national institutions.  When one is there, one can see that some of the security and safety issues are related to the international presence but they are not all identical necessarily to the national risks.  The complexities lead not to global statements about access but more localised understanding of access and they are very much related to specific operations.</p><p>There is a great deal of locally fuelled conflict in South Sudan.  I am not an expert on the country but I follow it closely because we all want South Sudan to succeed.  I was pleased to see the country participate in our global meeting last week, which means its officials also have their eye on the future.  This is a positive message.</p><p>Senator O'Keeffe had a question about schools and education and also mentioned public awareness.  I often ask, in discussion with both governments and the business sector, if there was only one thing we could do much more of, what would it be?  They all say public awareness and education, which needs to be much more systematic.  Ever since we started work, we have said disaster risk should be integrated into school curricula, starting at primary level, in the context of how to protect one's self against accidents and learning basic safety procedures.  It should not be dropped there.  We have all seen pictures of children hiding under school benches to protect their heads against earthquakes, which works.  Japan discovered painfully following the tsunami in 2011 that young people also have to be educated to take their own decisions and to use their judgment, because there were tragic examples of children, doing exactly what they had been told, waiting for an instruction to leave, and none of them survived.  Japan is rethinking its education approach and considering how to give people the self-confidence that militarists call &quot;situational awareness&quot;.  One Senator mentioned the ability to respond to a crisis situation.  Situational awareness is needed.  One can plan and prepare but no event is similar to the previous one, and therefore one needs to develop one's basic instincts and reactions.</p><p>Secondary and higher education are critical.  One of the enormous gaps that exists today is that it is still, surprisingly, unique at university level that the main curricula do not include risk.  Not even engineers include it.  If they think of risk, it is not the type of risk we see.  Risk management is gradually making its way into agriculture, engineering, water management, psychology, education and law programmes.  When I raise this and tell my colleagues in academia and university that we have to be much more serious about this, they say it is very difficult.  I acknowledge it is difficult but they say there is no jobs market for this.  There is, and it is developing rapidly.  It is one of the big areas in which we do not have enough expertise.  There is high demand for expertise in managing risks in all kinds of technical area.  Strong academic networks around the world are trying to promote this but they are not yet there.</p><p>The other aspect of education is that if we include education about disasters in our country's geography, history, philosophy and religion curricula, we learn to live with our disasters.  We learn from them in an active manner.  It is integrated in our thinking and we get to know our country a little better.  It is also easier to talk about things that in some places are seen to be rather traumatic events.  I still meet many senior officials who say they do not want to talk to their people about disasters because they may panic.  My humble answer, I hope, is that they will panic much more if they are not told, because with social media today, people have all kinds of information.  If the authorities do not tell them anything, people will start second-guessing.  The authorities do not have the right of interpretation any more unless they use it proactively, and this creates, in many instances, a serious confidence gap between people and their national authorities.  Governments are more important than ever before because we want to have authority and we need an authoritative, credible voice, but if that is absent, social media are not a good substitute.  They are good for many things but not to issue an authoritative opinion on the risk of an earthquake, for example.</p><p>I was asked about the role of private business and politicians.  I will share my observation, which has been confirmed by many of those involved.  Automatically, when one comes to the point of what to do, businesses say they do not need more regulation, while governments tend to see their role as regulators as the primary one.  The missing link is the honest conversation between business and the public sector, which can create that common space where each can take their responsibility for resilience - businesses because they need to make money and governments because they need safety.</p> <p>I have watched many of these interactions.  They are polite but never go to the core of the issue.  What we see, and what political leaders may also see, is that the work we are doing is really about creating the common space.  In the United Nations, all we can do is develop the conversation with each party progressively so that practical action can be taken.  Of course, it is a case of some regulations but, very often, areas are over-regulated, thereby creating more risks.  There is no obvious blueprint.  One must really detect what the core issues are.</p><p>When one notes how many companies are involved in the World Economic Forum's work on resilience and the surveys carried out on chief executive officers' main worries every year, one realises these are critical issues on the agenda.  In some years, it may be a question of global governance or financial risk and, in others, it may be a question of disaster risk, and climatic risk for sure.  There is interest but the challenge concerns how to move out of the preconditioned roles.  This is an important area for political leaders in all countries.</p><p>A question was asked on how communities rebuild after disasters.  Normally, it occurs very painfully.  Since there is so much public attention paid to a disaster - even if it is a localised disaster, help very often comes from other parts of society - the most difficult period is the reconstruction period.  It is costly and takes time and really wears people down.  It diminishes people's patience, exacerbates the economic impact and suffering, creates psychological and family problems, and can result in alcoholism and unemployment.  These are all the negative factors.  Some say reconstruction also fuels economic growth.  This occurs sometimes but the effect is very much temporary, as all the research shows.  This is the main area in which countries can still learn a lot from each other.</p><p>I was asked about the budget for disaster relief.  Over the past three years, some of the richest countries and some of the not-so-rich ones have been saying governments can no longer cope and that all of society must take responsibility.  That is because reconstruction costs are so great and because of shrinking governments.  Hence, the need for an all-of-society approach.  In many countries, it is a question of paying for the disaster event itself.  Who pays?  Many governments feel they are already paying too much and they are putting a ceiling on the budget, particularly in Europe.  Businesses never talk about how much they pay because it is a competition issue.  Communities and citizens have no idea what is paid because somehow they do not attach dollar value to their losses.  In some countries, insurance companies compensate and, in others, the government will give compensation.  In the overwhelming majority of cases, however, this does not happen.  The next realisation period will be when citizens discover this is a bit too much.  The various strands need to be budgeted and planned for separately because there are different types of processes involved.</p><p>Local government can handle a lot but cannot succeed alone.  Financial resources will be scarce.  The insurance industry can do a lot more but it has also taken a beating by virtue of increasing losses.  The insurance industry is one that needs to develop a different kind of conversation with the public sector because there is a mutual effort to try to transfer the risk.  Governments are trying to transfer it to the private sector while the latter is trying to transfer it to governments.  This is not a very productive path forward.  We are trying to encourage the insurance industry to deal with this.</p><p>Rwanda  is a very interesting example.  As stated, it has been very much rebuilt by widows, by women.  Rwanda, amazingly, is something of a gold-star country in our work, so much so that it is definitely advising other countries on how to build resilience in respect of women's initiatives and how to revitalise community action as a way forward.  Much has been done on climatic and economic structural vulnerabilities.  The country is densely populated.  For sure, all the historical problems have not been settled.  If there is a political slippage in Rwanda with a consequent economic impact, there will be a risk that all the traditional conflicts over resources and challenges will recur.  Today, we are impressed with the work Rwanda is doing and how its authorities have managed to hold the country together according to strong priorities.  I am conscious of the role Rwanda plays in east Africa and elsewhere.  We must support Rwanda through keeping an eye on the risk factors that could destabilise the country.  It is not at all certain that Rwanda will have the same leadership in the future as it has now.  That is an obvious point.</p><p>Reference was made to technology.  There may be business opportunities associated with ignoring the factors I describe, taking shortcuts and being disruptive, but there are also considerable business opportunities associated with resilience development, as there are in developing energy technology, better housing and land-use planning technologies.  That is one area that the United Nations, European Union and many other organisations recognise as growing.</p><p>Another factor concerns communities.  I refer to self-organising communities in respect of which social media will change the landscape.  There is no doubt about it.  We hope that the new level of social mobilisation will empower local governments and communities to attract much more respect for the work they already do and to be entrusted to do much more work on resilience building.  This would surely stimulate the engagement of the science and technology sectors such that knowledge can be used much more practically to assist at local level.</p><p>A question was asked on social justice and business opportunities.  Developing the thinking of businesses in terms of their being members of a community concerns justice issues.  It is a question of employees' income and good business reputation.  Some businesses are working very well in this regard.  We hope they will have an influence over others so their example will spread.  This message will be strong in the post-2015 era because community groups themselves are now so strongly present.  They talk to companies.  They talk directly to those that can do better.</p><p>I wish to comment on risk assessment.  It is a very basic start.  Although many countries and local governments invest in risk assessment, too many risk assessment reports sit on a bookshelf and are not transformed into practical action.</p><p>My final point is on floating responsibility for managing risk.  Sometimes it lies with the civil defence, at other times with the Prime Minister's office, and at other times with the office of the Minister responsible for the environment.  The big leap forward that we must achieve between now and 2015 involves moving from having one model of governance to having an understanding that governance associated with managing risk is different from managing the response to disasters.</p> <p>It needs to sit in a very central place in a government or an organisation and needs to be clearly defined.  The practices are set.  We have tried to put them together and show why this is a critical part of moving forward the knowledge agenda.</p></speech>

I was just about to conclude when the debate was adjourned yesterday.  I commend the Bill to the House.  It is vital that we provide the operational tools to the Garda and other enforcement agencies to enable them to combat terrorism and money laundering.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-05-29a.168" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1153" speakername="Catherine Noone" time="13:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013052900019#S00500"><p>This Bill, originally entitled the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) (Amendment) Bill 2013, amends the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010.  Some of the amendments were beyond the scope of the original Title and, as such, it has been renamed.</p><p>Before dealing with the significant money laundering and terrorist financing sections of the Bill, I will begin by focusing on the changes that have necessitated its new Title.  The amendments inserted at Part 3 deal with serious threats to life or property arising from a remote explosive device, similar to the powers already in operation in other parts of the world.  Such provisions are in place in Britain and Northern Ireland, for instance, covering any event where a mobile telephone could be used as a detonation trigger which is enabled upon ringing the handset.  Such set-ups are frequently found in bombing devices.  Part 3 allows for a two-tier process which will render these devices unviable by means of shutting down mobile telephone reception in a given area for a set period of time.  It is a sad fact of modern-day security that terrorists are willing to take advantage of such cowardly stratagems which cause terrible loss of life and limb, as seen in countless tragic events in recent years.</p><p>The provision in Part 3 is necessary to ensure we have the proper mechanism and tools in place to deal with such eventualities.  The system provides for a two-step process with decisions at ministerial and Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na level.  An application must be made by a garda of assistant commissioner rank or higher to the Minister for authorisation to issue directions for the restriction of mobile telephone coverage in a given area.  There is a 24-hour limit on the period for which such an authorisation may be acted upon.  A central element of Part 3 is the proposed section 24 which provides for a member of the Garda of chief superintendent rank or higher, having received a ministerial authorisation, to direct a mobile telephone service provider to cease providing services in a particular area at a particular time.  This will ensure there are adequate checks and fall-back mechanisms in place.  Similarly, this direction is limited to a six-hour duration.</p><p>I will now deal with the money laundering provisions of the Bill.  The Financial Action Task Force, FATF, is an international body set up to counter money laundering on a global basis.  While the FATF has had some success in containing the threat internationally, new mechanisms and techniques are constantly emerging.  As such, the level of money laundering has remained broadly steady in the western world in the past 15 years.  This legislation comes before us in the wake of a report last year by the Central Bank which found that our financial institutions were failing to comply fully with the law in regard to money laundering.  The Central Bank carried out an inspection ranging over 18 months which involved auditing 60 financial institutions throughout the country.  The revelations were surprising, with a significantly lower level of compliance with the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 than had been anticipated.</p><p>It is clear, therefore, that a further strengthening of the rules is necessary.  Moreover, as a result of our non-compliance in this area, Ireland was put on what is called the follow-up process by the FATF.  Addressing deficiencies in the legislation and improving Ireland's FATF rating were identified by the Central Bank as vital elements in improving our ability to compete for international business.  The third money laundering directive from the European Union was enacted under the previous money laundering Act.  However, a fourth anti-money laundering directive is expected later this year, which may necessitate further legislation in this area in the future.</p><p>I am mindful of the cost of compliance with measures to combat money laundering.  In this regard, I am satisfied to see that the main proposed amendment to the 2010 Act relates to customer due diligence measures rather than transaction monitoring.  The Bill deals adequately with a number of issues in respect of money laundering, terrorist financing and other specific aspects of potential terrorist and criminal activity.  I commend it to the House.</p></speech>

T&aacute; na leasuithe at&aacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh ag an mBille seo bunaithe ar eolas at&aacute; ag na garda&iacute; agus ag an Roinn le tr&iacute; bliana anuas.</p><p>We must constantly strive to ensure that the provision in our law to combat money laundering is of the highest calibre.  I take this opportunity to commend the work of the Garda money laundering investigation unit which, in co-operation with the Revenue Commissioners, undertakes extremely important and complex domestic and international investigations.  Senator Feargal Quinn mentioned the need for financial investigations to be carried out in tandem with investigations into other crimes such as human trafficking.  I assure him that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na draws on all its specialist units, including the money laundering investigation unit, to support multifaceted investigations.  We all absolutely condemn those who would and have used explosives to terrorise, maim and kill.  Such appalling activities deserve and have our contempt and abhorrence.</p><p>At the opposite end of the scale are the tremendous commitment, dedication, professionalism and bravery of those who put themselves in harm's way to protect citizens.  The men and women of the Defence Forces, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the fire service and so on, who respond to 999 calls and must act when a bomb is discovered, deserve our deepest gratitude.  They put their own lives on the line for us and thus represent the very highest in human generosity and courage.  The annual memorial day for members of the Garda was held just ten days ago.  It is sad to recall all of those on the roll of honour who died in the line of duty.  The roll now contains 87 names, the latest being that of Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe.  His murder was an unspeakable act and nothing we say can lessen the pain for his family and colleagues.  They can be assured, however, that we will not forget the evil that was done, nor Detective Garda Donohoe's service, courage and ultimate sacrifice.</p><p>We as legislators must do all we can to support the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces in the dangerous work they undertake.  The provisions in Part 3 of the Bill offer them an additional tool in dealing with the threat posed by the use of explosive devices.</p> <p>While clearly the cessation of mobile telephone services represents a substantial interference in everyday life, the measures the Bill provides are absolutely necessary and proportionate.  It addresses serious threats to life and it contains safeguards to ensure that its powers cannot be used lightly or for long.</p><p> I thank Senator O'Donovan for his support for the Bill and for his kind words of support for the efforts of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter.  He raised the issue of Garda resources.  The principle goal of the Minister, Deputy Shatter, is to ensure that the maximum possible resources are available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in these difficult economic circumstances.  Since coming into office we have increased the funding for the Garda from what was previously planned.  We have funded the purchase of vehicles and new rosters have been introduced which maximise the availability of Garda personnel at peak times.</p><p> The matter of fuel smuggling and the activities of dissidents were raised by other Senators.  A cross-border task force involving the PSNI, the United Kingdom HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs, the United Kingdom Serious Organised Crime Agency, the Garda, the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Revenue Commissioners has been established to specifically target the distribution of illegal fuel.  A multi-agency investigation in March into profits from the illegal fuel trade resulted in the seizure of significant amounts of cash, laundered fuel and records relating to a fuel laundering operation, with more than 25 bank accounts now frozen on foot of this action.</p><p> Senator Bacik raised several issues.  The Bill provides for a geographical area addressed by a cessation direction to potentially extend to the whole area of the State.  This is tempered by the requirement of section 22(2)(<i>c</i>) and section 24(6) to have regard for the need to limit the effect of a cessation.  While I cannot divulge the operational details of how the Garda addresses a threat of the type that the Bill addresses, I assure the House that it is envisaged that if a cessation is ever directed it will most likely be for a limited period and limited in terms of the areas affected.  Having carefully considered the matter in consultation with the Attorney General's Office it was decided that the Bill would have to allow for the possibility of the geographical area theoretically covering the entire State.  However, it is unlikely that an authorisation would ever be sought in these terms.</p><p> Other Senators, including Senator Norris, raised the question of access to emergency calls.  Landlines will be unaffected.  This Bill only provides for a cessation of mobile telephone services subject to the limitations mentioned.  I am advised that it is technically feasible for mobile networks to be adjusted in order that 999 services can continue to be available during a cessation.  Mobile telephone companies are required by section 25(3) to endeavour to continue to provide 999 services during a cessation.  Given the urgency with which this legislation has been progressed, it has not been possible to put in place an absolute requirement to maintain the 999 call services at such short notice but mobile telephone companies will be expected to fulfil their obligations under section 25(3) to the best of their ability.  This situation can be kept under review and further measures may be considered at a later stage if necessary.</p><p> The question of providing for a nominated person in the undertakings, that is, mobile telephone companies, to receive directions was also raised.  The companies have co-operated fully with the Garda on the development of the procedural arrangements and the Garda is grateful for their positive and helpful engagement.  The provisions will be of assistance to those companies.  Putting in place this legislation will ensure that any actions they take on foot of a direction to withdraw services are required by law.  I assure Senators that at an operational level An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has no concerns.</p><p> The question of the appropriateness of the delegation to a ministerial official as provided for in section 28 has also been raised.  This measure is provided to cover situations in which the Minister is not in a position to consider an application for an authorisation.  It is limited to nominated officers of assistant secretary grade or higher.</p><p> Senator Harte asked about the ability of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to address a situation where the signal from a mobile telephone network in Northern Ireland might be used to detonate a bomb in the South.  The Bill under discussion today can only allow for the coercive powers it contains to be directed at undertakings operating in our State.  The scenario Senator Harte raised would be addressed in co-operation with the PSNI, which has powers under the law in Northern Ireland to issue directions to mobile telephone companies in Northern Ireland.  Similarly, information received from the authorities in Northern Ireland about an imminent serious threat could form the basis for an authorisation and direction to companies in this jurisdiction to cease mobile telephone services in the Border area, where a signal could be used to detonate a bomb on the northern side.</p><p> Senator Norris is absolutely correct - he is a politically exposed person, PEP, but he can take comfort from the fact that he is not alone, because all of us are as parliamentarians.  The third EU anti-money-laundering directive and EU convention on corruption lay down certain requirements for additional money-laundering controls for PEPs.  At present, the controls only apply to PEPs resident outside the State.  Technically, that makes Senator Norris an uncontrolled PEP.  I am unsure what he thinks of that but I imagine he will have something to say about it.</p><p> The proposals of the Mahon tribunal for extension of those controls to PEPs resident in the State will be addressed in the context of our consideration of the fourth EU anti-money-laundering directive when it is enacted to ensure compliance with its provisions.</p><p> Reference was made to the timing of the Bill with regard to the G8 summit next month.  It makes absolute sense to have the tools it provides available when a group of prominent world leaders are meeting in County Fermanagh.  The summit is an occasion that terrorist groups might try to exploit.  Let me be exceptionally clear, however: the powers provided by Part 3 cannot simply be used on spec.  The legislation does not allow for mobile telephone systems to be shut down in case a threat might arise.  An authorisation or direction can only be issued where there is an imminent serious threat.  The Bill is, therefore, a balanced measure.  It provides for some improvement to our anti-money-laundering and terrorist financing legislation.  It provides a necessary and proportionate system for tackling explosive devices which exploit mobile telephone technology.  I thank the House for consideration of the Bill today.</p></speech>

This is an issue on which everyone is on the same side.  There are several people in the Visitors Gallery who are survivors of cancer and I welcome them too.</p><p>  On previous visits to the House, the Minister has stated the cost of tobacco smoking to the health service is &euro;1 billion a year.  The Health Service Executive estimates 5,000 people die from smoking while anti-smoking groups put it at 7,000.  Today, if someone announced he had invented tobacco but it would lead to so many deaths and cost the health service &euro;1 billion, there is no way we would license the product.  The Stamp Out Smoking campaign aims to eliminate tobacco consumption from the landscape by 2030.  We have to get it across to the industry that it is time to wind up and that we cannot allow this commodity to continue.</p><p>  If this amendment is of use to the Minister as he plots his course in tackling tobacco consumption, I say more power to his elbow.  I do not want to divide the House as there are no pro-smoking Members present.</p><p>  It was the Minister who first suggested, and it was discussed this morning on &#8220;Morning Ireland&#8221;, plain wrapping for cigarette packets.  If the Minister and others have evidence that younger people are attracted to smoking by colourful packaging, then this amendment would introduce plain packaging to deal with that issue.  This also allows the Seanad to express its support for the Minister in his intention in this regard.</p><p>  As part of the general idea that this commodity would not be licensed if it were introduced today, we must commit to a programme to reduce the availability of this seriously damaging product.  The amendment proposes that tobacco products should not be on sale in a licensed premise or filling station so as to reduce the availability of this damaging and toxic product.</p> <p>The Minister will undoubtedly have his own timetable of how he intends to tackle this problem, and the first item concerning plain packaging is taken from the Minister, as I have said.  Were he considering other measures to reduce and hopefully eliminate it, and I would seek to eliminate it long before 2030, we would not sell cigarettes in licensed premises because one cannot smoke them there.  In addition, it is probably undesirable that one should smoke anywhere near a filling station.  We will later propose measures to restrict smoking in road vehicles.</p><p>Those are the two proposals we put forward in this section as suggestions to the Minister as part of a programme to curtail the consumption of tobacco because licensed premises and filling stations might be two good places to start.  In recognition of the way this industry attracts young people despite all the medical evidence - the Minister, as a medical man, knows this better than anybody - the plain packaging would be a good deterrent to stop young people taking up smoking.</p></speech>

I hope they are enjoying their day and I wish them every success in their studies.  I welcome the Minister.  In dealing with the Bill, I welcome the proposal by Senator Barrett.  Obviously, the matter needs further attention.  With regard to graphic images on packaging, which the Minister has pushed very much, my office has been involved in carrying out a survey on this issue in the past two to three months.  The results are interesting in that people who smoke have indicated to us that graphic images are causing them to think long and hard about trying to move away from smoking.  This is also highlighting the long-term health costs that smokers will incur in the years to come, aside from the financial cost.  It is an important issue to highlight.</p><p>With regard to Senator Barrett's amendment on the restriction of sale in licensed premises and filling stations, from a competition point of view I am not sure whether we can do that immediately, but it is obviously something we should consider and should not ignore.  I welcome the fact this Bill is being put forward and that we will see it on the Statute Book in a short time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-05-29a.186" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013052900022#W00400"><p>I thank the Senators for their support and for the sentiments expressed.  I will first refer to Senator Barrett's proposed amendment relating to the introduction of plain packaging.  As the Senator is aware, Government approval was given yesterday to proceed with such legislation, and I am delighted with the Government's support and its decision in this regard.  Despite the ban on tobacco advertising, the ban on point of sale display and the introduction of graphic warnings, a gap still exists which I believe can now be eliminated by the introduction of plain packaging.  While I have forgotten to bring them with me, I demonstrated on television yesterday the type of new cigarette pack that is available, which looks very much like perfume and is particularly aimed at young girls.  We must compare and contrast that with the reality of what smoking does to people, which is why we want to see a plain pack.  It is said that the pack is the silent salesman or the mobile billboard for the industry.  The reason they are fighting us so hard on this and in Australia is that they know it works, and it is their last area of advertising.</p><p>The Senator referred to the 5,200 people who die in this country every year from tobacco smoking.  He is absolutely right, and in fact some 700,000 Europeans die each year from smoking.  The tobacco companies have to replace the people who give up and those who sadly die with new recruits, and it is very clear from the surveys we have done that they are going after our kids.  Some 78% of smokers in the survey said they started smoking in this country under the age of 18.  This begs the question of what choice a person has when he or she is already addicted at the age of 18.</p><p>However, a considerable amount of work must now take place on the details of the heads of the Bill.  This will not be a cakewalk by any means.  Property rights, intellectual rights and every device known to man will be brought to bear by the tobacco companies in order to block this, so we have to make sure we prepare the Bill carefully and that it will stand up to legal scrutiny.  I obviously support the principle of the proposed amendment, but this amendment, as drafted, would not successfully meet the needs of the introduction of such an initiative.  With this in mind, I reiterate my strong commitment and that of the Government to the development of the legislation.  I regret that I am unable to accept the amendment but I accept wholeheartedly the principle and the sentiment behind it.</p><p>I will now refer to Senator Barrett's proposed amendment in regard to the sale of tobacco in licensed premises and filling stations.  My Department is in the process of finalising a new tobacco policy which will set out plans for reducing the numbers who smoke in Ireland.  I intend to bring this policy to Government very soon.  The new policy will contain two themes, namely, protecting children and the denormalisation of smoking in our society.  The Senators will be aware of the strong stance I have taken regarding our children and young people smoking.  While the number of young people smoking has been steadily declining, thankfully, the number is still far too high, in my view.  No one measure will effectively reduce the numbers smoking.  A suite of measures must be put in place and these measures will be outlined in the tobacco policy.  Part of that policy includes looking at the current situation regarding the sale of tobacco products with a view to examining any changes that may be required into the future.</p><p>While I understand and support the principle set out in the amendment, I regret that I am unable to accept it.  Consideration is currently being given to any legislative changes that may be required following the publication of the Tobacco Free Policy Review Group report next month.  I can assure the Senator I am committed to implementing the recommendations contained in that report and I am 100% committed to ridding this country of the scourge of tobacco use given the premature deaths it causes, the lives it ruins and the families it devastates.  We have to tackle this head on.  I said publicly yesterday and I will say it again that I believe tobacco companies are the purveyors of death.  One in two who use their products will die.  It is inescapable.  If we had a drug that could save 5,200 Irish lives a year or 700,000 European lives a year, there would not be a single voice in this country not calling for it.</p></speech>

I also welcome the Minister's comments on what he called the "denormalisation" of smoking by reducing the number of retail outlets.  What I had in my own notes was that we need to "de-escalate" smoking, so it would be available in fewer and fewer places until, eventually, it is eliminated.  I thank the Minister for his response to both of the points.  I assure him of my continued support.  In the very welcome light of what he said, I will not press the amendment.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-05-29a.191" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013052900022#W00900"><p>I move amendment No. 3:<blockquote><br />In page 4, before section 2, to insert the following new section:<br />&#8220;2.--The consumption of tobacco products shall be forbidden throughout any place of employment, education, healthcare, sporting venues, areas in the vicinity of such places and in motor vehicles.&#8221;.</blockquote>Again, this is very much in line with what the Minister has said.  It is worthwhile for the Seanad to convey its views and I welcome the views of Senator Colm Burke, as always, on health issues.  There was a commendable stand, as I recall it, by the trade unions employed in the licensed trade, which pressed very strongly that these licensed premises are places of employment and that employees would prefer not to be inhaling toxic smoke.  I look askance at the development of smoking places in the vicinity of places of employment.</p> <p>I wonder whether it is time to push that out.  It is controlled in licensed premises but one does see places around various offices and outside shopping centres where people get together to smoke.  </p><p>The board of Trinity College Dublin, which I attended this morning, has decided to support Professor Shane Allwright's move towards a smoke-free campus.  I understand that other universities are moving towards that as well.  There are two dimensions to that.  One is that this is applying science for the benefit of society, which is what institutes of education should do.  The science on this is so definite, as the Minister has said, that if we can persuade people not to smoke this commodity, their lives will be inestimably improved.  If universities have that knowledge, they have a duty to push it out and assist the Minister in what he is trying to do in this regard.  </p><p>There is also the education aspect.  If we have responsibility for very large numbers of people - 16,000 in Trinity College - those in charge have a duty, as part of the education process, to say &quot;We are not allowing smoking here because it is bad for you.  It is part of your education to realise how harmful this will be.&quot;  I mentioned one university that is already working on it and I think there are others planning to do it.  Explaining to the cohorts of young people for whom they have responsibility that all the knowledge we have says that this is really bad for and detrimental to them is part of their educational role.  </p><p>On the previous occasion, we mentioned an eminent surgeon who quibbled or disputed that he was performing expensive heart operations on people who would not give up smoking.  People not changing their conduct is a classic illustration of a burden on the health service.  The other aspect I have in mind are smoking dens or zones outside hospitals.  There is no place for them in the message we are trying to get across that one is not doing one's relatives or friends in hospital any favour by having smoking dens around hospitals.  We are expending lots of money to make people healthier and smoking should not take place on a hospital campus.  </p><p>Smoking at sporting venues contradicts the message of sport.  On a recent visit to Croke Park, I was disappointed to find that smoking dens have come into play there.  It totally contradicts what sport is about in promoting healthy lifestyles.  Smoking seems to break out informally outside places of employment, colleges and schools.  Is it possible to extend the non-smoking zone as part of the denormalisation of smoking policy mentioned by the Minister?  </p><p>There were two concerns about motor vehicles, which relate to the final part of that amendment.  Regrettably, Senator Crown is in the US but will be here to support the Minister.  It is the fact that a car is such a confined space that makes smoking in it so damaging to children.  It is like being put in a wardrobe with somebody who is smoking.  We have a duty of care regarding protecting those children from adults smoking in cars.  Is this the adjunct to the mobile phone penalties the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has been imposing?  Does somebody trying to light up, flicking out the ash and lighting up a new one represent a danger in addition to driving in a smoke-filled vehicle?  As part of the Minister's denormalisation, we do not want people smoking in motor vehicles.  They have enough to do driving that vehicle safely on the roads of Ireland.  We also have a duty to protect other people present in those vehicles.  </p><p>That section extends the smoking ban, which has been an absolute boon to people who work in licensed premises.  Mandate deserves great credit in tougher times for supporting the Minister in the face of those who said the pub would die if people could not smoke in it.  They were major supporters of the Department of Health.  Education should take up the cudgel on the Minister's behalf.  It involves the promotion of accurate representation of what science has found for the benefit of society, namely, that people should not take part in this activity.  It is taking responsibility for 18 to 22-year-olds in universities and younger groups in other areas.  </p><p>We mentioned the incongruity of people smoking and requiring hugely expensive surgery allied to that.  Of course, we want to help people but we require a contribution from them as well.  I am disappointed to see that smoking is developing in sporting venues.  We mentioned that smoking in motor vehicles is damaging to other people in them and may be a source of accidents.  I think smoking is banned anyway where the motor vehicle is a place of employment.  Somebody spoke to me this morning about the incredible change in the upstairs sections of buses in Dublin since smoking was eliminated and how much better it is.  </p><p>That is a selection of ways to promote the Minister's general view of denormalising smoking and moving to curtail it.  I would move to eliminate it long before 2030 but if the Minister is looking at a new shelf of restrictions, perhaps some of the ideas we have in there might be of value.</p></speech>

Section 2 of the Bill repeals and revokes those provisions of the 1978 Act and the 1991 regulations in respect of tobacco products that were deemed to contain price fixing provisions by the European Court of Justice.  I am very disappointed with the judgment.  I am on record here in the past as saying that I want to tackle this and have written to Commissioner Borg about it.  Tobacco and alcohol are issues of public health and reside in the Directorate General for Health and Consumers and should not be under the Directorate General for Competition.  Public health and the common good should supersede commercial considerations in respect of these issues.  I am certainly seeking ways to find a legal basis and political support for doing that.</p><p>Senator Barrett spoke about hospitals.  Certainly, most hospital campuses will now be smoke-free.  The Department of Health is one such campus.  That is not to underestimate the addictive nature of this problem.  I have seen patients with a small oxygen cylinder on their back sneaking out of a ward to go to the toilet to have a cigarette.  Somebody very near and dear to me continued to smoke right up to the time he passed away.  This is a really serious addiction, involving probably one of the most addictive substances known to man.  The Senator is absolutely right.  If we were asked to bring this product to market now, there is no question that it would never be legalised.  </p><p>The Senator's comments about education are 100% right but education is a very broad stroke that happens at home.  I have previously mentioned anecdotal evidence of kids going home to their parents crying and saying &quot;Mammy, you're going to die&quot;, being reassured by their parent that they were not going to die, asked why they would think that and replying &quot;Teacher says people who smoke die and you smoke.&quot;  Immediately, there is a conflict so we need to educate parents and children and continue that education right through their childhood, particularly in their early teenage years when they are particularly vulnerable.  </p><p>I smoked once and have yet to meet anyone who told me that their first cigarette did not make them feel unwell so why do they persist?  They persist because it looks cool and because of the advertisements and subtle subconscious message that one will look cool among one's peers if one smokes.  </p> <p>Or course, once addicted it is too late to realise the error of one's ways.  However, it is never too late to give up and people should continue to try to give up smoking until they succeed.  Every time a person tries it is easier to stay off them a little longer.  We need to do as much as possible to support the smoker to become an ex-smoker.  As I have said before, I am not anti-smoker, I am anti-smoking and I am anti-tobacco.  </p><p>On the issue of smoking in cars, when children are not in the car we have examined this in the past and we will look at it again before any law is introduced.  However, there are privacy laws around that too and I do not know that it can be done.  I wrote to Commissioner Borg expressing the frustration in Ireland with that ruling and that Seanad &Eacute;ireann, in particular, was frustrated. </p><p>With regard to many of these proposals from Senators, the tobacco policy will set out key recommendations in efforts to denormalise smoking.  Senator Barrett's amendment deals with the important issue of extending the ban on smoking to other areas.  The tobacco policy will set out recommendations in this area involving partnership with and participation by many key stakeholders, for example, local authorities and education organisations.  The Government has taken this on board.</p><p>The Healthy Ireland initiative was launched by the Government a few months ago and it involves all Departments.  There is a full realisation that in the past the Department of Health has been associated with ill-health, with curing disease, instead of being associated with proactively maintaining good health.  We realise that other Departments such as those with responsibility for education, justice, the environment, arts and culture, tourism, transport, sport, all need to be involved and to interact.  Yesterday I was very pleased to be at the launch of the Slow Down campaign with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the National Road Safety Authority because this aims to keep people safe on the roads and it is a critical message at this time of year.  Such a campaign transposes across many Departments from health to justice, the environment and social protection.  A total of 75 people have died on the roads this year to date and it is not known how many families have been devastated in the process.  Many people have been injured who will spend the remainder of their lives dealing with an injury or a disability.  I am thinking of parents of a younger person who is injured and may have suffered a brain injury.  They will spend the rest of their lives worrying about how that child will be cared for when they go.  All that pain and suffering can be avoided as well as all those admissions to our hospitals if people slow down on the roads.  However, so many more deaths occur in multiples of tens and hundreds because of tobacco but we can do something about that.  We can protect our children and that is what we aim to do by bringing in plain packaging.  I am very pleased that we have such support across all parties and across this House and the other House.</p><p>I thank Fingal County Council, my own local authority, for being one of the first to ban smoking in playgrounds.  I would like to see that ban extended to beaches and parks and anywhere children are present.  I refer to the saying, &quot;Monkey does as monkey sees&quot;.   I note there is a current advertisement on television that promotes this idea with the father rubbing his chin and the young fellow beside him imitating him.  If children see a parent smoking it does not matter how much they are educated, they will smoke because they think it is okay.</p><p>I regret I cannot accept the Senator's amendment.  I endorse the banning of smoking in other areas, whether by legislation or voluntary measures and I am committed to progressing work in this area as a priority.  Senators will be aware that I have supported in principle a Private Members' Bill in this House which proposes a ban on smoking in cars with children present because I agree with every sentiment the Senator has expressed.  The idea of a child locked into a baby seat, unable to escape from what amounts to a giant mobile ashtray which is how it was described, is pretty shocking.  </p><p>A number of productive meetings have been held on this Bill.  I understand progress is being made by my officials, Senators Crown, van Turnhout and Daly and the Department of the Justice and Equality, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.  I have asked my officials to progress this Bill as a priority.</p><p>I note the Senators' opposition to section 2 and I understand their frustration in this regard.  I reiterate my disappointment at the necessity to put forward these amendments but it is in order to comply with the European Court of Justice ruling and to avoid infringement proceedings being instigated against Ireland.  I again state my commitment to tackling at EU level the broader issue of the priority given to public health initiatives.  </p><p>Senators should also bear in mind that the Government retains the option of increasing the excise duty on cigarettes which would counter any decreases in prices introduced by the tobacco industry.  There have been a number of tax increases on tobacco in the past and it is my intention that this practice be continued into the future.  As I have said here on other occasions, I would love if each cigarette cost &euro;1 so that people would think long and hard before inhaling long and hard.  </p><p>The Health Ireland initiative which is a cross-departmental initiative wishes to examine how all the areas of government can co-operate in order to reduce the impact of tobacco smoking as well as promoting more healthy lifestyles.  </p><p>I regret that I am unable to accept the Senator's amendment.  However, I ask him to be assured of my absolute commitment - which I know he shares - to ridding our country and the European Union of this scourge and to protect our children in the future.</p></speech>

On the question of privacy, the Minister and I are <i>ad idem</i>.  It seems to me that the cigarette is as lethal as the mobile phone and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, has been persuaded with regard to the latter.  I refer to trying to light a cigarette while driving and attempting to flick out the ash and throw away the butt because these actions are very distracting.  That is my response to those who fear that there is a privacy issue at stake.</p><p>  I agree with the Minister on the policy of increasing the excise duties since the decision of the court leaves him with little alternative.  However, our most helpful Oireachtas Library and Research Service has provided information that the tobacco price here is at 217% of the European average.  We have the highest priced cigarettes in Europe.  The price is there as a weapon and I will support the Minister in using it.  However, we need all these supportive measures.  I welcome all he said about the tobacco control policy and I look forward to seeing it in practice.  My suggestions are offered in that spirit.  Price has not been able to control the level of smoking.  The UK price is 166% of the European average and the price in France is at 133%.  The price in Ireland is nearly double the French price but it is still not sufficient a deterrent to the 5,200 people facing death each year as a result of this product.  </p><p>  I welcome all the news from the Minister about a ban in places of employment, education, health care and we agree on sporting venues.  I welcome what he said about tobacco use in motor vehicles and the progress being made in the talks with Senator Crown, Senator van Turnhout and other Members about the damage to children.  We hoped the Bill might be enacted in time for the summer period when people travel on holidays in order to help children travel smoke-free.  I wish the Minister good luck in that endeavour.  I will not press the amendment.  The section is not opposed.  I welcome very much the Minister's full response to every point we raised in the amendment which will influence his tobacco control policy.</p></speech>

I am happy to have this opportunity to support my colleague.  I understand he is not pressing either of these two amendments, largely because the Minister and himself are <i>ad idem</i> on these matters.  The Minister has been very strong in this regard.  I imagine he must be a little disconcerted but I do not expect him to comment when he discovered that senior Ministers, including the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, had a meeting with the leaders of the tobacco industry.</p> <p>That certainly caused much concern.  These people are involved in a trade which is extraordinarily devious and they should find it as difficult as possible.  The Taoiseach is a wily west of Ireland man but one needs to be twice as wily as anybody from this island to deal with that shower and they have certainly shown it as anybody who looks at the history of the tobacco industry in the United States of America will see.  I speak as somebody who most of the time does not smoke but who was heavily addicted at a very young age because of the blandishments of these awful people, including the Marlboro man and all these very glamorous figures who subsequently died of lung cancer which put an end to their glamour.  I commend Senator Barrett on his sterling projection of these ideas.  He is a tremendous advantage to Seanad &Eacute;ireann and, certainly as a colleague, I value him very much.  I regret Senator Crown is not here but I understand he is in America at an oncology conference.  </p><p>The situation in regard to the hospitals is idiotic.  People being treated for disease are not only smoking outside hospitals but they are going to local pubs in their pyjamas even though they are taking antibiotics.  This is countering the effect of the antibiotics.  Something should be done about that.</p><p>It may appear absurd to try to restrict smoking in cars but as a former smoker - I like to think I am mainly a former smoker - I have dropped the lighted top of a cigarette.  If it lands on one's crotch when one is driving at 60 mph, it certainly does not improve one's driving skills.  The same applies to even lighting a cigarette.  These things can be lethal.  Smoking is as bad as, or is perhaps even more dangerous, than using a mobile telephone while driving.</p><p>I agree with Senator Barrett in regard to looking for a non-smoker discount but I am not sure how it could be policed.  People are the most awful liars or, as we say now, they are in denial, which just means they are liars.  They will lie like hell to get a reduced premium.  How can one tell whether they smoke?  Does one smell their breath to see if they have been smoking?  Perhaps there is a blood test or perhaps people could breathe into something on the way back from D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann or Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  This could be problematic.  I am not sure how this could be policed even though it is an excellent idea.  I compliment the Minister on the introduction of the legislation.  </p></speech>

It may be a new trend.</p><p>I agree with the Senator that smoking while driving is a distraction and on that basis, it should be looked at.  However, we want our laws to be very robust because the tobacco industry is notorious for going after every little chink or weakness it can.  The tobacco industry has lost every single court case in Australia and now it is going at it through the World Trade Organisation.  </p><p>The Scottish Parliament has succeeded in bringing in a minimum price for alcohol, so we are looking very closely at that to see how it could apply to minimum pricing here and I have had conversations with Minister Poots about it.  If we can do it for alcohol, we may be revisiting this legislation which we have to enact because as I said, we are law makers and not law breakers and we have to adhere to the law as it stands.  However, there is nothing to stop us, as legislators, trying to get that law changed and influencing Europe.</p><p>Pricing was mentioned and there is no question but that it is very important.  A sudden increase in price often has a desired effect but these incremental increases do not.  I am all for a really big hike in the price of cigarettes.  People will say it will lead to more smuggling.  I have met ASH, the Irish Cancer Society and the Irish Heart Foundation; Professor Luke Clancy gave me an excellent paper showing that this would not lead to more smuggling.  There is no evidence to show that.  The places where smuggling is at its worst is in the eastern European countries where it is 37% and where the prices are very cheap.  Apparently, what influences it is a very large border.</p><p>What I really want to warn about is that this is classic tobacco industry tactics.  It is called pivoting away in an argument.  It is a case of let us not talk about all the people who die, all the lives ruined and all the people who are on oxygen at home because they smoked but let us talk about smuggling.  Smuggling has nothing to do with it.  Let us keep our focus where it belongs, that is, on the lives and well-being of our people, in particular our children.  I will never make any apology to anybody for protecting our children as it is our duty as parents, as adults and, in particular, as legislators.  I thank the Senator for his comments, colourful and otherwise, and for his support.</p></speech>

We received a very glossy brochure from some crowd with a name like CDFI.  They did not identify themselves and I had to go to quite a lot of trouble to discover they were representing a subsidiary of the tobacco industry.  They were pushing exactly the line about which the Minister spoke, that is, the notion of tobacco smuggling being an issue.  There was no mention of disease or anything else.  It was terribly smarmy.  Will the Minister look at that and expose these people?  We all received this apparently innocent package in the post.  I thought it was disgraceful because it was completely disingenuous.  I wanted to take the opportunity to alert the Minster to that, although he is probably aware of it already.</p></speech>

We have tried to have information campaigns to tell people the dangers.  I hope the proceedings of the Seanad today are noted because of the amount of information the Minister has placed before us on the damage tobacco can do.  The laws on where smoking can take place have had an impact.  We are winning but perhaps at a slower pace than we would wish.</p><p>  I realise Senator Norris spoke against the amendment before I even moved it but it states: &quot;The Minister may designate a rate of non-smoker discount&quot;.  It is for consideration in the Minister's tobacco control policy.  We have dealt with advertising and with laws and we are going in the right direction.  Doctors would know if someone was a smoker.  With inspection of someone's lungs, throat and mouth, it is pretty easy to see if he or she is a smoker.</p><p>  The third part of this troika of anti-smoking measures, which includes the information campaigns and the laws on where one can smoke, is a financial incentive to giving up smoking.  The Minister has been under pressure from other quarters on the rapid rise in health insurance premiums.  I know there is a principle of universalism there but could we envisage a situation where giving up smoking would mean cash in one's hand?  Could we persuade young people to spend the money on something else because the Minister for Health had designed a scheme to reward them?  Is this the kind of inducement the Minister, his colleagues and his advisers think would be a good one to include the tobacco control policy, that is, if one gives up smoking, one would be better off financially in addition to all the other benefits which the Minister enunciated for us?</p></speech>

It is helpful to raise these matters in order that we can discuss them.  In regard to smoking in cars, Senator Crown's proposal was to ban it where there are children in cars but that would be difficult to implement where, for instance, a 17 year old is driving a car and smoking.</p> <p>It would be very difficult to implement in the case of a 17 year old who was driving a car and smoking.  There might be some legal complications in that regard.  We should ban smoking completely in cars, as opposed to aiming at banning smoking in cars in which children are travelling.</p><p> Senator Sean D. Barrett spoke about the connection to health insurance.  I have previously raised the issue of the number of expectant mothers who continue to smoke, although I know GPs try to address it.  I recently spoke to someone in a high risk pregnancy clinic who told me about a woman who smoked 300 cigarettes a week, which I believe was a reduction on the number she had been smoking.  Is there information on the number of pregnant women who continue to smoke?  Have we provided a detailed analysis of the harmful effects it has on the baby?  I do not believe we have provided enough information in that regard.  We have not had a major campaign on that issue.</p><p> We still have problems with alcohol consumption during pregnancy.  Each year a number of babies experience <i>delirium tremens</i>after being born owing to their mothers' level of alcohol consumption.  Likewise with smoking, there are knock-on effects for babies when born.  It is a real health issue that we need to address and we need to provide information for the public.  While welcoming the Bill, it is important that we move as fast as possible on the other issues.  We need to work hard on reducing the number of people who smoke.  While we have introduced many changes in the past ten years, it has not made a substantial difference to the number of people who smoke.  It is a major target for us at which to aim in the next ten years and we all have a part to play.</p><p> I thank Senator Sean D. Barrett for tabling his amendments which have given us the opportunity to think about how we should plan into the future.  We need to start planning for how we will proactively deal with the issue in the next ten years.</p></speech>

The main legislative provisions for the regulation of the private health insurance market are included in the Health Insurance Acts 1994 to 2012 and the regulations made under these Acts.  The purpose of this legislation is to ensure the market is regulated appropriately.  In addition to ensuring appropriate regulation, I have also consistently urged all private health insurers to do everything possible to keep down the cost of private health insurance.  I am determined to address costs in this sector in the interests of consumers and I am not happy that this has been done.  I reiterate my concerns about the lack of a clinical audit to ensure tests done were necessary.</p><p>Despite a smaller number of people being insured last year, there was a 14% rise in claims.  We need to ensure tests carried out are necessary.  We need to revisit what we pay for what is being done.  I have previously mentioned a particular procedure that used to take two hours and now only takes 20 minutes.  However, insurance companies are still paying &euro;800 to the treating clinician.  If ten of these procedures are performed on a Saturday in the private system, as one gentleman was proud to point out - it took him all week to do nine in the public system - that is &euro;8,000 every Saturday, which comes to &euro;400,000 a year.  We need to look at this.  We also need to consider how we pay hospitals.  We should be paying them per procedure or per bundled treatments, not for the duration of stay, as we do at present.</p><p>As Minister for Health, I have no legal powers to intervene in the prices set by health insurance providers.  The insurance companies operate as commercial providers and pricing decisions on private health insurance products are matters for individual insurers.  However, I reiterate my concern about their failure to address their cost base.  I am sorry that I cannot accept the amendment.</p><p>We have been joined by many young people in the Visitors Gallery.  I let them know that this legislation is about banning smoking in public places and protecting them from the advertising of the tobacco industry.  Of the young people in the Visitors Gallery who take up smoking, one in two will die young.  That is factual and evidence based.  They should never start smoking, regardless of who tells them otherwise.  </p><p>I appreciate the support of Senators on the Bill.  I look forward to pursuing our fight against tobacco on an ongoing basis in every way open to us and on every stage we can access throughout Europe and the broader world.  I express my support for the action taken in Australia in its fight with the tobacco industry at the World Trade Organisation.</p></speech>

Barrett for their very dynamic and supportive contributions on all Stages of the Bill, on which we all agree.  The Minister was right in referring to the young people in the Visitors Gallery.  The tobacco industry is so cynical that in a few years these young people will be targeted by the advertising campaigns the Minister mentioned.  It is right for us to point to what the tobacco industry does.  The average age of those in the Visitors Gallery is 11 or 12 years.  In another year or two the tobacco industry will target such young people, particularly girls.  Yesterday the Minister highlighted the attractive packaging the tobacco industry used to target people such as those in the Visitors Gallery.  It is welcome that he is taking as robust measures as he can.  It has been said there will be no markings on the cigarette box.  In fact, I hope there will be pictures depicting the detrimental damage tobacco does.</p><p>I thank the Minister and my Opposition colleagues for supporting the Bill.  We look forward to its passage through the Houses onto the Statute Book.</p></speech>

I have no difficulty in supporting the legislation.  We look forward to further improvements to finally weed out the use of tobacco, the effects of which have probably touched everybody's family at some stage.  My mother and three of her younger brothers all died before their time as a direct result of smoking and lung cancer.  I smoked and struggled to get off cigarettes, but, thankfully, eight years later I have not looked back.  As a smoker, I opposed the smoking ban within the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party and how wrong I was because there was no way I would have succeeded in getting off cigarettes without the ban.  In bars, it would have been too easy to reach out and take one.  This is a further step in weeding it out.  I agree with the Minister that the smuggling issue is a red herring.</p><p>While it does not arise under this Bill, I am interested in what the Minister takes from the Scottish legislation on minimum pricing of alcohol.  We have work to do in that regard.</p></speech>

It would have been all so unnecessary had we been more aggressive on tobacco policy in the past.</p><p>Successful legal cases have been taken in the United States against companies for misleading people in advertising a product that they knew was carcinogenic.  There may be a case to be examined in that regard.  Our fight against tobacco will be relentless and unforgiving and we will not stop until we rid the country of this scourge.  There is tremendous support for the fight in Europe and the European Union must provide cross-Government support for economies that have grown to be dependent on tobacco production.  We must encourage them into other areas of production that do not have such catastrophic consequences for the consumer.  It is extraordinary to think that by using this product as advised by the manufacturer, one in two people will die.  The pain behind it does not hit us when we say it like that, but when we reflect on the matter, we realise it.  </p><p>I look forward to getting the Bill through.  I said I wanted it to be a pyrrhic victory for the tobacco industry.  It will turn out to be the beginning of a long road to defeat for it across the Oireachtas - the Seanad and the D&aacute;il - and Europe.

Is m&oacute;r an tionchar a bh&iacute;onn ag an oideachas a chuirtear ar dhuine ar na seansanna a bh&iacute;onn aige sa saol &oacute; thaobh deiseanna oibre, luacha saothair, teacht sl&aacute;n &oacute;n mbochtaineacht, agus t&aacute; na ceisteanna sin f&iacute;or-th&aacute;bhachtach do sh&aacute;samh intinne agus do shonas pearsanta an uile dhuine.

It is the settled view of experts in the special education area that children with special needs perform better socially and academically in mainstream classes in mainstream schools.  In fairness, there has been a very considerable movement towards the development of inclusive practices in Irish education over the last two decades.</p><p>  Is &eacute; tuairim l&aacute;idir na saineolaithe r&eacute;imse an oideachais do dhaoine a bhfuil riachtanais speisialta acu gur fearr a &eacute;ir&iacute;onn le p&aacute;iste a bhfuil riachtanais speisialta aige go s&oacute;isialta agus go hacad&uacute;il nuair a chuirtear oideachas air i ngn&aacute;th-rang agus i ngn&aacute;th-scoil.

However, this is not the recommended model for all children, as the Minister knows, and in particular, for children with Down's syndrome, for whom the appropriate model is support in a mainstream class setting.  </p><p>  The purpose of this motion is to ask the Minister what he intends to do to prevent the enrolment barriers that exist from negatively affecting children with special educational needs.  Additionally, I want to highlight that it is the policies of the Department of Education and Skills which contribute to the lack of welcome for certain students with special learning needs, particularly children with Down's syndrome.  The motion before the House deals with the report from the National Council for Special Education and its findings on the issue of discrimination.  The report recommends major changes in the way resources are delivered to students with special educational needs, with an emphasis on individualised assessment, educational planning and monitoring of student outcomes.  In the first chapter, it recommends that the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, known as the EPSEN Act, should be fully commenced as soon as the resources necessary for its implementation become available.  It also recommends the introduction of a robust regulatory enrolment framework to ensure that every child with special educational needs can access a school placement.</p><p>  I want to the give the Minister credit today, where it is properly due.  The NCSE report reminds us that investment in special educational supports is at an all-time high, with an annual spend of &euro;1.3 billion on supporting students with special educational needs in school.  That is a record level, despite our current economic difficulties and I commend the Minister on that and on his commitment in this area.  </p><p>  To get down to business, the problem that has been identified in the report is enrolment barriers.  Generally, management bodies and schools have responded positively to educating students with special educational needs in inclusive environments.  I know this is true and I should declare my own interest in the provision of second-level education in my capacity as a board member of CEIST, a trustee body for well over 100 voluntary secondary schools.  Many children with special educational needs are now included in mainstream classes but evidence remains of non-co-operation in some areas.</p><p>  The NCSE consultation paper highlighted practices whereby schools placed soft barriers to enrolment by advising parents that a different school is more suitable for their child or has more resources for supporting students with special needs.  In some cases, they have refused to enrol the child on the basis that they are not being allocated all of the resources they consider are required.  Parents feel they have to fight for a placement and that their child is being enrolled on sufferance.  This difficulty could be addressed by the Department developing the appropriate regulatory enrolment framework required to underpin section 2 of the EPSEN Act, as strongly recommended by the NCSE report.  This would deal with the concern.  Having made inquiries about practices in schools, it seems to me that the emphasis should always be on enabling all students to enrol in their school of choice.  </p><p>  Schools found to be non-receptive to students with special needs are at risk of being unfairly judged, of course.  There have been instances where a school declines to admit a student with severe or profound spectrum autism, or other such exceptional situation, because the board of management believed it could not best serve the student's interests due to the absence of sufficient resources.  Many schools believe that the resources do not automatically follow the child, resulting in students awaiting facilities and resources and parents growing impatient and irritated.  While the State may have let down the student, it is often the school that is at the front line of such disappointment.  </p><p>  We must recognise that some children with complex needs may require a more supportive special placement or school, although that does not apply to children with Down's syndrome.  I wish to acknowledge representatives of Down's Syndrome Ireland in the Public Gallery today, Mr. Pat Clarke and Ms Patricia Griffin, and thank them for being here.  I do not seek to excuse any school that would exclude a child with education needs but I understand why it happens.  I believe that Department policy may be the cause, especially in the particular case of children with Down's syndrome.  Since 2005, such children do not automatically qualify for resource teaching hours.  Most of the approximately 80 children with Down's syndrome who begin mainstream school each year have a need which is more severe and they will be catered for.  However, children whose level of intellectual disability places them in the category of mild general learning disability - about 30 of those children - must rely on a share of their school's special needs teaching resources given under the general allocation model.</p> <p>Schools have provision to allocate and target resources at those children most in need.  Children with mild learning difficulty generally receive two and a half hours per week under the general allocation model.  Down's Syndrome Ireland, having welcomed many of the NCSE report recommendations, notes that it does not identify Down's syndrome as a particular disability category for the allocation of resources.  The Minister has expressed a willingness to meet the organisation on this issue.  I ask him to consider the future of the approximately 30 children in each class in our primary school system who are being adversely affected by not qualifying for vital resource teaching hours.</p><p>I refer to one case.  Tom Murphy is four and a half years old and has Down's syndrome.  He will attend school next year and his mother recently spoke out about the fact that some parents are so desperate to get support for their child in mainstream schools that they have had recourse to manipulating or fooling the IQ test.  She talked anecdotally about some parents keeping the child up late the night before or not feeding him or her on the morning of the test or giving them Calpol in order that they would get a low score, thus guaranteeing them vital educational support in schools, which is appalling.  This is why we need to address the lack of welcome.</p><p>I wholeheartedly agree with the NCSE report's commentary on the need to address enrolment barriers but we also need to address the reasons such barriers exist, particularly for children with Down's syndrome.  Without seeking to excuse any discrimination, the resource allocation policies of the Department are the primary cause.  A two-pronged approach is needed to tackle enrolment barriers with robust guidelines, as recommended and as called for in the motion, and resolution of the apparent discrimination against children with Down's syndrome identified in the Ombudsman report and a reclassification of the condition as a low incidence disorder, which will attract specific resources and greatly assist students and schools.  I thank the Minister for his commitment and dedication in this area.  I commend the motion to the House.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister.  Senator Mullen has stolen all our clothes, having given a comprehensive overview of the issues.  I will not go over old ground but Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes the publication of the policy advice paper on supporting students with special needs in schools by the NCSE.  A number of issues arise.  The paper found that such students are well supported in schools and are making good progress.  I echo Senator Mullen's comment that the Minister has continued a proud tradition that began 15 years ago under the current Fianna F&aacute;il leader when he was Minister for Education, which the Minister has duly acknowledged.  I am happy to endorse the comments about the Minister's mandate since he took up office.  He has protected and enhanced, where possible, special needs provision.</p><p>One of the key recommendations of the review is to ensure all children with special educational needs can fully access the extensive supports available within the school system.  A total of &euro;1.3 billion is spent supporting such students, which equates to the expenditure of four other Departments.  The NCSE's recommendations are focused on refining where and how the supports are targeted to ensure all children with special educational needs have fair and equitable access to supports.  As Senator Mullen said, some parents find it difficult to access a diagnosis of disability, which is needed to trigger additional teaching support for students with more complex disabilities.  The NCSE has called for a new model to be developed for the allocation of additional teaching resources to mainstream schools, which is based on the profile need of each school with the need for a diagnosis of disability and it notes that the learning profile of pupils can vary from school to school.  Some schools have a number of students with learning difficulties while others have fewer.  The council recommends that any new system of allocating teaching resources should be targeted in line with the profile of educational need in each mainstream school rather than the current system of linking them to a particular category of disability, enrolment size or number of class teachers.  I fully endorse that view.  The Minister will be aware more than most that this provision has created enormous difficulties since it was introduced.  It does not take account of the individual requirements of those with particular categories of disability.</p><p>Another recommendation is to commence the remaining sections of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 as resources permit.  I am interested in the Minister's view on that.  The council's report also recommended that a framework be developed to improve teachers' knowledge and expertise in supporting and educating students with special educational needs and that additional funding be provided to special schools and special classes to allow them to purchase and replace equipment.  In the context of a budget of &euro;1.3 billion it is interesting that this recommendation has been made.  I thought that would have been addressed but there are gaps in this area.  It is important that special schools can purchase and replace equipment because that forms a key part of the curriculum.  Those of us who are parents of children with special needs will testify to that, having experienced the school system.  Equipment is needed by them more than by mainstream students.</p><p>The INTO has not enthusiastically embraced this review saying that it could roll back 20 years of progress.  I find it difficult that the organisation would take a hostile position, although its representatives say that while the current system is not perfect, it has ensured children have access to resource teaching in a timely fashion.  They also said the report should be a wake-up call for parents of special needs children and advocacy groups because if its recommendations are implemented, bureaucracy will once again become the barrier to children accessing resources.  The key element of the INTO's hostile response is centred very much on paperwork and bureaucracy.  I am sure the Minister will have a view on this position.  I reiterate that it is important that if change is implemented, it should take not account of class sizes or the size of the school.  I endorse Senator Mullen's comments about Down's syndrome children.  A decision about them is urgent.  The question is whether the Government will decide for the upcoming school year to allocate specific resource teaching hours to those with Down's syndrome who are diagnosed as having mild intellectual disability.  Perhaps the Minister will respond to that.</p><p>The pupil-teacher ratio is also an issue.  There will be a significant increase in the number of children in primary school next September and while the Government is increasing the number of mainstream teachers by 450 to meet that demand, which I enthusiastically welcome - it is a great tribute to the Minister's tenacity around the Cabinet table in the current climate to have secured this increase from the Department of Finance - the Government will not increase the number of special needs assistants, SNAs, and resource teachers in the system to match that.  There will have to be reductions somewhere along the line for those with special needs.  I hope the Minister will address that aspect of the initiative.</p><p>Increasing the number of mainstream teachers means the pupil-teacher ratio will not have to increase in line with an increase in the number of additional children entering the system but because there will not be a consequent increase in the number of SNAs and resource teachers to match that, that could cause a logjam.  Those who have the greatest need are suffering as a result of the way the Minister is approaching the finances of the Department.  Will he ensure in the same way he is increasing the number of mainstream teachers, he will also ensure there will be no reduction or squeeze on the resources available to those with special needs entering school next September?</p><p>I welcome Senator Mullen's initiative.  I compliment the Minister for being on top of his game on this issue.  We all try to adopt the spirit of the Proclamation in cherishing all the children of the nation equally.</p></speech>

Molaim Seanad&oacute;ir Mullen as &eacute; a chur &oacute;s &aacute;r gch&oacute;mhair inniu.  While welcoming the motion, I propose a slight amendment to it.</p> <p>I very much welcome the recent publication of the report on supporting students with special educational needs by the NCSE.  This motion is about enrolment, which is one element of that report.  The finding by the NCSE that certain school enrolment policies and practices have been less than fully inclusive is somewhat disappointing.  However, it is not clear from the wording whether this comment is meant to apply to discrete elements of enrolment policies or whether it refers to some policies in some schools.  I suspect it is the latter and ask Senator Mullen to clarify that point in the context of the motion before the House.  </p><p>It should be noted that the NCSE in its report states that the majority of schools operate inclusive enrolment policies and practices.  It is my experience that the vast majority of schools are most inclusive, both in policy and in practice, allowing for the limits of what is possible at any one time within a certain school.  Indeed, I wish today to pay tribute to our schools and the teachers, classroom assistants, boards of management and the wider school community for their massive contribution over recent years in immeasurably improving access to mainstream schools for those children with special educational needs.</p><p>The HSE and the special needs section of the Department of Education and Skills have also been proactive in providing the resources necessary to enable all children, irrespective of educational needs, to enrol in their local schools.  However, perhaps these resources could more often be pre-supplied rather than, in some cases, applied post-enrolment.  In other words, they should be supplied upon application or registration by a student rather than after the student enrols.</p><p>The motion states that it is essential that children with disabilities have access to mainstream education and I totally agree with this.  However, children with special needs should also be given the choice, if it is the considered wish of their parents, to attend special schools that cater for their special needs.  I would now like to look at a study in inclusiveness, which is Scoil Mhuire gan Sm&aacute;l in Kilsaran, County Louth.  This is a mainstream school with a dedicated autism unit which was officially opened last year by President Michael D. Higgins.  The school supports the principal of inclusiveness, particularly with reference to the enrolment of children with a disability or other special educational need.  The school caters for children from infants to sixth class in mainstream classes.  It also has one special class for children with severe and profound disabilities and three classes for children on the autistic spectrum.  The school also has County Louth's only early prevention unit for children of pre­school age with autism.  The purpose of the autism unit is to give pupils on the autistic spectrum a mainstream education, while suiting both their specific educational and sensory needs.  If a student is deemed both academically and behaviourally suitable, he or she can be transferred on a phased or full-time basis to mainstream education in the school.  At present there are five students who have successfully integrated fully into mainstream education and three others who are being integrated on a phased basis.  This is only one model and not all schools can have these facilities, but it is a clear example of how inclusivity is being developed in a particular setting.</p><p>I am not aware of any school, as referred to in the motion, that excludes children in its policies, and I am sure that is illegal.  If it is the case that this is happening, it should be brought to the attention of the relevant authorities.  Sometimes there is a stipulation that children will be accepted subject to the resources being provided, but this more a negotiating position with the various agencies involved rather than a covert attempt to exclude children with disabilities.  However, I agree that it should be examined.</p><p>Regarding enrolment policy and the aforementioned report, the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education, NABMSE, argues that what is needed is the adoption of a robust regulatory framework to ensure that all children with special educational needs can access a school placement.  The motion calls on the Minister to implement the recommendations of the report, of which there are 28, and, in particular, to ensure that every child with special educational needs is protected.  I support the motion but ask the proposers to consider my amendment.  Having said that, I commend Senators Mullen and Quinn on their tabling of this worthy motion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-05-29a.230" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1171" speakername="Jillian van Turnhout" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013052900030#EE00200"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House and am pleased to participate in this debate this evening.  There are many valuable proposals in the report by the NCSE, Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools.  I note and support both the report and this motion's strong commitment to providing access to mainstream education and the benefits which often accrue not only to children with disabilities but to society as a whole.  The normalisation of disability is a vital step towards achieving a fair and egalitarian society.  Indeed, ensuring access to mainstream schooling is in line with our obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which specifically recognises the needs of disabled children.  It goes on to say that the education of such children must be done in a manner that is conducive to their achieving the fullest possible social integration and individual development.  That is something with which we would all agree.</p><p>With the UN Convention in mind, I read the NCSE report with great interest but was disappointed by its finding that certain school enrolment policies and practices were less than fully inclusive and that such policies had created barriers to enrolment for students with special education needs.  As a firm believer in the right of all children, irrespective of any specific educational needs, to access their local schools if they so wish, I encourage the Minister to give serious thought to how this can best be remedied.  I question one section of the motion, although it is perhaps unintentional wording, regarding the entitlement of schools and their patrons to develop their own enrolment criteria.  It is vital that the school application process be carried out in the most fair and transparent manner possible.  The exclusion of any child from a State-funded school on any discriminatory basis is, for me, unacceptable, be it on the grounds of educational needs, faith or family history.  I also believe that on this occasion the Government is right in tempering the language of the motion.  The Minister must examine and give serious consideration to the recommendations of the NCSE report but to call upon him to introduce these recommendations in a wholesale manner, without due diligence, defeats the purpose of such a report, which aims to inform Government policy.</p> <p>In particular, I am conscious of the concerns expressed about the report's conclusions that Down's syndrome should not be reclassified as a low incidence disorder, given these children often require more intensive support than others in the same classification due to the variety of additional difficulties associated with Down's syndrome.  While I note the report's insistence that the proposed allocation system will allow for individualised assessment of children with and without Down's syndrome, I am concerned that this does not conclusively address whether Down's syndrome children will be entitled to resource hours.  While I do not doubt the veracity of the report's finding, further review by the Department may be useful in allaying the fears of parents.</p><p>I hope the Minister will provide clarity and reassurance for parents and children.  September will be upon us before we know it and many parents are concerned.  I support the call for the implementation of the EPSEN Act 2004, specifically to priorities access for children with special needs education to an individual education.  It is well overdue and I put my trust in the Minister.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-05-29a.232" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1174" speakername="Mary Moran" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013052900031#FF00200"><p>I welcome the Minister.  I second the amendment and I hope Senator Mullen will accept it.  I commend the Minister on his decision and forward thinking last year when he asked the NCSE to review and make recommendations on the supports provided to children with special educational needs and how they are allocated to ensure we are delivering the best educational experience and outcomes for every child.  The NSCE report on supporting children with special educational needs in schools details 28 recommendations for consideration.  It is to the Minister's credit that this is first report to be published after a 20 year gap in policy advice on this issue.  I welcome that the council engaged in a wide range of consultations with numerous interested parties but, most important, parents.  Every child is different and must be examined individually rather than as part of a group.  That is why I welcome the input from parents.  This policy advice is based on a review of national and international best practice.</p><p>The NCSE has outlined numerous findings and recommendations but what comes across most strongly is the recognition that children with special needs should not be allocated resources solely on the basis of their diagnosis but rather on their individual needs.  This finding is strengthened by another key finding in the report that there should be an ongoing assessment process.  This is important and I say this as a parent of a child with special needs.  Sometimes children are psychologically assessed when they are aged three or four before they enter the school system and that might be the only assessment to which they are subject during their schooling.  They are put in a box immediately and they remain in that box.</p><p>I welcome the recommendation that there should be ongoing assessment.  Whether children need to be assessed when they are aged six and again as they approach the teenage years or in the interim, each child is different and that is the key.  Their education should be individually based rather than group based because there are many different spectrums and disabilities.  I share the concerns of the people representing those with Down's syndrome and I welcome them to the Visitors Gallery.  I raised the valid concerns of parents and teachers of children with Down's syndrome with the Minister last week.  I hope that the recommendation to assess children on an individual basis and on the basis of need will cater for their individual needs.  With the autism and Down's syndrome spectrums, there are many individual needs and I hope this recommendation will lead to a more rounded and individualised approach to support for learning.</p><p>This will address many of the problems in schools currently and will put the onus on each school to appropriately meet the needs of its pupils.  The assessments will help to develop individualised planning for each child.  Currently, IEPs are only provided in special schools and it is vital that IEPs are introduced in mainstream schools.  I welcome this recommendation, which will help to enhance the experience of children with special needs in schools, educationally and socially.  As a former teacher and parent, it is not constructive or effective to allocate resources based on diagnosis alone.  Children with specific disorders and syndromes do not all have the same needs.  There are many different spectrums to consider and other overlapping, co­existing issues.  I hope a solution will specifically be found for children with Down's syndrome.</p><p>Appropriate teaching training to deal with increasing diversity in schools is another important finding of the report.  It is vitally important that teachers receive proper training, as they will have students throughout their career who have special educational needs.  That is becoming more prevalent and the number of children with special educational needs is increasing.  Other Members who are former teachers feel the climate within the classroom has changed greatly over the past 15 years as more of these children have entered mainstream schools.  The NCSE recommends that the Teaching Council and the Department of Education and Skills should ensure teachers are provided with the necessary tools to meet the needs of students with special educational needs.  The Teaching Council should stipulate mandatory levels and frequency of continuing professional development teachers are required to undertake for teaching children with special educational needs.  Teachers would welcome, as I did, ways to best encourage and foster a good relationship with children who have different needs.  The report recommends that the Department should clarify the role of class teachers, support teachers and SNAs, as the lines are becoming blurred.  Clarification of the role of the SNA would benefit all parties and, in particular, the child.</p><p>The report establishes that while many schools across Ireland are inclusive and encouraging of children with special needs, some schools still operate in a less than inclusive environment, which is a disappointing finding.  I agree with a comment Senator D'Arcy made.  I have never come across a school that has refused to take a child on the basis of special educational needs.  The Minister has said he will bring forward proposals to Government on the implementation of the findings and enrolment will play a part in the proposals for a new regulatory enrolment framework for schools which is being prepared.  I commend this proposal and I ask that parents been included on the policy group because that would be vital.</p><p>I recognise many improvements can and should be made but, as others said, we must acknowledge the investment that has made to fund 10,500 SNA posts and the provision of special school transport, equipment and adapted school buildings.  I agree with Senator Mooney that assistive technology could be improved but we have lower pupil-teacher ratios in special schools.  The Department has stated that it will work with the Departments with Children and Youth Affairs and Social Protection on this issue. This interdepartmental approach will be crucial to providing a cohesive programme for these children and their families.  I urge the Departments to engage in a thorough review of the report and I look forward to the establishment of the working group, which, I hope, will include parents and representatives of parent groups.</p></speech>

It is really appalling that the children should be disadvantaged simply because they have a higher IQ.  That seems to be a real paradox.</p><p>Senator Mullen would be mad to accept the amendment because, as the Minister knows very well, when one changes the requirement to implement a policy to a requirement to consider its implementation, it means nothing.  There is a progressive Minister and in his case it might mean something, but there is absolutely no guarantee if the wording is diluted to include only &quot;consider&quot;.  It would not be acceptable to the parents.</p><p>The other point that is noteworthy is that even in the Government's amendment, the entire preamble, or all the argument, is accepted.  That effectively rules out Senator Darcy's reservations.  He said it would be very disappointing if there were any schools that did as outlined.  The Government has already accepted that the practice may exist because it has accepted the preamble where the statement is made.  It is disappointing.  It is not disappointing that Senator Mullen referred to it; it is very disappointing that it happens to be a fact.  I know it is because I was approached by schools that said the fact that schools near them were issuing refusals or finding ways around the system meant they had a disproportionate number of the kinds of students in question.  It appears to be a fact and the Government has not disputed this in its amendment.</p></speech>

We all accept that is really good for them.  However, Down's syndrome children who have a mild disability have no access to the extra hours.  That is regrettable, particularly because it is a change that came about in 2005.  Before that, their disabilities were included as low-incidence disabilities.  They are low-incidence disabilities because they occur in 0.2% of the population.  Low-incidence disabilities are defined as those that occur in fewer than 1% of the population.  Clearly, they qualify.</p><p>With regard to the psychological assessment that has been spoken about, it takes place in March of the year in which the child begins in the school.  It is carried out by a psychologist in an institution such as Enable Ireland.  The child's IQ is assessed.  Many Down's syndrome children have an IQ of 50 to 69.  This is classified as a mild learning disability.  I return to my point that the very assessment that shows there is positive capacity to learn is used against the children.  Prior to 2005, this was not the case.  All pupils within an assessed syndrome were entitled to resource hours.  Up to 2005, Down's syndrome fell within the category of an assessed syndrome.  Will the Minister state in his reply whether it is possible to determine why the change was made?  Was it made on purely economic grounds?  I am afraid this may be the case.</p><p>The value of resource hours is very significant.  When one receives resource hours, one receives one-to-one engagement with the teacher.  The pupil is normally taken to a special room where he or she will have the entire attention of the teacher.  This is very important.  The resource hours, the one-to-one contact and special resources are very important.</p><p>The people who have lobbied me are very strong in their call to the Minister, whom I am very glad is present because it is very important to have present a senior Cabinet Minister with direct responsibility.  I appreciate the fact that the Minister is present and I know Senator Mullen does also.  The parents directly involved in this matter are asking for an end to what they regard as discriminatory treatment of their children.  They want the current circular, circular 02/05, to which I referred, to include Down's syndrome as a low-incidence disability, as it used to be classified.  It is just a question of returning to circumstances that were favourable to the affected children.  The lobbyists are calling on the Minister to recognise Down's syndrome in its entirety and in its own right.  They say the children cannot and must not be categorised as having mild or moderate learning disabilities as this does not reflect all aspects of Down's syndrome.</p><p>In light of this discussion, which has not been fractious or disagreeable in any way, could the Minister address this matter very clearly and practically?  I am very impressed by the various people who have spoken about their experience.  Colleagues of mine have spoken about their direct experience of children with special needs.  They, perhaps, have a greater understanding than I could possibly have.  This has been a very useful debate.  I hope that the vulnerable children will not be penalised simply because they have higher intelligence than others.  They should be encouraged.  Everything should be done to allow them to become useful, happy, fulfilled and creative citizens.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-05-29a.239" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1114" speakername="Deirdre Clune" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013052900032#GG00600"><p>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  Senator Norris and others referred to children with Down&rsquo;s syndrome.  I am glad the Minister is to meet representatives of the Down's syndrome group.  I understand, although I am open to correction, that children with Down's syndrome do have access to resources, but not dedicated resources, under the general allocation to schools.  They would certainly have specific hours allocated to them if Down's syndrome were considered a low-incidence disability.  That is the issue for the parents in question.  I support them in their negotiations with the Minister on the issue.  Under the programme for Government, it was agreed that a plan would be published for the implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 to prioritise access for children with special needs to an individual education plan.  The NCSE report has been published.  The Minister is asking his Department to consult other Departments, including the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Health, and the Health Service Executive on their responsibilities in regard to the report and the education of children with special educational needs.  It is a question of establishing a working group to develop a proposal for new tailor-made allocations.  That is very wise and pragmatic.</p><p>I acknowledge that &euro;1.3 billion was spent in 2011.  Given that &euro;35 billion was the tax intake in that year, the expenditure was quite considerable.  Nevertheless, we have come from a low base in this area.</p><p>The findings of the report make for much discussion.  It struck me that the majority of parents were satisfied with the supports they are receiving.  The time taken to have an assessment was criticised.  From dealing with parents who have been trying to obtain an assessment for their children, I realise this.  The report refers to the assessment procedure and states that if a parent or the child's school can afford to pay for an assessment, it can ensure supports will be obtained immediately.  The imbalance needs to be addressed.</p><p>It is important to acknowledge that the needs of the child change as the child develops from preschool right through to adolescence.  It is important that there be monitoring.  The report advocates the measuring of outputs rather than inputs.  The outputs are important for the individual.  It is important to have a database to establish outputs.  Continuing professional development of teachers so as to keep them informed and trained is necessary.  We could discuss the role of the special needs assistants as a separate issue.  The report highlights blockages in terms of having an input to the education of the child.  Therefore, while the role of the special needs assistant has probably evolved over the years, it certainly needs to be defined.</p> <p> I would like to bring a couple of specific issues to the attention of the Minister.  ASD units and the provision of places for children on the autistic spectrum have come to my attention recently.  There has been growth in the provision of places for children in primary schools.  Preschools have supported that as children move to primary school.  We are now finding there are not sufficient places at second level.  Children cannot move on from primary school and places are not available for those who hoped to move from preschool to primary school.  A difficulty is manifesting.</p><p>I wrote to the Minister.  He highlighted the fact that it is a matter for the National Council for Special Education.  I wrote to it directly and I look forward to a response.  It will be a constant issue as there is growth in the population and an emphasis on ensuring children with special educational needs can be incorporated into mainstream schooling. </p><p>The motion states it is essential that children with disabilities have access to mainstream education.  I am sure those who tabled the motion understand that special schools are important.  There are children who have better educational attainment from attending a special school.  Mainstream schools with supports do not suit all children.  I spoke to some parents recently whose children are in special schools.  As difficult as it was for them to move their children from mainstream schools, it has been the making of them and has made for a happier family unit.  Special schools have a very important role to play.</p></speech>

It is an area that can sometimes be overlooked.  It is an issue families often face at a very difficult time in the development of a child's education, whether he or she is entering primary school or moving to second level.  Families need support at a time when education plays such an important role in a child's development in terms of physiology, education and life skills. </p><p>Like every public representative, I have met families, parents and school authorities.  Difficulties have arisen as a result of policy or funding.  While I fully appreciate that the budget available for special education has increased and is at record levels, at &euro;1.3 billion this year, the availability of resources does not always equate to solving the problem.  There is a need to look rationally at how we can make sure that every child who needs special education in a mainstream school can have it afforded to him or her. </p><p>While the provision of special education is available to schools, there are competing demands within them for the same chunk of change in terms of special needs assistants.  I see that in schools in my constituency.  There is often a dilution of the resources available to children.  It is very unfair that children should have to compete against each other for the allocation of those resources. </p><p>It is important that the report to which others have referred is implemented.  The disappointments contained within it must be dealt with.  The suggestion that a new model be developed for the allocation of additional teaching resources to mainstream schools based on the needs profile of each school, without the need for diagnoses of disabilities, is something I strongly urge the Minister to consider.  It has been referred to in regard to Down's syndrome.  I raised the issue on the Adjournment recently.  A child with a mild intellectual disability such as Down's syndrome is not afforded the special educational provision that he or she should have.  Children with mild intellectual disabilities should be provided with the educational advancement to which every other child has access.</p><p>Under the Constitution we cherish all the children equally, which extends to education.  The Constitution contains many references to education.  Just because a child has a disability does not mean he or she is less equal than another.  My cousin's child, who was born ten days ago, has Down's syndrome.  That child deserves the right to live, to educational advancement and to educational and job opportunities, as do we all.  Just because a child has a disability or his or her ability to learn may not be as fast as that of a friend, brother or sister does not mean he or she should go without. </p><p>There is a need for the system to work more effectively and efficiently to ensure the budgets made available to boards of management and schools are adequate and meet demand.  The recommendations contained in the report need to be carefully scrutinised and implemented in full.  I know the Minister will do that.  There are competing demands in his Department.  I acknowledge that while there are competing demands, the Minister has not touched the allocation of money for special education in this year's budget.  I hope that will continue into next year's budget.  He will have to play the game at Cabinet level.  We all hope that not only will the budget remain in place but it will increase, because it would benefit children who deserve opportunities.  </p><p>I know the Department is aware of children with Down's syndrome.  All children classified with it should be provided with special educational resources and training.  This is not happening, and there is an anomaly.  Some 30 children with mild to moderate levels of Down's syndrome will go into school next September, but they will not get the special educational teaching they deserve.  It is something that should be corrected.  It will not cost a lot of money but I urge the Minister to deal with it.  I hope the motion will be accepted on a cross-party basis because it is sensible and well thought out.  Those of us on this side of the House are delighted to support it.</p></speech>

Every adult possible was consulted but children and students were left out, which was a mistake.  I did research a number of years ago on children with dyslexia whom I had taught a number of years earlier.  When one is teaching in the classroom one knows it is very important to vary instruction in order that one does not bore children.  When I interviewed the children with dyslexia they asked me to continue with a subject until they had learned it and to repeat the information.  They needed over-learning to impart information to their long-term memories.</p> <p>A failure to listen to what students want, particularly at second level, is a huge disadvantage in seeking to devise the best possible outcomes for them.  Mr. Sydney Blain observed that thinking in this area has been evolving for 20 years.  It is a little like the X case in that a great deal has happened in the meantime.</p><p>I agree that the report, when and if it is implemented, will bring about a significant improvement in the education of children with special educational needs.  It does, however, require careful consideration.  There is a great deal contained in the report and a plan is needed for its implementation.  Will the Minister indicate his plan in this regard?  Does he hope to implement the report's recommendations by 2016, which is when the next election is due?  I understand he has been given a detailed background costing for the full implementation of the plan.  Will he indicate the costs involved?  What are his own hopes and preferences in this regard?</p><p>There are two particularly interesting elements of the report.  First is the focus on outcomes-based education rather than inputs, which is very welcome.  I have substantial experience in this area as a teacher, observer and mother of a child with learning needs.  We can have all the inputs we want, but if a child is not learning and we are not getting results, then we are failing that child.  Finding No. 10 in the report refers to access to qualified teachers who know how to differentiate learning and how to teach children so that the desired outcomes are achieved.  It is an incredible skill to be able to help children in this way and the teachers involved should be paid more if necessary.  The problem, however, is that support for children at second level is not subject-based.  Under the general allocation model, all children with special needs are going to the same teacher and it is generally about literacy.  They are getting no support whatsoever with mathematics, for example, or with languages such as French and Spanish, even though they may be experiencing huge difficulties with those subjects.  In short, the general allocation model is not working at second level for children with learning needs.  It is not always, by the way, about one-to-one support.  Children with learning difficulties want to be mainstreamed and to be considered the same as their peers, yet they need additional help.  I am getting a great deal of feedback from parents, which matches my own experience, that subject-specific help is needed for children with learning difficulties at second level.  If the Minister has a proposal in this regard, I am eager to hear it.</p><p>A second interesting aspect of the report is the focus on needs rather than diagnostic classification, that is, breaking the linkage between assessment and resource entitlement, as set out on page 30.  That is very important but who will make the decisions in this regard?  There must be some scientific basis to it.  Is this not the argument in regard to Down's syndrome?  In order to meet children's needs, we must take into account a classification or diagnosis of those needs.  We have to consider the diagnostic assessment of need if we are to be fair to the child.  A teacher without a specialist qualification in educational needs might read a child's needs totally differently than would a teacher with expertise in the area.  In such a scenario, we might not be getting the full picture.  However, the report seems almost to suggest that we should get rid of educational psychologists.  Will the Minister clarify exactly what is envisaged in this regard?</p><p>I support Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen's comments in regard to inclusive enrolment policies.  I agree that all children, irrespective of special educational needs, should be welcome and facilitated to enrol in their local schools.  That is fine in theory, of course, but the practice is rather different.  Parents of children with Down's syndrome and other disabilities have told me how they were gently persuaded to try the school down the road because they were told the latter had better resources to cope with their child's needs.  Exclusive enrolment policies are not acceptable.</p><p>I generally welcome the report, although I have difficulty with some of the findings.  I hope the Minister will clarify the issues I have raised.  This report is deserving of more detailed discussions in this House, but much depends on the timeframe the Minister has in mind for its implementation.  It would be helpful if he could break the report down into sections so that we might have a series of narrower discussions on the different aspects.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-05-29a.246" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1155" speakername="Kathryn Reilly" time="15:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013052900034#JJ00200"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I support the motion Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen has brought before the House.  It is disturbing and sad that the parents of children with special educational needs or disabilities have had to fight continually for their children's rights.  Those rights should be enshrined in law as a matter of course.  Like most public representatives, I am in regular contact with parents of children with special needs, often on a weekly basis.  Many parents have become experts in fighting their corner with various organs of the State, including the National Educational Psychological Service, the child and adolescent mental health services section of the Health Service Executive and the Delivering Equality of Opportunities in Schools programme, for the right to have their children assessed for entitlement to basic resources.  In recent weeks we have dealt with parents of children with autism, Down's syndrome and other conditions whose education is suffering because of the way in which resource hours are being allocated.</p><p>  Colleagues have covered most of the points I wished to raise, so I will focus on one particular issue.  Complaints to the Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan, increased by 22% in 2011 according to her office's annual report from October last year.  The office investigated 1,393 new complaints in 2011, almost half of which related to education and 32% to health.  The breakdown of the education complaints shows that problems with special needs resources made up 12% of those complaints, while 23% of health complaints related to the adequacy of and access to HSE services.  The ombudsman indicated that she was not surprised by the increase in grievances in regard to education.  She stated:<blockquote>Parents are very worried about the cuts to special needs education.  And they become fearful because there is a lack of communication on what the implications might be for the child....  While adequate resources are of great importance to guaranteeing that children's rights are respected, the attitude and culture that underpin how we engage with, and provide for, children is arguably more fundamental...  We continue to see more concern for the system than for the best interest of the child and family.</blockquote>Ms Logan stressed the need for Government policies based on fairness and equity which, she said, are even more important at a time of fiscal difficulties.</p><p>  The recommendations of the National Economic and Social Council report must be implemented as soon as possible.  A range of shortcomings and failings is identified in the report, including in regard to the linkage between allocation of resources and category of disability.  A system of allocation based on need is essential if we are to improve the level of supports for children with special educational needs, particularly where the emphasis is on integrating students into mainstream education.  The authors of the report were careful to highlight their efforts to ensure the recommendations were realistic in the context of available resources, including in respect of the implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.  The recommendations contained in the report are cognisant of the economic realities.  They are feasible proposals that can and should be taken forward as a matter of urgency.  This is not to say, of course, that we should refrain from urging the implementation of the 2004 Act at the earliest possible date.</p><p>  We have an obligation as Members of the Oireachtas to support children with special educational needs.  We all recognise the serious difficulties and challenges facing families as they seek to access essential supports.  The Government must actively support families affected by the loss of services in the past, with a view to restoration of those services.  We must ensure that the NESC vision of a society where children and adults with special educational needs receive an education that enables them to achieve their potential is realised.  Inclusive education practices must be underpinned by a series of statutory rights which will ensure children receive an education in an inclusive environment and achieve outcomes in accordance with their ability.  I look forward to the Minister's response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-05-29a.247" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1172" speakername="Aideen Hayden" time="15:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013052900034#JJ00300"><p>There is a great deal of expertise in the area of education in this House.</p> <p>My expertise is limited to third level but undoubtedly there have been some interesting contributions and I imagine the Minister will agree that there are some expert people in the House.</p><p>I thank Senator Mullen for bringing forward this good motion.  It is important to take some time to recognise that we have come a long way with the Irish educational system when it comes to special needs education.  While Senator Mullen and several other speakers have referred to disabilities such as Down's syndrome, we should accept that special needs education covers a wider range of disabilities, including dyslexia and dyspraxia.  I have had some experience of the educational system and I welcome the change in direction that there has been within the system, even within the past decade, in terms of the provision of resources to children who require particular help.  These include the facilities that have been made available to children who have dyslexia and dyspraxia, for example, to enable them to compete on a more level playing field when it comes to the State examinations.  The provision of facilities such as being able to do examinations by tape recorder and the provision of scribes and so on have helped these children.</p><p>We tend to focus on one extreme of the spectrum but it is important to recognise that many children have been assisted by our recognition and broader understanding of what special needs entails.  We will never know the number of Irish adults in the country today who were denied a third level education because they never got such assistance, or the number who were categorised as clumsy, for example, or even the number of left-handed children who were told that they could have it beaten out of them.  That happened in my lifetime.  Therefore, we have come a long way and that needs to be accepted.  The Disability Access Route to Education, DARE, scheme in particular has given access to third level education to many young adults who would never have had the opportunity otherwise.  With my experience of third level education I am aware that this support continues into third level education and that it is effective.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, report notes that the majority of schools operate an inclusive enrolment policy and practice.  The report indicates that some schools continue to operate less-than-wholly-inclusive enrolment practices.  The Minister is not running away from that issue.  It is important to recognise that the Minister has accepted the motion in the main and there is no essential disagreement.  However, it is also important to accept that the report under discussion only reached the Minister's desk on 17 May, less than two weeks ago.  To some extent we are being a little premature given the commitment the Minister and the Department have made to review it.  They have acknowledged that the report deserves in-depth and detailed examination and exploration and this takes a good deal more than two weeks.  The Minister has stated that a consultation will be required with stakeholders on some of the recommendations prior to any decisions being made to implement them.</p><p>At a recent trade union conference the Minister announced that he intended to bring to Government the draft heads of the education (admissions to school) Bill 2013 to tackle some of the issues that have been raised today in respect of school admission policies.  The Minister stated that the draft Bill will allow for a full public discussion, including ourselves and other Members of the Oireachtas, to ensure that we have a structured fair and transparent schools admission policy.  It is important to put that on the record.</p><p>One of the issues I had intended to raise has been raised by Senator Healy Eames.  It relates to one of the main findings of the NCSE policy advice to the effect that diagnosis should not be a prerequisite or determinant for the allocation of additional resources for a child or young person with special educational needs.  Instead allocation should be based on the needs of the child irrespective of category of disability.  I call on the Minister to explain this in more detail.</p><p>It is important to note that the Government has made and continues to make a significant contribution towards special needs education and that &euro;1.3 billion, which is approximately 15% of the Department's budget, is spent on special educational supports.  Like other Senators, I hope this commitment is maintained in future and I imagine the Minister shares that hope.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-05-29a.249" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1035" speakername="Ruairi Quinn" time="15:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013052900035#KK00200"><p>Members will be aware that the National Council for Special Education has a specific role under section 20 of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act, to which reference has already been made, to provide me, as the Minister for Education and Skills, with expert independent evidence-informed policy advice on the education of children and others with disabilities.  It is important to emphasise the nature of that advice.  Last year I called on the NCSE to review and make recommendations on the supports to be provided to children with special educational needs and on how they are allocated to ensure we are delivering the best possible education experience and outcomes for our children.  I was pleased to receive the report recently on 17 May.</p><p>The report is based on a review of best practice in both national and international research.  It also follows a wide process of consultation with children with special educational needs, parents, representative groups, educational partners, voluntary bodies and advocacies.  According to my note, which I do not doubt, children were part of the process as well.  There is no doubt that the report is a comprehensive and significant review of the provisions we make for such children.  The report makes it clear that there are many aspects of the current system which parents and schools are satisfied with and which are working well.  It is important to put that on the record.  We are making progress and this is a collective effort.  No one owns this legislation; it came through from different Administrations and it is working substantially well for many people.</p><p>The report notes the extent of the investment that has been made in providing for children with needs in schools and highlights the level of investment in providing special educational support.  This level remains at an all-time high despite the country's economic difficulties.  It has been stated already that some &euro;1.3 billion is spent and this represents approximately 15% of the total education budget.  This includes spending on approximately 10,000 special education teacher posts - these provide additional teaching to more than 32,000 students - and more than 10,500 special needs assistant supports for more than 22,000 students.  In addition, the Department funds specialist school transport, specialist equipment, assistive technology and the adaptation of school buildings.  We have made considerable progress in this area.</p><p>However, the report also raises several concerns in respect of some aspects of our current system under the headings of enrolments, assessments and supports for children with special educational needs and how those supports are allocated.  One of the main findings of the policy advice is that diagnosis should not be a prerequisite or a determinant for the allocation of additional resources for a child or young person with special needs.  Instead, it should be based on the needs of the child irrespective of the category of disability.  The report notes that the time of health professionals can be disproportionately taken up with conducting assessments as opposed to providing clinical interventions and supports, and states that in some cases parents may be delayed in getting resources because they have had to wait for assessments.  The report recommends that the allocation of additional teaching and care supports should be in line with the profiled need of each school.  The development of these resources should be linked to the student's learning plan process, a point made by Senator Moran, and it should be time-bound and outcome-focused.  The report recommends that a new model should be developed for the allocation of additional teaching resources to mainstream schools based on the profiled need of each school and such that it breaks the direct link between the allocation of additional resources and the diagnosis of disability.</p><p>Section 2 of the EPSEN Act relates to enrolments and provides for an inclusive education for children with special needs.  While not all aspects of the EPSEN Act have been commenced as of yet, section 2, providing for the right to inclusive education, has been commenced.  The section provides that, to the greatest extent possible, children with special educational needs should be educated with children who do not have such needs.  The policy of the Department is that children with special needs should be educated with their peers in local mainstream schools where additional support such as assistance and resource teachers are provided.  Where children with greater levels of need require specific interventions, special classes and special school placements are also provided.</p> <p>On school enrolment policies and practices, the NCSE report noted the majority of schools operate inclusive enrolment policies and practices.  It stated, generally, management bodies and schools have responded very positively to educating students with special educational needs in inclusive environments in mainstream schools.  However, it also indicated some schools still operate less than wholly inclusive enrolment practices by placing certain conditions on enrolment of children with special educational needs.</p><p>During the consultation process on the NCSE advice, some parents and NCSE staff reported finding difficulties in securing placements for children with special needs.  Some parents felt schools placed soft barriers to enrolment by advising them that a different school would be more suitable or better resourced.  Some schools also placed conditions in their enrolment policies.</p><p>To address these issues, the report recommended a robust regulatory enrolment framework should be introduced for schools.  As Senator Hayden already said, I am moving on that issue independently as there are concerns about general enrolment policies.</p><p>All mainstream schools are resourced in accordance with the same policy parameters and, therefore, they should all be equally welcoming of children with special educational needs.  That is the underlying principle behind the review of enrolment policy.  The NCSE has, accordingly, recommended that to address the outstanding difficulties that remain with this matter, an appropriate regulatory enrolment framework should be put in place.  The discussion paper on a regulatory framework for school enrolment contained suggestions on how to make the process of enrolling in schools more open, equitable and consistent.  It is available on my Department's website.</p><p>While section 15 of the Education Act requires schools to publish their enrolment policy and to make provision in that policy for pupils with disabilities or who have other special educational needs, the Act is light-touch in terms of providing ways and means of ensuring all schools welcome all children.  In summary, the existing legal framework is in essence confined to specifying the establishment and maintenance of an enrolment policy as a function of a school and providing for an appellate process under section 29 of the Education Act 1998.  It is not satisfactory and we intend to change it.  The primary aim of the proposals will be to ensure every child is treated fairly and that every child, including those with special educational needs, has a place at school.  This recent policy advice from the NCSE will be fully considered in the context of the proposed regulatory framework for school enrolment.  It is proposed that any legislative changes in the area of enrolment would seek to maintain and support the current position whereby decision-making resides with the board of management to the greatest extent possible.</p><p>Work is ongoing on this legislation.  I intend to bring heads of a Bill and the draft statutory instrument to Cabinet and send them to the Oireachtas committee on education for feedback.  A similar approach was adopted with the Education and Training Boards Bill which proved to be very satisfactory.</p><p>There are 28 recommendations in this comprehensive report, the first in 20 years.  It would be a dereliction of my duty as Minister if I were to give a commitment to implement uncritically all 28 recommendations without the Department having the time to analyse and cost them, as well as assessing how they could be implemented and the subsequent implications.  That is why we have put down this amendment to the motion.  As Senator Norris said, the preamble and thrust of the motion has been accepted.  I will carefully consider implementing all 28 recommendations but it would be irresponsible of me to give a commitment to the House to accept all of them before advice on them comes from the Department.</p><p>The Department is accountable to the House through the Minister.  The NCSE is a very fine organisation and a new chairman was appointed to it recently, a former chief inspector in the Department, Eamonn Stack, and a new board.  It gives us advice, but giving the Department of Education and Skills advice is different to making policy.  We have to be accountable for the making of policy.  We have to take advice carefully, analyse it and decide how much of it we want to implement.</p><p>One of the reasons the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 has not been fully implemented is the cost.  It was conceived in a different time when costs did not seem to be an obstacle to anything.</p></speech>

I have been able to ring-fence the amount of moneys available for its implementation.  We have capped the number of special needs assistants, SNAs, but there are pressures on the system.  This year, for example, the assessment process shows there is an increase in the number of overall special needs children coming into the system.  We are going to have to find ways of doing more with the same amount, not less.</p><p>I understand the sense that for many parents of children with special needs the only tangible support they can identify as coming from the wider community is measured in a SNA or a resource teacher.  If there is any alteration to that, it can be seen as the withdrawal of support by a community.  In some cases, if a SNA is there purely to provide toilet training, for example, and it has been achieved, there should be a way the young person with special needs can graduate.  That is the whole purpose of the intervention.  It is not custodial or palliative in that sense but an intervention to adjust the gap between normality and children with special needs.  In some cases through research and intervention we can do that.</p></speech>

In some cases, those consequences may change the nature of the support.  In this debate, we must not just measure the commitment to a policy by the amount of moneys put into it but also measure its success.  We do this in our own personal lives.  We adopt a course of action and invest time in it.  If it is not working to our satisfaction, then it is normal to try something else.</p><p>This report took some time to produce with much consultation.  We only have it less than a month and I do not expect to have a detailed working plan back from the Department until September, given all the other pressures we are under coming into the holiday period.  As soon as I have a response, I will publish it along with the recommendations I am implementing immediately, those when I have the resources to implement them and those I might dispute on which I might seek a second opinion.  We are not simply going to implement all 28 recommendations.  Advice is different to direction.  It is for us to consider that advice carefully and respectfully and then proceed to implement it.  My predecessors and specialists have given us great guidance in this area.</p><p>I acknowledge the presence of representatives of Down's Syndrome Ireland in the Gallery.  I confirm what I said to one of its representatives in the Clock Tower in the Department of Education and Skills when the policy was launched and I will make arrangements to meet with them soon.  I know the group was involved in briefing the Oireachtas and I got many calls from many of the representatives.</p></speech>

I want to acknowledge Senator Deirdre Clune's valid comment, which I certainly support, about the important role played by special schools.  I also acknowledge Senators Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill and Fidelma Healy Eames for their recent contributions on this issue in the Seanad.</p><p>Whenever we consider these matters, it comes down to a question of what type of society we want to be.  I hope we are all aiming towards a secure, gentle society that is life-affirming and inclusive.  It is always the test of a civilised society how well it treats its weakest and most vulnerable members, and I believe that is tied in closely with this issue.</p><p>I am interested in a number of the points made by Senator Healy Eames.  She is right to talk about the importance of outputs rather than inputs.  We need to measure developments in terms of the impact they are having or the outcomes for children and their learning.  I acknowledge the commitment of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, to this area, and I note his proposal to introduce legislation.  In the context of the health debate, it has often been said that money should follow the patient.  For me, one point that emerges very clearly is that money should follow the student, so that, instead of seeing the issue in terms of the funding of schools, we identify the specific needs of individual children.  This is why it is so important that we look to the full implementation of the EPSEN Act.</p><p>I want to thank the representatives of Down Syndrome Ireland in particular for being here today.  The case of children with Down's syndrome is central to this debate and I, of course, acknowledge Senator Aideen Hayden's point that we need to be concerned with the wide range of special needs that present to us.  It is important, as numerous speakers noted, that Down's syndrome be classified as a low-incidence disorder and that we see the issue through that lens.  I believe the Minister's decision in this area should be informed by the findings of the Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan, in her recent report.  Her view is that the decision of the Department of Education and Skills not to grant pupils with Down's syndrome an automatic entitlement to additional teaching resources has adversely affected the capacity of children with Down's syndrome to engage to the fullest possible extent in mainstream primary schooling.  Of course, that criticism came in a report arising from a complaint by the mothers of two children with Down's syndrome attending mainstream primary schools.  In a situation such as that we are not talking about direct discrimination against children with Down's syndrome, but we are talking about discrimination in effect.</p><p>The Minister said, and I have to agree with him, that advice is different from direction.  Far too often, Government hides behind advice to push through very controversial measures.  I can certainly think of reports that deserved to be more closely scrutinised before the Government hid behind them.  That said, it is not unknown for reports that are credible and excellent to have an early commitment to implementation.</p><p>I totally understand the Minister's position.  He is doing his best but, like any Minister in his position, he is terrified of the resource implications.  I know that is not the only issue he adverted to, and he said he wants to see whether he agrees with all of the recommendations.  However, while I can understand that it is the Minister's sense that it is his duty not to jump in, and I acknowledge that he, by implication, accepts the thrust or content of the motion, none the less, he stands back from a commitment because he wants to consider it.  I feel it is my duty to ensure we keep the pressure on here, and that we have seen and heard enough to know this is something we ought to implement.</p><p>I have not heard any substantial criticism of the recommendations in the report and, for that reason, I believe I and this House ought to call on the Minister to implement it.  It is not unknown for politicians or the Government to make commitments to implement certain things and then, when they find difficulties, to step back, delay or review.  I do not believe we will be doing any harm to the cause of children with special needs - in fact, quite the contrary - if we state in this House that this report and its recommendations should be implemented.  On that basis, I cannot accept the Government's amendment to the motion.  While the Minister may have the best intentions, for this House to say he should merely consider the report would not pay a just tribute to the content of what is a very fine report.  On that basis, I must persist with my motion.  None the less, I thank the Minister for his attentive and informed answer, and for all the work he is doing.</p></speech>

It is a matter close to my heart because it is one of common sense.  If people are provided with a sufficient number of home help hours at minimal cost, they will be kept out of expensive institutions.</p><p>Senators Denis Landy and John Whelan and I have been vocal on this issue for a long time.  We are vocal on behalf of those who were deprived of home help hours in 2012.  We are also vocal on behalf of the home helps who have been before the Labour Court on 12 occasions in the past 12 months over their contracts not being honoured.  They are not being given the hours which they have been contracted to do, which is a major issue.  A contract is an agreement between two sides and one half of that agreement is not being honoured.</p><p>I expressed my dissatisfaction with the home help cuts made in 2012.  I made representations on the issue before the last budget and received assurances that this decision would be reversed.  It was mentioned in the budget announcement that the decision had been reversed and the figure of &euro;7 million was restored to the home help budget.  However, nobody I know who had their home help hours cut in 2012 has had them restored.  I have viewed the HSE service plans in various counties in my neck of the woods and they reflect the same number of home help hours post the cuts in 2012.  Nothing has changed.</p><p>It is obvious that either one of two things has happened.  Either the announcement was not honoured and the money was not given back to the HSE, or the HSE received the money and spent it elsewhere.  I would like to have clarity on that issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-05-29a.267" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1127" speakername="Denis O'Donovan" time="16:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013052900039#OO00700"><p>I will not go over the ground Senator John Kelly has eloquently and fairly covered.  I have raised this issue previously.  Irrespective of what side of the House one is on, the home help hours provided for elderly people, whether in towns or remote areas such as the area from where I come, represent very good value for money.  Senator John Kelly alluded to the cost that would be involved if the State were to provide care for elderly people.  I compiled a report on the issue when I was a Member of the D&aacute;il and found that the cost to the State of such provision would be eight or nine times greater than the cost of enabling people to be cared for in their own homes.  We would all like to see people being cared for in their own homes, if at all possible.</p><p>  More than one year ago I dealt with the case of a 99  year old woman who had been taken to Bantry Hospital.  Her son who was in his 70s who had been caring for her had cancer.  He begged me to try to get the hospital to provide a long-stay bed for his mother because he was not in a fit condition to care for her.  The consultant geriatrician at the hospital, a very professional man, interviewed her, did the arithmetic and she was sent home.  She had never been in hospital in her life, except for these few days.  The consultant said he had talked to the woman and even though she was totally blind, she was fully <i>corpus mentis</i> and had told him that she wanted to go home because that was where she was comfortable living.  She fell short of reaching her 100 hundred birthday by a few months, but did not die as a result of the state of her health during those few days in hospital.  </p><p>  Geriatricians and the health experts say that in so far as it is possible to do so, it is best to care for people at home, yet because of the system in place and the cutbacks made, in some instances, home helps have only a half an hour to spend with the people being cared for.  One home help has told me that she boils the kettle and makes a cup of tea for the person concerned and that some of the people to whom she calls have to be showered and brought to the toilet.  Is she to leave the house after 30 minutes, similar to the time limit imposed on speakers by the Cathaoirleach from time to time, signalled by the sound of the bell, and leave the person concerned sitting on the toilet who would be unable to get up off it unaided?</p><p>  There is a case to be made for home help provision for those who need the service and whom we are neglecting through these mealy-mouthed cutbacks.  A case can also be made, as Senator John Kelly said, for the home helps who are providing the service, some of whom are very experienced, skillful and have been doing this work for a long time.  They are being treated abominably.  </p><p>  That is my tuppence worth.  We should work together to try to solve this problem  This is not a party political issue but a national one, about which I am deeply concerned.</p></speech>

Senators John Kelly and Denis O'Donovan have outlined the position which was clearly stated in previous discussions by our colleague, Senator John Whelan.</p><p>There are  535,000 people in Ireland over 65 years of age, which represents an increase of 12% since the 2006 census.  The CSO has showed that between now and 2036, 15,000 more people will need home help care.  The use of Exchequer funding for the provision of the home help service, undoubtedly, represents good value for money, in providing a service in people's homes, thus preventing them from having to go into nursing homes which would impose a further cost on the State.  Everybody agrees with this.  </p><p>The issue we are trying to get to the bottom of, as Senators John Kelly and Denis O'Donovan have outlined, is that there was a cut of &euro;8 million in the last quarter of 2012 and that money was to be restored in the 2013 budget.  The evidence available to me, through my constitutency, my constituency office and the people with whom I deal on a daily basis, shows that the hours removed have not been restored.  Reassessments were made in early 2013.  People who were in need of home help hours in 2012 are now being told that they are not in need of them in 2013.  The people concerned are a year older and more infirm, yet a decision has been made that the hours do not need to be restored.  Clearly, there is some trick of the loop when we are being told in various reports, to which Senator John Kelly alluded, that at regional level hours are being restored.  Perhaps they are, but they are not being restored to the people from whom they were removed in 2012.  They have the same health problems and are now a year older, but they are not receiving the samen umber of home help hours.  It is falling on families who are hard pressed as it is to provide a service for their elderly mother or father on a private basis.  They are unable to do this and are coming to us.  I want to know from the Minister of State what is happening about this issue.  That is the crux of matter.  In anticipation of his reply, I thank him for coming to the House to deal with it.</p></speech>

The home help service is a core community service supporting, principally, older people to remain in their own homes, preventing admission to acute services, delaying or preventing admission to continuing residential care and facilitating early discharge from the acute sector to the community.  The Health Service Executive has responsibility for the delivery of services such as mainstream home help, enhanced home care packages, meals on wheels and day or respite care services.  The volume and types of health service to be delivered within the available funding for 2013 have been set out in the HSE's national service plan.  My colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, approved and laid a copy of the plan before both Houses earlier this year.  The HSE has a statutory responsibility to live within the budget voted by the Oireachtas.</p><p>  This year the HSE has committed to maintaining community supports such as home help and home care packages at the levels planned for in 2012.  This means that 10,870<b></b>people will be in receipt of home care packages and that 10.3 million<b></b>hours of home help service will be provided, with 50,000 people receiving the service.</p><p>  Our commitment to restore home help hours to 2012 levels has been delivered.  The HSE service plan for 2013 provides &euro;392 million<b></b>for community based services for older people.</p> <p>The target for home help hours in the HSE's 2012 plan was set at 10.7 million hours.  This target was incorrect.  During the period 2012 to 2013 a data problem was uncovered in one HSE region which had resulted in the figures being overstated.  Put simply, for a period of time in one HSE region, service figures counted all of the members of a family instead of the individual in receipt of the service in the household.  This inflated the 2012 figure but this error has now been corrected.</p><p>The correct original national target, therefore, for 2012 should have been 10.3 million hours.  This is the target now also set for 2013.  Home help hours targets have been profiled in order to focus service delivery on the times of peak demand within each region.  Activity data is being monitored to ensure that the agreed targets are met relative to the agreed profiling and by year end.  The HSE has delivered over 2.2 million home help hours for the first quarter of 2013.  I understand that the information requested by Senator Kelly was supplied to him earlier this week.</p><p>I acknowledge that this involves a reduction of around 7% in hours nationally, from some 11.1 million hours delivered in 2011, to the current target of 10.3 million hours for 2013.  However due to service efficiencies in this area, the number of people in receipt of home help service will only be reduced by 2%.  It is important also to note that the HSE works to ensure that the impact of this reduction is minimised by ensuring that services are provided in the first instance for direct patient care.  Decisions in relation to the provision of home help hours continue to be based on an assessment of individual needs.</p><p>There is no doubt that these are challenging times for the health services overall, including maintaining home care services in line with evolving resource pressures.  The demand for these, which are highly regarded by those who receive the service, continues to grow as the population of older people expands and as many more older people with complex care needs are maintained at home.  Notwithstanding this difficult financial environment we should not lose sight of the fact that just over &euro;390 million is being provided this year for community services for older people and that about 100,000 older people will be receiving various community-based supports during 2013.</p></speech>

The HSE is more or less saying that a mistake was made.  However, I received figures from the HSE about the number of clients in receipt of home help in the first quarter of 2011 showing 51,735 people in receipt of home help hours.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-05-29a.273" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1161" speakername="John Kelly" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013052900040#PP00400"><p>That number has dropped to 45,000 in the first quarter of this year.  Therefore, 6,000 fewer people are in receipt of home help hours now.  This does not answer the question about the people who were in receipt of home help hours in 2012 whose hours were cut and not restored.  I am not satisfied that the HSE response to my question deals with the situation I am trying to portray.  I will leave it with the Minister of State.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-05-29a.274" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1127" speakername="Denis O'Donovan" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013052900040#PP00500"><p>I note the Minister of State's response and I thank him for coming to the House.  He indicates there has been just a 2% decrease.  However, the age profile of our society is going the other way in my view there should be an increase of 2% or 3% rather than a decrease.  I ask the Minister of State to convey to the Minister, Deputy Reilly, that in my view, when the pressure is on the HSE budgets the home help service is the easy picking.  Most of the people in receipt of home help cannot speak for themselves and they are depending on us to raise the issue here.  It is appalling that there should be any cuts whatsoever in this area.  I am disappointed with the response.</p></speech>

The financial background is the basis on which services have been reduced, unfortunately, not just in this very important area but across the board.  I agree with Senator O'Donovan's general sentiment and also with his point that the age profile has to be taken into account.  There is a continuing need in that regard.  If greater provision could be made or could have been made it would have been done.  We are simply operating under the constraints that are well known.  I regard it as a priority area and the Senator has a right to raise it in the House and to keep up the pressure for the reasons Senator O'Donovan and Senator Kelly have adverted to.  In respect of the precise figures given to Senator Kelly during the week, I cannot comment in detail, other than to say that the information I have given to the House this evening is correct.  As to whether individuals should have a change in their position I repeat that these decisions are made on the basis of the assessment of individual needs and that is how it is approached.</p></speech>

The EU directive on cross-border health care gives citizens of member states the right to travel to another member state if suitable health care is not available or is unduly delayed in their own member state.  That directive was signed off as far back as February 2011 and the Government has 30 months in which to put it in place.  The treatment abroad fund currently deals with that area.  My concern is that the time period is running out and there is a need to set up the structures for dealing with the directive.  I ask for clarification on the Department's current position.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-05-29a.278" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1024" speakername="Alex White" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013052900040#PP00800"><p>The EU directive on the application of patients' rights in cross-border health care provides clarity about the rights of patients who seek health care in another member state and supplements the rights that patients already have at EU level through the legislation on the co-ordination of social security schemes, Regulation 883/04.  The purpose of the directive is to establish a clear legal framework to facilitate cross-border health care with a focus on patient rights; information for patients on entitlements; patient choice.  The directive aims to facilitate access to safe and high-quality cross-border health care; to promote co-operation on health care between member states, in full respect of national competencies in organising and delivering health care; to facilitate efficient transfer of patient information between member states; to establish a mechanism to facilitate reimbursement of the cost of treatment abroad; to introduce a system of prior authorisation for certain categories of treatment.  It is not envisaged that the directive would establish any new entitlements or rights to treatment.  In essence the directive provides rules for the reimbursement to patients of the cost of receiving treatment abroad, where the patient would be entitled to such treatment in their home member state or the member state of affiliation.  However, in this regard, it should be emphasised that the vast majority of EU patients receive health care in their own country and prefer to do so.  Thus, the directive seeks to ensure a clear and transparent framework for the provision of cross-border health care within the EU. for those occasions where the care patients seek is provided in another member state than in their home country.  It is also worth noting that the Commission recognises that member states are responsible for the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care, in particular for determining which rules will apply to the reimbursement of patients and to the provision of health care.</p><p>The Government welcomes the directive as it provides a coherent and uniform set of rules for patients throughout the EU and it will initiate a new phase of co-operation between 27 national health systems.  It is also hoped that the directive may contribute towards reducing inequalities in access to care by helping patients to choose their health care-provider across the EU.  Patients will, under the directive, have greater and clearer access to information on the quality and safety of the care they will receive in whichever member state they decide to have their treatment.  All of the above issues are complex and require careful consideration before proposals to transpose the directive are finalised.  This is the issue raised in Senator Burke's matter.  My Department continues its work on the required legislative framework to facilitate the assimilation of the directive into domestic legislation.  Details of legislative changes required will be published closer to the date for transposition of the directive.  The Senator made reference to the time limit in that regard.  The Government intends to keep to that time limit.</p></speech>

My understanding is that the time will expire by the end of August 2013.  This leaves quite a limited period of time in which to transpose the directive.  I am concerned with regard to entitlements.</p></speech>
