I refer to an extremely serious issue that I have had occasion to deal with in north Dublin.  Nationwide, there are 58 early intervention teams but in 11 Health Service Executive, HSE, areas, there is no early intervention team at all.  The entire Dublin region has no early intervention teams.  The purpose of such teams is to assess and support children with disabilities by agreeing with their parents a path forward for them and to consider the areas in which the children need assistance to help them to develop further and to reach their potential.  However, there are 11 HSE areas without an early intervention team and consequently, the children have no support at all.  More worryingly - I have written to the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, in this regard because I have encountered a couple of cases in the north Dublin region - since June 2012 the HSE is not even adding to the waiting lists.  This is about children with disabilities but a family seeking early intervention assistance through the HSE for a child is not even being added to the waiting list.  The purpose of this obviously is to enable the HSE to massage the figures.  I have to hand the complete figures on an area-by-area basis as to the number of children who are waiting for early intervention but surprisingly enough, for the Dublin region the number of children in each team has been left blank in all of the areas because the waiting lists have closed.  I have written to the Minister and know of families who have visited his office in Swords.  The response they received was to ask the parents whether they could not have the assessment done privately.  Many of these parents cannot afford to have such assessments carried out privately.  This is an extremely serious issue that must be addressed.</p><p>The Minister with responsibility in this regard is the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, as well as his junior ministerial college, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  Moreover, I imagine the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, would have something to say in this regard.  What is the Government's response to this issue?  Will there simply be no early intervention teams in 11 areas, including all the Dublin areas, Kildare, west Wicklow and Wicklow itself?  No service at all has been made available in those areas.  What is the Government's position about not even having a waiting list?  Anyone who applies is being told the waiting lists are closed.  Colleagues on all sides of the House, of any party and none, will agree this is a completely unacceptable situation.  I will conclude by asking the Leader to arrange for the Minister to come into the House to discuss what will be done in this regard as soon as possible, that is, next week or this Thursday.  I do not believe anyone thinks the current position is tenable or acceptable as, after all, this pertains to kids and anyone who understands the issue of children with disabilities will understand the importance of early intervention and being able to set out a plan for such children to reach their potential.  All Members will be concerned about this issue and I respectfully ask the Leader to arrange an early debate on this matter, in order that the Government can put forward what it plans to do about it.</p></speech>

In the context of the story that first was broken in <i>The Sunday Times</i> last Sunday, it would be a good idea for Members to have a debate once they have a little more clarity as to what exactly has occurred.  Certainly, it is a matter of grave concern that the agency that has been entrusted with the independent oversight of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na apparently has been subjected to surveillance.  I understand the Minister is likely to give a statement to the D&aacute;il this afternoon and that tomorrow, the three members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission will appear before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions here in Leinster House.  While there may be greater clarity as to what occurred after those two developments, I seek a debate as soon as possible thereafter to address the critical question as to whether there was bugging of GSOC - if so, who authorised it or was it authorised, whether it was carried out unlawfully, and, if so, by whom?</p> <p>There are other questions to which no doubt the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission will be asked to respond tomorrow concerning the reason it considered it wise not to report the matter to the Minister for Justice and Equality, but the critical question-----</p></speech>

That is the sinister question.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties, Transparency International and other groups have expressed grave concern about the reports.  We only have reports at this stage; there is very little clarity as to what exactly went on.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission's own statement is not clear on what exactly went on and suggests this was not the first occasion on which it believed it might have been subject to surveillance.  Clearly, we need more information, but I would like us to have a debate in when we have a little more information.</p><p>I commend our colleagues in the other House, Deputies John Lyons and Jerry Buttimer, for speaking so frankly and openly last Thursday night on their experiences of discrimination on the grounds of sexuality, in other words, their experience of homophobia.  I also commend our colleague, Senator David Norris, for speaking so eloquently about the matter on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; on Friday night.</p><p>In the context of the ongoing debate on homophobia, I also commend the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, who has turned down an invitation to attend the St. Patrick's Day parade in New York-----</p></speech>

It concerns homophobia.  I would like to read the most authoritative statement on the welfare of children.  It comes from the American Academy of Pediatrics and was published in April 2013.  It reads:<blockquote><br />Extensive data available from more than 30 years of research revealed that children raised by gay and lesbian parents have demonstrated resilience with regard to social, psychological and sexual health, despite economic and legal disparities and social stigma.  Many studies have demonstrated that children's well-being is affected much more by the relationships with their parents, their parents' sense of competence and security, and the presence of social and economic support for the family than by the gender or the sexual orientation of their parents.  Lack of opportunity for same-gender couples to marry adds to families' stress, which affects the health and welfare of all household members.  Because marriage strengthens families and, in so doing, benefits children's development, children should not be deprived of the opportunity for their parents to be married.  Paths to parenthood that include assisted reproductive techniques, adoption, and foster parenting should focus on competency of the parents rather than sexual orientation.</blockquote>A complaint was made by a solicitor acting on behalf of a particular person.  The solicitor was instructed on 11 January.  That person remained on the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland until 23 January, nearly two weeks later.  The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland is charged with upholding freedom of expression.  There was a very clear conflict of interest.</p><p>  On &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; I quoted from an interview, which can be substantiated.  It states:<blockquote>...this is really a kind of satire on marriage that is being conducted by the gay lobby.  It is not that they want to get married, it is that they want to destroy the institution of marriage because they are envious of it ... [They] started a campaign for marriage which is purely an attempt to discredit an institution, a normative institution, on which society, on which human civilization, is founded...</blockquote>That is an attack on gay people, which is clearly homophobic.  It states gay people are an insidious element that is attempting to destroy our entire society.  If I felt that way, I would believe it was right to repress them in the most strict and harsh manner possible.</p></speech>

I acknowledge it is not the Leader's fault, but calls have been made in the Chamber for debates on important issues which we could easily take place this Thursday and next Thursday.  It is disappointing that, through no fault of any Senator, the Cathaoirleach or the Leader, the House is not sitting and it does not look good for this institution or the Government's approach to political reform.</p><p>I primarily want to raise the concerns many citizens have about the alleged bugging of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Office.  This is a very worrying development.  The Government's response was disappointing in that the Minister for Justice and Equality appeared to be more concerned about not being informed than about dealing with the central questions of whether the office had been bugged and, if so, by whom.  We need to get the answers very quickly because it would be appalling if the watchdog over An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was being bugged.  We need a prompt response and the Minister needs to act quickly.  I would like an independent inquiry to be conducted to get to the bottom of the matter to ensure the integrity and independence of the office is protected and to find out who was responsible.  I join Senator Ivana Bacik in calling for a debate on this important issue.  All of us want to ensure whoever is responsible is brought to justice and that we get the full facts.  Why can we not have that debate on Thursday?  I fail to see why the Minister cannot make himself available to discuss this issue in the House.</p><p>We have not yet debated the HSE service plan, even though we were promised such a debate.  The Leader stated last week that we could have the Minister for Health before us to debate 15 issues.  Why can he not come to the House on Thursday to discuss the HSE's service plan?</p> <p> I am not placing the blame for this at the door of the Leader, but I am saying it is an appalling situation that must be rectified.  Moreover, I am serving notice that if no Thursday sitting is scheduled next week, my party will write to the relevant committee of the Oireachtas seeking permission to hold a debate in this Chamber on any issue that is of relevance to the people of this State.  If that request is refused, we will book the AV room and hold the debate there.  We will turn up for work and do our job.  We will not be held back from doing so by any Minister or by the Taoiseach.</p></speech>

As the previous speaker pointed out, we are hardly run off our feet in this Chamber.  In fact, it is an absolute disgrace that for the second week in a row the House is sitting for only one and a half days.  In making this point, I mean to cast no reflection on Members, the Leader or anyone attending the Seanad.  An attempt was made to kill us off in a referendum, but it did not succeed.  An effort was made to remove our ability to have a workplace and that, too, failed.  Now they are trying to kill us with kindness by denying us an adequate legislative schedule and refusing to make Ministers available.</p></speech>

I call on the Leader to invite the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, who should be able to spare us an hour this Thursday or any other Thursday, to come into the Chamber, as Minister responsible for inland waterways, and explain how he proposes to put a stop to what Waterways Ireland is doing.  I call on all Senators to intervene to save the Naomh &Eacute;anna, the vessel currently in dock at Grand Canal which operated as an Aran Islands ferry from 1956 to 1986.  Waterways Ireland's plan is to throw that vessel on the scrap heap even though there is a group of people in this city willing to salvage and restore it at no cost to the taxpayer and thereby preserve an important item of heritage.</p><p>More urgently, we must ensure the Minister does not sign into law the new regulations and rules concerning canals.  Canals throughout the county are being destroyed because the last few remaining barges and boats are being driven out by a tenfold increase in fees and fines.  If the new regulations come into force, there will be no boat or barge left on the canals, with devastating consequences for towns such as Tullamore, Sallins, Athy, Vicarstown and Monasterevin, which rely on the tourism from the canals.  They are an important amenity and resource which were run into the ground in the 1960s and 1970s and turned into dumps before undergoing something of a revival in recent times.  We must have the Minister in the House to hear the Seanad's view on this matter.  These draconian new laws will desecrate an important amenity that we should instead be regenerating in order to build tourism in the midlands.</p></speech>

Although I do not agree with him on most issues, I support the call made by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, on his way into the Cabinet meeting this morning for the commission to clarify what it means by "anomalies".</p><p>The Government response to this issue has been poor in the extreme.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, seemed mainly concerned with complaining that he, as Minister, should have been told about it first.  We had the Taoiseach talking rubbish from abroad, apparently not even fully briefed on the relevant legislation, and echoing the line that the Minister should have been informed of what was happening.  We had a representative of the commission effectively telling us last night, through the media, that the commission had come to a dead end with its investigation but, by the way, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was not implicated.  That looks dodgy to me.  Delegates from the commission will come before the relevant Oireachtas committee tomorrow, but the question arises as to what they will be allowed to tell us.</p><p>What is required is an announcement, before the end of the day, of a full independent inquiry into this matter.  Indeed, we should have had an announcement this morning that some international body would be invited to examine the situation.  This is up there with the Arms Trial.  It is up there with a murderer being found in the Attorney General's apartment in the early 1980s.</p> <p>We are talking about the most important arm of the State from a justice perspective.  The people who oversee the police force and the legal apparatus of the State are saying there were anomalies and may have been bugs.  We have the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na saying it had nothing to do with it and the representative organisations calling on the chairperson of the Ombudsman commission to consider his position.  Ministers are running around in circles, more concerned about knowing first.  This is a disaster.  Who is running the country?  Who is in charge of our justice system?  Where does the buck stop?  We need to know.  The only way we will get that in a way people can be confident of is through an international, independent inquiry as a matter of utmost urgency.  It should be given a couple of weeks to report.  Then we can know what is going on, who was listening to who, why, and what implications there are for the security of the State.</p></speech>

It is not up with the Arms Trial and the bugging of the telephones of Geraldine Kennedy and Bruce Arnold, which were proven facts.  Who was reputed to have provided the tape recorder for that event?  We should also protect people - and hope the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is protected - from unwarranted aspersions and this "dodgy" stuff.

We had a most valuable discussion on that with the Minister, covering issues such as the fact that the fatality rate on Irish roads increased by 17% in the past year.  I am hoping it is not a trend away from a very good trend over a number of years.  There were discussions about technology and infrastructure, which are very important.  The Bill would gain if Committee Stage were taken today and Report Stage amendments considered at a later stage.</p><p>Important discussions are taking place this week with respect to EU-US free trade.  Some of the talks are taking place here.  One matter that concerns the wonderful relations we have in respect of investment and the role of the United States in the peace process is the absence of an ambassador.  The well-respected Dan Rooney resigned on 14 December 2012 and the House would welcome the vacancy being filled as quickly as possible in view of the major investment links between the two countries, the role of the United States in the peace process, and the approach of St. Patrick's Day.  We would welcome an ambassador.  The chain of warm communications between Ireland and the United States is broken.  Irish people living in the United States are very strongly in favour of the vacancy being filled.  Perhaps the Leader, on behalf of the House, will communicate this to the appropriate authorities.  We very much look forward to welcoming a new American ambassador to Ireland.</p></speech>

I asked for a debate on this last week.  It is scandalous that we are letting Thursdays go to waste and not taking the opportunity to debate many issues.  The Inland Waterways Association of Ireland has contacted me because it has not been given much consultation time on these proposed charges.  Only 21 one days was given to everyone.</p><p>Hundreds of single people and families will be affected by these decisions.  I listened to a debate on radio this morning between Senator Whelan and a representative of Waterways Ireland who said the increases could be &euro;4 per year but under the proposed by-laws the increase is ten times the current charge making an increase of up to &euro;3,500 a year.  That will drive those people off the canals into the waiting room of the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan, and onto housing lists, putting further pressure on the system.  There is no reason we cannot have a debate tomorrow or next Thursday, before the Minister signs these by-laws. </p><p>I support Senator Bacik&rsquo;s point that the bugging scandal at the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, which is being covered by the media at the moment, be independently investigated.  There is a lot of innuendo in the media about the garda&iacute; which is very harmful to the garda&iacute; and I am not sure there is any accuracy in it.  I will not rush to judgment because many organisations could have bugged the offices of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  In 1986 or 1987, when the murder of Father Niall Molloy was under investigation, Martin Cahill, one of the biggest criminals in the country, broke into the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, and stole that file, purely to embarrass the garda&iacute;.  This matter warrants independent investigation before anybody rushes to judgment. </p></speech>

Could the Leader forward a list to us of the engagements that each of the Ministers and Ministers of State had last Thursday so that we could see what was more pressing for them than coming to the Seanad?  It might be quite enlightening.</p><p>Ba mhaith liom freisin tr&eacute;asl&uacute; le R&oacute;n&aacute;n &Oacute; Domhnaill, at&aacute; ainmnithe inniu mar an t&eacute; at&aacute; an Rialtas ag roghn&uacute; maidir le h&aacute;it an Choimisin&eacute;ir Teanga a ghlacadh.

It highlights the challenges we will face over the next few years in respect of the growing number of people over 65 years of age.</p> <p>For example, there is an interesting statistic indicating that by 2021 there will be a 46% increase in the age group over 85.  We need to start long-term planning, particularly with regard to home care and nursing home care packages.  In particular, there is a need for an increased number of nursing home beds, and by 2021 we will need approximately 4,000 additional beds, even if we are speaking conservatively about the available figures.  If we started that process in the morning, it would take at least three years to take in the planning, construction and completion of nursing home accommodation.</p><p>It is time for us to have a debate on long-term planning for this area.  There should be a five, ten, 15 and 20 year plan.  We must debate the issue, as it is extremely important.  It will not go away and we must put in place a long-term plan to deal with it.  I ask the Leader to organise a debate with the relevant Minister at an early date.</p></speech>

We did not manage to convince the Minister that something should be done about it and that we should follow the example set in a number of other countries, but we were discussing only water and electricity.  I have not yet heard the result of today's vote, but personnel in Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports are deciding whether to engage in strike action.  It seems there are other critical utilities and services.  We really should give attention to the issue in order to avoid the automatic assumption that a small number of people can close down the nation.  Electricity and water are vital but major transport also plays a part.</p><p>I also seek a debate on a decision that is likely to come here very shortly on what is termed a statutory code of conduct in the grocery business.  This was voted on in the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, but although it recommended the measure, no attention was paid to the cost of food for the average household.  If a statutory code of conduct is pursued in the grocery trade, there will be two consequences.  The price of food will go up, and everybody in the food business will be encouraged to import from outside, as the State cannot exert control on that basis.  The debate that occurred in that committee needed to go much further and needed to hear the opinion of the housewives, families and parents of Ireland; these are the people who buy food and serve our citizens.  We should do more than just taking into account the voices of those in the production, grocery or agricultural businesses.  We should have a wider debate than the narrow discussion that took place in that committee.</p></speech>

I am inclined to agree with Senator Bacik that until there is much more clarity and detail - and, at a minimum, until we hear the Minister's statement and until we establish whether there has been bugging - we should not go near the issue.

There is not a Member in this Chamber who does not feel a sense of ownership where the strategy is concerned.  I can remember the debates which took place.  They were totally separate from politics.  It was about the importance of the language and the love we all have for the language and the richness of the language.  It is not just a St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day syndrome or a seachtain na Gaeilge syndrome; it is our national language.  If we were discussing issues such as those that have arisen from the controversy on the Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga, they would be at the top of our priority list.  Perhaps the Leader would arrange in the coming weeks an opportunity for the Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy McGinley, to come to the House and to put a lot of the controversial issues to bed once and for all.</p></speech>

It has a serious role to play.  If anyone has deliberately set out to cause damage to its activity then they will have questions to answer and must be held accountable.  How we do that is a matter of debate in this House and elsewhere.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions.  We have a role to play.  Parliament has the right to ask questions to try to establish what happened.  At this point, whether there is a need for an independent inquiry remains to be seen but the fact that GSOC is coming readily to the committee tomorrow is a good sign.  I will ask the Garda Commissioner to also come back before the committee because there is so much confusion and so many remarks have been made in the public arena that it is the right place for it to be sorted out, and it would be welcome for the Garda Commissioner to have his opportunity to speak in a fair and clear manner.  While it remains to be seen, it may well be the case that we need also to have a debate in this House on the matter.</p><p>In fact, the matters Senator Norris raised, have also been raised with the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions last week.  We will look into those matters.  Perhaps I might be able to have a word with him on the issue afterwards.</p></speech>

I was out and about in Galway yesterday and there is much public concern.  While the appropriate word might not be &ldquo;dodgy&rdquo;, there is certainly a lot of doubt.  Questions are being asked about what type of country we are living in and what type of culture this is.  We thought we had gone away from that but serious doubts have been raised about penalty points and top-ups.  All that is feeding into doubt.  I take cognisance of what others have said.  We might need to pursue the issue further following tomorrow&rsquo;s session with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission in the committee.</p> <p> The Leader will know that I tabled an item for discussion on the Adjournment today but the Cathaoirleach ruled it out of order.  I was seeking a debate on Irish Water, with seven questions to be answered.  From next September, every householder in this country will be billed for water, with payment starting next January.  The Cathaoirleach ruled my adjournment matter out of order on the basis that it should form part of a substantive debate.  In that context, I ask the Leader to agree to a substantive debate on Irish Water.  Questions remain unanswered concerning staff numbers, bonus payments, pensions, obsolete metering and the carrying out of a cost-benefit analysis.  We also need to know why the Siemens bid to install meters for &euro;800 million, without an up-front payment, was rejected.  These issues are of enormous public concern.  I ask the Leader to schedule that debate because the issues arising now were unknown to us at the time of our previous debate on Irish Water.</p></speech>

To be quite frank, I was most disappointed to hear the statement from the Chairman of the Garda Ombudsman Commission on the evening news yesterday.  I felt sorry for rank and file garda&iacute; with the mention of the Garda in the statement.  The Chairman would have been well advised to refrain from commenting until after the Cabinet meeting today.  Members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na all over the country are upset.  At least one of the Garda representative bodies has now called on the Chairman to resign.  He certainly needs to respond to the Garda Commissioner, Mr. Callinan and clarify exactly what he meant by his comment.  Clarity is needed urgently because rank and file garda&iacute; all over the country are very upset.  Whether it was the Chairman's intention or not, garda&iacute; have taken offence.  In everybody's interests and as a matter of urgency, the statement needs to be clarified.</p></speech>

The success of our agriculture sector is being hindered by recent cattle prices which suggest that the market is uncompetitive.  This is of great concern to most people out there, particularly those who are working as farmers.  Recently I did a price comparison and the average market steer prices among the top three companies in Ireland were almost identical, with the greatest difference between two companies being only five cent per kilo.  Right now beef prices in the United Kingdom are at almost &euro;5 per kilo, which is over &euro;1 per kilo more than what Irish farmers are making.  This gap in the prices between Ireland and the United Kingdom is unprecedented.  The uncompetitive meat companies are holding prices down in the Irish market and livestock farmers are suffering as a result.  The Government cannot allow this kind of profiteering to continue.  It is clear that the market is lacking in true competition.  This is harmful to our economy and especially harmful to our livestock farmers.  Irish farmers have had to put up with a lot in recent years, with rural areas hit the hardest by the recession, the fodder crisis, budget cuts and now the flooding problems.  In 2011, Members may remember, the Competition Authority found that an agreement had been made among competitors in the beef industry to reduce capacity in Ireland and control the market to their benefit.  I support a full investigation into what is happening in our beef industry.  If foul play is not involved, then it needs to be ruled out now.  In order to ensure that the beef market is competitive and to safeguard the well-being of our livestock farmers, the Minister should come into the House to address this issue, with all Members given an opportunity to express their views.</p></speech>

Last night the British House of Commons passed an amendment to a Bill to ban smoking in cars when children are present.  This occurred within one month of it first seeing the light of day in the House of Lords as an Opposition amendment to a government Bill on child welfare.  The hurdles facing that Bill over one month were significant.  In the first instance, there was a real chance there would be use of the Whip by the UK Government parties against it, but this was not done in both Houses.  There was also widespread recognition that there was the potential influence of the tobacco lobby in Downing Street which had incredibly adopted a position of opposition to a slam-dunk public health measure.  Despite all of this, the Whips were lifted and the Bill was passed in both Houses and will become law within one month.  This should be contrasted with the position here where the well thought-out and well crafted Protection of Children's Health from Tobacco Smoke Bill, into which public health professionals had an input and which sparked widespread debate, has been bunged up for two years in the bureaucracies of the Department of Health and the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.  If it had been given any degree of priority, I do not find it credible that there was not the competence within these two great organs of State to ensure this relatively simple Bill would have been passed into law.  It was originally our intent to have it on the Statute Book two summers ago.</p><p>I remind Members that British public health authorities brought out figures yesterday, estimating that 140,000 children per day were subject to tobacco smoke in cars.  Using a rough calculation, that would mean that 7,000 children per day are exposed here.  I am despondent and cannot understand why a Bill as simple as this has taken so long.  It would give the Government its first anti-smoking legislation three years into its term, led by a campaigning anti-smoking Minister for Health whose forthcoming Bill on plain packaging for tobacco products I support enthusiastically.  I will be seeking a division on my proposed amendment to the Order of Business.</p></speech>

Any lady unfortunate enough to have had this barbaric act performed on them should register their interest with the judge.  She has agreed to travel around the country to meet any lady affected.  I encourage everyone to register with her in order that we can receive an independent report and have full closure on this matter.</p><p>  In today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> Elaine Edwards has an article on online content and children.  I am concerned to read that one in five children has been upset by something they have seen online in the past year.  Up to 20% of nine to 16 year olds reported they had viewed something that had made them uncomfortable or wished they had not seen.  That is double the percentage in a similar survey three years ago.  The report also found that more girls were bothered than boys.  This is Safer Internet Day.  To create a better Internet together, everyone in the Internet community needs to be aware and it is vital that parents keep themselves fully informed as best they can.  Will the Leader organise a debate on children and Internet usage, especially in the light of the concerning figures reported today?  I welcome the announcement which coincides with European Safer Internet Day by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, on the extension of the public consultation process on online bullying, with the task force accepting submissions from the public until 18 March.  I am glad that they submissions will identify policy solutions to the problem of cyberbullying.</p></speech>

Another scandal is emerging in Cambodia where four people have lost their lives, 40 people have been injured and 21 people are in prison as a result of their protesting against poor conditions and campaigning for a minimum wage of $160 per month.  I support all the labour organisations and the very many individuals throughout the world who are mounting an international campaign on this issue.  The Cambodian garment industry employs 500,000 people and represents 95% of Cambodian exports, worth approximately &euro;3.8 billion.  Seven reputable international brands have called on the Cambodian Government to investigate the recent violence and, most importantly, to release the 21 workers whose only crime has been to stand up for colleagues who are campaigning for a decent living wage.</p></speech>

In planning and delivering reform I have always said we are willing to listen to good ideas from all sources and very much look forward to hearing the views of Senators on the comprehensive reform plan.  I will be meeting the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform next week in a similar context.</p><p>Since the publication of the first public service reform plan in November 2011, I am pleased to say we have made good progress in reducing costs, improving productivity, the online delivery of services, the development of shared services and putting in place the structures to reform public procurement, property management and many other areas.  We have been implementing these reforms at a time of increased demands on public services.  For example, the numbers in receipt of jobseeker's payments, of full-time enrolments in education and medical card holders have all increased significantly since 2008.  Notwithstanding these increased demands, we have maintained service provision, while reducing staff numbers in the public service by more than 30,000 since 2008.  The cost to the Exchequer of public service pay has fallen from &euro;17.5 billion in 2009 to &euro;14.1 billion last year, an extraordinary reduction.  New working arrangements have been introduced, including longer working hours, new rosters and standardised arrangements for annual leave and sick leave.  We have also been removing barriers to the redeployment of staff to priority areas across the public service.</p> <p>This has been achieved in an environment of industrial relations stability.  The Croke Park agreement and, more recently, the Haddington Road agreement have been key enablers for many of these changes.  The role public servants themselves have played in our ongoing recovery should not go unrecognised.  I am very happy to underscore and recognise the work of public servants in that regard.</p><p>The Government is committed to building on the success we have achieved to date.  We cannot become complacent.  We remain in challenging fiscal times and reforming our public services is a critical component in meeting the challenges.  Doing more with limited resources remains as relevant now as ever.  One of the challenges we face is convincing the public that the public services it pays for are worth the investment, particularly given all the other pressing needs facing the State and citizens.  I strongly believe that effective public governance can contribute to Ireland's competitiveness and the attractiveness of its business environment for investment and the creation of employment.  Efficient public services affect taxation levels and the State's funding requirements.</p><p>Last month, I launched the Government's new public service reform plan, setting out our ambitious programme for the next phase of public service reform to 2016.  I forwarded a copy to each Senator.  I published at the same time a progress report on the Government's first reform plan, which was published in November 2011.  Since then, considerable progress has been made.  Let me give the House some specific examples.  PeoplePoint, the Civil Service-wide human resources and pensions shared services centre, has been operational since March of last year and is now servicing 15,000 employees across 13 different organisations.  PeoplePoint will be fully operational by next January, at which time it will provide services to 40 organisations, with estimated savings of &euro;12.5 million to follow annually.</p><p>Other shared services projects are progressing well in the Civil Service and across other sectors.  We have undertaken a major review of public procurement and are now implementing a radical overhaul of our public procurement approach, with a target of &euro;500 million in savings over the next three years, including a budgeted &euro;127 million in procurement savings this year.</p><p>An action plan, setting out a broad range of measures to deliver efficiencies in the State's extensive property portfolio, was published last summer and is currently being implemented.  We have issued over 500,000 public service cards to date.  They are currently being used for social welfare payments and the free travel scheme.  We are considering extending the card to cover a greater number of services.  We envisage that it will be possible to issue a further 900,000 cards during the course of this year.</p> <p>The Office of Government Chief Information Officer has been established within my Department to build on the Government's strong performance on e-government and maximise the potential benefits of digitalisation and open data to deliver services and information in more efficient and innovative ways.  The Government services portal, <i>gov.ie</i>, now includes quick links to more than 400 information and transaction services, including those relating to Revenue, social welfare, higher education grants, motor tax and property registration.  A number of customer-facing online services also have been launched.  These include<i>fixyourstreet.ie</i>which allows the public to report non-emergency issues to their local authorities and<i>intreo.ie</i>through which employers and jobseekers can access all existing information and services regarding support, training and entitlements.</p><p> A series of public expenditure reforms has been implemented to bring greater structure, scrutiny and openness to budgeting.  The Government is also making good progress in implementing a comprehensive programme of political and legislative reform aimed at enhancing openness, transparency and accountability.  The publication of important financial and performance data on my Department's Databank and Ireland Stat websites was another important step in this process.  These are just a small number of examples and further details of the achievements in delivering reform are set out in the progress report I circulated to Members last month to accompany the new reform plan.  The new public service reform plan outlines the key cross-cutting and sectoral reform initiatives that will be implemented in the next three years.  It also looks further forward to address the broader ambition for reform towards 2020.  The first phase of the Government's public service reform programme focused on ways to consolidate and reduce costs because that was a necessity when the Government took office.  It did so by taking out duplication and waste by focusing on shared services, better procurement, rationalisation, reducing staff numbers and improving expenditure controls.  The next phase of reform will continue to drive reduced costs and greater efficiency but will also have an increased focus on citizen engagement and improving outcomes for service users, the economy and society as a whole.  Implementation of the reform plan will be delivered through a focus on service users, increased efficiency and greater openness, underpinned by a strong emphasis on leadership, capability and delivery.</p><p> The Government is committed to driving greater use of alternative service delivery models.  This will include considering innovative approaches to funding services in return for delivering specified outcomes such as social impact investment which the Government is exploring.  The Government must measure the impact of public spending in deciding how and whether to fund these services.  Of course, moving to alternative methods of service provision does not alter the fact that the Government is accountable to the public for the overall performance of public services.  The State will retain an essential role in deciding how and to what extent services are funded and in regulating the behaviour of service providers.</p><p> In recent years the habits and behaviour of citizens and businesses have changed as the introduction of consumer technology such as smartphone, tablet and smart television technology has spread throughout businesses, homes, schools and other public service organisations.  In the same way that the private sector has started to exploit the new digital world, the public service also is adapting to this new environment.  The Government's digital strategy will drive improved performance and effectiveness of public services.  It will consider how new digital opportunities and trends in technology can be harnessed to deliver a new genre of services.  Where appropriate, a mandated &quot;digital by default&quot; approach will be adopted.  As part of a new public service information and communications technology, ICT, strategy, the &quot;Top 20&quot; transactional services across the public service are being identified and prioritised for digitalisation.  A new data sharing and governance Bill will address how public services operate in the new digital world and under what circumstances data can be legitimately and securely shared.  Sharing data will increase efficiency and ensure citizens are not asked for information time after time that is already held in other parts of the public service system.  I hope the public service card will be a great advantage in this regard, in that one will not be obliged to fill in one's name, address and PPS number each time one accesses any service.</p> <p> We need to radically change how we engage with citizens and customers.  Public service organisations will consult with their customer bases to identify areas where priority action is required to enhance service delivery.  They will also ensure that their information and transactions are more accessible.  The public service must simplify the language it uses when communicating with citizens.  Alongside this, there must be a renewed focus on improving both internal and customer-facing business processes.</p><p>As well as changing how we deliver public services, we will continue to focus on increasing efficiency and productivity.  This will include a greater use of shared services across all sectors of the public service.  For example, the creation of a new single payroll shared service centre for the Civil Service will consolidate and integrate payroll processes and practices from 18 current centres now delivering payroll services to three payroll centres, which will deliver an estimated &euro;5.6 million in annual savings.  We determined that there should be three centres because of the physical infrastructure that is already in place, but they will be integrated into one singe payroll provider.</p><p>There will be more efficient and effective public procurement, with targeted savings over &euro;500 million over the next three years.</p><p>The implementation of the Government's property management action plan will deliver efficiencies and a more integrated approach to the management of the State's extensive property portfolio.  Until very recently, we did not even have a snapshot or a proper inventory of all the premises occupied, rented or owned by the State sector.</p><p>As I have already mentioned, the Haddington Road agreement will act as a key enabler for the delivery of the next phase of the Government's reform programme. The agreement will deliver an additional &euro;1 billion reduction in the cost of the public service pay and pensions bill by 2016.  It should be noted that core pay reductions in the Haddington Road process were confined to the better paid within the public service, commensurate with its leadership role across the system.  This poses its own challenges in recruitment at senior levels, and is something we might have to talk about into the future. However, ensuring the pay impacts were fair and progressive across the broader public service was critical in securing consent to the changes we have made.  It is remarkable that every public sector union that balloted, and they all balloted, formally endorsed the Haddington Road agreement.</p><p>The agreement also provides for a total of 15 million additional working hours across all sectors of the public service.  These additional hours will help to deliver long-term and sustainable increases in productivity, while also helping to improve the provision of services to citizens, but it is imperative that managers at delivery level fully utilise the capacity of the Haddington Road agreement and those 15 million additional hours that are now available.</p><p>As reform efficiencies are realised, some of the savings made will be reinvested in services.  That is something I underscored in launching the reform plan.  I call this the reform dividend, and this reform dividend will serve to underpin and help sustain the reform agenda beyond the current crisis by identifying and tackling waste and inefficiency.  We will use this dividend to invest in areas that work best for the citizen.  In essence, I am saying that savings we make from shared services, better procurement and all of the efficiencies can be redeployed to some extent - for example, by reopening recruitment to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or providing this year more special needs assistants, resource teachers and so on.  We are moving from back-office efficiency to front-office proper provision.</p><p>We are also progressing our legislative programme to improve public governance and rebuild public trust in the administrative and political branches of the State. This will include the introduction and implementation of lobbying regulation, which is coming down the track shortly; the enactment and implementation of a reformed Freedom of Information Act - I hope to be back in the other House shortly on Report Stage of that legislation; participation in the Open Government Partnership - I am very pleased that we will be hosting the European segment of the Open Government Partnership here in May; enactment and implementation of legislation to protect whistleblowers - as Senators will know, very useful debate and amendment took place in this House on that legislation; the continuation of the comprehensive programme of statute law revision, which is well under way; and further strengthening of the ethical framework for officeholders and public servants underpinned by legislation - a consolidation Bill is being worked on by my Department on that score.  We have already radically reformed our local government structures through the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p> <p> The Government has also established the Constitutional Convention.  Previous debates about our Constitution have been confined to the Oireachtas or its committees.  This innovative format will see this Government present to the people the most radical reform of our Constitution since it was first endorsed by the people.  The people will in their wisdom, approve or reject proposals for change.  That is their prerogative but they will have been asked and their stamp will be borne out on the State's institutions.</p><p>We must ensure that we have the capacity and capability to deliver reform.  A high performing and accountable leadership cadre at the most senior levels of our public service is crucial in supporting economic recovery and driving effective delivery of services to the citizen.  Leaders and managers across the public service must have a clear sense of what needs to be achieved and they must have a strong focus on performance, delivery and results.  Traditional policies and practices must continue to be tested to ensure that they firmly underpin business and organisational requirements.  In doing this, performance management systems must support managers in getting the best from staff.  The delivery of Ireland's ambitious reform plans will require a strong emphasis on implementation and governance.  This is led by the Cabinet committee on public service reform, which will provide strategic direction and hold senior managers to account for the delivery of this plan.</p><p>The renewal of the vision and strategy for the Civil Service is another core part of our public service reform programme.  Every day, civil servants perform many complex roles to support the Government and serve the public.  These include advising on key policies, implementing major projects and programmes, delivering frontline services, representing Ireland's interests abroad and supporting regulation and oversight across a number of sectors.  We sometimes take this support for granted but the creation of an impartial and non-partisan Civil Service remains one of the great achievements of this State.  No institution of State is perfect and the Civil Service is no exception but I believe it played a key role in securing the continuity of this State as the previous Government imploded during its final months in office.  Despite this, however, we have never before as a State placed due emphasis on giving civil servants a role in developing their own organisation.  We have never asked them for a view on where the Civil Service should go and what it should become.  As we look to the future, we must ensure the Civil Service is a strong and capable organisation that is equipped to address current and future challenges and bolstered by a work force that has the skills, capacity and tools to meet those challenges effectively.</p><p>The Civil Service renewal programme is identifying a clear vision for the Civil Service in the future and setting out practical and specific actions to make the vision a reality.  We are looking at a range of areas where capacity and capability needs to be developed to meet the new challenges that we now face.  These include leadership, change management, policy formation and implementation.  This programme is being driven by a task force of civil servants and supported by all heads of Departments and offices.  The focus over the coming months will be to discuss the future of the Civil Service with those inside and outside the system.  In order to harness their knowledge and experience, every civil servant is being given the opportunity to give his or her views on what the Civil Service does well and what needs to change, and to participate fully in the renewal process.  As well as participating in this process online, a series of town hall meetings are taking place across the country to brief civil servants on the issues being addressed and to seek their input and ideas.  By gathering ideas from every office and every grade, I am confident that we can build a vision which is strategic but also motivating, and more important, builds on the long and proud tradition of an independent and impartial Civil Service committed to meeting Ireland's needs now and into the future.  The initial feedback from this process has been hugely encouraging.</p> <p> Hand in hand with opportunity goes accountability.  Last month - separately from the reform plan, because it is very important in its own right - I published a consultation paper on strengthening Civil Service accountability and performance.  This extensive publication and associated public consultation will assess how greater clarity, certainty and common understanding on the key issue of who is accountable to whom and for what in the Civil Service can be arrived at.  It is important that we know what specific responsibility falls on a Minister and what specific accountability and responsibility falls on a particular civil servant in order to avoid the systemic failures we have seen so often in the past.  We must have a much more accountable system of governance.</p><p>An independent panel on accountability, chaired by Professor Kevin Rafter of Dublin City University, has been established to manage and oversee the public consultation process, review submissions received and develop recommendations by the end of May.  In addition, the panel will engage with key stakeholders within the political system and the Civil Service.  We need to harness the potential of the Civil Service to learn from its successes and failures at both an individual and an organisational level.</p><p>I acknowledge the commitment and dedication of the Civil Service and the wider public service in delivering real and sustainable reform, reducing costs and improving services.  As we embark on the next phase in the reform programme, the public service of the future must be more innovative, better integrated, more strategic and more customer- or citizen-focused.  Achieving these goals will not be easy, and many challenges lie ahead.  I remain convinced, however, that my fellow public servants will once again show their commitment to the reform process as we build a new public service that is better for citizens, businesses, public servants themselves and Irish society as a whole.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-02-11a.127" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1116" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="16:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014021100022#V00200"><p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire go dt&iacute; an Teach.  Our public servants are dedicated, committed and conscientious.  At various points in the history of the State, as the Minister pointed out, they have kept the country going.  One calls to mind, for example, the change of government in 2011.  The change from Cumann na nGaedheal to Fianna F&aacute;il, which took place at a much more delicate time in the history of the State, saw the public service, particularly the Garda, playing a tremendous role in keeping the country on an even keel.  They have always done that.</p><p>The Fianna F&aacute;il Party recognises the huge sacrifices that have been asked of public servants in recent years, as outlined by the Minister.  Those sacrifices were, unfortunately, necessary, although many of them were opposed by the Minister when he was in opposition.  Most of the measures were implemented with a focus on higher earners and with proportionate reductions across the public sector.  That has been acknowledged subsequently in various economic reports.  There is no doubt that the Civil Service has paid a high price.  That process began under the Croke Park agreement and by way of the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation - it might more accurately be called the pay cuts legislation - that has been introduced since 2009.</p><p>Notwithstanding these sacrifices, there have been outrageous attempts by certain commentators and media elements to denigrate the role of public servants.  In fact, it has been a constant theme of discourse in this country that civil servants are somehow lazy and ineffective.  In my experience, that is not the case.  Many civil servants are among the hardest working people in the country, providing vital services upon which citizens depend.  In many cases, those services are not available in the private sector.  I had a case recently in which a person required a medical card not for financial reasons but simply because the service that was needed could only be obtained from the public sector by those with a medical card.  In many such life-and-death situations, it is the public sector that steps in to provide the vital services.</p><p>We in Fianna F&aacute;il do not accept that the nation must be divided into competing groups of public sector and private sector workers.  On the contrary, we recognise that there is a mutual dependence between both groups of employees.  The reality is that we in this country often do not treat our public servants very well.  What I saw in a school I visited this morning is undoubtedly happening in other schools throughout the country.</p> <p>It did not start today or yesterday.  To see a head teacher or principal sitting in his office wearing his jacket is outrageous.  We must do a lot more.  It hit home when I saw the sacrifice that man was prepared to make, along with many others around the country, to ensure children are looked after and educated and that they can contribute socially and economically to the future development of the country.  We do not treat our public servants that well.  There is a necessary emphasis on change, reform and doing things better and more efficiently, but we must look after the people working there and make sure they are in a happy environment and that their work is appreciated.  Often, there is too much emphasis on change and not enough on the actual work done by many of our public servants.  There are lazy public servants and lazy private sector workers.  That is not to denigrate one whole sector of society.</p><p>The sacrifices public servants have made over the past number of years have played a key role in reducing the deficit, which was always seen as the key to getting the economy back on track.  Reducing public debt and reducing bank debt means investors are likely to have more confidence in the country and, eventually, banks will start lending again.  The sacrifices of the public sector have been the key and it is worthwhile to keep reminding ourselves rather than looking for more change and cuts.  It brings an element of unfairness to do so.</p><p>Any public sector reform should ensure State services are user-focused rather than producer-focused.  Having said all that about how we must value our public servants, the bottom line is that they provide services demanded by the public.  That is the key.  We must examine items such as the results of changes in respect of waiting lists, accident and emergency unit queues, special needs facilities in schools, the time taken to process social welfare applications, the ongoing delivery of services by local authorities, and medical cards.  In one case recently, a medical card was eventually given to a dying child on discretionary grounds.  In another case I heard about today, the medical card of a child who may be facing amputation was rescinded.  The changes and reforms in the delivery of public sector services are not working for everyone.</p><p>We support scrutiny of senior members of the public sector to hold them to account in respect of the advice they give and their performance.  The Government is also keen to pursue that agenda and Fianna F&aacute;il will support it.  Policy choices are increasingly complex and it is difficult for the Government to make decisions.  I faulted Ministers in the previous Government for becoming too reliant on the advice of public servants.  Some Ministers in this Government have fallen into that trap, but there is a difficulty because the decisions are often complex.  They depend upon a lot of research being done and Ministers depend on civil servants to do that.  Going against the grain means risking the unknown.  Ministers may only have a special adviser or their instincts on which to base the decision and, while they are entitled to do so, they are taking a risk.  If the Minister goes against the Civil Service in making decisions, he is likely to receive media scrutiny on why he did so.  The advice civil servants give is increasingly crucial because of the nature of complex decisions.  The advice of civil servants must be subject to greater accountability, and we support changes in that regard.  I do not think civil servants will have a problem with that.</p><p>Where I have a problem with accountability for civil servants is something that has become a feature of this Oireachtas.  At the drop of a hat, when the latest headline appears in the newspaper, we are dragging public servants into committee rooms for the television.  That is wrong and it should stop.  Josephine Feehily and the Revenue Commissioners were dragged in here to explain issues set out in legislation.  It was outrageous.  A much better system is for civil servants, such as Ms Feehily and the Revenue Commissioners, to appear on a regular basis, once or twice a year, to explain what is going on.  She should not just be dragged in for political purposes.  She is not the only one.</p> <p>In the interests of fair procedure for the citizen, the taxpayer and the public service, there should be a regular discussion at committees.  This is already a feature of many committees, but the issues should be planned in advance and a timetable drawn up for all senior civil servants.  They should not drag people in to appear before committees in pursuit of cheap headlines.  Many of our colleagues, especially those in the D&aacute;il, have been guilty of doing this in recent weeks.  We support accountability but not at the price of fair procedure.</p></speech>

Public services are essential to the functioning of our economy and society.  A strong and effective public service is recognised as a source of competitive advantage for any country.  The Irish public service has already made a major contribution to the national recovery and as the country enters a new phase after the conclusion of the troika programme the public service must continue to play a central role in our recovery.</p><p>Public service reform will remain a key element of the strategic response to our ongoing challenges into the future.  Two years ago the Government's public service reform plan was published.  A renewed wave of reform has been developed, building on the progress made, implementing the first reform plan and setting out an ambitious new phase in the reform programme.  This new plan outlines the key cross-cutting and sectoral reform initiatives that will be implemented over the next three years.  It also addresses the ambition for reform towards 2020.  The plan is complemented by a progress report that sets out the strong progress achieved in the implementation of the current reform plan in reducing costs, improving productivity, increasing online delivery of services and greater use of shared services, to name some areas.</p><p>There are four key themes running through the new reform plan: delivery of improved outcomes, reform dividend, digitisation, openness and accountability.  This new public service reform plan also addresses a wide range of other issues, including the implementation of shared services models, the evaluation of new business models for the delivery of non-core services, the reform of public procurement, property rationalisation, strengthening leadership and human resource management reforms.  We need to address the culture of the public service to ensure it adapts to meet the challenges and opportunities that will arise in the coming years.  In short, it needs to be fit for purpose.</p><p>We need to continue to ensure that our public service is exactly that, a service to the public.  Many reforms are planned across the public service over the coming years that will improve how services are designed and delivered.  This reform programme must be dynamic and responsive.  This is why the first reform plan is being refreshed.  We need to ensure that the culture of the public service adapts to meet the challenges and opportunities that will arise.  This will support a public service that is better integrated, more responsive, more efficient and more focused on strategic goals and on our service users.  There was a commitment in the first public service reform plan of November 2011 to create a public service of which we can all be proud, delivering flexible and responsive services to our customers.  The public service has embarked on this journey.  It is not complete yet, but the actions set out in this plan will build on the considerable progress made to date and take us much further along the road.</p><p>I welcome the Minister to the House and encourage him to continue to step up to the mark when it comes to reforming the way our public service does its business.  I have a few questions for the Minister, in the first instance about the town hall meetings that are to act as a sponge for the people delivering public services.  Some time ago I met in this town a director of services from a local authority who said that if he was allowed, or was able, to get rid of the people under his remit whom he needed to get rid of he could get rid of 20 of them and increase productivity by 20%.  I imagine that is what the Minister will hear at town hall meetings.  I hope that is what he will hear, but I do not know whether that can be achieved.</p> <p>The theme running through this reform process is "doing more with less"; that is what every house in the country is doing, it is not only the public sector which is doing it.</p><p>With regard to procurement, there are projected savings of &euro;500 million, about which I am slightly worried.  In the process the small supplier, producer and provider is being blown from the water not only by multinationals but also by businesses from abroad.  Small companies are not really at the races when it comes to these procurement deals.  Will the Minister provide for clarity in that regard?  </p><p>My final point is on quangos.  I know there has been much integration of bodies, but could we have a breakdown of the quangos that have been amalgamated or abolished?  What is the plan for quangos in the next year or two?</p></speech>

I read the second progress report on the public service reform plan and was fascinated by how much was in it.  One of the issues that immediately comes to my mind, given my experience of the private sector, is the length of time it takes to get something done in the public sector.  There was an example today as Senator John Crown outlined his difficulty in getting through the legislation to ban smoking in cars where children are present.  That process has been ongoing for two years and it has still not come to an end.  Similar legislation was introduced in the British House of Commons a month ago and will become law this week.</p><p>My first experience of moving from the private sector to the public sector was in 1979 when I became chairman of An Post.  I doubt the Minister was around at that stage.  I remember breaking some rules without knowing it and discovered the embarrassment that could be caused for the Minister if something went wrong.  A couple of years later I remember deciding that we should have stamps to mark St. Patrick's Day.  I suggested to people in An Post that there be a special stamp.  They said it was a great idea and that they would get to work on it right away.  That was in January and there were to be samples by late March.  I said St. Patrick's Day was 17 March and they said, &quot;Surely you did not mean this year.&quot;  That is a reminder of how long it takes to get things done.  We produced the stamps, although we probably broke some rules in so doing.</p><p>The Minister has heard my suggestion before of a public website on which the taxpayer would be able to see where every cent of the money goes.  I raise the issue all the time and it needs to be raised.  The Government has set up the Ireland Stat website and the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, has argued that this has to be the type of information we seek.  It does not, as it covers export statistics or agricultural products.  I would like to see something along the lines of the US model, a single website on which we would be able to see exactly what money was required to run public institutions.</p></speech>

We need to know what funds are going to charities.</p><p>It is coming up to six years since the collapse in 2008, but little has been done to tackle quangos.  The Minister has argued that information is available, although he might be saying it will become available.  If ir was available now, we would not have Deputies in the D&aacute;il going through the charade of asking parliamentary questions, with the answers received via e-mail.  When, if ever, will the Government create a transparent source of information for taxpayers?  I thank the Minister, as he has said it is on the way.  It took an interviewer's question to reveal the full amount of money Irish Water was paid to get up and running - over &euro;80 million.</p> <p>Perhaps on another day the chief executive, John Tierney, would not have revealed that to the interviewer.  Is that a way to do business?  We should not set up a new quango with new people.  I was interested to hear Senator Sheahan talk about quangos.  We could simply pass legislation that requires every Department and public institution to upload documents and figures on their spending and get the public to judge.  Such online programmes are cheap and they are easy to use.  They are simple to change into easy to read graphs for the public.  The media does that job to an extent but we must move towards the public being an effective watchdog by virtue of being given access to all that information.  We could come up with such simple legislation in the Seanad which would be an amazing contribution to society.  I would love to hear the Minister&rsquo;s views on this later.</p><p>I would like to see more public debate on freedom at all levels of society.  People are too passive when it comes to the Government making laws.  Politicians make laws which very often put more restrictions on people&rsquo;s lives but the Government never seems to withdraw them.  I hate to see a move towards the nanny state but the Garda is used by the Government to check tax on cars rather than concentrate on areas of concern such as burglaries or violence.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has strayed from its original mandate of doing preventative policing because now we are getting garda&iacute; to be tax collectors, as such.  That is one example where the public needs to have more information.  I will not get into a debate on the reports on the office of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission but it is a matter that will get a lot of attention.</p><p>It is amazing to consider that the State still has 170 budget lines, and 11 independent agencies, responsible for the disbursement of the State's science programme.  That is an incredible figure for a country of just 4.5 million people.  One could ask whether we need such an amount of budget lines and agencies for that purpose.  Perhaps one or two agencies would be enough.  That is not good enough.  We need much more action in the area.  The Government may have effectively created a two-tier system whereby older civil servants keep their privileges and new entrants have nowhere near the same benefits.  Coming from the business world I am aware that it is always very difficult if one has two people doing the same job and one is being paid a lot more or a lot less than the other.  One example is that new doctors will be paid approximately 30% less than those already in the positions.</p></speech>

I am concerned that we would have real reform.

She is studying in China at the moment.  She has been there for some time but she goes back and forth.  Her ambition is to become an ambassador or work in the French diplomatic service.  One of our difficulties is that we send ambassadors to the Far East when they are in their 40s or 50s and they do not speak the language very well.  I would love to think there are ways that we could train people up from an earlier age.</p><p>I wish to refer to some interesting ideas on public sector reform worldwide to see whether the Minister would be open to them.  In France, the Government rightly identified that public service reform must be focused on what matters to people.  They found that in general most people perceive Government services to be effective, based on just a small number of personal and professional interactions or what I call life events.  How easy was it, for instance, to obtain a marriage licence or to register the birth of a child or for a business to open a new branch or office?  As unfortunate as it is, claiming social welfare has become a life event, and the Government made it a key goal to increase public confidence by simplifying such interactions.</p> <p>I am delighted that the Minister has grabbed hold of this issue and is getting somewhere, but I get frustrated, as I am sure the Minister does, at the length of time it takes to get things done.  I encourage him to retain his commitment and enthusiasm and continue in the direction in which he is going in order to achieve what he has set out to achieve.  I am delighted that we are having this debate.</p></speech>

Like him, I value public service enormously.  There is nothing more important in a country than people working in the common good and setting aside the fact that they may achieve a certain level of earnings and no more.  It is not like the private sector; it is a very particular job and important that the Minister has devoted so much time and commitment to reforming the public service.  It is interesting that in the public arena we see reform only in terms of euros.  We hear the figure of &euro;3 billion and think &quot;that's great.&quot;  People tend to turn away, forget or not examine the great detail behind all of the processes that must be gone through in order to bring about significant change.  It is not always about saving money, although that is welcome, obviously.</p><p>  I welcome the Minister's commitment to plainer communication because the language of the document makes it quite hard to read.  It is hard to see what is happening because, ironically, of the amount of information contained therein.  In a way, reaching out to the public at large and talking about change are difficult because people are never very sure what it means.  If we talk about processes and detail, they very quickly turn away, which is part of the dilemma we face.  People shout at the Government and say nothing has happened when actually quite a lot has happened, but how do we bridge the gap between what people believed they wanted to change and what is actually happening within the Minister's Department and beyond?  Plainer language - the sooner the better - would be a good start and a help in getting that message across.  There is no point in doing it if people do not understand it.  Perhaps we might develop an application for <i>gov.ie</i>.  The website is very welcome and lays out clearly all of the things one can find.  Obviously, we are still waiting for some Departments which have less information available than others, but it all takes time which, as Senator Feargal Quinn argued, is the frustrating part.  </p><p>  I have a number of queries on the plan.  The Minister made reference to the saving to invest idea, which would allow for the hiring of new garda&iacute;, new special needs assistants and so forth.  Is there an indication of how savings will be arrived at or does it depend on a variety of budgetary factors across all Departments?  Can the Minister say whether it will be 10% or 20%, for example?  There is great cynicism around the tendency for Governments to promise a certain pot of money for, say, roads and then the money is pulled away at the last minute.  People become cynical about so-called savings and the tightening of belts; they want to see the additional five or 50 garda&iacute;.  If there is a way of quantifying this, it would be good to know.</p><p>  The Minister spoke about the public services card and the issuing of 500,000 cards.  In the report reference is made to the potential to store biometric identification data on the card, which, I take it, means a step towards it becoming an identity card.  I am assuming that, ultimately, we will all have one.  It will start with those who are in receipt of welfare payments but will proceed beyond this.  Am I correct in that assumption?  On the issue of individual health identifiers, is that a separate system and, if so, does it need to be separate?  Could it not be part of the public services card?  What protections are in place for the card in the context of more and more information being stored on it?</p> <p>We see all the arguments on how information in the electronic age can be extracted and how protections are harder to come by.  One of the great issues in the debate about having an identity card is that of protection.  If we are proceeding in that direction, we would need to be satisfied that, at all levels, protection is as much a priority as the delivery of the card and all that goes with it.  The Minister referred to sharing data and I raise the same question about securing it.</p><p>In his speech, the Minister, as well as the report itself, referred to the innovative utilisation of the additional public sector hours.  What does the Minister see as innovative use?  Is he waiting for senior managers to come up with their own innovative uses?  There was a reason for these additional hours.  It was not simply a matter of the public sector saying &quot;give us more hours&quot;.  Tasks must have been identified that required extra hours.</p><p>The Minister rightly described the Haddington Road agreement as the largest productivity deal in the history of the State.  How much of future activity will be sub-contracted?  Will this be part of the way alternative models of service are delivered, an expression which comes from the report?  The speed vans are one example of sub-contracting.  We have seen the number of private firms providing such services mushroom in the UK and other countries.  Does the report outline how these alternative models will emerge?</p><p>Legislation for the regulation of lobbying, an issue dear to the Minister&rsquo;s heart, is not in the timeline but it is mentioned in the report.</p></speech>

I cannot see it in the timeline but I know the Minister is committed to it.  In what guise will it come?</p><p>The Minister spoke about the preparation for universal health insurance.  Again, the White Paper is promised for early 2014.  Are we on target for that?  There has been much criticism, wrongly placed, at the decision concerning free medical care for the under sixes and that this was a sign we will never see universal health insurance.</p><p>Property asset management is now a profession and will rightly be reformed with that view in mind.  These are the details people do not want to listen to because it is about property, yet they are very quick to criticise State offices lying idle and how much it costs.  People then are critical of moneys spent on managing these properties properly.  Now an inventory has been done of State properties, are there other uses for properties not being used?  Can charities, for example, use these properties rather than paying double rents?</p><p>Procurement has also become a profession.  The Minister referred to hiring professionals and sharing skills that already exist.  What is the cost of the Office of Government Procurement?  I note not all Departments, such as Health and Education and Skills, are involved in the office.  Is that because they cannot be or that they do not want to be?</p><p>The reform of immigration services is often raised in this House with many Members arguing such reform is more than urgent.  Will the Minister give us some indication of where this will fit into the public service plan and the timeframe?</p></speech>

Actions speak louder than words.  He will have been in government three years, or 36 months, next month.  It is not a very long time in the overall context when one takes into account reading into a brief, holidays, etc.  What has been achieved must be celebrated and acknowledged.  It is of international significance.  We began in a programme with our reputation in tatters and costs running at enormous levels.  Less than three years later we have our independent sovereignty, with no insurance policy, and have negotiated Haddington Road, which is significant in the international scale for what it has achieved.  I would appreciate it if we could have silence.  It is significant and has been recognised as that.  It is living up to the commitments in the programme for Government and the commitments to society, because this country was and is broke.</p><p>We have a job of work that must be developed.  Achieving efficiencies is part of that programme.  Many advances have gone under the radar.  Procurement has already been mentioned in this debate.  This Minister, along with the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, has developed websites and the procurement process to a very advanced degree.  There is probably potential for further efficiencies in procurement.  I was on the local authority for a number of years before I came in here and we saw countless examples of absolute waste in terms of not using the purchasing power.  We had a situation where local authorities were operating as individual entities instead of pooling resources.  We have regularly heard of back-office efficiencies that can be achieved.  It is grand to talk about them but it is another thing to actually implement it and achieve efficiencies.  That means bringing many stakeholders on board.  That process is well under way.</p><p>We have all heard about medical cards and had people into our offices talking about them.  That process was centralised.  There were teething problems but it is working.  The medical card scenario was fragmented with community welfare officers all over the country.  Similarly, we have saved millions of euro as a result of centralising third-level grant applications.  Of course there were problems.  We have all had people in our offices who have experienced problems.  However, one cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs.  I have visited the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, offices.  It is far better and the response time is significantly improved.  The centralised system has been proven to work.  If one was doing a desk-top study of what would and would not work, one would come up with the SUSI formula to save money and take advantage of that buzz-word &quot;back-office&quot;.</p><p>It is a programme of work.  It is work in progress.  I am looking forward to another two years of achieving efficiencies as part of the programme of putting this country back on the right track to ensure the 400,000 unemployed people will decrease to 300,000 and lower.  We must ensure that the people out there working their backs off in the private and public sectors to put this country together who have made the sacrifices will, as a result of the direction being taken by the Government and the two Ministers in the Department of Finance, see better and brighter days ahead.  This country had a lot of waste and we will never be able to afford waste again.  I commend the Minister on his ongoing programme of work.</p></speech>

The Minister stated the pay bill fell from &euro;17.5 billion in 2009 to &euro;14.1 billion, and we have managed to do the job with 30,000 fewer people on the payroll.  This reform deserves credit.  We had to do it, and we still have a debt to GDP ratio of 120%.  When we lobbied our way into this situation we used to state as a percentage of GDP Ireland spends too little on whatever our favourite project was, but in cash terms we were not that far behind the countries we subsequently asked to bail us out.  The GDP figure has a certain strange element in Ireland which is not present in other countries and we must watch out for this.</p><p>In retrospect social partnership may have led to a very large growth in the Taoiseach's Department to supervise the other Departments.  Commitments were made to reduce it to a small Cabinet office, which it was in its heyday.  Very powerful Taoisigh had one tenth of the staff which were there subsequently.  It is not necessary to have this level of duplication.</p><p>I wish the Minister well with regard to procurement.  He mentioned &euro;500 million.  Already I hear stories of it creaking and that someone going to a conference will stay in a certain hotel because procurement decreed it although everyone knows there is a cheaper hotel around the corner.  Many services in Ireland are competitive.  In the UK it was stated some of the procurement deals for the NHS could have been done by the matron going to Marks &amp;amp; Spencer and picking up the laundry.  Opponents would state it is the re-introduction of a Russian-style retail operation with one great place in Athlone-----</p></speech>

He has made progress in his reports on getting outputs instead of the traditional budgeting, whereby spending more gives Ministers a speech to make when they are cutting the ribbon, when they will state they spent more than the previous Government.  Did it accomplish anything?  Is it why we have a debt to GDP ratio of 120%?  Turning inputs into outputs is important, as the Minister stated, and he also mentioned improving outcomes.  I support the Minister wholeheartedly.  We must measure the impact of public spending which will give us the reform dividend.</p><p>On the capital side we must move to publishing independently-conducted appraisals in advance and not have alleged appraisals prepared by the lobbyists, beneficiaries and promoters.  Robbing Peter to pay Paul usually has the support of Paul, and Paul's lobby group, consultants and beneficiaries, but it is not the point.  We must consider these issues from the point of view of society overall.  This type of scrutiny is more and more important.</p><p>I would like to see what went on at Irish Water as the last of the old brigade and not part of the new reform.  Why did we not know everything upfront?  We could have had a much more informed discussion on whether replacing 34 local authorities would lead to the benefits we all seek.</p><p>I am concerned that of late we do not see as much regulatory impact analysis accompanying legislation, stating what legislation is supposed to do and how to measure it.  The memorandum on the Irish Water legislation did not include the financial statement.</p> <p>There should be more cost-benefit analyses and output measurements.</p><p>The tax aspect should be included.  I worry that we have guillotined the Finance Bill in each of the last two years.  There are huge giveaways of money, hard-earned by collecting taxes, and we do not know whether the benefits to society of those loopholes and so forth are worth the costs.  That should be brought under scrutiny.  One can say the Seanad does not have financial powers and can only make recommendations, but even then our thoughts on tax loopholes have been curtailed.  The recent concern in unlikely places, such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, and in the United States in President Obama's State of the Union address, is that part of the reason for the growth in inequality, which bodes ill for so much in society, is that people with enough tax lawyers and accountants can avail of those tax loopholes while the rest of us do not have that facility.  Living in a society where inequality is increasing is not something to which many of us aspire.  That must be examined.</p><p>I share the Minister's concerns about lobbying.  Mr. Vito Tanzi, who had a high post in the International Monetary Fund, IMF, is concerned that not just Ireland but almost every country has developed a capacity to live beyond its means by borrowing.  His list of things to beware of represent part of a public sector reform proposal.  They include always listening to the beneficiaries rather than society as a whole, an entitlement culture and the power of lobbyists.  The fact is that when we move into free trade, projects are proposed that claim to have a great multiplier effect.  The fiscal council has said this is not the case - as this is a small, open economy, the money leaks out of the colander once it is poured in - but we still have lobby groups saying, &quot;You have lost millions, Minister, but we will make you rich.&quot;  The ease with which certain people got bailouts during the crisis must be reformed.  There is also the use of &quot;do nothing&quot; options and avoiding asset bubbles.  I am concerned that in the print media, in particular, there is a confusion of asset price increases with real economic growth and the type of real productivity this Minister is seeking in the public and private sectors.  There are also the issues of regulatory capture or the capture of regulators, the fiscal termites who undermine the tax system by chomping away at it and the sheer complexity of government.  We must simplify it.</p><p>I have always liked the Minister's visits to the Chamber to discuss this reform package.  It is necessary to continue with the reform because there is still a debt-to-GDP ratio of 120%.  I still think about matters such as the complaints about the high number of children per class.  It is far more than when one divides the number of teachers on our payroll by the number of students who are registered.  Have we diverted valuable teaching staff into doing administrative tasks and so forth?  The same applies to health.  We doubled the number of staff in the health service between the 1980s recession and the peak, from 55,000 to 110,000.  With that massive increase in staff, why do we have unacceptable waiting times now?  There must be an emphasis on the outputs rather than the inputs.</p><p>Separating the Minister's Department from the Department of Finance was a good idea, because they have different tasks.  The reform agenda continues, and I look forward to the Minister's proposals on lobbying and whistleblowing.</p></speech>

I come from the perspective of a young person.  The emigration figures point to tens of thousands of young people who had to leave for economic reasons and for those same reasons they will probably be unable to return.  Public services have been undermined through cut-backs and the loss of numbers within the public sector means that those who are still there are under severe pressure.</p><p>The sale of State assets is not a measure of reform.  The Minister and I have tic-tacked on the matter previously, and my colleague in the other House has tic-tacked on it also.  If we had examined the assets more closely we could have utilised them better for the benefit of citizens.  Apprenticeship and management mentoring programmes could have been provided.  Commercial semi-State CEOs could work directly with the Departments of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Education and Skills, and Social Protection as part of a jobs scheme.  Filling State boards with political cronies does not amount to reform but I will not get into a debate on the issue.  Reference was made to the Freedom of Information Bill, the Bill on whistleblowers and the regulation of lobbying Bill.  There has not been any sense of urgency to bring some of those Bills to a conclusion and we have not yet seen the regulation of lobbying Bill.</p><p>The savaging of services to the young, the elderly and disabled has not been any kind of reform.  I disagree that improving shared services, cloud computing and the limited introduction of the public services card is reform and it is a matter of concern that the Minister continues to refer to them as such.  Such measures, and the introduction of Intreo offices, are due to modernisation rather than reform.  Many of the achievements in the second progress report on the public service reform plan relate to modernisation as opposed to reform.  Many of the reform measures relate to accounting which has meant fewer workers and those who still work have longer hours for less pay.  I measure success in terms of reform of public services in another way.  Access to basic services has decreased and waiting times have increased in many areas.  Children must wait years before their needs are even assessed for counselling services, speech and language therapy and other fundamental supports.  That has repercussions for access to other services.  The lack of service provision will impact on educational attainment, yet there is no interaction between the Ministers for Education and Skills and Health.  A co-ordinated response is required.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, could ensure they would engage in dialogue.  That is an under-the-radar example of the crisis in the public service.  We must improve social policy development and cross-departmental engagement across the public sector.</p><p>We must bring an end to the practice of political appointments which currently rides roughshod over standard mechanisms for appointments to State boards.  Ministers still select those with whom they have a political relationship.  It is irrelevant whether a former constituency manager has all the applicable skills for appointment to a board if he has not applied for the job.  From the outset, such cases undermine the position of those appointed and that of the Government.  Cronyism in all its guises must be rooted out in order for people to have confidence in public services and the public bodies they represent.</p><p>The Government must review its relationship with State agencies who deliver critical supports and services.  I refer to the hands-off approach to oversight of the service providers.  Reform should also harness the vast wealth of in-house expertise in the public sector.  Infrastructure could come under the responsibility of a single agency by bringing together engineers and project managers who are currently dispersed across various agencies.  Such an approach is worth consideration.</p><p>A nod to open government is insufficient.  We need to see a real commitment on how data with a public interest is disseminated and how civil and public servants are trained and resourced to deal with requests.</p></speech>

We need to have regular contributions on the issue as much of it is not &ldquo;sexy&rdquo; to use that hackneyed word because it is a process change, but it is fundamental.  I take both elements of my job seriously.  As Minister for public expenditure I have to reduce the full expenditure profile of the State to an affordable level.  Senator Reilly said we do not have enough services.  That is almost to pretend that we do not have the economic crisis we are working our way through.  Every month of last year we borrowed &euro;1 billion on top of the tax income to keep the services going.  We promised those who are giving us the &euro;1 billion that we would work towards a balanced budget and we are doing that.</p><p>Many positive things have been said and I wish to deal with the contributions in the order in which they were made.  Senator Byrne fairly and rightly talked about the Civil Service tradition of service in the State going back to its foundation.  He said it was loyal to whoever happened to be elected by the people.  That is something we should not take for granted.  I put it on record in the other House and I might have put it on record in this House previously that during the final social interaction with the troika, which took place in a relaxed frame when it was about to leave, the head of the troika said to me that of all the civil servants he had dealt with &ndash; he had dealt with many &ndash;  the Irish civil servants were the most professional.  He said they were much better than the Germans and several others.  It is to our credit that the Civil Service is matter of fact and it provides an extraordinary service.  Of course all civil servants are not perfect.  In every aspect of life there are star performers and those who are not.</p><p>My Department is a small one in numerical terms.  Last year we were involved in the Presidency of the European Union.  We negotiated more trilateral meetings on the cohesion strategy than was ever done in any programme.  We were involved in the sale of State assets.  We negotiated the Haddington Road agreement.  We were intrinsically involved in both the promissory note renegotiation and the exit strategy.  Any one of those would be an extraordinary body of work.  It is to the great credit of the staff in the Department that nobody who was working on those various teams had a beginning hour, an ending hour or saw a weekend as a non-working weekend.  Everybody was there for as long as was required.  I add my words of appreciation to Senator Byrne&rsquo;s in that regard.  He is correct also in what he said about the complex nature of current decision making by the Government.  The easiest form of decision making is to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to whatever is proposed by the Civil Service.  To be contrarian is difficult because then one has to justify oneself because the decision is that of the Minister.  We must have more debate about that.  I do not know whether it is appropriate to invite in the chairman of the Top Level Appointments Committee, TLAC.  We now have an outside chair and a majority of members of TLAC are outside members not civil servants.  In the first annual report which it presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas, it indicated that one of its concerns about getting quality applications for top level appointments in the public service was a &quot;gotcha&quot; culture.  The notion is not whether one is performing well on balance but whether one did something for which one could be caught.  It is more than actual remuneration that acts as an impediment for quality people to apply for jobs.</p><p>Senator Sheahan referred to the town hall meetings and some of the proposals that were put forward.</p> <p>Of the 30,000 plus staff comprising the downsizing in the public service, the local government sphere was downsized by 25%.  I am not sure that too many directors of service would be able to find 20 people in order to say that they were surplus to needs.  We have done remarkable downsizing in the local government sector.  When one sees how they have stepped up to a task - as they have done in the areas affected by floods where hours of work do not matter and people just get on with doing a job for their communities - it has been a remarkable achievement to secure that level of downsizing and maintain a quality service.  The town hall meetings that are taking place around the country will bring all public servants together and I hope very good ideas flow from the initiative.  </p><p>Procurement was mentioned by a number of Senators so I shall deal with it on a number of fronts.  First, I shall deal with a particular question that was asked.  It comes up a lot and is now almost a default response - if we have efficient procurement we will squeeze out the SMEs.  The situation is quite the reverse and there is no reason that SMEs cannot fully participate.  The most recent data that I have shows that 63% of public service contracts were awarded to the SME sector in this country - that is 63% of the National Procurement Service contracts - and 25% of the contracts went to larger Irish companies.  Let us add both so that means 85% of all centralised contracts go to Irish entities and 12% of contracts go to non-Irish companies which compares favourably with a variety of countries.  </p><p>From the beginning we have been committed to collaboration with the employer and small businesses.  We have discussed this matter with the representatives of the SME and have held a number of meetings.  We have also had a meet the buyer engagement process where we bring small business in to meet Government procurers in order that they can be skilled, upskilled and work collaboratively to make large scale procurement offers where they do not, within their own encompassment, have a capacity to bid.  I am determined to drive up the involvement of SMEs but we need to get value for money.  The days of having five or six different organisations procuring the same product from the same company at different rates cannot be continued.  In the past couple of weeks I attended a public meeting in the country but I shall not say where and the following issues arose.  I was told: Sure, we always did a local deal.  Our school bought whatever we had and we got a few bob from the local Christmas fund.&quot;  That is not the way public goods should be procured, it must be done in a professional manner involving professional procurement techniques.</p><p>Quangos and rationalisation issues were mentioned.   Let me be clear about the matter.  The information is laid out on my Department's website.  I produced the first service reform plan in November 2011.  It contained two commitments and the first one was to implement phase 1 - the rationalisation of 48 entities which involved 100 bodies.  All 48 will be delivered by the end of this year, except in two cases where we made the decision not to proceed and the first one was the national cancer registry.  I took the decision not to reintegrate it into the Department of Health because I got very clear information that it was the wrong thing to do and that it should be an independent stand-alone cancer registry.  In the second case - on advice from the transport sector and the European Union - we did not go ahead with the merger of the Commission for Aviation Regulation and the Irish Aviation Authority.  Other than that all of the other promised actions will have been absolutely completed and a lot of them involved serious legislation, negotiation and redeployment.  All will be completed by the end of this year.</p><p>The second promise that we made was to critically review 46 other measures.  The review was carried out and published, I think, the year before last.  We said that we would go ahead with the rationalisation of 25 agencies under the programme.  Again, that involved a further 100 State bodies and all of the 25 actions will be implemented by the end of this year.  The rationalisation programme, the killing of quangos or whatever phrase one wants to use will be completed this year.</p><p>Senator Quinn made a very thoughtful contribution.  I am sorry that he is not here but he explained to me that he had to leave.  Let me put it bluntly.  We need to make ourselves aware of the issues.  The Senator claimed that we did nothing about sick pay or leave arrangements.  We debated changing the law on sick pay in the Chamber last year and we are now implementing the halving of sick leave arrangements across the entire public service after a year and a half of hard slog through the Labour Relations Commission and bilateral negotiations.  When we do things please acknowledge them.  We have also rationalised holiday arrangements.  Let us remember the debates that we had when we discovered some of the more outlandish arrangements.  We have consolidated leave arrangements across the public service as we build an integrated public service. </p><p>The Senator talked about providing a website displaying all of the data, and Senator Barrett also touched on the matter.  I have given a commitment - and it is my big ambition regarding our delivery of our commitment to the new open Government programme - is to have open data.  It is my ambition to have FOI requests, PQs and all of that made redundant by having all data accessible and I want to work towards that aim.  Except, obviously, where there are security implications and so on but that would be the default position.</p><p>The Senator asked how many people would be dismissed.  Bluntly, that is an odd criterion to use to gauge success.  First, we are creating a new system of accountability that says what one is responsible for so that one knows what one is responsible for.  It is very hard to evaluate somebody's performance if one does not tell them what they are to do, hold them to account and have a proper evaluation system.  In cases where a person needs upskilling and retraining then it should be provided and that is before one reaches the stage of asking how many people one intends to fire.  We need to have such a system.  </p><p>Senator O'Keeffe talked about communicating change.  It is important that we have a system of communicating what we are doing and that is why we are having a very dynamic communication within the public service conducted through the town hall meetings and communications at Department and agency levels.  We are open to seeing how we can engage in the broader public debate.  Certainly, that is needed on the accountability document.  I hope that the expert group that I put in place under Kevin Rafter will provide new means to capture public involvement in that aim.  She suggested that we provide an App.  We have an e-government website, etc. and have sought ways to deliver it in as varied a manner as possible.  We will also have a new e-government strategy this year.</p><p>The Senator asked a number of specific questions such as how much was the reform dividend.  There is not a specific answer to that because I must ensure that we live within the confines of expenditure.  However, it gives me the wherewithal to divert some of it to front-line services which is important.  </p><p>The Senator mentioned a number of things about the public service card.  Obviously the card will require security to ensure that personal data is protected.  We will debate the matter because I must bring in new legislation on data protection.  There are some ridiculous barriers which prevent people from acting freely in order to get information or gain access to services.  Using a card needs to be broken down so that one does not have to submit the same set of information every time one goes online to the 400 plus public bodies that now operate a direct services provision.  </p><p>The Senator also asked about the use of the 15 hours.  The extra hours will do as follows - reduce paid overtime; reduce agency costs so that we are not buying in external work; allow management to maintain services against the backdrop of decreasing numbers; facilitate reductions in staff numbers where that is possible; allow management to undertake further reform initiatives; improve services where we see a need; extend opening hours for public offices, call centres and so on; address peak demands by redeployment into those areas; and increase the output of Departments in terms of additional projects that we can undertake.  That has already been negotiated and will, hopefully, be delivered but I am saying that we are dependent on engagement at middle management level to ensure that happens. </p> <p>I am not accountable for every service.  I am not going to tell the House what is happening in the health service or what is the position on universal health insurance and so on.  I will let members ask the Minister for Health about these issues, although we want to drive all of them in an efficient manner.  </p><p>The Senator mentioned the consolidation of ethics legislation which is within my remit.  We have said we will look at the current suite of legislation governing ethics in the public sphere to have it updated and modernised so as to incorporate best practice in one integrated Act.  We are working on this within my Department.  We have had the FOI legislation in the other House; the register of lobbyists Bill is coming; the ombudsman Bill has been completed; the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Bill 2013 has been passed and the open data programme is on the way.  A lot is happening on that front.  </p><p>The Senator also mentioned property management.  That is an area in which we need to make advances and that has been taken by the scruff of the neck by the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Brian Hayes, who has done remarkable work in examining the property portfolio.  Unfortunately, we have discovered that long-term leases have been taken out on many offices that are no longer decentralised.  That was not the wisest course, but we are working towards getting ourselves out of the process.</p><p>I thank Senator Martin Conway for his acknowledgment of how far we have come in a mere three years.  We have made remarkable progress.  I do not think there is another country that has made as many significant reforms in public administration in an atmosphere of industrial calm, which is to the credit of workers in the sector.</p><p>The Senator also talked about procurement.  I think I have answered most of the questions in that regard.  Having looked carefully at how the private sector conducts procurement, it is much more keen.  We have to ensure we get value for money for the euros that are hard-earned and paid into the tax purse.  Senator Sean D. Barrett also raised the issue of procurement and mentioned a Russian-style retail operation.  It is professional procurement in line not only with international best practice but also best practice in the private sector.  I would happily arrange for anybody who is interested to meet Mr. Paul Quinn, chief procurement officer, at the Office of Government Procurement and his professional team who do a splendid job.  </p><p>On the measuring of outputs, the mantra is almost that, rather than the old-fashioned way of measuring inputs, the more inputs we have the better.  It does not matter what the outputs are; by definition, the more inputs and money we spend the better, as opposed to what we are getting for it.  We need to get away from this.  </p><p>Of course we need to have robust capital assessment.  As the Senator is aware, we are integrating the National Development Finance Agency with the Railway Procurement Agency and the National Roads Authority to have a critical mass not only of engineering but also financial competence to evaluate infrastructural investment.  The legislation is being prepared and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport will introduce the first phase during this session.  </p><p>The Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform has an ongoing oversight role not only when the Finance Bill is going through but also to check that we are getting what was promised.  That should not be an event, rather it should be a process.  </p><p>Senator Kathryn Reilly mentioned promising change.  Any objective person will read the two reports and see that change has not only been promised but has also happened.  This has been acknowledged internationally by the OECD and the Open Government Partnership.  That is the reason we are introducing the next wave of open government in Dublin Castle in May and I am sure the party of which the Senator is a member will be represented.  Hundreds of thousands of people are no longer leaving the country.  There are now more people at work in this country than there were three years ago.  We created 65,000 net new jobs last year and have reduced the rate of unemployment from a peak of 15.1% to 12.3%, although it is still too high.  When we went into government, the absolution prediction of everybody was that the rate of unemployment would exceed 500,000.  We have turned this around and will work might and main this year to reduce the number significantly.  We have set the target of achieving full employment by 2020.  That is our objective.  </p><p>The Senator mentioned the sale of State assets and said the proceeds should be spent in a different way.  While we have not yet received any money from the sale of State assets, I have pre-spent some of it.  It will be recalled that I spent &euro;200 million in the budget, of which some &euro;50 million was for county roads - not too many people thought county roads did not need another &euro;50 million; &euro;50 million was spent on new schools - that was not an extravagant or wasteful use of it; &euro;50 million was spent on the retrofit of local authority houses to provide local authority tenants with decent insulation and jobs across the country.  </p><p>The Senator said we had savaged youth schemes.  Last month we launched the new Child and Family Agency.  We have anchored responsibility for children and youth affairs in a Cabinet Minister for the first time.  We have done all these things at a time of economic crisis and, not to be overtly party political about it, at the outset of our period in government the leader of the party of which the Senator is a member said our strategy should be to tell the troika to go home and take its money with it.  The problem is not that we would be cutting services but we would have no services because the country would have collapsed.  Nobody would have invested a shilling here and after a few months we would not have had the wherewithal to pay any public servant.  It is very hard to take criticism when that was the strategy which demonstrably and objectively would have been ruinous for the State.  We have worked our way through it and made remarkable progress, but we still have some way to go and, please God, we will get there.   </p><p>The Senator referred to public service appointments.  This morning the Cabinet made an appointment, about which the Senator will be pleased, that of the new Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga.  It was done by way of an open appointment process.  I understand there were 21 applicants and a fair and open process was used to determine who was the best candidate.  I did the same in appointing the Ombudsman.  Previously the position of Ombudsman was not open to public advertising.  A robust and talented pool of people applied for the job and I think the best of them was appointed to the position.  That is the change we have brought in making these appointments. </p><p>I thank Senators for their inputs.  I am conscious that there is a huge number of issues to cover.  I will be happy to come back periodically to report progress and, equally important, I am happy to receive inputs from Members on things that could be done that we are not doing.  I thank the Seanad for giving us the time to have this debate.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-02-11a.177" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1126" speakername="Jim Walsh" time="18:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014021100035#JJ00400"><p>The Cathaoirleach said that I could raise a number of points on this section and I will do so with the indulgence of the Leas-Chathaoirleach, although I may be stretching it.  This section deals with the principal Act.  There is an issue that needs more specific attention in the principal Act.  I do not know if the Minister is of a mind to examine it on Report Stage.  It concerns slow drivers, who can be quite hazardous.  We have all had the experience of driving in a 100 km/h zone and not being able to do more than 60 km/h because someone in front is going at that speed.  It happened to me today.  At night time it can be dangerous when there is a build-up of traffic and someone is trying to make time by driving at the normal speed limit.  The person starts to overtake, which is one of the most risky driving manoeuvres.  Getting the timing wrong or doing it near a bend can lead to a serious accident.</p><p>I raised the point in the House a number of years ago and a predecessor of the Minister said there was provision within the legislation for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with the matter as the driver would be showing insufficient regard for other motorists.  This is true and is in legislation but there are very few prosecutions.  There was one well-publicised prosecution a few years ago, when someone was driving a tractor and did not pull in.  There was a build-up of traffic and a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na presented the driver with a summons.  There was a lot of controversy about it but there should be some provision.  I am not sure how we can do it but through the Road Safety Authority or the Department something can be done.  The best I can come up with is that when driving 15 km/h below the speed limit for the area, if there is a build-up of more than three or four vehicles, people should be obliged to pull in at the first opportunity and let traffic pass.  I do not know if the Minister is amenable to the argument but it is a serious traffic safety issue.</p><p>An unrelated point is that many speed limits across the country have been pitched too low.  A review in the past two years changed some of the limits.  A prime example is the N11, which I use to travel up and down to Dublin.  Construction work is taking place at the moment, which reduces the speed limit on parts of the road to 80 km/h and there is no argument with that.  However, large sections remain at 100 km/h.  The road is of a standard that the limit should be 120 km/h for the vast majority of it, with the exception of a bend at the Glen of the Downs which does not meet the normal standard of motorways.</p><p>There should be a mechanism whereby motorists can bring such matters to the attention of the authorities so that the investment in roads yields the anticipated productivity for the economy.  This may be a subjective matter but the N11 is a prime example.  I remember when the Arklow bypass was opened and I raised the matter with the National Roads Authority.  The chief executive of the National Roads Authority said that it could not be done.  Subsequently, the speed limit was upgraded to 120 km/h.  Where we are investing in roads, we should ensure construction is to best international standards and that people can drive at the appropriate speed.  Motorists tend to drive at speed in those areas, which is not good.  It also feeds into a disregard for speed limits generally.  There is a need to have speed limits set at an appropriate and sensible level, which is sometimes not the case.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-02-11a.178" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1128" speakername="Paschal Mooney" time="18:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014021100035#JJ00500"><p>I support my colleague, particularly in respect of his first contribution about slow drivers syndrome.  In his response, perhaps the Minister can indicate whether any analysis has been carried out.  What level of Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na prosecutions takes place?  Are they significant or infinitesimal?</p> <p>One hears a great deal about the emphasis on speeding and the danger it causes to other drivers and pedestrians, but we rarely hear about drivers who are slow, for reasons best known to themselves, perhaps because they are not confident, have just passed their test or are driving a vehicle that does not have the capacity to go faster.  All of us, if the truth were told, have been behind long lines of traffic.  I am not talking about agricultural traffic, which has rights because at certain times of the year when farmers need to be out on the roads and cannot do anything about that, but about the mainstream driver, particularly on single-carriageway rural roads, of which there are many, not the dual carriageways or motorways where one does see a certain amount of slow driving.</p><p>Has the Minister reflected on this at all or does he think there is a case to be answered?  Senator Walsh is right to say the law provides for the garda&iacute; to prosecute or follow up on complaints of slow driving under a certain interpretation of the Act.  Does the Minister have a view on this?  If he has not formed one, he might perhaps consider doing so.</p></speech>

I will, however, do the Member the courtesy of responding.</p><p>The speed limit review was raised the last time we spoke on Committee Stage of this Bill and on Second Stage, and I explained in detail how the speed limit review works, what was in it and how it will operate, so I refer the Senator to the comments I have already made on this subject on Committee Stage.  I do not wish to repeat myself. </p><p>On slow drivers, there are offences of careless or dangerous driving and insufficient regard for other motorists.  I do not have figures on prosecutions for these offences but if they are available to us I will make them available to the Senators.  I do not see an alternative solution.  It would not be practical to introduce a minimum speed on any roads.  There may be all sorts of reasons why somebody may need to drive slowly, regardless of the speed limit - for example, if there is an animal or ice on the road.  I cannot imagine how a minimum speed limit or something to that effect would work.</p></speech>

The slow driver is as much a hazard as a really fast driver, although some people may dispute that.  This phenomenon has caused accidents.  I take on board what the Minister says about its being difficult to fine someone for this, but it is not impossible.  It is not impracticable to have a minimum driving speed.  It happens in other countries on particular types of road.  It is not impossible and there is an international precedent for it.</p><p>I came up with the best suggestion I could think of but if the Minister agrees that it is dangerous for someone to drive well below the speed limit, with a build-up of 20 cars or vehicles behind them, particularly at night, would he give some thought to how that might be addressed?  The current catch-all provision of not showing sufficient regard for other drivers is not sufficient.  We need something specific.  There will be people who, for whatever reason, may not be able, or confident enough, to drive that fast.  I am only asking for a system whereby somebody in that position would take the first opportunity to allow the build-up of traffic to pass.  Some professional drivers, such as lorry drivers who drive below the speed limit because they have heavy loads, tend to pull in to allow traffic to pass.  One sees that happening from time to time.</p><p>Will the Minister consider this point?  It is a hazard.  There is a failure to address it sometimes because it might fly in the face of tackling speeding.  We should, however, recognise that it is hazardous and that the practicality of dealing with it should be passed on either to officials in the Department or to the Road Safety Authority, RSA, to come up with a sensible suggestion to address the problem.  That is the only point I am canvassing. </p></speech>

I instanced an example on the N4, on which there is a speed limit of 100 km/h for the entire length from Dublin to Sligo, with the exception of a number of towns and villages.  It is not until one comes to Longford that one must slow to under 100 km/h through the villages of Ballinalack, Rathowen and Edgeworthstown.  Longford is bypassed, as are other villages in County Leitrim, and it is not until one reaches Sligo that speed must be reduced again.  There are one or two stops on the road, one outside Carrick-on-Shannon on the N4 at Annaduff.  It comprises a pub on one side of the road which is faced by a church where religious ceremonies, with the exception of funerals, are confined to weekends.  Nevertheless, a driver is immediately requested to drop from 100 km/h to 60 km/h and, within the space of approximately 200 yards, 50 km/h.  After a couple of hundred yards the speed limit increases to 60 km/h.  I go into such detail to ask if the Garda considers it important and relevant to ensure safety on the road to have an unmarked car operate in the area.  I am not talking about GATSO vans.  There are other instances in my county to which I could refer, but I will not do so.  I am sure the same is true for other Members.  Is there a case for the Garda authorities to indicate on-line where they are locating unmarked cars?  One can access the locations of GATSO vans on-line and there are signs across the road network which indicate where a car is entering a speed camera area.  There is no such sign in the example I have outlined.  Will the Minister consider requesting the Garda authorities to publish where they generally located unmarked Garda vehicles?  If the purpose of the exercise is to encourage all of us to slow down, rather than engage in a revenue gathering exercise or making a person's record of prosecutions look good, surely there is a case to be answered to make the information available on-line.  I am referring specifically to unmarked Garda speed detection cars rather than GATSO vans in the context of povided the required evidence.</p></speech>

He raised this matter the last time we took Committee Stage of the Bill.  I cannot account to the House for Garda operations, as the Garda is controlled by the Garda Commissioner who is accountable to the Minister for Justice and Equality.  It is not really for me to answer that question and I do not know enough about the reason there are unmarked cars.  Anybody engaged in policing is not necessarily involved in one type; therefore, every garda, whether he or she is in the traffic corps, can enforce the road traffic laws.  There may be very good reasons for having an unmarked car in a particular place, other than for speed enforcement.  If garda&iacute; see somebody speeding, they will enforce the relevant laws.</p></speech>

It is promoted that people can access on-line the locations of GATSO vans, which encourages them to slow down.  I am asking the Garda authorities to indicate where these cars are located.  This is not being done on a one-off basis, as the cars are located there regularly.  It might not be as often as GATSO van, but they are staying in one location.  That is the only reason I raise the issue.  I do not want to delay the Minister, but as we can access the likely locations of GATSO vans, surely the same logic should extend to unmarked Garda speed detection cars.  I appreciate that they could be located there for other reasons.</p></speech>

Taking the idea to its logical conclusion, a driver would only slow down where he or she knew there would definitely be a speed check, if it could be noted on-line before undertaking a journey.  There might be checks at five locations, but the driver could go mad for the rest of the journey.  I do not know how this could be policed, especially if the location of every Garda had to be identified.  There could be a free-for-all on the rest of the road.</p></speech>

As he mentioned, road conditions may have been responsible for 3% to 6% of fatalities, rather than the driver of a vehicle.  I am indebted to him for providing such information.</p><p>  This amendment is tabled in response to a very recent case, in which it was judged that a roadblock was not legally valid as the person who had authorised it was not of superintendent rank or above.  The amendment substitutes the term &quot;rank of Sergeant&quot; for &quot;Superintendent&quot;.  We have reproduced section 81(7)(<i>a</i>) from the Road Traffic Act 2010 and the amendment would increase the amount of assistance the Minister would have in achieving the commendable goal, which we all share, of improving road safety.  The provision, as it stands, means that 2% of garda&iacute; can decide on these checks.  There is a Garda Commissioner, as well as a deputy commissioner, nine assistant commissioners, 45 chief superintendents and 159 superintendents.  That gives a total of 215 garda&iacute;.  The strength of the Garda force is 15,330, meaning that this figure amounts to 2.1%, although it would be a little more if we were to take out the number of civilians.  If sergeants and inspectors were to be given this power, approximately 80% of the Garda force would still be unable to mount these checks.  The base on which action can take place is really small.</p> <p>That was the problem in the case to which we referred.  Superintendents and inspectors are people with authority in the Garda, as indeed are sergeants.  If they feel these checks are necessary for speeding, drink-driving and other problems - we have a problem with road safety which appears to be increasing again unfortunately - why not use the Garda to a greater extent to assist the Minister and everyone in ensuring safer roads?  The definition of &ldquo;manager&rdquo; in the 2010 Act seems narrow.  I always thought of some of those excluded as being pretty powerful in the organisation.  I would like to give them that discretion in the interests of safety through this amendment.  It would be better for these ranks to have the discretion to put a system of checks in place for speeding or driving under the influence rather than having to go up the line to find a superintendent.  The amendment aims to better utilise our Garda force in assisting in achieving an important national goal.</p></speech>

The media reports suggested that MAT authorisation identified a number of checkpoint locations and, because of this, was considered contrary to the provisions of the legislation.  This was not down to the rank of the garda&iacute; involved.</p><p>The Road Traffic Act 2006, as amended and restated by the Road Traffic Act 2010, provides that a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, not below the rank of inspector, may authorise checkpoints in a public place or places at which the members may exercise the powers provided under the Act on blood alcohol concentration levels.  The authorisation shall be in writing and shall specify the date and public place at which the checkpoint is to be established, as well as the hours of any time between which it may be operated.</p><p>Following the raising of this matter three weeks ago in the Seanad on Second Stage, I asked the Garda and the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, for further clarification.  It appears the newspaper article was incorrect in its identification of the reason the DPP did not proceed with the case cited.  The problem was not that the authorisation covered different townlands but rather that the time spread for the authorisation was too wide, covering a period of almost 24 hours.  In the DPP&rsquo;s view, this was an impermissible delegation by the inspector.</p><p>Another issue raised in the Seanad concerned the appropriate rank in the Garda for authorising the MAT checkpoints, the issue which it would appear this amendment is meant to address.  Legislation sets this at not below inspector level, while the amendment proposes lowering this to sergeant grade.  Again, I have discussed this matter with the Garda.  It has informed me the current situation has operated without difficulty and the Garda sees no need for any change to the legislation.</p><p>When the 2002 Bill was drafted, the establishment of MAT checkpoints was regarded as a significant development in the efforts to deter drink-driving.  Given the critical contribution that the evidence gathered at checkpoints would have in any consequent court hearings, it was considered the decision as to the location of checkpoints should be taken at a relatively senior level in the Garda.  This approach demonstrated to all concerned, particularly the courts, the importance associated with the MAT checkpoints and addressed any potential charges of bias or personal subjectivity regarding their location.</p><p>If there were a need to change the law in this regard, this amendment would not be acceptable.  It proposes a change to section 87 of the Road Traffic Act 2010, which in fact deals with approval of equipment to be used and requires approval from an officer of the rank of superintendent.  Were an amendment of the kind intended necessary, it would be to section 10 of that Act which deals with the setting up of checkpoints.</p></speech>

We may have been reading different newspapers but there was one case where the rank of the garda who authorised the checkpoint was an issue.  I am sure the Minister has access to more authoritative information on that.</p><p>While I will not press the amendment, I am struck by how the Garda management structure is extremely narrow.  As there are only 158 superintendents, 45 chief superintendents and nine assistant commissioners, 80% of the force cannot take a decision on these checkpoints.  Is it wise to have people excluded from decision-making?  What do we expect the Garda to do, given its incredible public prestige and the invaluable role it plays in promoting road safety?  We might consider this amendment in the context of other legislation the Minister has said he will introduce later in the year or on Report Stage.  If very few people at the top are making decisions, what does this do to an organisation tackling the major problem of the loss of so many lives on the roads?</p></speech>

I was awaiting a reply to a question at the health committee.  This issue is about the provision of a national office for rare diseases.  Much work is being done in this area and I was asked to raise this issue in view of the fact that there would be a national conference in Belfast at the end of the month and that it would be helpful if we could have some idea when it was proposed to put this office in place.  It is accepted that there is a need for it and that it is the long-term plan.  We await the long-term plan and I want to know when it will be announced.  My Adjournment matter sets out clearly what I seek and I wonder if I could have clarification.</p></speech>

Rare diseases are life threatening or chronic debilitating conditions affecting no more than five in 10,000 people.  Between 5,000 and 8,000 rare diseases have been described, affecting approximately 6% to 8% of the population in the course of their lives.  Approximately 80% of rare diseases have a genetic origin and the life expectancy of patients with rare diseases is significantly reduced.  Many of these conditions are complex, severe and debilitating.</p><p>Ireland has been supportive of EU proposals on rare diseases and my Department is finalising its national plan for rare diseases accordingly.  Two national conferences and a public consultation day were organised to discuss what might feed into the development of a national strategy for rare diseases.  In April 2011 the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly established a national steering group to develop a policy framework for the prevention, detection and treatment of rare diseases based on the principles of high quality care, equity and a patient-centred approach.  The policy will operate over a five year period, take account of the Council recommendation on rare diseases in 2009 and define priority actions, subject to resource availability.</p><p>The national steering group is working on many areas relevant to the issue of rare diseases, including the identification of appropriate centres of expertise, access to appropriate medication and technology, research as an integral part of overall care for rare diseases, including access to clinical trials, where appropriate, and the empowerment of patient organisations.  The steering group is also considering for its report the development of a national office for rare diseases, as referred to by the Senator.  Its purpose would be to facilitate the co-ordination and timely access to centres of expertise for rare diseases, both nationally and internationally.  Such an office could act as a national point of reference on services, diagnostics, care pathways and information on rare diseases.</p><p>The report by the Department on recommendations for dealing with rare diseases, including the establishment of a national office, is being finalised and the Department's officials are meeting the HSE to discuss implementation of the report.  The HSE has established a national clinical programme for rare diseases, NCPRD; a national clinical lead has been appointed and a programme manager is in place.  The programme aims to improve and standardise patient care for individuals affected by rare diseases in Ireland by increasing detection and prevention, facilitating early and timely diagnosis, intervention and co-ordination of care and increasing awareness, information and support.  The programme is progressing with the establishment of a rare diseases national working group which will consist of experts in various fields to identify best practices.  The programme will also be supported by the advice and guidance of a clinical advisory group appointed by the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.  A key priority of the NCPRD is to assist with the provision of information and helpline access for patients and families through the establishment of a centralised rare disease information office.  Regrettably, I do not have a specific date for publication of the report.  I assure the Senator that I am aware of this work and regard it as important, as he does.  I am aware of the conference to be held in Belfast at the end of the month and the report will be published as soon as possible.</p></speech>

I understand there are many demands on his Department; however, having worked with a number of the organisations, we should do everything possible to progress this matter.  If the national plan was published, it would help.  Is it possible for the Minister of State to give any guideline as to when the report is likely to be issued?  The reason I was delayed in coming was there was a discussion at the health committee about a clinic in Cork where funding was provided and &euro;500,000 worth of equipment is lying idle because of the embargo on taking on staff.  I hope we do not have a scenario where we cannot go ahead because of the restrictions which are not looked at in an overall context.  We might try to receive some clarification at an early date on the matter.</p></speech>

I will take his raising of it again very much as a spur to engage in further action and specifically to try to establish for him as soon as I can what the timelines are likely to be.  There are pressures and resource issues in the Department.  The Senator's point on the importance of having this office established is very well made.</p> <p>I will take it very much on board.</p></speech>

I am led to believe a further 38 trolleys were spread among a number of wards, which meant the real figure was 82.  I am also informed it took up to three days for some of these sick and elderly patients to get beds.  Now is the time to examine viable solutions for these figures, which are quite regrettable.</p><p>As the accident and emergency department crisis continues throughout Ireland the practice of nurse prescribing is a resource which is not utilised to its fullest extent.  Last year approximately 7,000 patients spent time waiting on trolleys in accident and emergency facilities, as reported by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation.  Nurse prescribing is considered a forward-thinking development in the health care sector and would help reduce the overcrowding we face in hospitals throughout the country, in particular in Galway.</p><p>The nurse prescriber qualification permits nurses to examine, diagnose and prescribe for residents in nursing homes and residential health care facilities when the patient's general practitioner signs an agreement to this arrangement.  Health care professionals find many elderly patients are sent from private nursing homes and residential health care facilities to accident and emergency facilities to receive IV fluids, antibiotics and other such drugs which may need administering because nurses employed at such operations are unable to prescribe them.  This further exacerbates the overcrowding crisis at accident and emergency departments throughout the country.</p><p>Nurse prescribers are able to provide services to private sector patients but a problem arises with medical card patients.  The HSE will not issue a GMS prescription pad to nurses employed at non-HSE facilities, therefore effectively barring this practice.  Utilising nurse prescribing would not only be of great benefit to the residents of such facilities who would have timely access to medical treatment and would not have to wait for a house call from already under pressure general practitioners, but there would also be benefits for taxpayers who would not have to pay for accident and emergency department visits where patients can be treated at a private facility.  The HSE policy does not encourage competition in the health care industry as a result of what I have stated.  To provide an equal level of care to patients residing in private nursing homes and care facilities it is important this practice be abolished and nurse prescribing be embraced.  I look forward to hearing the thoughts of the Minister of State on this matter.  I apologise for gasping; I had to run upstairs to get here on time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-02-11a.247" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1024" speakername="Alex White" time="18:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014021100040#OO00400"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  Between 2012 and 2013, a 14% reduction was achieved nationally in the number of emergency department patients waiting for ward bed accommodation.  When compared to the baseline year of 2011, there was a 33.8% reduction in 2013.  This is equivalent to 29,200 fewer patients waiting on trolleys, a reflection of the willingness and ability of the system to manage each temporary crisis that occurs.  A total of 4,015 fewer patients have had to face trolley waits since we began to actively address this problem in 2011, quite an achievement in the face of the ongoing crisis referred to by the Senator.</p><p>The trolley counts for the first few weeks of 2014 in some hospitals are disappointing for the Department, the INMO, the HSE and the special delivery unit, but much more so for the patients and their families for whom these delays add discomfort and further distress.  However, as Minister Reilly has stated regularly in recent weeks, these pressures are anticipated in the early part of the year and time and again the system has proved it can come through these peaks, stabilise and continue to improve.</p><p>One of the elements which assists in all areas of acute hospital practice, including emergency and acute medicine, is the introduction of medicinal product prescribing by trained and registered nurses and midwives, as the Senator correctly outlined.  Nurse and midwife medicinal product prescribing has been in place in Ireland since 2007, underpinned by legislation and the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, NMBI, regulatory framework, whereby nurses and midwives must be registered as nurse prescribers.  There are currently 650 registered nurse prescribers.  Professional guidance is in place with regard to the scope of nursing and practice, and specifically on nurse and midwife medicinal product prescribing.  There is, therefore, no barrier to advanced nurse practitioners who are registered as nurse or midwife prescribers with the NMBI prescribing to patients in the accident and emergency department at University Hospital Galway or in any other acute hospital.</p><p>No single trend or factor is wholly accountable for the peak pressure encountered at this time of year and no single action will address these pressures.  However, University Hospital Galway has made steady improvement using a combination of actions, such as prioritising diagnostics of inpatients over outpatients to enhance patient flow; the transfer of patients to other hospitals within the west and north west hospital group; increased ward rounding; the use of a surgical day ward; the use of a medical assessment unit in tandem with the emergency department; and a focus on the use of nursing home and long-stay beds with colleagues in primary care.</p><p>These actions aid progress, with numbers awaiting admission reducing from 29 on Monday, 27 January to 22 on Monday, 3 February and 17 yesterday, Monday, 10 February.  While these numbers are still unacceptably high, I am confident that with sustained effort, supported by senior management, Galway can achieve the type of reductions it has shown it is capable of, namely, a 34.1 % reduction, or 266 fewer patients on trolleys, between 2011 and the end of 2013.</p></speech>

One would presume anyone in receipt of a social welfare payment of &euro;100 a week would receive a medical card but this is not the case.  These people fall between two stools.</p><p>The national assessment guidelines on medical card eligibility state a person aged between 16 and 25 may have entitlement to a medical card or a GP visit card if they meet a number of criteria, including being a dependent of a person with a medical card or a GP visit card; being financially independent, which in this case means they earn or are in receipt of a social welfare payment in excess of &euro;164; or if they face extenuating circumstances such as financial hardship.  It is very difficult to prove such hardship given the new manner in which medical cards are assessed.</p><p>There is a loophole here as one should not have to prove financial hardship or undue hardship just because one earns less than &euro;164.  A 27 year old person who receives a social welfare payment of &euro;188, whether living at home or not, will receive a medical card, but just because one is 24 not only is one's social welfare payment reduced to &euro;100 per week but because one is in receipt of less than &euro;164 per week one will not receive a medical card either.  It is very unfair.  For those aged between 18 and 26 the national assessment guidelines for medical card eligibility should be changed because it is not fair or right they must comply with a raft of eligibility criteria.</p> <p>I know a number of individuals in my county aged between 18 and 26 years who are not living with their parents, are in receipt of &euro;100 per week and struggling to survive but who are not entitled to a medical card.  That seems daft in the extreme and throws into question the entire medical card eligibility criteria if such individuals are not deemed eligible because they are in receipt of too little from the Department of Social Protection.  That is the only reason they are being refused a medical card.  It does not make any sense to me and I know it is an issue that many community welfare officers are dealing with in various parts of the country.  A change must be made quickly because people are finding themselves in very difficult circumstances.</p></speech>

People aged 16 to 25 years, including students, who are financially independent of their parents may be entitled to a medical card if they pass the means test.  If they are financially dependent on their parents, they are normally only entitled to a medical card if their parents have one.  They may be entitled to a medical card or a GP visit card if obtaining GP, medical or surgical services would be the cause of "undue hardship" or  "unduly burdensome" on themselves, if financially independent, or the person on whom they are dependent.  Financial independence, as it relates to persons aged between 16 and 25 years, is the standard rate of income set out in the HSE's medical card or GP visit card national assessment guidelines for a single person living with family, that is, &euro;164.  Financial independence may be achieved through student loans, education grants, employment, self-employment, part-time employment, savings or social welfare payments.  Rent supplement payments are not included in establishing financial independence.  Historically, when there was a single rate of social welfare allowance in the Department of Social Protection, the HSE used this rate to establish financial independence.  However, under budget 2014, with the age-related rates of jobseeker's allowance set by the Department of Social Protection, the HSE's test to establish financial independence is no longer linked with social welfare allowance rates.  </p><p>To reiterate, financial independence is defined as &quot;in receipt of income equivalent to or greater than the current income guideline for a single person living with family&quot;, that is, &euro;164 per week.  The current national assessment guidelines state an applicant whose weekly income is derived solely from social welfare allowances, benefits or Health Service Executive allowances will be granted a medical card if this social welfare income is in excess of the medical card income qualifying limit that applies to the application.  Social welfare payments being made at a rate less than the maximum weekly rate may be indicative of other income or means.  This provision cannot be relied on by persons aged 16 to 25 years receiving only social welfare income less than &euro;164 per week as entitling them to a medical card.  There are no proposals to change the income thresholds for standard means-tested medical card eligibility.</p></speech>

This is discrimination against 18 to 25 year olds and deeply unfair.  I ask the Minister of State to examine the issue again.  I do not expect him to provide a solution tonight, but I had expected a response which suggested 18 to 25 year olds were playing a meaningful role in society and that their eligibility for a medical card should not be scuppered just because another Department had cut their weekly social welfare income.  This is essentially one Department working against another.  Someone needs to sit down and work this out.  Can a meeting be scheduled between the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Health to come to some arrangement to assist the people concerned?  The fact that they are earning too little should not make them ineligible for a medical card.  It makes absolutely no sense.  If such individuals get sick, how will they be able to afford to go to a doctor?  They are being left high and dry.  I am not making a political point because this is beyond politics.  I ask the Minister of State to examine this issue again because it is simply unfair.</p></speech>

It is also engaged in link-ups with the Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown and NUI Maynooth.  It does not, however, have independence.  There is one principal in charge of the two institutions because they are, in fact, deemed to be one institution with one roll number.  This is not satisfactory.  The college believes it should have its own roll number, separate access to the Department of Education and Skills and be independent of the secondary school in order that it can provide a real education service for the people of County Meath.  It would, in effect, then form an educational triangle with the institute of technology in Blanchardstown and NUI Maynooth.  Those involved in the college of further education cannot go anywhere until it separates from the secondary school.  The college is seeking independence and its students would be better served if it had that independence.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's response.</p></speech>

It caters for those who have completed senior cycle education, as well as adults who are returning to education and require further vocational education and training in order to enhance their employment prospects.  There are 32,688 approved PLC places nationwide.  The number of approved PLC places is set at its current level because there is a continuing requirement to plan and control numbers and manage expenditure within the context of overall educational policy and provision.  For each approved place, the Department of Education and Skills provides a staffing allocation and non-pay capitation.  The majority of PLC places are provided by education and training boards, ETBs, in recognised schools and colleges, with the remainder in voluntary secondary and community and comprehensive schools.  Places are allocated to ETBs and other providers on an annual basis following an application process and ETBs are responsible for the further allocation of these places to schools and colleges within their remit.</p><p>Dunboyne College of Further Education is part of St. Peter's College, Dunboyne, which is managed by Louth Meath ETB.  Louth Meath ETB has an allocation of 1,526 PLC places for the current academic year.  Enrolment data indicate that the total PLC enrolment in Louth Meath ETB is 1,809.  The only stand-alone PLC college in Louth Meath ETB is Drogheda College of Further Education which has an enrolment of 790 PLC learners.  O'Fiaich College, Dundalk has an enrolment of 511 learners, with Dunboyne College of Further Education having 429.  The other ETB schools offering PLC places are Beaufort College, Navan, which has 64 learners and St. Oliver's post-primary school, Oldcastle, which has 15.  Sanction as a stand-alone PLC college would require additional financial and staffing resources in terms of teacher allocations and management structure, including a principal and other posts of responsibility.  In the context of the current budgetary situation, the moratorium on public sector recruitment and the employment control framework, it would be very difficult to provide these resources.</p> <p>In addition, the Government's medium-term infrastructure and capital investment framework, published on 10 November 2011, sets out the demographic challenge facing the education system in the coming years.  To ensure every child has access to a school place, the delivery of major school projects, as well as smaller projects devolved to schools to meet the demographic demands nationally, will be the main focus for capital investment in schools in the coming years.</p><p>SOLAS, an tSeirbh&iacute;s Oideachais Lean&uacute;naigh agus Scileannathe, the new further education and training authority, is responsible for the integration, co-ordination and funding of the wide range of further education and training programmes available around the country.  It is working on a strategy for the development of a unified further education and training sector.  This strategy will form a framework for future developments in the sector, including the post-leaving certificate sector.</p></speech>

While I do not expect the Minister to announce that the Department will sanction a new building for the college next week, the provision of a separate roll number which would entail appointing a principal is not a significant ask for a college that, as the Department states, officially has 429 students.  Unofficially, as I understand it, the college is providing a service for hundreds more students within its departmental financial allocation.  It is managing to maintain a good service, taking pressure off the Government which would otherwise be under severe pressure to provide these courses.</p><p>The immediate issue is that the school be separated and a principal appointed.  There is already a teacher acting as principal who is not being paid for it, despite the fact that the principal of St. Peter&rsquo;s College is in charge.  They are at least a mile away from each other and it is not conducive to good learning.  While a new building is required in the medium to long term, the Department should examine the short-term solution of putting a principal in charge to allow the college to grow and develop.  I know that the college is looking forward to taking part in SOLAS and bidding for the provision of courses, as well as contributing to the resuscitation of the economy in general.</p></speech>

It is, however, a question of how we address priorities.  The Senator&rsquo;s request is not unreasonable, but it must fall to be dealt with within the assessment of priorities in the allocation of limited resources.  He has made a good case for the school, but it must be seen in the context of the wider work the Government is doing in expanding and improving infrastructure in the years ahead.</p></speech>
