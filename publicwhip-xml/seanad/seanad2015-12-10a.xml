    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-12-10a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1131" speakername="Fidelma Healy Eames" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015121000002#A00500"><p>F&aacute;ilte romhat a Aire.  The matter I raise seeks to discuss with the Minister for Education and Skills teacher appointment and retention figures for primary schools and particularly to ask her to revise teacher appointment guidelines in order that a new primary teacher can be appointed immediately after the 30 September pupil numbers are confirmed by the Department, namely in that same year rather than a whole year later.  </p> <p>I will focus on the challenges facing teaching principals around teaching and learning while also managing a school and providing leadership.  I am talking about schools with seven or fewer teachers.  I will refer to a case study that outlines the challenges facing six teacher schools, in particular.  I am thinking of Bawnmore national school in County Galway, an exemplary school which I have visited many times.  As a class teacher the principal places emphasis on teaching and learning but also gives leadership in the school.  She will have 174 pupils on her books on 1 September 2016.  She needs 172 to appoint a seventh teacher and she will exceed the required number by 30 September.  However, she cannot appoint that seventh teacher until September 2017, a whole year later.  The rules are absolutely archaic.  I know of a number of schools in this position and I feel it is time to revise this rule, which is sheer madness and does not in any way support education.  Another principal asked why schools would get a teacher a year after they need one.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fidelma Healy Eames:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2223"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2223&amp;amp;pid=FidelmaHealyEames&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->He said he has the numbers for a whole year and that is the year he needs the teacher.  Instead, the rule provides that if a school has the numbers on 30 September, it must wait until the following September to get that teacher.</p><p>I propose a way around this.  The Department of Education and Skills should do as follows.  It should use the model the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, uses when providing resource hours to a school, the online claim system, OLCS, model.  This model works really well for resource teachers and the Department should use it for the appointment of teachers in primary schools.  It would have the data immediately through the online system and this would enable it to appoint a teacher immediately.  I recommend that this system be used for the mainstream setting.  The 30 September model has been in place for donkey's years and is out of touch with advances in technology.  I believe it is being used as an excuse to not appoint a teacher for a whole year and to save a year's pay.  If the Department is serious about advances such as the recent autonomy document which is totally frustrating principals, it needs to get with the programme and respond to the immediate needs of schools.  Nothing is more immediate and real than when the numbers are confirmed and the pupils are attending school.  They are real bums on seats.</p><p>To recap, administrative principals are faced with real challenges and we have approximately 1,300 principals in Ireland in this situation.  For all of the schools with seven teachers or fewer that face these challenges, the Minister should very quickly move to provide more administrative days.  That is the least that is required if it wants these teachers to be able to manage teaching and learning, to lead and manage their staff, including ancillary staff, and to deal with parents and take important calls.  The current situation means that the class pupils of teaching principals will lose out.  The leadership role is overwhelming in this type of setting and there is no room for reflective practice and leadership.  I look forward to the Minister of State's reply and hope he has good news for me.</p></speech>

I am aware she tried to raise the matter last week and am glad we are able to facilitate her this week.</p> <p>The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to schools is published annually on the Department's website.  The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.  The staffing schedule includes the provision whereby schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional permanent mainstream posts on developing grounds using projected enrolment.</p></speech>

The staffing appeals process was extended in the 2014-15 school year to allow schools that are not gaining an additional teaching post under the developing schools criterion to submit an appeal to the primary staffing appeals board.  This appeal criterion is targeted at those schools that make a significant contribution to the provision of school places and so assist the response to demographic growth within their area and as a result are under significant pressure on their class sizes at infants level.  An appeals process is also available to small schools in the event that they can show that their projected enrolments are sufficient to allow them to retain their classroom teacher in the longer term.  The appeals board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p> <p>The staffing arrangements for the 2015-16 school year are set out in Circular 0005/2015 which is available on the Department website.  The staffing arrangements set out the appointment and retention figures for all primary schools.  Separate appointment and retention figures apply to ordinary schools with four teachers or fewer and to schools situated in the Gaeltacht with 11 teachers or fewer.</p> <p>The Minister announced two new policies in February 2015 to provide some improvement to the staffing levels of some of our smallest schools and to particularly recognise the challenges faced by very small schools that are more than 8 km from the next nearest school of the same type.  We have a range of these schools in Cork, Kerry, Galway, Mayo and elsewhere that I have visited and that change has been a major help.  These two new policies were improved retention thresholds for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th classroom teacher in a primary school and improved appointment and retention thresholds for isolated one-teacher schools.</p> <p>The number of pupils enrolled in individual schools is provided in the national school annual census and refers to the number of pupils enrolled as of 30 September in the given academic year.  The national school annual census is generally returned by schools to the Department by the end of October.  The allocation of all teaching posts is contingent on compliance with redeployment arrangements.  The core function of the redeployment arrangements is to facilitate the redeployment of all surplus permanent teachers to other schools that have vacancies.  The redeployment of all surplus permanent teachers is key to the Department's ability to manage within its payroll budget and ceiling on teacher numbers.</p> <p>A revision to the teacher allocation process to base the staffing of a school on the enrolment of 30 September in the current school year would require teaching appointments to schools to be made on a provisional basis from 1 September, pending confirmation of enrolments on 30 September.  Allocating resources based on projected enrolments for the coming school year is not practical and would impact negatively on the teacher allocation and redeployment process and the timeframes in which the process is completed.</p> <p>The Minister has made provision in budget 2016 for some 2,260 additional teaching posts for our primary and post-primary schools next year.  At primary level, there will be a one point improvement to the primary staffing schedule to be implemented for the 2016-17 school year.  The improved staffing schedule is available on the Department website and the staffing and redeployment arrangements for all schools for the 2016-17 school year will be published early in 2016.</p> <p>I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the position on staffing in primary schools.  I will ask departmental officials to look at her suggestions, but she should understand that from the point of view of redeployment, it is difficult to change the system.  However, there is a mechanism, where a school can show it is under pressure due to an increased demographic, to allow for an increase during the year.</p></speech>

I accept there has been some improvement in the appointment and retention figures for small schools.  This was welcome given the severe cuts in 2012.  However, I need clarification on one issue.  In the case of proof of a developing school during the year, how soon can the teacher required be appointed?  Can the teacher be appointed during the same school year or must the school wait until the following year?</p> <p>I disagree with the Minister of State that it is not practical to deal with this because I am not referring to the redeployment issue.</p></speech>

That is my recommendation.  Can the Minister of State respond on the point of developing school status.  What proof is required for a school to obtain a teacher on that basis?  Furthermore, why are fewer numbers required in the context of Gaeltacht appointment and retention figures?  Approximately 20 fewer pupils are required for Gaeltacht schools.</p></speech>

The idea behind the provision for rapidly developing schools is that numbers could change significantly from 30 September and to allow for an appointment to be made the following September.</p></speech>

The Senator says she is not concerned about redeployment, but the Department is and we are concerned with remaining within budget.  We have a duty to spend our budget as best we can to get as many teachers as we possibly can in order to reduce class sizes.  We must do that in a co-ordinated manner and that is why redeployment is important to us.  It might not bother the Senator, but it is a concern for those trying to manage the system.  There must be some system.</p></speech>

The system is based on 30 September, but there is a provision in respect of where there is rapid development in an area.  That is allowed for and the system has worked quite well.  I have not come across many cases where schools have felt they were left short.  I will certainly raise the Senator's suggestion with the Department.

Today, I am suggesting an environmentally friendly solution to this problem.  </p> <p>Ten years ago the Irish offshore drift net salmon fishing was ceased as a result of complaints from our European neighbours, which I find rather entertaining given the depredation they cause to Irish fish stocks.  There was a period of cessation of approximately four years following which the total allowable catch system was introduced, which is based on the stock strengths of various rivers.  One would imagine this would result in a considerable increase in fish stocks and a boost to the tourism industry in the context of angling but the reverse has happened in that catches have disimproved.  There are a number of reasons given for this, the official one being that there has been an escalating level of sea losses, with smolt going out to the north eastern Atlantic feeding areas not returning in the numbers expected.</p> <p>According to the fishery scientists, survival is down to around 5% from a level of 40%, which is fairly disastrous.  There are five reasons advanced for this, including: climate caused ocean temperature changes, which has resulted in the sand eel and krill moving further north, to which the fish have not yet adjusted; the mass harvesting of krill and sand eel to provide commercial sources for cat food, etc.; salmon being inadvertently caught by trawlers fishing for other species; damage to smolt as they exit the river systems caused by a myriad of sea lice lava coming off the sea cages of the fish forms in the west coast inlets; and attacks by flocks of cormorants, the results of which can be disastrous.</p> <p>Are these really the reasons for the decrease in the survival rate?  A major factor could be that we are not sending out sufficient numbers of strong smolt in the first instance.  There are a series of social changes that have affected this, including, for example, the development since the 1950s of rural electrification, gas cylinders and Bord na M&oacute;na peat briquettes.  In the past in rural areas people went out and gathered firewood from the banks of small rivers and streams, thereby leaving the riverbanks, which were considered public domain, clean.  This meant that thousands of miles of small tributaries of the main rivers were open to sunlight and became highly productive nursery areas for trout and salmon.  However, the vast majority of these small streams are now completely tunnelled over by Alder and other trees.  </p> <p>It is easy to identify the rivers that are ecologically deficient.  They are the ones that have no ranunculus growing alongside.  Ranunculus is a long green stringy weed which, if one pulls it up out of the river, will be teaming with lice.  Dr. Martin O'Grady, who carried out academic work in this area, reported in 1993 that this over-shadowing of streams reduces their breeding potential by 70%.  That is what he reported over 20 years ago.  The situation has worsened since then and has been exacerbated by ill-thought out REP schemes and so on.  This reputable academic survey concludes that tunnelling reduces breeding potential by 70%.   The result of this is the phenomenon of main channel spawning whereby fish are being driven out of the small tributaries and forced to breed and spawn in the main channels.  Spawning in the main channels leads to over-competition, excess predation and smaller, weaker smolt being produced, which are easy targets for sea lice infestation.  This may also explain why in many Irish rivers the vast bulk of the returning fish are now entering the rivers of origin later in the season.  </p> <p>I now come to the solution.  There have been a number of pilot projects involving manual rehabilitation of degraded stretches of dendrite but only a certain amount could be done by hand.  However, enough has been done to demonstrate a massive increase in productivity of the stretches concerned.  Work on the Kilmanaghan River near Clonmel is a case in point.  The reality is that such rivers probably each have 1,000 km of good nursery streams such that an 0.1% improvement will not impact hugely on the situation.  The situation involving the farmers, in terms of their being under the umbrella of REPS and AEOS, and as such required to fence-off rivers and streams, makes the problem worse.  While this is being done with the best of intentions it is having a harmful effect.  </p> <p>We must also examine whether a few cattle watering gashes are silting up the spawning beds in the first instance.  Fifty years ago there were many more such watering places before the advent of the black polythene waterpipe and concerns about TB.  Is it not far more likely that the cause is the shading out of light upstream, such that there is no riverweed ranunculus to bind the silts in place?  Another issue is that of the lampreys, which stir up the spawning areas and make them appropriate for the fish.  We are now told that they cannot get over the weirs.  Fifty years ago they got over far higher weirs.  </p> <p>What about Coillte, private forestry owners and Bord na M&oacute;na in all of this?  In the old days, the big rivers, a large proportion of the sources of which are in the midlands bogs, were drained and worked but no provision was made for the excess water.  The bogs acted as sponges and provided a far more productive environment for salmonage young.  The solution is simple.  Each of the bog areas should be filled with a limited number of v-notch weirs.  This would also alleviate flooding, which is a topical issue these days.  The introduction of the European beaver in Scotland and Wales has been very successful.  It would have a significant impact here.  Also, special areas of conversation should be under the control of one agency.  Under the current arrangement nothing can be done because each Department has regulations which block the other and they apparently take pleasure in doing so.  It is a game to them.</p></speech>

A grand plan for opening out the dendrites is required.  This does not mean 5 km or 10 km per major river.  A good start would be to apply the law to Coillte, followed by a reseeding of the dendrites using quick-lock vibred boxes.  All of this could be done in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills and become part of the junior certificate science curriculum.  This involves capturing ripe fish in the autumn, stripping them and placing their fertilised ovum in specially designed boxes buried in the gravel.  Those fish that return to spawn will seek out the very tributaries they were born in and the cycle will become self perpetuating.  Doing this will not affect hatcheries.  It is an environmentally friendly system.</p> <p>I thank the Cathaoirleach for his indulgence.</p></speech>

Salmon is of great economic importance to Ireland as a commercially caught species but more particularly for recreational and tourism angling.  The comprehensive national strategy for angling development is currently out to public consultation.  It is intended that this strategy will provide for the development of fisheries and fish habitats for the betterment of recreational angling.  Salmon stocks in Ireland and other countries are constantly under threat from numerous different sources both in rivers and in the ocean.  Salmon spend half of their lives in fresh water and their growing phase at sea, only returning to the river where they were born to spawn after some 15 to 25 months at sea.   </p> <p>Salmon is listed in annex 11 of the habitats directive and as such is afforded special protection not only in special areas of conversation, SACs, but also throughout Ireland.  As a consequence a huge amount of scientific and management effort is invested by Inland Fisheries Ireland in protecting and conversing the species in Ireland.  Ireland's management of wild salmon, carried out by IFI, is considered exemplary in Europe and fisheries managers from many European countries have visited IFI to study Ireland's management regime.  Ireland manages its salmon stocks in each of our 143 salmon rivers on an individual basis as each of these rivers contains a genetically individual stock and annual assessment of stock is carried out on each individual river throughout the year.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This assessment process employs a suite of 29 fish counters on rivers nationwide where data on returning salmon are gathered daily and utilised in the management of the resource.  In addition, all salmon fishermen and commercial draft-net and snap-net fishermen are obliged to take out salmon licences and must return completed logs of their catches, which are used in an analysis of salmon catch data annually.  A large-scale programme of electro-fishing and other scientific assessments also is undertaken.  These components contribute to the recognition of Ireland's robust salmon management and scientific assessment system as being world-class.  However, despite all the work that is undertaken in the freshwater environment, the key challenge in respect of wild salmon is the failure of fish to survive in adequate numbers in the sea and thereafter return to home rivers.  At present, the survival of smolts going to sea returning as grilse and salmon to their natal river to spawn is only 5%, having been as high as 25% only a few decades ago.  I acknowledge the Senator raised some concerns regarding this shortage today but I am advised the principal challenges are tied in with much bigger questions, such as changes in ocean currents and temperatures affecting food distributions associated with climate change.  There also is significant scientific evidence of major detrimental effects on the survival of wild salmon arising from the impact of sea lice emanating from marine salmon farming.</p><p>It is also important to note that after 2006, the mixed-stock commercial salmon fishery in the sea was closed following a decision of the Government.  Harvesting of salmon commercially is now only permitted in the estuarine and freshwater portions of rivers that have an estimated surplus above the individual river's established conservation limit or in the case of estuaries, all contributing rivers are meeting their individual conservation limits.</p><p>Scientific assessments of salmon stocks are carried out by the statutorily independent standing scientific committee on salmon, SSCS, comprising scientists from a range of bodies both North and South.  The most recent advice of the aforementioned committee has concluded for 2016, that of Ireland's 143 salmon rivers, 55 rivers are estimated to be meeting biologically-based conservation limits, while 27 more rivers in all probability will be open for catch-and-release angling as assessments indicate either relatively high juvenile densities or the stocks are meeting more than 65% of their conservation limit.  A comprehensive public consultation process on the management proposals for 2016 in respect of each river concluded yesterday.  I am afraid I do not have the results to hand.  The fish counters provide the most direct assessment of salmon stocks status in rivers.  The number of counters installed and used in the SSCS stock assessments have increased from nine to 29 since 2009.  There has been natural fluctuation in the mean salmon count since 2002, with the highest numbers recorded in 2007, coinciding with the closure of offshore drift-net fisheries, to which I already have referred.  However, there has been a marked decline in subsequent salmon counts, with 2014 being the lowest in the time series.  These counter data are considered as an index for other rivers nationally and are likely to reflect a general national trend.  In the past five years, marine survival of salmon is among the lowest recorded since coded tagging of fish commenced in 1980 and probably since the 1970s, based on a longer time series of information available for the Burrishoole salmon census index site.</p><p>Changes in oceanic conditions leading to poor recruitment of salmon have been implicated by the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation, NASCO, following international investigations into the decline of salmon stocks.  Recent stock forecasts from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, ICES, for stocks in the southern range of the north-east Atlantic, indicate this low stock situation is likely to persist.  Given the current levels of poor survival, ICES recommends that priority should be given to conservation objectives rather than catch increases until there is a noticeable improvement in stock abundance.  In this regard, the ongoing management policy of adopting the scientific advice to only allow exploitation on stocks above conservation limit is central to aid the recovery of salmon stocks nationally and with this policy in place, any improvement in marine survival would be reflected in greater numbers of rivers achieving conservation limit.  This will contribute to meeting the ICES advice and the NASCO requirements of providing for the diversity and abundance of salmon stocks.</p><p>I understand the issues raised by Senator Norris relate specifically to views and observations formed as regards the current situation in the Munster Blackwater where, for the last two years in particular, returns of salmon have decreased.  I am advised the suggestion that the current decrease in the wild salmon stocks is significantly as a consequence of overgrowth on river banks and the tunnelling effect on these rivers inhibiting the spawning and development of salmonids does not appear to be supported by the scientific evidence on the ground.  I understand the Environmental Protection Agency undertakes an assessment of biological river quality of rivers nationally, including the Munster Blackwater, usually every three years.  This assessment is based on the abundance and species composition of insects present at sites both at tributaries and along the main channel of all channels, including the Munster Blackwater.  A Q-value of 4 indicates good ecological status, that is, unpolluted and in satisfactory condition.  This is derived from a standard survey protocol, which examines the abundance and diversity of the insects and other organisms living in the riverbed.  I am advised this constitutes the backbone of the food chain for the juvenile wild salmon and if a figure of 4 is achieved, it indicates, as I stated already, a good ecological status, unpolluted and in satisfactory condition and with a habitat perfectly suitable for wild juvenile salmon production.  A total of 26 tributaries of the Munster Blackwater recorded a Q-value of 4 or higher in the most recent assessment of all the sites.</p></speech>

They are all detailed for the Senator in the response.  As for the main channel of the Blackwater, all sites were described as satisfactory throughout, with high and good ecological quality.</p> <p>The Blackwater is an extensive catchment and salmon spawning takes place both in the main channel and in the tributaries.  While tunnelling can have an impact on the production of juvenile salmonids in certain circumstances, scientific evidence on the ground is it is unlikely this is having a significant effect on juvenile salmon recruitment in a large salmon river such as the Blackwater.  It also is important to note that Inland Fisheries Ireland also undertakes electro-fishing of juvenile salmon in many rivers annually, particularly those that are under pressure in respect of salmon numbers such as, for example, within the Blackwater catchment, the River Bride.</p> <p>Recent electro-fishing of the Bride revealed an electro-fishing average of 18.3 fry per five-minute fishing period, which is above the threshold of 17.0 that the SSCS determines to be the requisite level for a healthy fish stock to be attaining successfully the target conservation limit for salmon.  For the coming year of 2016, the SSCS estimates the Munster Blackwater will have a surplus of 3,714 salmon above the spawning requirement conservation limit of 12,024.</p> <p>I hope that information is useful to the Senator.  It certainly has been an education for me on the issue of salmon fishing in Ireland across 143 rivers.  The Senator also raised issues that were specific to the Department in which I have responsibility, the Department of Education and Skills.  He will be conscious that the junior certificate reform will allow for local courses to be developed and there will be an opportunity for teachers to use their own imagination to work with students to develop short programmes that are significant to their own areas.  Certainly, for those schools along the salmon rivers, there would be an opportunity to do that.</p></speech>

I also will feed back the other issues raised by the Senator to the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, and will ascertain whether I can feed them into the system as well.</p> <p>My final point is the Senator raised the issue of trees and I recall that when I was planting trees at my own house, my good friend, Mr. Bill Dallas, as well as two other guys from Coillte gave me advice on planting trees.  However, I did not take their advice and planted quite a few of them because I thought they would grow quite quickly and might help to give a bit of cover and in a similar way, they have taken over.  Consequently, I can understand what is happening on the rivers.  One should always listen to good advice as one goes along.</p></speech>

Second, I refer to the part of the response which states "While tunnelling can have an impact on the production of juvenile salmonids in certain circumstances, scientific evidence on the ground is it is unlikely this is having a significant effect on juvenile salmon".  This is completely contradicted by the learned academic paper produced by Dr. Martin O'Grady in 1993, which demonstrated there was an impact of 70%.  There is a conflict of evidence in this regard and that is important.  I ask the Minister of State to take back a suggestion to the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, that he or his officials or both might meet Mr. Nicholas Grubb to exchange opinions and to develop matters further because he is an example of somebody who has lived all his life in this area, who has recorded the changes and who has a scientific understanding and knowledge of the situation.  This could be valuable in informing the Department of this particular problem.  I ask that were Mr. Grubb to contact the Department, a meeting might be arranged in order that they could exchange views.</p></speech>

Not unlike many others concerned for his life, health and well-being, I sent him a birthday card through our Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and I hope the message will be passed to the Irish Embassy in Cairo so Ibrahim will know we have not forgotten him and I keep him in my heart.</p> <p>Protection of the right to liberty and from arbitrary detention is included in all human rights treaties.  It is a rule of customary international law.  Detention may be characterised as "arbitrary" on the basis that it continues for an unjustifiably long period or there is a delay in bringing the accused to trial.  As the Minister is aware, there have been continual adjournments of Mr. Halawa's trial over the past two and half years and the next date is scheduled for 15 December.  That will be the tenth time he has been brought to trial.  On the ninth time his trial was adjourned, it was due to a judicial ruling that all 494 defendants must be present for the trial to proceed and a couple were not present due to illness.  The arbitrariness of his detention is one of the prime reasons I have requested the Minister to provide an update on Ibrahim Halawa's legal case and to outline the Government's actions since his last trial date of 4 October 2015, which ended in adjournment until 15 December.</p> <p>I am aware of and deeply respect the personal commitment of the Minister to support the release of Ibrahim and the immense work done by him and his officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and our Irish Embassy staff in Cairo.  As he knows, I had an extended meeting with the Minister's officials prior to Mr. Halawa's last trial date and I heard first-hand an outline of the Minister's actions, strategies and assessment of diplomatic advice taken from other jurisdictions with citizens in similar circumstances.  I now request an update of actions since 4 October and I hope the Minister might also give us an indication of how we are supporting Ibrahim's access to his lawyers prior to 15 December.</p> <p>My understanding from meetings with the international team is that the precise charges Mr. Halawa faces remain unclear and there is no evidence against Ibrahim set out in the charge sheet.  Ibrahim has been living in appalling prison conditions, with a lack of medical treatment, and letters from him describe regular beatings, being stripped naked in front of inmates and guards and being hit with metal chains.  There is insufficient access to daylight and exercise.  Journalists report that a recent letter stated that he is merely "waiting in a queue for my turn on a death row" and his family claims that he has fainted on four occasions in recent weeks as his condition weakens.</p> <p>Given the lack of evidence and clarity in the charges, along with the lack of access to lawyers, prolonged detention, cruel treatment and the precedence of mass trials in Egypt, a fair trial appears impossible.  It is a time of great urgency, as I know the Minister understands.  That is why I hope the Minister's reply will indicate what new actions he has taken or will take to step up the pressure for Mr. Halawa's release.  I know the Minister is aware that this is no longer a time for aspiration but it is time to secure his freedom and bring him home.</p></speech>

I assure her and the House that the objectives on the part of the Government in this case are two-fold: first, to see the release of Mr. Ibrahim Halawa by the Egyptian authorities so that he can return to his family and his studies in Dublin; and, second, to provide consular support for his health and welfare while he remains in detention.</p> <p>Having regard to the fact that the trial is ongoing, the Government must be extremely careful to ensure that its actions, both public and private, are well judged and do not detract from our goal of securing positive progress for Ibrahim Halawa at the earliest possible opportunity.  The further adjournment of the trial, as outlined by the Senator, was a disappointment and I have conveyed the Government's ongoing concern about the continued delays to both Egypt's Foreign Minister and the Egyptian ambassador to Ireland, both of whom I contact on a regular basis.  Embassy officials are preparing to be at the next hearing of the trial, which is scheduled to take place next week on 15 December.</p> <p>I assure the Senator that within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, this consular case continues to receive a very high level of priority.  I acknowledge the Senator's comments in that regard.  In addition to the 48 consular visits conducted thus far, the case has also been raised at the highest level between the Taoiseach and President al-Sisi, most recently last month.  I have also raised the issue on several occasions with my Egyptian counterpart, the Foreign Minister, Mr. Sanaeh Shoukry.  I have raised the issue on a regular basis with the Egyptian ambassador to Ireland, Ms Soha Gendi, and with the European Union&rsquo;s High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice President of the Commission, Ms Federica Mogherini.  My colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, also recently raised the case with the Minister, Mr. Shoukry, when they met at the migration summit in Valletta, Malta.</p> <p>While Ibrahim Halawa remains imprisoned, our focus is on Ibrahim's welfare and I am naturally concerned about reports that he may have embarked on a hunger strike.  Such a course of action could be damaging to his health and I cannot see how in any way this course of action could contribute to positive progress on the case.  I know of the Senator's interest in this case over a long period and I urge her and anyone who has the best interests of this citizen at heart to do everything within their power to dissuade him from this course of action.  They should encourage him to engage in all and every nutritional activity.</p> <p>The Irish Government has formally supported the applications made to the court to secure Ibrahim's release on bail and under decree 140, which grants a discretionary power of release to the Egyptian President.  The bail application, as the Senator is aware, is exclusively a matter for the court's determination.  In regard to decree 140, we have been repeatedly advised by the Egyptian authorities that this discretion will only be considered after the trial has concluded.  We expect there will be progress in this regard next week, on 15 December.  In the meantime, I assure the Senator that we will continue to avail of all appropriate opportunities to respectfully remind the authorities in Egypt of our concern for this citizen's health and welfare.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charles Flanagan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=414"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Our wish and priority will be that he will be able to return to his family in Ireland at the earliest possible opportunity.</p></speech>

I appreciate and acknowledge the high priority the Minister and his staff have provided for Ibrahim and his family regarding his case.  I acknowledge the objectives the Minister has identified and he has pursued those objectives.</p> <p>In the Minister's response he outlined that he has pursued these various courses.  I am not sure if he feels there is nothing more to do apart from continuing in the way he has identified.  This case is so critical I felt it was important at this stage for me to raise publicly that, notwithstanding its status under Egyptian law, his continued detention without trial and his inability to meaningfully challenge that detention constitutes a serious violation of his rights under international law.  He has been in detention for an unjustifiably long period of time.  There must be other ways, whether a fresh application under decree 140 directly from our Government.  The Minister and I are aware there is a debate regarding when is the appropriate time to do this when it has been done by other countries in terms of the release of prisoners.  I also hope the Minister will support Ibrahim's legal team gaining access to him prior to his trial.</p> <p>I appreciate the Minister's response but I hope that given the ongoing length of time and the arbitrariness of his detention, there must be other ways the Minister is exploring so that ultimately Ibrahim can be released and come home.</p></speech>

On behalf of the Irish Government, I wish to assure the Senator and this House that we fully support all and any applications that have been made to the court regarding bail and the Presidential decree 140.  Ultimately we do not have a final say in the judgment.  I am sure the Senator will agree this is a matter exclusively under the jurisdiction and remit of the courts in Egypt.  However, we are not only in regular but constant contact.  I accept that there are those who do not agree with the Government's approach.  However, I appeal to anyone who has the best interests of our citizen at heart to ensure that their own actions and public statements do not jeapardise his position and progress that has been made to date, irrespective of any views regarding the fairness or appropriateness of any arrest abroad.  While we are entitled to expect that international standards are fully complied with, when an Irish citizen is charged with an offence under the law of a foreign country, it is foreign law that is applied.  In this case it is Egyptian law which is applied.  It is the relevant foreign authorities which decide on matters such as bail and release.  Of course I wish to acknowledge what the Senator has said regarding the inordinate length of time for which our citizen has been detained without trial.  I acknowledge the contribution of many NGOs which have expressed an interest in this case.  However, ultimately the decision to release Ibrahim Halawa will be made by the Egyptian authorities.</p> <p>My strategy in seeking his release is carefully considered.  It is informed by decades of experience in difficult consular cases.  It is underpinned by extensive and ongoing consultation with states which have had citizens in similar circumstances.  I speak to my international colleagues on a regular basis to see and determine where best practice can be applied.  Since October, which was raised by the Senator, I assure the Senator we have renewed our engagements and we continue to seek all and every opportunity to make our position clear.  Therefore, the approach taken by the Government represents the best means of achieving the twin goals of protecting his welfare and, more important, securing his release at the earliest opportunity.</p></speech>

The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, has shown that this Government&rsquo;s budgets have hit those at the bottom the hardest and protected those at the top, whereas our budgets got most out of those who had the most and protected those at the bottom who had the least to give.  We see the result of that two-tier recovery in a report that one in five children goes to bed or school hungry every week.  The Government&rsquo;s commentator in chief, who holds the title Minister for Health, commented yesterday on Deputy Wallace&rsquo;s brief incarceration.  The leader of the Labour Party was quoted last week in <i>The Irish Examiner</i>saying he should focus his comments on the Department of Health.  There is plenty to comment on there.  When asked to comment on the fact that one in five children goes to bed or school hungry each week, he was able to find a silver lining in that dark cloud by saying at least the consumption of fruit and vegetables is up and the consumption of sweets is down.  That of course is only for the four out of five who can afford them not the one in five who goes to bed and school hungry each week.  Will the Leader invite the Minister for Health to come to the House to discuss this report?  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to have a debate on the issue that one in five children goes to bed or school hungry every week.  The Minister has been able to comment on many things but as his real title is Minister for Health he should focus on that. </p><p>In Famine times, when the Irish went to the United States, there were many who did not want them to go there and tried to block their entry because they were Catholics.  The Irish were refugees from a Famine of biblical proportions and even those who have Christian values did not espouse the view that they should love their neighbour.  They did not even live up to the ideals of the Statue of Liberty, &ldquo;Give me your tired, your poor, your huddling masses yearning to breathe free&rdquo;.  They come out with comments about members of different faiths, not Catholics but the Muslim faith with bigoted and racist comments.  We would expect more from people running for high office. </p></speech>

We would expect more from someone seeking the high office of President of the United States and leader of the free world than to judge someone by his or her religion and try to block members of the Muslim community entering the United States in the same way as people tried to stop Irish Catholics entering the United States over a century and a half ago.</p></speech>

We are getting optimistic reports that new targets for global emissions reduction will be set there.  It has been really good to see so much input from civil society.  Many Irish activists went to Paris.  There has been a great deal of dynamic activity by civil society groups around the talks.  That is really welcome given all the security concerns.  If time permits in the new year will the Leader arrange a debate on the outcome of the talks and the new targets?</p> <p>I welcome the announcement by the Minister of Health, Deputy Varadkar, about the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015.  Many colleagues in this House have called for this Bill.  When will it be brought before us?  It will impose important restrictions on advertising of alcohol, minimum pricing and so on.  It will probably receive cross-party support. </p> <p>Can we have a debate on crime in the new year?  Several significant reports have been published recently, in particular the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na inspectorate report which was highly critical of so many aspects of Garda and policing practice.  Today, one of the three members of the inspectorate spoke about the difficulty in bringing prosecutions in a timely fashion, given computer system delays and talking about better deployment of garda&iacute;.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence has held several debates on different aspects of Garda Inspectorate reports but I would like this House to debate this report.</p> <p>I welcome the announcement by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, this week that the practice of imprisoning people for non-payment of fines would end in January with the commencement at last of the Fines (Payment and Recovery) Act 2014 and the putting in place by the Courts Service of the necessary systems to ensure that alternative mechanisms can be used.  The Law Reform Commission report on search warrants has some very practical suggestions for greater efficiency in the criminal justice system. </p></speech>

Deputy Wallace was released within 90 minutes and the whole thing was an absolute farce.  I listened to "The Late Debate" where a collection of self-righteous political hypocrites condemned them in the most inflammatory language.  I praise them.  I support them.  I regret that I was not there to protest against the involvement of this country in the aggressive war being waged by the United States against various countries in the Middle East.  They were admirable to do it.  Ed Horgan, a former senior army officer who was at the jail last night, and his group, supplied me with information as a result of which I was able to demonstrate an unbroken cycle of rendition involving this country.  We were clearly implicated in it.  Government after Government has lied about this.  War crimes are being committed by the United States of America in the Middle East by the massive saturation bombing of people in Iraq and the use of white phosphorus in Fallujah.  These unspeakable things were going on.  These Deputies were 100% right to protest.

They were acting in a humanitarian way and supporting the civil and human rights of people in the Middle East.</p> <p>We cannot be surprised at the kind of attacks that are being perpetrated, regrettably, against people in the west when we put them into the context of the dreadful interventions of the United States and Britain, particularly in this area.  I salute Deputies Mick Wallace and Clare Daly and think they were right in their actions.  I heard people saying last night on the radio that they did the crime and should pay the fine.  Why should they?  This is an honourable and reasonable method of protest.  It is a non-violent civil protest and I applaud them for it.</p></speech>

There was a collapse in milk prices and pig farmers had a similar problem.  There will be a fund of over &euro;27 million paid out to them before Christmas, of which &euro;13 million comes from the EU and &euro;13 million from national funds.  That is good news for about 18,000 farmers who will get &euro;1,300 or &euro;1,400 before Christmas.  There is a smaller number of farmers involved in the dairy sector.</p> <p>The payments are vitally important.  A number of farmers still have not got their basic payments, although most have.  It is important that we call on the Minister to make sure that those farmers who are short-listed do receive their basic payment before Christmas.</p></speech>

It is very serious in Limerick and Athlone, where there are houses in danger.  It has alleviated to some degree in Athleague.  I compliment the Army, Civil Defence and volunteers who were very active in the village of Athleague.  The people there helped and supported each other and assisted in preventing the flooding of businesses.  Hopefully Athleague will reopen for business as quickly as possible.</p> <p>On the celebration and commemoration of the 1916 Rising, I would like to ask the Leader and the Cathaoirleach what proposals the Oireachtas Commission has made to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Rising.  It took place on 24 April 1916 and the State celebrations will be on 28 March 2016.  There are events taking place in Dublin Castle.  I believe the Oireachtas should play a very active role in this regard but, as someone who has served here for a very long time, I have received no briefing whatsoever from anyone.  Commission members have not told me what is proposed.</p> <p>I suggest, if I may, that the siopa would be immediately converted into a 1916 area for students attending the Oireachtas during the year.  There could be an exhibition of photographs, memorabilia and other material there.  Other structures within the buildings of the Oireachtas should commemorate this day.  The very attractive commemorative badge that was given to Members of the Oireachtas should also be given to every citizen of the State.  I have met people in the Defence Forces and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have not been sent this badge.  In 2000, former Minister S&eacute;amus Brennan had memorial trees sent to every citizen in Ireland to mark the Millenium.  It would be a small gesture for the Government to provide this badge to every citizen.  It would be very nice for people to proudly wear it during 2016.</p> <p>It is the most memorable and largest event we will celebrate in the next 100 years.  We should be briefed and I hope the Leader will be able to get a briefing before the year is out.  I would like to see a day when the Oireachtas would erect statues to the 1916 signatories on the Merrion Street side of Leinster House to display the bravery of those men and women.</p></speech>

The security fence is there for a purpose.  I do not think my colleagues in the other House do their cause very much good by grandstanding in this manner.  We can argue the rights and wrongs of the use of Shannon and the problems in the Middle East.  Perhaps we should have a debate here in the new year about that.  They have made their point, and by failing to pay the fine they have wasted Garda and Prison Service resources.  They, not the garda&iacute;, are responsible for that.  They should pay their fine and consider their point well made.</p> <p>I ask the Leader if we can have a debate on the trouble in the Middle East in the new year.  It seems that the analysis put forward by some people about its causes are simplistic.  I heard Deputy Daly on the radio this morning.  What she was saying was that we have brought on ourselves any terrorism events we may expect here in the west, because the evil Americans are the cause of every woe in this country.  That is, of course, a simplistic, naive and wrong analysis.</p></speech>

I was somewhat surprised that there has not been any comment so far on the publication of a 400-page report on changing policing in Ireland.  The media have highlighted aspects of this report.  One of the most respected security journalists, Jim Cusack, has referred to it as "the latest and possibly most important independent report on the history of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na" and says that it is a shocking indictment of Garda management.  I understand that the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald has welcomed the report and that its author, Mr. Olsen, and the Commissioner, Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan, will attend a special Cabinet meeting next week on justice reform.</p> <p>Will any opportunity arise for this House to debate the report?  It affects both city and country.  For example, it has branded the Garda force as creating a two-tier community policing system which benefits Dublin at the expense of rural communities.  The figures bear this out.  There are currently 540 garda&iacute; assigned to community policing, some 328 of whom work in Dublin with 117 assigned to one division in Dublin alone.  The technology employed by the garda&iacute; is, according to the report, 30 years behind the times.  It beggars belief that this is happening.  A significant number of Garda stations do not even have e-mail availability.  Others are still using paper-based systems as distinct from computers.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paschal Mooney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1990"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1990&amp;amp;pid=PaschalMooney&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->More worryingly, there is no cybercrime unit within the Garda.  As a result, investigations into paedophilia and abuse of children through the Internet is four years behind the times.  These are shocking statistics.  Tribute is paid to rank and file garda&iacute; who it seems are working under the most difficult of circumstances across the country.  It is important for this report to be teased out.  It is incumbent on the Minister and Government to respond to this in a positive manner and tell us what they will do to improve the technology and efficient running of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am not surprised that morale among rank and file garda&iacute; is at such a low ebb if they have to deal with this sort of thing on a daily basis.  It is unacceptable in a modern society.</p></speech>

It is laudable that its goal is to reduce the damage alcohol causes to individuals and society and to reduce average annual alcohol consumption.  I welcome the measures contained in it to deal with minimum unit pricing, strict separation of alcohol products in outlets, compulsory health labelling, the requirement to display health warnings, the regulation of advertising and marketing, the ban on advertising near schools, playgrounds and public transport, the prohibition of price based promotions and an enforcement regime including inspections.  It is horrifying to realise that four out of ten people typically engage in binge drinking.  All sides of the House find these measures laudable.  I welcome them and look forward to their introduction.</p></speech>

I remember this being proposed many years ago but I am not sure what happened to the proposal.  Is it possible that we have not moved on it or is there a constitutional reason for not doing so?  It appears there are people in jail because they have not paid their television licence, which does not make sense.</p> <p>Senator Mooney talked about the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Yesterday, there was a case in which two garda&iacute; went to Limerick with a Member of the other House who was released an hour and a half later.  I do not know whether the two garda&iacute; came back again but it must have taken them some time.  This is a situation in which we could deduct fines from salaries, social welfare payments or other income.  It is worthy of discussion and decision.  We had a debate on a Bill on fines in this House recently.  Perhaps the Leader can tell us if anything is happening in this area.  It was his suggestion yesterday that reminded me of it.</p></speech>

Women's Aid is using it to highlight all the women who have been murdered by their partners and children who have been killed as a result of domestic violence.  One of the first motions I moved in this House was on domestic violence and we had a very good debate and cross-party support.  The time has come again to have another debate on it.  Senator Cahill has called for a debate on domestic violence and I second her call for that debate.</p> <p>Yesterday, on the Order of Business, Senator Mooney raised an issue on the medical card office and its workings.  He subsequently moved an amendment to the Order of Business and while I could not support his proposed amendment - we all know Ministers cannot come to the House at the drop of a hat - I support what he said and I call for a reasonable debate on the medical card office.  It is outrageous that anyone who has given documents to the PCRS office and wants them back has to make a freedom of information request.  It is ridiculous.  I am aware of a man who collated all his documents for the PCRS office.  It took him four weeks to gather all the information.  He needed bank statements.  He had to write to England about a British pension he was receiving because proof of it going into his bank account was not sufficient and he had to get written confirmation from Newcastle upon Tyne.  He then sent the documents to the PCRS office in an envelope, which it supplied.  When he phoned the office, there was no record of his documents and nobody could tell him where they were gone.  He was asked to send them again.  It is absolutely ridiculous.  Either we have the worst postal system in this country, which is responsible for delivering to the PCRS office, or the PCRS office is not keeping an eye on all this information and is not collating it properly.  I request a debate on the workings of the PCRS office as soon as the Leader can get a Minister here to do so.</p></speech>

There probably has not been a time when we have seen such breaches of human rights across the globe.  Every day we hear stories from the Middle East and the atrocities of Daesh against minorities, in particularly Christians who are killed.  There are YouTube videos of the beheading of innocent people.  We are aware of the situation of women, particularly young women, being taken and forced into sexual slavery by some of these terrorists.  It is an appalling vista.  Among those breaches is the abortion holocaust.  It is very sad that the UN and organisations such as Amnesty and ICCL, which receive millions in foreign moneys, spend their energy promoting the breach of the most fundamental human right of all which is the right to life.  I am specifically referring to the right to life of the unborn.  I have asked before and I ask the Leader again to have a debate on this issue in this House.  Yesterday, the BAI condemned the Ray D'Arcy show on RTE Radio 1, our national broadcaster.  I heard the interview with Colm O'Gorman of Amnesty.  The cynicism and cold blooded intent of killing unborn babies was chilling.  It is not good enough for a national broadcaster.

Our thoughts remain with the home owners and businesses that have been flooded in recent days and those who are on high alert as a result of rising rivers throughout the country.

They have been supported by emergency responders and volunteers in the local communities.  Thanks to their efforts, many homes and businesses have been saved from the worst effects of flooding.  For those who have been affected, I welcome the Minister's confirmation yesterday that the &euro;5 million to be made available to small businesses and administered by the Red Cross would have the minimum of red tape.  Householders are reminded that they can access the humanitarian aid through the Department of Social Protection.  I thank the Department for agreeing to open a temporary office in Ballinasloe from this Friday onwards to facilitate the people in the area who have been impacted.  When the floods recede there is much work to be done.  I hope a renewed urgency will be given to the CFRAMS programme.  I was disappointed to learn this morning that a decision on Dunkellin drainage scheme, being progressed by Galway County Council and which was expected from An Bord Plean&aacute;la before Christmas will not be available until February.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la needs to get into the real world and realise the urgency of this decision.</p><p>An issue that needs to be discussed is that of insurance for homes and businesses that have been flooded.  Even in situations where flood defences have been put in place and they are working satisfactorily, insurance companies still refuse to insure those home owners.  We need a full debate on the attitude of the insurance industry in the new year.</p></speech>

We should have a balanced debate on what is a very emotive issue.  There are contrary views to that of mine and Senator Walsh and many others on all sides of this House but we should have that debate.  There is, in my opinion, a certain amount of conditioning going on and it is conditioning in one way, so far as I can see.  It is trying to cleanse the whole process of what abortion is about, that is, the ending of an unborn child's life.  I call on the Leader to arrange for that debate.</p> <p>I received a text from somebody who visited Collins Barracks, the National Museum, yesterday.  In the text the individual said he enjoyed the visit.  At the end of the visit he bought portraits of six of the signatories of the Proclamation but it had run out of portraits of James Connolly.  To illustrate the balanced approach of this individual, he also bought a portrait of Michael Collins and of James Larkin.  However, when he attempted to purchase a portrait of &Eacute;amon de Valera he was told, "Oh, we don't do that".

Specific assurances were sought and received from US authorities by many taoisigh that Shannon was not being used in this way.  An agreement for overflight and landing of US military has been in place for over 50 years.  We are talking now about better co-operation between all of the European countries.  Are we saying we should have no co-operation that there should not even be fuelling and landing?

This House has conducted itself very professionally and well in looking after legislation and doing the right thing by the citizens of this country.</p> <p>I also commend An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Garda Commissioner and superintendents around the country for their initiatives to help alleviate much of the unfounded concerns of members of the public regarding the closure of rural Garda stations.  In order to reassure people, superintendents and chief superintendents have set up clinics in local libraries and town halls for the same number of hours as rural Garda stations were open to demonstrate to those who are concerned that a service can be provided and that it will be monitored.</p> <p>I further commend the chief superintendents around the country who have initiated and organised public meetings and public awareness sessions to again give people reassurance.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has gone through a difficult period but the Commissioner and her senior management team are doing extraordinary work to rebuild the confidence and loyalty most citizens in this country have in the force.  A survey carried out in recent months showed that 86% of people now have confidence in the force.  That has risen from 67% in 2013.  Much credit must be given to the first female Garda Commissioner, together with the support she is getting from our great female Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.  Sometimes we can be very critical but when a job is being done properly, professionally and correctly and is getting results, we must acknowledge it.</p></speech>

This relates to the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.  The Minister for Health has undergone a consultation process with a view to making a final decision about the proposal to prescribe the title of physical therapist as a variant of the specified title of physiotherapist after an appropriate lead-in time.  This proposal has been recommended by the State regulator, the Physiotherapists Registration Board and it is also supported by the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists, a professional body for physiotherapists and physical therapists in this country, which has more than 3,000 members.  There is support for the protection of both the titles of "physiotherapist" and "physical therapist" within the same body.  Organisations such as the Irish Medical Organisation, the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland and various universities all support the proposed change.</p> <p>This is about maximising public protection and eliminating a widespread public confusion that exists around the term "physical therapist".  The legislation in 2005 set out to protect the titles of 14 health professionals.  The title "physiotherapist" will be protected but it is imperative that the second title of "physical therapist" would also gain protection because in the UK and internationally, the title of physical therapist is synonymous with physiotherapist and they are interchangeable but there are people in this country who have adopted the title of physical therapist having done short and part-time courses - good luck to them but it is causing considerable confusion because the public, sporting organisations or many other individuals and groups related to the health professions in the country are aware of the fact that the level of service provided by physiotherapists and physical therapists can be completely different.  It would be great if we could get a decision from the Minister or clarification on what decision he has made.</p> <p>Senator Healy Eames should not have to run the gauntlet for making the very simple point that there should be accountability when a public service-funded broadcaster is showing bias on a life and death issue.  I remind colleagues in the Labour Party and elsewhere who get very exercised, for example, about the fact that religious ideas and values are communicated in State-funded schools, even though that happens with the will of those parents and even though other schools are also funded.</p></speech>

Something could be done for the elderly now that the country is in a better state economically, especially those aged over 90 years if not over 85 years.  I had a similar experience with a constituent who had all sorts of difficult medical conditions to deal with and the medical card was refused over a very small sum.

I welcome moves undertaken by the Minister for Health, my constituency colleague, Deputy Leo Varadkar, to attempt to tackle the troubled Irish relationship with alcohol.  He announced yesterday the long-awaited drinks legislation under which we will see a ban on alcohol advertising near schools, playgrounds and public transport.  That can only be welcomed.  Under the new law, we will see a minimum price of &euro;7.60 on a bottle of wine.  Alcohol in supermarkets has become like any other product such as milk or butter and one now throws in a few bottles of wine into the trolley.  We have become too relaxed in our consumption of alcohol and it is clearly not doing us any favours as a society.  The Bill will also introduce a minimum price for a can of beer.  </p> <p>We must be concerned about alcohol.  It was one thing when people were drinking in pubs, and perhaps drinking to excess, but at least people were there, such as the publican and members of society, to keep an eye on them but if people are drinking a huge volume at home, in many cases they are putting themselves in huge danger.  From that point of view, the Bill is greatly to be welcomed.</p> <p>A criticism of the Bill is that it will affect the more vulnerable people in society but it is a small price to pay for the overall reduction in the amount of binge drinking, in particular, among teenagers and young people.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Catherine Noone:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2354"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2354&amp;amp;pid=CatherineNoone&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->When will it be presented to the House?

I am disturbed by some comments today.  I respect the right of anybody to have an opinion on any issue and I have listened, but I find some of the distortions that have been raised about a particular programme on RTE absolutely horrific.  The national broadcaster was not found to be biased in favour of abortion.  It was found to be biased in a segment of one radio programme after a particularly distressing case where doctors were seeking advice on keeping a woman alive artificially because she was pregnant.  Nobody could have failed to have been shocked by that case.  I find phrases like "abortion holocaust" absolutely horrific and if Members would like the respect of the House-----</p></speech>

Reason needs to be brought to this debate.  Unfortunately, the debate is only emanating out of a sexy campaign called Repeal the 8th.  None of the underlying issues is being discussed, although disturbing cases are being raised, with which we all sympathise.  They are alarming in the extreme but reason needs to be brought to the debate.  I would welcome a reasoned and sympathetic debate in the House, which would consider all the issues.  My colleague, Deputy O'Dea, spoke on this issue last night in a level-headed manner.  If the eighth amendment is repealed, the protections of the unborn will be removed from the Constitution.  What constitutional protection, therefore, will we provide for the unborn?  Does the State want to take all the protections for the unborn out of the Constitution?</p></speech>

Human rights extend to the unborn because we were all unborn at one time or another.  Other issues and wider factors need to be brought to bear in this debate and I ask the Leader to facilitate such a reasoned debate over a reasonable timeframe with everyone being allowed to express an opinion and bring balance to the debate.  To date, the debate has not been balanced and there has been too much emotion.  That serves no one's interest.  I hope the Leader takes all views on board and facilitates such a debate.</p></speech>

I am ashamed at the exchanges I have listened to from all sides.  The exchanges have not been respectful or fitting for this House.  If legislators such as ourselves behave in such a manner, I am reluctant to have a debate on the issue.  If legislators behave in such a manner, what can we expect of others on both sides of the divide in this debate?  I will think seriously about having a debate but I hope that when that debate is decided upon, we will have much more respectful exchanges that we had here this morning.  It is not conducive for the House to put up with such exchanges in the run up to Christmas or, indeed, at any time.  I ask Members to be mindful of their remarks when they stand up in the House.  I am talking about both sides, and not one side of the divide on this issue.</p> <p>On the Order of Business, Senator Daly made a number of wandering commentaries on various matters.  With regard to the American people, we had better leave them to judge on who they vote for themselves as President.  It has nothing to do with us.</p> <p>Senator Bacik referred to the resolution of the climate change talks and she is hopeful that they will be successful and that we will have a debate in the future on that matter.  We will, hopefully, be able to do that in January.</p> <p>Senators Bacik, Coghlan and Noone raised the alcohol Bill and that will come before the House next Thursday.</p> <p>On other legislation, Senator Mooney asked yesterday about the bankruptcy Bill.  That will also be before the House next Thursday.  I am sure he will be happy about that.</p></speech>

The Minister for Justice and Equality intends to send the report to Mr. Ray Magee and other parties, including the Garda representative organisations, first in order that they can review the issues raised.  She also intends referring the report to the Cabinet Committee on Justice Reform.  Technology is an absolute necessity for the Garda.  The Government's capital plan includes substantial additional investment of more than &euro;205 million in new technology and systems for the force.  This new allocation will deliver new systems which will ensure a more responsive deployment of garda&iacute; in the community and improve Garda response times.  These and other new technology solutions for use by the Garda will cut back on the time involved in paperwork in order that garda&iacute; can spend more time on front-line policing.  Hopefully, we will have a debate on that in the new year.</p> <p>A number of Members sought a debate on crime.  The burglaries Bill will be before the House next week and, therefore, there will be ample opportunity for them to debate the issue.</p> <p>Senators Norris, Gilroy and Keane expressed various views on Deputies in the other House in the context of Shannon Airport.  We cannot condone the breaking of the law in any instance.</p> <p>Senator Comiskey welcomed the aid for beef and pig farmers.  The outstanding payments are few and far between and I am sure the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is working on that issue.</p> <p>Senator Leyden raised the 1916 commemoration and the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  I am not aware of the commission's programme in this regard but I am sure the Fianna F&aacute;il representative on the commission will highlight the issues raised by him.</p> <p>Senator Quinn referred to the Fines Act, which was passed in 2014.  I understand the Minister for Justice and Equality has announced that she will commence it in January.  In future, fines could be deducted from social welfare payments and salaries, which is the proper way to go.  Community services orders will also be an option in dealing with people who do not pay their fines.</p> <p>Senator Moloney pointed out that today is Human Rights Day and she called for a debate on domestic violence, which we will have in the new year.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maurice Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2003"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2003&amp;amp;pid=MauriceCummins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> In relation to medical cards, obviously we will have isolated situations where people have difficulties.

I understand that the Primary Care Reimbursement Service, PCRS, was before the Joint Committee on Health and Children yesterday.  I hope that members brought up these issues with the service at that meeting.  </p><p>Senator Mullins mentioned flooding and applauded the efforts of volunteers and emergency services.

The Minister has said he believes the spike in the returns is sustainable.  We will see if that is the case.</p><p>We are trying to provoke a discussion on this issue as it has been suggested to me and many others that setting up this type of fund might be the safest way to lock in any windfalls or temporary bonuses from the State which we might enjoy because of the fluid situation in global taxation.  We also know that multinationals are rational actors which will arrange their business in a way which benefits them most.  That is fair enough.  Despite what some might think, sentiment is not a major player in their tax affairs.  We know that as rules change, they will change.  They will try to stay one step ahead of all of us and of states.  There is also a strong opinion, which looks increasingly credible, that the BEPS process is benefitting Ireland.  That is ironic given our head in the sand attitude to corporation tax.</p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in and Deputy Pearse Doherty have been raising this issue of whether corporations were even paying an effective corporation tax or pay enough corporation tax.  As a result of the European inquiries into Apple and much controversy and discussion about whether multinationals were paying their fair share of corporation tax, it would seem to some that there is some link to what has happened this year in terms of the spike in corporation tax.</p><p>The idea in the amendment is to examine the benefits of setting up a wealth fund which would be funded by these receipts as well as any repayments due to the State if, for example, the judgment in the Apple case was to lead to a windfall payment.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Cullinane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2357"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2357&amp;amp;pid=DavidCullinane&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This idea has some merit in that it attempts to make sure any windfall or temporary benefit which the State might enjoy would not be squandered.  The fiscal compact and various other EU rules mean that if the State takes in extra income of that scale, it will not impact massively on the fiscal space because of the debt-to-GDP ratio rules and so on.  However, there is merit in the approach suggested and at least examining the possibility of it happening, as proposed in the amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-12-10a.252" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015121000002#Q00200"><p>I thank the Senator for his comments.  I advise him that there are no active cases in the European court that would result in any additional tax being paid to the Irish Exchequer.  The issue at the heart of the recommendation is the application and use of non-cyclical tax receipts.  Ireland is bound by EU fiscal rules and from 2016 our compliance will be assessed under the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact.  The expenditure benchmark will, therefore, provide the anchor for fiscal policy in the medium term.  In practical terms, this means that from 2016 onwards, there will be a fixed amount of expenditure or fiscal space available in the annual budget.  This fiscal space will be derived by reference to the potential growth rate of the economy which is independent of tax performance.  This means that future Government expenditure will be decoupled from cyclical or windfall tax revenues so as to ensure increases in public expenditure will be sustainably financed and safeguarded from dependence on cyclical revenues.</p> <p>In terms of extra tax payments which have been received by the Exchequer, the public finances are improving, with a broad and growing tax base providing stable funding for vital public services.  The reformed budgetary framework and fiscal rules are designed to protect the public finances and ensure the mistakes of the past will not be repeated.  Underpinning recent budgetary policy, for example, has been projected 15% growth in taxes and PRSI between 2014 and 2016, while in the corresponding period expenditure is forecast to grow by just 4%.  This favourable differential has facilitated the Government&rsquo;s successful focus on deficit reduction.  </p> <p>Regarding our strong corporation tax performance in 2015 and the forecasts for 2016, a reversion to more normal levels of growth in corporation tax receipts is prudently assumed for next year.  Under the new fiscal regime, non-cyclical receipts cannot be utilised for public expenditure purposes, although they can be applied to reduce the national debt which remains the biggest internal risk to the economy.</p> <p>Taking account of cash and liquid assets, including those held by the NTMA and the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, our net debt position will be 80% of GDP by the end of the year.  This debt level, while sustainable, is too high.  Debt reduction is a critical goal as building our fiscal capacity or ability to borrow is the best way to mitigate the risks from unforeseen events.  </p> <p>To address the suggestion of the establishment of a sovereign wealth fund, I remind the Senator that the State already has the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, which is available for investment in commercial projects that also yield an economic return to the State.  The fund has assumed the resources of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, and will invest them in accordance with its mandate of promoting economic activity and employment within the State.  We are already beginning to see that the ISIF is having a positive impact on the economy.  Its first economic impact report from July advised that by the end of 2014, 79 Irish companies and projects with a combined annual turnover of &euro;472 million were benefiting from ISIF investment.  Furthermore, approximately 8,362 jobs were supported directly and indirectly by ISIF investments.  At 30 September 2015, the ISIF had some &euro;7.472 billion available for investment and will continue to leverage its resources by seeking co-investors.  It can be expected to more than double the funds available to support economic activity and employment in the State.  It is my view that the fund has enough resources to fulfil its mandate at the current time.</p> <p>On the basis that we have the ISIF and given my explanation of EU fiscal rules, it is clear that there is not a sufficient case for seeking a report along the lines suggested by the Senator.  Therefore, I am not accepting his recommendation.</p> <p>To return to the issue of additional corporation tax receipts which came in strongly this year, the Revenue Commissioners advise that they were due to increased economic activity.  Economic activity has increased substantially this year.  The Central Statistics Office figures published this morning indicate that the economy was growing at 7% for the first nine months of the year.  Obviously, an economy growing at a rate of 7% is generating a lot of tax.  In nominal terms, the economy is growing at a rate of almost 11%.  That is what drives the size of GDP and, to an extent, the buoyancy of tax receipts.  The other point to make is that the take from corporation tax is exaggerated.  Of all the taxes we have collected in the first 11 months of the year, corporation tax, even at an enhanced level, represents only 15% of the total tax take.  It is by no means the tax on which we are depending to fund expenditure programmes or tax reductions.  That said, it is very important and I am glad that there is an extra take coming in.  </p> <p>As well as the explanation from the Revenue Commissioners that there is increased economic activity, quantitative easing has brought down the value of the euro.  A lot of orders in FDI companies are denominated in US dollars; there is, therefore, a value advantage from quantitative easing which has helped Ireland more than other countries.  If the companies concerned are making more money, they pay more tax.  </p> <p>The statistics published this morning are very interesting.  They show an enormous level of investment in research and development.  When I started amending the corporation tax regime, I got rid of the so-called "double Irish" which was a residential rather than a tax law.  I was hoping some of the FDI companies operating here would bring their intellectual property onshore and there is evidence from this morning's statistics, with the huge increase in investment in research and development, that a lot of it is being brought onshore.  If it does come onshore, of course, it will be liable to Irish tax.  We attempted to close a loophole that was causing us reputational damage and one of the consequences seems to be an additional tax take as foreign companies, instead of having intellectual property on a Caribbean island, are headquartering in Ireland and basing their intellectual property here too.  Apart from the tax take, it also puts deeper roots under FDI companies because once serious research and development are conducted in Ireland, the base is more stable than previously.  </p> <p>We are looking at a good picture and I do not think we are going to be hit by some unexpected issue which will cause corporation taxes to fall away.  The Revenue Commissioners have advised that they can include all of the extra taxes in the base for next year, with the exception of around &euro;300 million, which relates to repayments due to some companies.  They are not suggesting to me there is any reason to be doubtful about the flow of corporation tax next year.  Of course, the increased flow above that forecast has continued for the past three months of the year, which means that the figure included in the 2016 Estimates on budget day has been exceeded already by the returns from corporation tax, but we are not going to change the figure.  This means that in the national accounts for 2016 we are actually showing a reduction in the yield from corporation tax on the figure for 2015.  I did not do this deliberately.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Michael Noonan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=821"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=821&amp;amp;pid=MichaelNoonan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This was the way the numbers ran because we never know in October how the year will end up.  It means that there is a tax buffer built in for the next Government.  If the same amount of tax comes in from the corporate side next year, there will be approximately &euro;525 million not assigned.  If there is any falling away, there will be a buffer which makes it easier to make ends meet.  We are in a good position.  The figures for this morning show 7% growth for the first nine months of this year.  That will probably come back a little bit for technical reasons.  In the last quarter of last year, there was very strong growth and because the base from which we will compare the last quarter of this year is so strong, we may come back to 6.5% or 6.6% for the year.  The budget figure was 6.2% and I am confident of not only reaching but exceeding that.  Many things are going well and we can only hope they continue.</p></speech>

I do not doubt anything the Minister has said about the figures he has presented, even in respect of growth, although many experts would say that our growth levels in respect of gross domestic product, GDP, or gross national product, GNP, are always a bit skewed because of the very high levels of foreign direct investment.  While the Minister says the Revenue Commissioners say it is sustainable and the spike has come because of the growth in the economy, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council is not exactly saying that.  Different views are being expressed.</p> <p>While I support foreign direct investment and what it means for the economy, we are entitled to ask questions about its sustainability because of what happened in the past, when we built our public finances around unsustainable tax receipts from construction or consumption or whatever it was.  People do not want to make the same mistakes again.  I am not suggesting that is what the Government is doing but questions can be asked about it.  I accept we have an investment fund set up by the Government but the recommendation is concerned with the potential of unexpected receipts, where they come from, whether they are one-off or long term or more sustainable.  The perception, whether true or not, is that multinational companies determine how much tax they pay.  There are many ways they can classify their corporation tax and so on.  People will ask what is the real agenda, is it really down to growth or are there other issues at play here.  The Minister spoke about the changes he made in the double Irish.  I welcome them too.  Is it possible to make any link between all of those issues and the spotlight put on this State in respect of corporation tax payments and the spike this year?  It is a reasonable question.</p> <p>If the Minister is not willing to consider establishing a sovereign wealth fund, is he saying that if the corporation tax was to increase further, there would be a possibility that some of that money could be used in the investment fund?  The difficulty is that we will work off the same figures as the Minister, in terms of the fiscal space over the next five years.  If there is a big jump next year in corporation tax, it will not alter the fiscal space very much.  That will determine how this State spends its money.  It is important, given that the economy is recovering and that so much investment was taken out of it in recent years, to reinvest in it.  The investment fund was set up for that purpose but the money has to come from somewhere.  If the Minister will not consider establishing a sovereign wealth fund because he already has an investment fund, is it possible that some of the corporation tax yield will be put into that investment fund? </p></speech>

That is what we should do in the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  That is why I am giving him as much information as I can, well beyond my briefing notes.  Approximately &euro;7 billion will be collected in corporation tax this year.  That is approximately &euro;3 billion more than estimated.  Of that &euro;3 billion, we spent approximately &euro;1 billion additional at the end of 2015 in Supplementary Estimates, a big chunk of it for health.  We also did county roads and replaced 30 or 40 Dublin Bus buses because the fleet was a bit clapped out.  There was stuff for the Garda and so on.  It was well within our capacity to pay for it and it was well within the expenditure benchmark.  That left another &euro;2 billion.  We cut the deficit with that.  Our obligation under the European rules was to get the deficit under 3% at the end of this year.  On budget day, I said we would go down to 2.1%.  We used some of the corporation tax that had come in at that stage to get down to 2.1%.  We used other taxes as well.  Now with the strong flow continuing to the end of the year, it looks as if the deficit will come in at 1.6% or 1.7%.  That has consequences for next year.</p> <p>Rather than putting money in some kind of investment fund, the priority is first of all to balance the budget and then get money to reduce the debt.  That can be done directly or indirectly.  As soon as we have a balanced budget and are running the country on what we collect in taxes, if additional funds come in, it opens up the possibility of investment and improving services.  There is no doubt that after seven years of recession, there is economic and social depletion of infrastructural assets.  The next phase of growth will have to be driven by investment.  The private sector is investing very heavily and that is shown in this morning&rsquo;s figures but the State has a role as well to invest in economic and social infrastructure.</p> <p>Assume we balance the budget by 2018, in 2020 and 2021, we will have a lot of leeway and additional income, which we can use.  My priority would be to improve the services but also to invest because if we do that we will keep the growth phase going.  I do not disagree with the Senator.  Putting in the fund might be an option in three years&rsquo; time.  If there is a lot of excess tax at that stage, it might be a good idea to go back to the kind of pension reserve fund that the former Minister, Mr. McCreevy, brought in.  It is too soon to do it now because if we are borrowing money on average at 3.5% or 4%, we would not get that return from an investment fund.  If we take it off our borrowings, we will get the money in.  That is the way I figure it out but everything has to be adjusted as new information comes in and as the annual cycle of budgets comes along.</p></speech>
