While no one wants to pre-empt what is in the budget today, I think it shows scant regard for the Oireachtas and the Parliament when one considers the level of kite flying in the newspapers today and yesterday.  Two editorials today seemed to predict authoritatively what will be read out at 2.30 p.m. and 3 p.m. today by the Ministers in the other House.  I am sure the Leader would agree that the Members of both Houses require a little more respect as the people's representatives than that which has been rolled out today.</p><p>We will have the opportunity this afternoon to comment on what is actually in the budget.  While one can appreciate, given that it is 1.10 p.m., that the budget has gone to the printers some time ago, I can only express the hope that the actual budget we hear is not as mean-spirited as has been suggested by the media.</p><p>No one envies the Ministers their task to try to save &euro;2.4 billion, but all parties in opposition have made suggestions on how they would put forward an alternative budget in this regard.  Some notable things jump out immediately, including the bereavement grant.  Surely it cannot be true that such a callous development would take place in terms of a savage cut such as this.  It was first introduced in 1999 to help people at their most vulnerable time, when a loved one has passed away, to deal with the significant costs of funerals, some &euro;3,000 on average outside Dublin and &euro;4,500 in Dublin.  It was brought in 1999 at about &euro;630.  At that time it cost &euro;25 billion to run the country every year.  Today, it costs &euro;52 billion or &euro;53 billion to run the country every year and we want to scrap the &euro;850 grant, which is the level it is at today.  Surely our priorities are wrong if this is what we are trying to do.</p></speech>

I thank the Leader for giving time this afternoon for statements on the budget.  I think that is appropriate and it is good to see we will be able to do that.</p><p>I renew my call on the Leader for a debate on universal health care and on the steps and progress that have been taken towards universal health care.  Certainly, it would be good to have this in the immediate aftermath of the budget announcement this afternoon.  It is likely that certain measures will be announced.</p> <p>I hope steps will be taken towards that objective and there certainly has been particular speculation - which remains just that at this point -  that free health care for the under-fives will be rolled out as part of that process of moving towards a system of universal health care for all and the abolition of the inequitable two-tier health system that has been perpetuated over many decades by successive Governments.  If that step is announced in the budget this afternoon, it would be an important progressive step towards universal health care.</p><p>Last week, I asked the Leader for a debate on this issue in the near future and I renew that call.  It also is important that Members have a debate on how best to help those hard-pressed families that are struggling, which the Minister, Deputy Howlin, has stated this budget will be designed to assist and support.  Members might consider this in the context of being obliged to make the adjustments that must be made, albeit that it is to be welcomed that the adjustments are of a much smaller order than the original amount of &euro;3.1 billion that was being put about and certainly initially was being sought by the troika.</p><p>I ask the Leader for a debate on a subject that is quite apart from the budget, namely, the constitutional reform proposed by the Constitutional Convention.  While I have asked previously for debates on the specific issues on which the convention has been reporting over the past few months, perhaps Members could have a debate broadly on constitutional reform in line with the recommendations of the convention and in anticipation that there will be a Constitution day next year on which a successive number of amendments will be put to the people by way of referendum on the issues the convention has been discussing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-10-15a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1136" speakername="David Norris" time="13:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013101500005#D00200"><p>I seek reassurance from the Leader that the people involved in the background construction of the budget were not those who got it so disastrously wrong regarding the figures appointed for what they thought the Senate cost, because they were way out.  In addition, the Government parroted some of the left-wing assertions that only 1% of the people had a vote in the Senate but as there are 200,000 people on the combined university register, this would mean there are 20 million people in this country.  The Government therefore first should set out to have a look for the missing 15 million people.  If this is the way the Government approaches things, I have no great confidence it will get the budget right.</p><p>Moreover, no matter what it contains, it is known there will be &euro;2.5 billion in cuts, which again will affect the most vulnerable.  There can be no rosy support for any of this because the real problem is with the major international financial institutions, the ratings agencies and the way in which the world economy is run.  This was all started off by the American system in which the ratings agencies were involved with the ratings of Enron and the dishonesty there, but the world financial situation still has not been addressed at all.</p><p>Across Europe, tens of thousands of ordinary European citizens are being evicted in Spain while in Portugal, people are starving and in Britain, people are being asked to deposit food parcels at supermarkets to feed the hungry.  In this country, there are soup kitchens, evictions and misery, as well as people taking their lives.  I recall a meeting held in the AV room of Leinster House at which garda&iacute; and nurses could not stop the tears flowing down their cheeks as they explained how they could not live and feed their children.  This morning, I heard people on the wireless talking about feeding their children by selling their clothes at car boot sales.  There is nothing here on which to congratulate oneself.  It is not enough simply to be the court jester of Angela Merkel.  The Germans take the view, &quot;We're all right Jack and hump the rest of you&quot;.  That is not European solidarity and the entire financial system must be addressed radically in the interests of the people.</p><p>I also seek reassurance from the Leader that, contrary to rumours in the media, the Senate will not be bypassed on certain social welfare votes through some trickery and machinations.  I hope this will not happen.  It was suggested it was because the Government feared a Labour Party revolt but so doing would be absolutely and utterly undemocratic.</p> <p> The suggestion has been made that Mr. Peter Sutherland should be invited to the House to engage in discussion with Senators.  If that happens, I hope I will be well enough to attend and give him a grilling.  He is somebody who has an awful lot to answer for, including his involvement in Goldman Sachs, his entirely incorrect blatherings about the economy-----</p></speech>

I welcome the Government statement of intent to broaden the Seanad electorate by including graduates of all third level institutions.  There is a need to examine the technical implications of that change, because it will create constituencies as large as those for elections to the European Parliament.  Having said that, the proposed change is not enough.  The Government also has the capacity, within legislation to effect that particular change, to democratise the electorate for the political panels.  We should put down amendments to that effect in this House.  We must fight not just on the university situation, but for the democratisation at the same time of the existing panels.</p></speech>

As unpalatable as those measures will be, I am glad the Minister has not succumbed to the austerity junkies - many of them members of my own party - who are unhappy with measures amounting to &euro;2.5 billion and instead wanted to take &euro;3.1 billion, &euro;3.5 billion or even &euro;4 billion.  The Minister has not been swayed by their argument, for which I am thankful.</p><p>I hope the budget includes some incentive to repatriate the &euro;100 billion that left this country when the banks were going down the tube, the majority of it to Germany at 0%.  Such an incentive would help to re-finance the banking sector so that it can resume lending and help businesses to get back on their feet.  That is the best way to get people back to work and, ultimately, to restore the economy.</p></speech>

We had a very useful discussion on that legislation in this House, but I am concerned that amendment No. 71 introduces draconian regulations in regard to public bus services.

My point is that it is important that we discuss these two issues separately.  Today might be a little soon for that, but the fact is that proposals regarding public bus services should not be included on page 60 of a Bill dealing with the regulation of the taxi industry.</p><p>There is an urgency about this issue.  The last time a similar proposal was put to the House, in 2009, the Bill in question was guillotined and sent to the then President, Mary McAleese, for immediate signature.  As a consequence, direct award contracts - as opposed to competitive tendering - were implemented for five years, with those contracts set to expire in 2014.  We must have an opportunity for a full debate on the future of public bus service provision, as opposed to discussing an amendment that is merely an appendage to unrelated legislative provisions.  The manner in which non-competitive awards of bus contracts were given out in 2009 was most unsatisfactory.  We are in danger of the same happening again and, moreover, it is being done in an underhand manner in an unrelated Bill.</p></speech>

They are also about creating efficiencies.</p> <p>Let us examine the medical budget for the ten-year period, 2000 to 2010, where the cost of drugs and pharmaceuticals went unchecked and rose from &euro;570 million to over &euro;1.9 billion per year.  Therefore, one of the things that the Minister is now trying to tackle is getting better value for money.</p><p>I am astonished by the misinformation in the media on the medical card issue so I shall outline the real figures.  Since we came to power in 2011, the number of new medical cards and GP cards issued is 253,000, as at 31 August 2013.  That means that 253,000 additional people have medical cards or GP-only cards.  If one adds the new figure that we are talking about today, the free GP service for under 5s, then nearly 500,000 additional people will have free access to GPs since we came into Government.  Instead people have focused on austerity.  Yes, some very difficult decisions have been taken but some very good decisions have also been taken----- </p></speech>

If he is not in a position to extend the time today then I ask that he agrees to roll over the debate until tomorrow or Thursday.  I want the debate extended because it is important that every Senator in the House, from all sides, who wishes to contribute has an opportunity to do so.  I do not believe that will be possible in the two hours and 15 minutes that has been provided.  The Leader should extend the debate by an hour which is not a big ask.  If he cannot do so then he should consider rolling it over until tomorrow or Thursday.  I genuinely believe that everybody who sits in the House should have an opportunity to have his or her say on the budget.</p><p>The Minister for Finance has said that the budget will be tough.  If all of the media leaks are true it will also be an unfair one, especially on young people who will again be asked to leave the country because that is what a cut means.  When one cuts the dole of young people one is taking opportunities away so the only option left open to them is to leave the country.  We are just short of the State and the Minister paying for the plane tickets.  The cut is a recipe for more emigration and that is in addition to the 300,000 people, mainly young people, qualified people and graduates, who have left the State over the past four years.</p><p>The budget will contain all sorts of cutbacks, hidden cuts plus more visible ones.  Therefore, it is incumbent on the Leader to make sure that we have a genuine debate on the budget, that we genuinely debate all of the propositions, proposals and cuts in the budget and that we have an opportunity to challenge the Minister on the cuts.  I do not believe that we will have the opportunity to do so given the short period set aside for the debate.  I respectfully ask the Leader to extend the time, by whatever way he sees fit, in a way that ensures that every Senator has an opportunity to speak. </p></speech>

This morning I heard about a report from Europe on the membership of boards, particularly the female membership of boards.</p> <p>There might be a necessity for some sort of incentive or for some measure to encourage boards to have a greater proportion of women on them.  I am not somebody who flies the gender equality flag and, traditionally, I was not a fan of quotas, but there clearly is a problem because only 15.8% of board members of the largest companies in the 27 EU member states are women.  Ireland is below average and the percentage is growing at a much slower rate than in other states, so it is clear some sort of intervention may be required.</p><p>In addition, there are many economic advantages.  According to a Credit Suisse report, which I read when researching this, companies with at least one woman on their board have outperformed the stocks of companies with no women on their boards by 26% over the past six years.  Women also control 70% of global consumer spending decisions, so there would be advantages to having boards mirror the market.  The European Commission is considering proposals to introduce gender quotas on boards of up to 40% by 2020.  While I am not a huge fan of gender quotas, we should certainly look at this area in an effort to improve our ratings.</p></speech>

Along with colleagues on all sides of the House over the years I could never understand why successive Governments did not act on the people's wishes.  It appears the "Yes" vote at that time to extend the franchise was over 90% and, signs on, there will not be a house in the country now that will not have at least one Seanad vote just on that panel alone, which will indicate a greater empathy with this House because people will have a stake in it.  I never understood why Governments did not do it but, on reflection, I came to the view that Governments generally chose to ignore this House and did not want to give it any power.  When I was asked why Governments would not give it, I believed Governments did not want to give this House any more power.  They were quite happy to allow it continue on the way it was.</p><p>In that context, because there seems to be some momentum in this area, I ask the Leader that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, CPP, would have as an agenda item the most recent report, the Mary O'Rourke report, any other report - there were discussions at the constitutional committee chaired by the late Brian Lenihan - and other relevant documentation, that it be brought together in a concise way and examined realistically in terms of what can be achieved rather than looking at the broader picture of what we would like to achieve.  I ask that the committee would then in turn bring those proposals to the floor of the House for a debate to ensure that Members on all sides of the House can make a contribution on the basis of the wisdom of those Members who sit on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I know it is in the gift of the Cathaoirleach, or perhaps the Leader, to set agenda items - I am not sure of the procedures - but it would be a useful contribution to the ongoing discussion about reform.  We do not have to opt for the grand design.  Great oaks from little acorns grow.  We could examine specific issues that could be introduced without any great upset to the political system.

Obviously, there will be some good measures and some tough measures in it but I am sure it is not lost on Senator Daly and others how times have changed in terms of the calm atmosphere in the House today.  Less than two and a half years ago our country was in crisis, our international reputation was in tatters and people were wondering if our banking system would survive.</p> <p>Today, we are well on the road to recovery.  Our finances are under control and, as Senator Brennan said, we are creating over 3,000 jobs per month.  The budget, which will be announced today, will be geared to strengthen our recovery and to secure our exit from the bailout.  We have a long way to go and, as other Senators have said, we need to concentrate more on job creation and accelerating its pace.  Will the Leader invite the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, to the House for a further discussion on the jobs plan and to give us a quarterly update, so that we can have an input into it and help the Minister and the Government in their efforts to accelerate the pace of job creation?  I share Senator Cullinane's concerns about the young people who are leaving our country.  I hope that by the time this Government leaves office we will see people begin to come back to Ireland to take up good and meaningful jobs in a country that will be well on the road to recovery, having survived the disastrous legacy of 14 years of a previous Administration.</p></speech>

That is a very welcome first step but much more has to be done.  None of us can be under any illusion that the people voted in the referendum on the abolition of the Seanad for minor tinkering or just to fix the issue with the university seats.  The people voted for real and significant reform of how this House is elected and how it does its business.  Anything short of that will be a sop and an insult to the electorate.</p><p>I call on the Leader to ensure that this House plays a leading role in driving forward the momentum for reform of the Seanad.  The Leader played a very strong role during the campaign which must have been politically and personally very difficult for him.  He represented us all very well and in a very dignified way.  It is essential for this House to ensure that the momentum for reform is pushed ahead.  Anyone to whom I spoke during the campaign wanted to see one citizen, one vote.  It is a positive move to extend the franchise to the other universities but how do we explain to people that somebody is entitled to a vote just because they have a higher standard of education?  It is a step forward to extend the vote to colleges such as Dublin City University but it is a snub to everybody else.  It is essential that this House push that process forward.</p><p>There are two Bills before the House, the Quinn-Zappone Bill and the Crown Bill.  I would like to see those proceed.  I am very concerned about the messages coming from the Taoiseach and other Ministers over the course of the past week because they seem to see the university seats as the only focus for major change and to think that everything else should be kicked into touch.  That is not necessary.  We can change the electoral system by legislation and we can do that straightaway.  I hope that, rather than rest on our laurels, we will respond to the real message that came from people during the course of the referendum campaign.  Let this House be the one that drives forward the real reform.</p></speech>

We had several opportunities to speak to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, coming up to the budget.  I hope he has taken several of our ideas on board because it was a great opportunity for us.  I hear that the newspapers today report, and I know that it is only a report, that people who spend money on their homes would receive a VAT refund.  I would be very happy to see those people get a VAT refund for refurbishing their homes.  It would be a good thing if that were extended to cover septic tank replacement and so on.  I have been calling for this for many months and years.  It would give a major boost to the construction sector.</p></speech>

As Senator Mooney said, one need only have listened to the "News at One" to hear almost the entire budget.  Surely there is a constitutional issue here.  It is not that many years ago when a Minister had to resign because an official of his sent a fax before the budget was announced.   That man is a senior Minister today, I am glad to say, but because of a mistake by an official in his Department he had to resign.  What has changed constitutionally between then and now when journalists have access to details of the budget before democratically elected Members have an opportunity to hear them at first hand from the Minister? </p><p>I join with Senator Terry Brennan in congratulating Wellman International in Mullagh, County Cavan on celebrating 40 years in that town yesterday.  The company employs 260 people in this rural part of County Cavan and has a &euro;5 million investment programme which over the next couple of years will see the numbers employed there grow.  I welcome too that 25% of the extra jobs created have been in the BMW region, particularly along the Border.  </p><p>I also join Senators Mooney and Power in welcoming the Taoiseach's comments regarding the democratic decision of the people in a referendum of 1979 that the franchise for the university sector of this House should be extended to all graduates while supporting the view that this is not acceptable as the only reform required in this House.  I reiterate Senator Mooney's call for the CPP to examine the O'Rourke all-party report and the legislation championed by Senators Quinn, Zappone and Crown.  This House must be proactive in taking initiative on reform, rather than have it foisted upon it by the Lower House.  </p></speech>

I hate to disagree with my colleagues on the other side of the House but this is significant reform because it is the only reform since 1937.  If it comes to pass, it will be a major step in the right direction.  Of course we would all like to see a lot more reform but let us take it incrementally, step by step.  At least we now know this House will survive, which we did not know some weeks ago.  Let us approach reform in the right way and in consultation with the various stakeholders, particularly the people.  </p><p>Today is a good day.  It is unlikely to be as dramatic as the previous two budgets since I became a Member of this House.  It will be a lot more steady.  My only concern relates to the matter of universal payments, which I think we need to move away from.  The idea of giving something to everybody under a particular age is not in my view going in the right direction or the direction in which I would like to see it go.  We must target our resources at those who need them most.  While it may be difficult to police and implement that approach, there are means by which it could be done.  I have long advocated that the budget process should be the summing up of a period of lengthy consultation within Parliament.  I credit the Leader for facilitating significant debates in the lead up to the budget this year and last year.  However, we need a more formalised structure which would involve both Houses whereby each proposed change would be debated and the Minister's Budget Statement would effectively be a summary of the decisions of the finance committee and Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  That seems to be what happens in other European countries and I would like to see it happen here.  </p> <p>I sincerely hope this political reform is included in the next programme for Government and is thereafter pursued, developed and implemented.</p></speech>

The focus in our discussion of today's budget must be on how we can get the economy back on an even keel, restore it to health and ensure it is competitive.  Otherwise, we will endanger our ability to compete and grow in the future.</p><p>  I received a letter this morning from an individual with whom I was in correspondence last year.  This person, who lives in Belgium, has a son studying here in Ireland.  He writes:<blockquote>He [the son] entered a new flat yesterday after learning about the reality of life during one month.  He got first into a flat where the day after paying the rental guarantee and first month's rental, he was told, as were all the others, by the owner that for an unforeseen reason, he [the owner] was moving and they had to empty the flat.  No document had been signed and the police refused helping, arguing they needed a lawyer.  It took some efforts to get the guy to refund the money and the next day, the rooms were back for rent on the Internet.  My son then had to go into a youth hostel.</blockquote>It is unacceptable that somebody can rent out a property, take rental money from students and then, because no lease has been signed, change his or her mind the following day and evict them.  I do not know whether new legislation is needed or if such matters are already covered in current legislation.  It seems an outrageous abuse of a landlord's position to treat tenants in that way.  I hope that by drawing attention to this particular case, we might be able to do something about it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-10-15a.110" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/958" speakername="Brian Hayes" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013101500014#N00300"><p>I welcome this opportunity to speak in the Seanad and to contribute to this debate on budget 2014.  Earlier today the Ministers, Deputies Noonan and Howlin, presented to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann the Government's third budget.  This is yet another milestone in repairing Ireland's public finances, supporting our emerging economic recovery and crucially a further step to exiting the EU-IMF programme at the end of this year and regaining our full economic sovereignty.</p><p>Much has already been done on repairing the public finances and we are now seeing the fruits of this.  On the basis of the measures outlined in the budget, we are likely to see a small primary surplus next year - in other words once debt-servicing costs are excluded, we are once again paying our way.</p> <p>Effectively, we will be taking in more tax than expenditure when one takes away the cost of paying the national debt.  This is a primary surplus and I gather this is the first time it has happened for some years.  It is a positive development because once that happens one begins to reduce the stockpile of national debt <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>GDP and that will be a major and important step along the road to recovery.</p><p> As I have stated before in the House, the budget is not only about consolidation.  This budget includes measures that will help to support and drive forward the economic revival of the country.  It is about building on the progress that we have seen this year in the economy, in the public finances and especially in the labour market.  Before turning to the specifics of the budget for next year, 2014, I will set out the economic and fiscal background that underpins the budgetary arithmetic.</p><p> This year, GDP is projected to increase at 0.2% over the year.  At first glance this may appear at odds with labour market data which have been strong in the opening part of the year.  As the Minister for Finance stated, we are creating jobs at a rate of approximately 3,000 per month.  This apparent puzzle is explained, at least in part, by the so-called patent cliff in the pharmaceutical sector.  Although the sector has been a large weight in GDP and exports, its share of employment is relatively low, meaning that the impact on the domestic economy is relatively contained.  Importantly, there are increasing signs of a stabilisation and indeed modest growth in domestic demand, in other words, in consumer spending and business investment.  This is in contrast to previous years when the growth was driven by the export sector.  This is encouraging because it is growth in domestic demand that people will more readily identify with, in other words, it is jobs-rich and as a consequence, it is more tax-rich as well.</p><p> For next year, the budget arithmetic is based on GDP growth of 2%, a figure in line with the prevailing consensus.  This is based on the assumption of a further albeit moderate improvement in domestic demand combined with a recovery in our exporting performance.  The rebound in exports is contingent upon a recovery in our key export markets.  The recent data in the United Kingdom, the USA and the euro area have been reasonably encouraging in this respect.</p><p> The competitiveness improvements that we continue to achieve will also stand to us.  According to the European Commission we will have seen a relative improvement in our unit labour costs of over 20% between 2009 and 2010.  This is significant.  Let us consider the unit labour costs throughout the eurozone economies as a whole.  I understand they have gone up by 8% in the course of the past three years.  In respect of our economy, because people are more productive and competitive and wage price inflation is not a problem, unit labour costs have gone down by almost 14%.  There are two important points to note in this regard.  First, it suggests we are producing more and we are more competitive and, as a consequence, this has led to a restructuring of the economy.  Second, from the point of view of IDA Ireland, which is trying to sell the country and get jobs to the country, the reduction in unit labour costs is a key determinant upon which businesses decide to locate in Ireland.  Not only has the consolidation been necessary, because we could not continue to borrow on the basis of the deficit, but it has had the greater macro effect of making Ireland a more attractive place to do business.  Often we do not give due cognisance to that fact in trying to sell the country to the foreign direct investment sector.</p><p> In the labour market, thankfully, employment is now increasing again after several difficult years.  Annual employment growth averaged 1.5%, the equivalent of 27,000 jobs in the first half of this year.  In the past 15 months the net new employment in private sector jobs has been 47,000.  This is significant and it is down to the strong exporting sector but also speaks to a rebounding of the domestic economy.  The fact that we have seen a net improvement in private sector jobs by approximately 47,000 is most encouraging.  The Pathways to Work initiative, spearheaded by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, has been significant in shaking out the labour market and ensuring that where opportunities exist, people will go back to work.</p> <p> I now will turn to the budgetary position and today's statements confirm Ireland remains on track to reduce the deficit to below 3% of gross domestic product, GDP, by 2014.  Next year, as the Minister, Deputy Noonan, has stated consistently, a deficit of 4.8% of GDP is being targeted, which is well within the 5.1% GDP ceiling imposed by the ECOFIN Council in December 2010 when Ireland entered the EU-IMF programme.  As the Minister outlined to the D&aacute;il earlier today, this target is based on consolidation of &euro;3.1 billion, comprising &euro;2.5 billion in tax and expenditure measures and a further saving of &euro;600 million in other areas.  As has been the case in recent budgets, the consolidation is concentrated on the expenditure side in order to underpin the emerging recovery in domestic demand and to support job creation.</p><p>I wish to highlight to colleagues two crucial developments.  First, as I alluded to earlier, the Government is targeting a primary budgetary surplus for next year.  This will be the first such surplus since the crisis in Ireland's public finances began and means that leaving aside interest costs, we finally will be paying our way again.  This is an important achievement and is due to the painstaking support and patience of the people.  Second, our gross debt-to-GDP ratio is set to peak this year at 124% of GDP, with net debt of less than 100% of GDP.  In respect of net debt, when talking about the amount we owe, we often forget the amount we have.  If one adds up the amount of money held within the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, - the Minister for Finance referred recently to the &euro;25 billion Ireland has in cash reserves - and when one takes out that amount, which is an asset, albeit one which is in a deposit account through the NTMA as a buffer to exit the programme, Ireland's debt-to-GDP ratio is approximately 100%.  This ratio is not all that dissimilar from virtually all eurozone economies, which have debt-to-GDP ratios of close to 100%.  Markets look at such indicators.  They watch closely the implications of a surplus and how Ireland is faring on the deficit.</p><p>It is also worth stressing there are significant cash reserves, which enhance our position as we approach the year ahead.  There is no point in leaving a programme only to go back into another programme shortly thereafter and as Ireland leaves this programme, it needs cash buffers within the NTMA that are evidently there.  The really important development this year in respect of the NTMA, as I am sure Members have noted, is that for the first time in six years, Ireland has got away a ten-year money bond.  Significant buffers have been built into the NTMA figures for next year and ultimately, I believe such things make a difference in ensuring the yield on Irish ten-year bond rates is reduced.  I believe the rate this morning was at 3.6%, which is a rate lower than that of Italy, Spain, Greece or Portugal.  This really is the test of creditworthiness, namely, where the market determines the cost of ten-year Irish debt to be.  As Ireland returns to the market in a more long-term and sustainable basis, keeping the interest rate low and the cost of Ireland's ten-year money will be extremely important.</p><p>I will now turn to the specific tax and spending measures contained in the budget.  Were I to choose three words to describe the objective of this budget, they simply would be jobs, jobs and jobs.  As the Minister outlined in his speech to the D&aacute;il earlier today, since taking office the Government has been looking at the economy sector by sector, building upon the strengths of those sectors that are doing well and repairing the damaged sectors.  The objective is to support businesses, to create jobs and to get people back to work.  For the tourism sector, the VAT rate has been reduced.  Moreover, a ten-point tax plan to support the SME sector was introduced last year, 20 measures were introduced to support the financial services industry and a number of initiatives have been introduced to support the property sector.  Taken together, all these measures are playing a significant part in the recovery in the jobs market, as is now evident.  The 2014 budget seeks to build on this with the introduction of 25 pro-business and pro-jobs measures, which on the tax side amount to more than &euro;500 million on a full-year costed basis.  For instance, the 9% VAT rate for the tourism sector is being continued, the air travel tax is being reduced to zero from April next year and a home renovation tax incentive scheme is being introduced to help the construction sector and, in particular, to help those who may be in the black economy at present to be fully compliant within the tax regime.</p> <p>To further underpin job creation, a number of measures under the Build your Business initiative are being introduced to support entrepreneurship, innovation and investment.</p><p>The small and medium-sized enterprise sector is the biggest employer in Ireland.  We need to build on this, and encourage people to set up their own businesses and to expand existing businesses.  Access to finance is crucial for the sector and the Government has been very proactive in this regard, with measures in the 25-point strategy designed to finance growth in the SME sector.</p><p>Protecting and creating employment is also at the heart of everything that we try to do.  Today my colleague, Deputy Howlin, announced that a further &euro;200 million in capital spending arising from the balance of the lottery licence proceeds - which we took to this House some months ago - will be used to support local economic activity and job creation.  The money will help to fund road maintenance and repairs, a new round of sports capital grants, the better energy programme, and housing adaptation grants for older people and those with a disability.</p><p>The Government is transforming the National Pensions Reserve Fund into the Ireland strategic investment fund, to invest on a commercial basis in projects in Ireland that support economic activity and employment.  The value of the NPRF discretionary portfolio at the end of June 2013 was &euro;6.4 billion.</p><p>Overall, the Government is reducing public spending in a balanced, strategic and responsible way.  Of course there must be reductions in spending but it is being done in a way that minimises the impact on the Irish people.  When one adds the capital and current expenditures as proposed for 2014, I think that the total consolidated amount is &euro;53 billion.  We are projecting that the total tax take for next year will be &euro;42 billion.  One does not have to be a mastermind to work out that the deficit problem has not gone away.  We still face a difficulty in terms of a fundamental distinction between tax and expenditure.  Even though we have bridged the gap - and we expect growth will fill the gap in a way that it did not this year - it is important to say that we still have a difficult budgetary situation that must be corrected.  For those on the hard left and hard right who argue that those in the troika should take away their money, were that to happen they would go and they would take away their money.  That would have meant that the adjustment would have happened overnight or over a two-year period.  Such a move would have left the country in an economic Armageddon and I do not think that anyone would have wanted that scenario.</p><p>Before concluding I want to take the opportunity to highlight some of the recent reforms of the budgetary process.  I know colleagues in the House have very forcibly spoken about reform in the past while.  In particular, as part of the improvements to economic governance at a European level, euro area member states are required to have their economic forecasts, upon which their budgets are based, endorsed by independent authorities.  The rationale behind this is to provide for greater transparency and ensure that budgets across the euro area member states are not based on optimistic or overly optimistic economic projections.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has been tasked with assessing the economic forecasts of the Department of Finance.  It concluded that the forecasts are &quot;within the range of appropriate projections&quot; for this year and next which Senators will see in the accompanying documentation.  I refer to a letter by Professor McHale and his colleagues at the end of the book that was published today by the Department of Finance.  </p><p>In addition, the Government has moved, in line with European arrangements, to an October budget which is important.  In recent years ongoing speculation mania started and ended in December that left people frightened to spend money.  Therefore, it is good that such mania is now over because now there is certainty on income and where we stand as we go into next year.  I hope the measure will help, particularly the Christmas market, to encourage people to spend the money that they have in terms of retail Ireland and the domestic economy.  </p><p>In conclusion, I want to highlight that the 2014 budget represents the penultimate step in bringing our deficit below the 3% GDP threshold.  We are consolidating the public finances while at the same time supporting jobs and growth and ensuring fairness.  We are all making substantial progress, especially our people.  The Government has renegotiated the bailout programme, achieved an extension to the maturities and a reduction in the interest rates on our European loans, as well as the replacement of promissory notes with Government bonds that will serve to reduce future financing needs and galvanize investor sentiment.  The Government has also reached agreement with the troika that half of the proceeds from the sale of State assets can be used for capital investment.  The minimum wage has been restored when we were told it would not happen.  Anglo Irish Bank has been liquidated.  We are creating jobs for the first time since 2007 and the measures outlined in the budget will build upon this recovery.  We are supporting important jobs-rich sectors of the economy as seen by the fact that we can continue with a 9% VAT rate for the hospitality industry.</p><p>The budget provides further clarity and certainty to the people of this country and addresses many of the most pressing issues facing the economy today.  It strikes the appropriate balance between repairing the budgetary situation on the one hand and supporting the recovery in domestic demand on the other.  As always I look forward to the constructive comments from Senators on all of these matters.</p></speech>

I am glad that he is here to listen to the points of the Members of this House.  It is regrettable, however, that his colleagues, Deputies Howlin and Noonan, left their stations before listening to the entirety of the  Opposition's lead spokespeople.  That is unfortunate and does not augur well for the cognisance by Government of the points that may be made.

It was an insult in the extreme to the shadow spokespeople in that regard.</p><p>I welcome some of the measures in the budget such as those for renovating homes, making homes greener and those kinds of points that have been included in order to get people working and encourage people to spend on necessary works on their homes.  The measures will be of help and will create employment, which is welcome.</p><p>Obviously I do not welcome many measures contained in the budget.  I appreciate that is difficult to find consensus on cuts but, in any respect, it is hard to find two people to reach agreement.  One wonders how any Cabinet can manage to do so.  That said, I must speak in terms of my interpretation of the budget.  I am baffled as to why we consistently ignore people who earn over &euro;100,000.  The people that I know in that income category were conditioned last year to take a hit of a few per cent and they were conditioned this year to take a hit of a few per cent.  That measure would have easily cancelled out some of the more mean-spirited measures in this budget.  I say that not just to score political points.  I refer to the bereavement grant which I mentioned on the Order of Business, plus the fact that cuts were leaked throughout the newspapers.  Indeed, most of the budget was leaked in the media today.  I ask the Minister of State to convey upwards that leaks are disrespectful to the Houses of Oireachtas.  I do not think there was a measure of surprise in today's speech by either Minister. </p><p>A bereavement grant of &euro;630 was introduced in 1999 when the cost of running the country was &euro;25 billion.  I understand that the grant is now at the substantially higher rate of &euro;850.  Today the grant is being cut completely when the cost of running the country is &euro;52 billion but the average funeral cost is &euro;3,000 outside Dublin and &euro;4,500 inside Dublin.  Such a measure is mean-spirited and kicks in &euro;40 million.  Would such a cut have been missed by the category of people earning over &euro;100,000 who were conditioned to expect a percentage cut?  Yes, it would hurt that income category to pay an extra 3% or whatever but they would be better placed to shoulder an additional burden than most other people.</p><p>With regard to the telephone allowance, how much will be saved?  We are talking about a minor enough amount considering the impact it has on the lives of elderly people.</p><p>There have been changes in terms of eligibility to the medical card. </p> <p>In recent weeks, Members on all sides of this House have highlighted consistently that while the greater number of people have medical cards, the Government is homing in on people in their 70s and 80s.  They are receiving forms in the post telling them to fill out this or that and are losing their medical cards, which is creating a serious and difficult situation for them.  Moreover, in the case of those suffering from chronic diseases, on first entering office the Minister, Deputy Reilly, indicated he would deal with this issue by legislating for the provision of medical cards.  As this legislation never transpired, are Members to believe the same will be the case for the medical cards for the under-fives for which legislation is required?  Members have been told the chronic diseases could not be provided for in legislation because of difficulties.  Will it be the same for the under-fives?  As for the reaction of the general practitioners, GPs, to it, there has been no engagement with them.  This does not surprise me because another aspect of the budget for which there was no engagement concerns the assistance to those who are unemployed and wish to start up their own business but I will revert to that in a moment.  One wonders how this proposal will be carried.  Last year, I mentioned how, when in opposition, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, asked what the then Minister, Brian Lenihan, had against the third child.  In the other House, the question was asked as to what this Minister has against young mothers.  This is of critical importance, on foot of the taking effect of additional taxation earlier this year, which now has been followed by an overall reduction in maternity benefit.  There certainly seems to be an issue in this regard.  To return to the issue of discretionary medical cards, no clinical panel has yet been put in place in this regard.  The only panel I can discern to be in place regarding the interpretation of people's eligibility for discretionary cards is that of the bottom line and of saving money.  Unless people meet the financial criteria, they will be off the list.  Before the Government rushes into the provision of free GP care to the children of the Michael O'Learys of the country, perhaps it should focus on those who have chronic multiple sclerosis, cancer or other serious chronic diseases.  What is this clinical panel doing and is it in place?  Who is on the panel and how and to what criteria are they operating?  Perhaps consideration should have been given to such questions.</p><p>When looking through the various booklets handed to Members as the budget speeches were being read out, one sees the headline amounts of savings that were confusing and one in particular jumped out at me.  The Minister of State has mentioned specifically additional expenditure pertaining to road maintenance and repairs involving shovel-ready projects and getting people back to work.  However, if one looks under the transport section of the speech by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, it states there would be savings of &euro;50 million this year in respect of the National Roads Authority and road surfacing.  How can one save &euro;50 million on road surfacing on the one hand while, on the other, there will be additional expenditure?  Everyone is in favour of more sports capital programmes, particularly in the run-in to an election.  There will be a big hurray from all the counsellors nationwide in that regard.  Moreover, the better energy programme also is to be welcomed.  However, if the Government was seeking to give respite to people directly into their homes, how could it so do to every single home in the country?  Nothing has been done with the price of petrol.  The cost per litre is approximately 69 cent and the amount the Government adds on to that amounts to 130% of the cost.  In the case of an average family with a mileage of 12,000 miles per year and an average consumption rate of 30 miles per gallon, that costs &euro;240 per month.</p><p>If the Government intended to give something back directly to each family in the home, why could such a measure not be considered?  Instead, it has come up with ridiculous job activation measures in which it is telling the unemployed that if they are long-term unemployed and if by some fluke of reality they set up a business that manages to make money in the first two years, the Government will give them that money tax-free.  I know a little about business and can tell anyone in this Chamber who knows anything about it that one may as well tell the national lottery to announce the first person to come in with both parents who are older than 105 years can have the winning lottery numbers.  I predict confidently that no one will qualify for that scheme.  Whatever civil servant is responsible knows only the inside of a Department and knows nothing about business.  This is window-dressing in the extreme that will do nothing for anyone.  As for young people and the cuts to social welfare, what does one really wish to do to get people out there?  The Government is making it more difficult for them to get into internships.  If they have been out of third level education for a year having already completed a level 5 course, they will not be allowed back in again.  All these measures are designed in some way to look less harsh but, in reality, will not apply to anyone in practice.  That is my difficulty with these measures.  On getting enterprise going again, I would love to see the creation of an Industrial Credit Company-type financial institution.  It should be given &euro;200 million, 20 good underwriters should be picked and they should be set to work.  People should be encouraged to borrow money, to set up business and fail thrice but succeed once.  That is what is needed, not some harebrained design of a scheme for which no one can apply, because that is what the aforementioned &euro;40,000 a year tax-free scheme is.</p><p>While I appreciate the Ministers have done their best in a difficult environment and on the basis that I admit everyone would have a different approach and a different set of cuts he or she would make, I believe a number of these measures are extremely superficial.  A number of measures needlessly are far too harsh and yet the Government continues to ignore those who are best heeled, that is, those earning more than &euro;100,000, in terms of them taking a bigger hit.  They would not flood out of the country and specifically, were they told that an additional 4% to 6% was needed from them for five years to help to look after the relative security and health of the least well-off, the elderly and the infirm, those people would respond.  I believe they were conditioned to respond to such a request in last year's budget as well as this one.  I only hope this can be effected through the forthcoming legislation to back up these budgetary measures.</p></speech>

Listening to Senator MacSharry, it is somewhat akin to picking a football team in that no one would pick the same team or the same slew of cuts and expenditure changes.  However, one point that gets lost on each budget day concerns the actual headline figures.  According to the explanatory booklet from the Department of Finance, the deficit for this calendar year is &euro;12 billion.  In other words, we will have spent &euro;1 billion more each month then we have taken in.  The deficit for next year will be &euro;9.8 billion or 5.8%.  These are the real figures and they simply cannot be ignored regardless of one's desire to so do or whether the troika is present.  That is completely irrelevant because even if the troika is not present, the markets will be.  According to the budget for 2014, the State next year will collect &euro;42 billion in revenue and as I stated a moment ago, will spend more than &euro;51 billion.  If one considers the tax items, the biggest category is income tax at almost &euro;17 billion, which is coming from those were working.  The next biggest tax item is VAT at &euro;11 billion, which comes from everyone.  Excise duty will raise &euro;4.8 billion and then corporation tax will yield &euro;4.4 billion.  The latter, in conjunction with income tax, VAT and the excise duty, make up &euro;38 billion of the &euro;42 billion that will be collected.  Those four large big-ticket items alone will do so and this simply cannot be ignored.  On the expenditure side, the two biggest areas of expenditure are social welfare and health.  Again, there are no circumstances in which those areas can be left to spend such quantities of money without being affected.  However, the other figure that has been left out to an extent in today's conversation is the interest on the national debt, which is projected to be almost &euro;9 billion for 2014.  It is an absolutely huge amount, which is approaching what is being collected in VAT and is more than is being collected in excise duty and corporation tax.  This is the reality of our current position.  As to how we got there and while I am not trying to be political about this, in 2010, the previous Government ran a deficit of 30%.  A banana republic would not run a deficit of 30% and the comparative analysis of the Fiscal Advisory Council of the position before the crash and our present status shows that each citizen of this country now owes more than &euro;30,000 more than was the case in 2008.  This does not include what was owed at that time but amounts to an additional &euro;30,000 per head.</p><p>Specifically within the budget, I greatly welcome the retention of the 9% VAT rate for the hospitality sector.  However, I have a concern in this regard and as the Minister of State is aware, I always raise such concerns.  In this case, Senator Darragh O'Brien also voiced this concern at the time of the rate's introduction.</p> <p>The 0.6% levy on the pensions sector paid for the retention of the 9% VAT rate, and that was agreed.  It was agreed that it would conclude in 2014 but there appears to be some confusion about that.  There is a 0.15% levy from 2015 but a concern I have is that a temporary tax measure becomes a permanent tax measure on far too many occasions.  The 0.6% levy will end in 2015 but it will be at 0.6% plus 0.15% for 2014.  If that is the case, that is not a clever way of doing this business.  We were itemised worldwide.  We were one of the few countries ever to put our hands into the pension pot and take money out.  I have a concern about that and I hope the Minister of State will address it for me.</p><p>I welcome that the Minister will do the analysis in terms of the agrifood sector because it is an area that is jobs rich, in particular in the dairy sector.  The arable sector is not as jobs rich as it once was because the machinery is so capable of getting over ground but the dairy sector is an area that is labour intensive.  I am hopeful that we can channel the funds towards where the jobs are located in the agrisector.</p><p>The home renovation tax incentive is very welcome.  There is an enormous black market in that area and it is getting bigger year on year.</p><p>On the corporation tax rate of 12.5%, I have posed the question: if we raise it a small amount would it scare the horses?  That will not happen but something the Minister addressed in his statement earlier that is very important is our reputation.  We have suffered reputational damage internationally because of the United States congressional hearings and because of some of our European partners who tend to be somewhat belligerent about our 12.5% tax rate.  </p><p>It is important to note also that the Minister is moving towards the analysis of the stateless companies and that something will be done in that regard.  We cannot do it on our own but it must be done on a global basis.  It is important to put on the record of the Seanad that the US Securities and Exchange Commission has closed its review of Apple's tax filing for 2012 and it has found nothing improper about Apple's disclosures and policies.  It has adhered to US laws and in terms of international laws, and it is something we should note.  I welcome that the Minister is moving to deal with that.</p><p>On the two year income tax break for the unemployed, I disagree with Senator MacSharry.  If people are given the opportunity to earn money by way of a two year tax break and they are not prepared to take that up, they will never do so.</p><p>The national debt peaking at 124% of GDP is a real concern.  It is one of the highest internationally in western Europe.  The Minister addressed the question of the National Pensions Reserve Fund having significant moneys on account.  That must be taken into consideration.  The levy on the banks is welcome.</p><p>I welcome the excise on the old reliables - cigarettes, wine and beer - but with a caveat.  It is an issue I pushed the Minister on, in particular with regard to the supermarket trade for off-licence beers in particular.  The Minister informed us that the one euro levy on a bottle of wine brought in &euro;45 million in extra income.  That is to be welcomed.  If somebody wants to buy a bottle of wine the extra euro will not stop them doing that.  In the same way, if a euro is put on a six pack of beer, on the 24 pack carry-out it is an extra four euro raised by way of taxation.  I know there are difficulties in this area.  A case in the Scottish jurisdiction that has gone to the European Court of Justice is yet to be determined but we should have been inventive in that regard.  The lid tax could have been considered in that there was a prospect of taxing an unopened vessel, whether it is a tin or a bottle.</p><p>I welcome the &euro;200 million stimulus from the sale of the licence for the national lottery.  I do not see anybody here from the Department of Finance and I am wondering to whom I am making this request.</p></speech>

Of that &euro;200 million I am hopeful, before the ink is dry on anything, that instead of it simply going for X, Y and Z as we have itemised we should initiate a number of pilot projects both in urban and rural Ireland in terms of towns and villages that over-developed.  The developers are bankrupt and are in NAMA but NAMA does not or will not provide the funds, whichever is the case.  In conjunction with funding from NAMA we could advance a number of those pilot projects to show the people in those areas that have been over-developed without the correct services, including footpaths and street lighting, that the local authorities do not have the funding to put in place.  If we put a pilot project in place we could put a larger scheme in place from that.  That would show the people living in poorly developed areas that the State will intervene.  I ask the Minister that this be considered for the future as well as allocating a few million euro to the pilot project.</p></speech>

I will premise my statement by underscoring the importance of addressing today's budgetary measures and fiscal adjustment, the sixth in line of extremely difficult budgets since 2008, and the context of their cumulative impact since this is the reality of the way they are being experienced by people.</p><p>As a Senator this is the third time I have made a statement on the budget and it is safe to say, and no doubt the feeling is shared by many members of the public, that my sense of disillusionment and powerlessness has been compounded on each occasion.  It is a sense that nothing has changed about the way we do our business.  I welcome what the Minister said about the European aspect but as far as we do our business, I do not believe anything has changed.  </p><p>I have said on numerous occasions in previous statements on the budget and in response to various social welfare provisions that Ireland, while on the road to recovery, is still in serious financial difficulty and money must be saved and generated but how this money is saved, be it from cuts to existing provisions and services or exploring alternative revenue-generating measures such as tax increases and against whom the cuts are made, are ultimately political decisions.  There is a strong public perception that the decision has been made to persistently target vulnerable groups and re-hit already stretched and hard-pressed families.  </p><p>Accusations have been made that such decisions are made with political capital considerations in mind.  There is a certain class of people that have remained largely unscathed by successive budgets.  They are young employed individuals without children and without a mortgage.  Effectively, that grouping has remained unscathed.  I have spoken with many of those people in the course of my work and I have heard time and again that they are willing to shoulder their share of the burden more fairly.  After each budget they are grateful they did not get hit.</p><p>I believe it is a mark of a decent and humane society to ensure that those with the lowest income and least resources are protected from further cuts.  I recall when dealing in April 2012 with the impact of the provisions on lone parents in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2012 feeling that anything I had to say was futile since the relevant decisions had already been made.  It almost felt disingenuous to be kicking up a fuss knowing that whatever I said, nothing would change but I spoke to the groups advocating for lone parents on the ground and they convinced me of the importance of ensuring that their voices, and the voices of their constituents, made it on to the record.</p> <p>The voices of civil society organisations and NGOs on the ground, which witness the impact of the decisions and cuts we debate in these Chambers, must be heard.  We need to reconsider our mechanism leading up to the budget, to have a greater engagement with those organisations and not have a showpiece hearing where the relevant decision makers are not present.  This is also why I feel so strongly about the move to restrict the access of the NGOs to the AV room to have political briefings.  We need to be very careful about our decisions.  We should not close off or close down dialogue and open ourselves to accusations that political decisions are being made in a vacuum.</p><p>Moving to today's budget, I very much welcome the decisions made, particularly in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and the additional funding of &euro;6.7 million in 2014 to reform child protection.  I know that money will go to the new child and family agency.  It is really positive that it is being moved into the Vote of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  I am very concerned at the talk that the new agency will start with a deficit.  The agency will be taken out of the HSE and created, and there is talk of transferring a deficit.  That will be regressive and I will watch it closely.</p><p>I welcome the implementation of the preschool quality agenda for which there is funding of &euro;4.5 million.  Additional inspectors will be recruited.  There should be nationwide coverage.  I wholeheartedly endorse the idea of a preschool mentoring service.  We need mentoring in that sector to bring quality up to a consistent level and not to see more scenes such as those we saw in the &quot;Prime Time&quot; programme entitled Breach of Trust.  We need to support staff training.</p><p>I also welcome the initiatives to tackle child poverty at a local area level.  A cut of &euro;3 million in youth work funding was projected for 2014, and we are supposed to heave a sigh of relief that it is only &euro;2 million.  This sector has been disproportionately cut.  We know that for every &euro;1 the State invests in youth work it saves &euro;2.22 in the long run.  Youth work organisations around the country are under huge pressure.  The youth council proposed the introduction of a 1% social responsibility levy on drinks manufacturers.  I notice in the budget that &euro;145 million is saved in the excise duty added to alcohol.  Why can youth workers not receive some of that additional money?  They do not take funding from drinks companies.  All too often we hear it said of the sports organisations &quot;Oh dear, they cannot afford to let go of the drink sponsorship&quot;.  Youth organisations say &quot;No&quot; to drinks companies because of the ethos of their organisations.  They work with young people, as do the sports organisations.  Youth organisations say &quot;No&quot; and I do not see why a measure like that cannot be found for them.  I welcome and note the increase in tax on tobacco.</p><p>If one is in the 18 to 25 year age category one had no hand in creating the situation in which we now find ourselves yet there is a disproportionate reduction in the jobseeker's allowance.  That is very tough on young people.  Yes, they should be encouraged into education and training but the reality is that the places are not available for them. </p></speech>

There is an urban-rural divide.  I hear all too often that young people are being forced back into the family home.  Once again, there is a geographical lottery.</p><p>On the tax exemption for starting one's own business, does someone need to wait to be unemployed for over 15 months?  We know most businesses do not make money in the first two years.  I wonder what this measure solves.</p><p>It is great that the &euro;14 million youth guarantee has been announced.  I am however a little concerned about the figures and I will study this more closely.  It seems very low.  Much of this is based on the Swedish model but the Swedes estimated that it would cost &euro;6,600 per participant.  They estimate that it will cost &euro;273 million to implement in Ireland, based on their figures.  That is phased over several years but &euro;14 million seems very low, given that we need to spend it before we recoup it from the EU.  While it seems like a large sum it is too low to implement the youth guarantee as it is envisaged-----</p></speech>

What children will lose out?  In the<i> Irish Examiner</i> there is a very good case study profiling some of the cases that have lost out.  It is excellent to have a rights-based approach to introducing the free GP card and they should not be confused with one another.  I am concerned about this and I am hearing these concerns from parents around the country.  I welcome the grant for the protection of the homeless.  </p><p>  I am concerned about the tax credit for the one-parent family.

After successive years of taking money out of this economy this is the last of the austerity budgets.  This Government has made a commitment on that point.  I believe that we are at a turning point in the history of this country.  The T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Gilmore, said recently, "We are now creating 3,000 new jobs every month, the economy is seeing modest but all-important growth, our national finances are largely back on track, Irish exports have now exceeded even their pre-crisis levels and we are about to successfully exit an EU/IMF bailout." </p></speech>

It is important to me that this time next year, Fine Gael and the Labour Party are engaging in discussions on social democratic politics, for example, versus the politics of Fine Gael and its spending priorities, rather than dancing to the tune of the troika.</p><p>The bottom line is that we had a challenge in this budget to protect the most vulnerable while continuing to grow the Irish economy.  It was a difficult balancing act.  How would we take out &euro;2.5 billion without damaging modest growth?  How can we facilitate a return to the markets?  How do we ensure we do not hurt people who are most in need?  It was a difficult challenge, but the budget has succeeded in achieving that balance.</p><p>I have not heard mention thus far - it is something we are inclined to forget - that there was a major discussion as to whether the adjustment should be &euro;3.1 billion or &euro;2.5 billion.

I particularly welcome the decision not to impose any cuts on the budget for services for homeless people.</p><p>I also welcome the inclusion of incentives for the construction sector.  We have gone from an economy in which 20% of GNP came from that sector to a situation where the figure is now between 6% and 7%.  One in four people formerly working in the construction sector is on the dole.  In that context, the incentives to which I referred represent some of the most progressive measures included in the budget.</p><p>I very much welcome the commitment to engage with private investment in the area of the provision of services for the homeless.  I also welcome the initiative on VAT credit, which will be available to people who engage in home improvements.  This budget recognises, for the first time, that we are facing a housing supply issue.  The commitment that NAMA will find 4,500 additional units in the Dublin region, which is on the cusp of a serious housing crisis, is welcome.</p><p>As a social democrat, there are issues I would like to see addressed in the next budget.  I am concerned, for example, that the levels of capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax were not raised.  It is very unfair that somebody who works an additional hour in a supermarket pays a higher rate of tax than a person who inherits wealth, for instance, or profits through speculation on the stock exchange.  The tax system must be more progressive and I look forward to measures in that regard in future budgets.</p><p>A measure that seems to have gone largely unnoticed is the provision relating to survivors of the Magdalen laundries.  The decision by the Government not to tax the payments to those women will be welcomed by all.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-10-15a.170" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013101500021#U01800"><p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, and thank him for his speech.  The first point to make is that we are making progress.  The situation remains difficult, however, and we are relying on luck that the 0.2% growth to which the Minister referred will increase to 2% next year.  There are many imponderables, including what will happen in the United States and the rest of the European Union.  We certainly require a degree of good fortune.</p><p>Some 1.7 million people are in receipt of medical cards on income grounds, of whom 540,000 were granted cards in the past five years.  I would not have chosen to extend the medical card to all children aged under five regardless of their parents' income in a situation where 1.7 million have been shown by means testing to require them.  This particular provision gives cause for concern.  As the Brennan commission reported, the extension of medical cards to over 70s some years ago was expected to benefit 39,000 people at a projected annual cost of &euro;19 million.  As we know, however, it ended up applying to 77,000 people and costing &euro;51 million.  Perhaps the costs have been more carefully calculated in the case of universal provision for the under fives, but we all know that when one reduces the price of something to zero, the demand is bound to be greater.  In addition, GPs are saying that the Government has not engaged in negotiations with them on implementing the new system.  In the case of the over 70s, even very wealthy older people were eligible to avail of the scheme.  It is a shame we have taken the same tack once again.  When we engage in social expenditure, it should be biased towards those who are objectively in a state of need.  In this instance, all children under five would not have been my target group.</p><p>I heard Se&aacute;n Whelan on the radio earlier today pointing out that &euro;3.1 billion will be realised by the interest reductions plus the &euro;2.5 billion adjustment set out in the budget.  If Mr. Whelan is making that statement on the airwaves, it is good news for the Government in that the &euro;3.1 billion target has been reached.</p><p>I welcome the abolition of the air travel tax and the retention of the 9% VAT rate for the tourism sector.  The Department of Finance must ensure there is joined-up thinking in this area.  The remaining obstacle to attracting tourists back into this country arises out of the decision to increase airport charges by 44% when the new terminal at Dublin Airport opened.  In fact, the previous Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport overruled the regulator on that occasion - the Commission for Aviation Regulation was effectively rendered useless - by insisting the charges be increased to recoup the cost of the new terminal.  I hope the airlines will enter into the spirit of this - including Ryanair, which is the largest.  I commend the Government on its efforts in the area of tourism.</p><p>The budget makes provision for an increase in the DIRT rate to 41%.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, said recently that he was somewhat annoyed that the banks had intervened to reduce the rate of interest paid on post office deposits on the basis of there being unfair competition.  I took that issue up with representatives of the banks at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.  Surely an organisation like An Post, which is solvent, should be able to pass on some reward to its savers, compared with those banks which are insolvent and made the country insolvent.  A 41% rate of DIRT comes on top of the virtually non-existent interest rates being paid by the banks.  The post office would like to pay more, and the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, would like to see it paying more.  As it stands, we are cleaning out savers with the reduction in interest rates and the imposition of DIRT at 41%.</p><p>The pension levy has been up and down, rising to 0.75% but with the promise it will reduce to 0.15%.  The stamp duty on financial institutions will probably be passed on-----</p></speech>

I hope the Government's strategy works.</p> <p> I welcome the comprehensive review of expenditure and am of the view that this must be maintained.  I also welcome the cap on health insurance contributions.  When the Minister of State brought the Finance Act before the House, we raised with him the fact that the Milliman report shows that people in Ireland spend up to 11.6 days in hospital for treatment whereas the average length of stay internationally is 3.7 days.  As a result, the tax break must be removed.  I hope that Pat McLoughlin, who is investigating this matter, will submit his report soon and that it will be debated in the House.  I am of the view that we have been funding an excessively expensive health insurance system and that there should have been much more competition than has been the case.</p><p>I welcome the review of the capital investment programme.  It is welcome that growth has returned and that an additional 33,800 jobs have been created in the private sector.  I suspect much of this is due to the degree to which wages have fallen during the recession.</p></speech>

It would be a welcome development if the money saved from reducing the relevant rate could be spent on education or training.  That would be better than just paying people to turn up on a Tuesday or whenever to sign on.  I accept that it might sound harsh but perhaps the worst thing we can do to young people is give them a payment for doing nothing.  Perhaps the money saved might be channelled into areas in which we can develop their skills, etc., in order to that they will be ready when the economy takes off again.</p><p>I have referred to the Minister of State's contribution and I will now comment on the Minister for Finance's contribution in the D&aacute;il.  The investigation into the tax reliefs and incentives for agriculture and agrifood is a good proposition.  Many of the subsidies and tax breaks in question are capitalised in higher land prices and this makes it more difficult for young people to become involved in agriculture.  I look forward to what the review might have to say in this regard.</p><p>On tackling stateless companies in the context of corporation tax on profits, I support the retention of our 12.5% rate but we must ensure that people pay it.  The existence here of companies that are stateless for tax purposes caused Ireland damage when the relevant congressional hearings took place in America.  I am glad the Minister, Deputy Noonan, is tackling this problem.</p><p>I was glad to discover that a number of houses in Monaghan sold for &euro;30,000 each recently.  NAMA should dispose of more assets because that is how we will get the cost base down and encourage the kind of growth in jobs to which the Minister of State referred.</p><p>On procurement and the need to make savings, the House will discuss amendments made to the Taxi Regulation Bill 2012 by the D&aacute;il.  I do not know why buses are being dealt with in the context of that legislation, which contains a provision relating to the retention of monopolistic routes and direct-award contracts rather than competitive tendering.  The whole concept behind what is being done in this budget is that there should be competition in respect of procurement.  However, some Departments are not listening and what is contained at the tail end of the Taxi Regulation Bill is something of which the Minister of State should be aware.  He should encourage the Department of Finance to hound the relevant individuals in order to discover how the relevant provision got through.  There must be competitive tendering and there cannot be monopolies.  As part of legislation relating to taxi regulation, the bus monopoly could be preserved for a further five years.  I do not believe anyone wants that.  We want value for money.  I support the Minister of State in this regard.</p></speech>

I stated earlier that the atmosphere around the Houses today has been much calmer than in previous years.  This is due to the fact that the Government has gradually and slowly brought the country back from the brink.  Today's budget builds on the positivity we have seen in the past year, during which 34,000 new jobs have been created.  The public finances are on target and there is economic growth for the first time in several years.  As the Minister for Finance stated in the D&aacute;il, we are on the cusp of exiting the bailout, regaining our economic sovereignty and returning to the markets.  However, as previous speakers noted, we have a long way to go before we reach a position where our expenditure will equal our income on an ongoing basis.</p><p>The budget is designed to create growth in the economy and to get people back to work.  I welcome the introduction of a tax package of &euro;500 million and of 25 new measures to support entrepreneurs and SMEs.  One of the headline items in the budget relates to the fact that the VAT rate for the tourism and hospitality sector will remain at 9%.  The Minister's move to reduce the rate to this level last year gave rise to the creation of in the region of 15,000 jobs.  There is a real commitment on the part of those in the tourism and hospitality sector to acknowledge the fact that the rate will remain at 9%.  In that context, we can build on the work achieved as part of The Gathering and other initiatives during the past year.  I welcome the investment of &euro;8 million in the Wild Atlantic Way tourism route.  I also welcome the abolition of the 10% travel tax.  It is probably no coincidence that almost immediately after the announcement of the latter, Ryanair indicated it will be making available 13,000 new seats on aircraft flying on routes between Knock international airport and London during the remainder of this year and in early 2014.  I hope this will lead to many more English visitors coming to Ireland during the winter months.</p></speech>

The Minister has taken this initiative as a result of prompts he received from many Members of this House.  The economy will never return to stability until there is a certain level of activity in the construction sector.  The initiative to which I refer will encourage many homeowners to carry out improvements.  It will also create a significant level of employment for tax compliant builders and tradesmen and allow legitimate operators to compete.  I hope this will lead to the shadow economy being taken out as a result.  The Minister's initiative will create an opportunity for tradesmen such as carpenters, blocklayers, plasterers, etc., to come together and pool their resources and operate successful businesses.  Some people who emigrated in recent times may return to Ireland as a result of this initiative.  I am informed that there is a scarcity of tradespeople in the building sector at present.  I am aware of one or two individuals who have indicated that they may return from Australia in order to avail of possible opportunities in the construction sector.</p><p>I welcome the Living City initiative, which is being extended to all properties built prior to 1913.  This initiative is being extended to my home county, Galway.  I also welcome the Build Your Business initiative, which is designed to promote entrepreneurship and support SMEs.  I particularly welcome the two-year income tax exemption for long-term unemployed people who start their own businesses.  Some of those in the construction sector will slot nicely into this initiative.  The increase in the VAT receipt threshold to &euro;2 million will be of benefit, as will the improvements to the research and development tax credit.</p><p>There are some good initiatives in the budget in the context of creating employment.  The budget also strikes a balance and I welcome the fact that headline social welfare payments and pensions are being protected for the third consecutive year.  There will be no cuts to child benefit this year and I welcome the introduction of free GP care for those under five years of age.  Families that are under pressure to pay medical expenses and bills will welcome the latter.  I also welcome the fact that there will be no change to the fuel allowance.  In addition, there will be no increase in income tax or the universal social charge, USC, for people at work.  I welcome the additional &euro;20 million being allocated in respect of mental health services.</p></speech>

That is stupid.  I welcomed it at the time it was introduced and it has worked.  I remind the Deputy that other initiatives were paid for by the pension levy - there were other elements of it.  This measure worked but others did not.  That aspect is certainly to be welcomed and there is no question about it.</p><p>The removal of the travel tax is also a welcome measure.  The home renovation initiative is to be welcomed.  Many of us proposed its introduction over a number of years, even during the term of the previous Government, pointing out that it would help to reduce the number of people operating in the black market.  All those measures are to be welcomed.</p><p>In reality, this budget was never going to be an easy one.

It is irrelevant in government.  It has not been able to bring forward any measure whatsoever.  It has had to stand over another &euro;113 million worth of medical card cuts - these are called "medical card reviews" or, as the Civil Service has said, "probity reviews on medical cards".  This at a time when it has already presided over 22,500 people - some 400 people a week - losing discretionary medical cards.  It has presided over further reducing the income thresholds for the over 70s for medical cards.  The rug has been taken from under the medical cards for the over 70s.</p><p>I was interested in points made by Senator Hayden.  Reference has been made to her track record on housing, which is admirable, and I often listen to her speak.  It was interesting to hear Senator Mullins mention the measure announced in this regard and welcome it, but Senator Hayden said nothing about it.

That is pathetic.</p><p>The telephone allowance is being abolished with the Government having taken more than &euro;26 per month from people.  That is real income for old age pensioners.  For pensioners who are solely dependent on their old age pension or for those who may have also some small residual pensions, that is a big deal.  Let us be honest about that and not say it is not a big deal when it is.</p><p>The abolition of the bereavement grant is also a big deal.  What Senator Hayden, others and the Labour Party obviously want is for people having buried a loved one to go straight down to the community welfare officer and show them their receipts, what they paid for paid for the coffin, and point out what their income is.  It is ridiculous that the grant is being abolished for a saving of &euro;17 million.  It makes no sense because there were alternatives.</p></speech>

Fine Gael has been strong in its record over the years on protecting the wealthy and the privileged in society.  The Government has done that again.  Fine Gael was the party that said that would be not be any income tax increases.  The Labour Party barked like a poodle last year about the application of an additional 3% universal social charge levy to incomes over &euro;100,000.    We believe that should have been done; it should have been done this year.  Those who can afford to pay should pay and in that way the Government would not have to remove the telephone allowance from an 85 year old widow or remove the bereavement grant.  These are choices that the Government is making.</p></speech>

I put it to the Minister of State that there is a bomb waiting to go off in the Department of Health.  It is all over the place and all of those in the Government know it.  I refer to the fact that there are &euro;600 million to &euro;700 million in additional cuts which the Minister for Health cannot deliver and he has had to bring in the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and every other Minister on this.  It is a bomb waiting to go off.  The &euro;113 million savings on foot of the discretionary medical cards that will be taken off people next year and the additional &euro;25 million worth of medical cards that will be taken off the over 70s will come back and bite the Government big time.  The Minister of State should not come in here and say this budget is fair.  It is not fair.  The last two budgets the Government introduced were seen as the most regressive, unfair budgets of the last six.  That is what the ESRI said.  This budget is incredibly unfair.  The Government could have gone after people who had money but it did not because Fine Gael protects the wealthy and the privileged and the Labour Party do not have the guts or gumption to stick that to them and to make sure they protect the people that they supposedly serve.</p></speech>

When I say "difficult" I mean it has been difficult for the people of Ireland.  Some &euro;31 billion has been taken out of the economy since 2008.  That has been a staggering blow to our people but it has been met with fortitude and resilience.  People have endured austerity but, unlike what many people will try and say here, austerity is not a policy.  It is a necessity after the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government, of which my two friends were members, drove this economy on to the rocks and destroyed it.  Therefore, what could we do but only try to retrieve an almost hopeless situation.  I remember when we came in here first and were informed of exactly how bad the situation was I, for one, was shocked to my core at how bad a state the economy was in.  Addressing that necessitated raising taxes, cutting services and all sorts of other awful measures.  With this budget, the deficit is now approaching 4.8%, down, as my colleague Senator Michael D'Arcy said, from over 30% when we came into government.</p><p>It is worth repeating that Fianna F&aacute;il left the public finances 30% in deficit.  Senator Michael D'Arcy described it charitably as banana republic politics.  That is what it was.  How did we recuse it?  It has been done with the greatest of difficulty.  The Opposition said at the time that it could not be done.  People made great sacrifices to achieve it and we must be conscious of that.  We must also be conscious that further difficulties lie ahead.  We can say, and I believe we can be confident in doing so, that the worst is over, that next year's budget will be one devised by ourselves when we will have the control of our economy and our destiny in our hands.  My personal opinion is that Fianna F&aacute;il people who drove this country onto the rocks should never again be let near the reigns of power or government.</p></speech>

I believe that nobody would argue that young people are not better off being in education, training or employment.  There has been an extension, unfortunately, of the &euro;100 reduced jobseeker's allowance to new entrants below the age of 24.  Over a full year that will would probably affect up to 40,000 people.</p> <p>We have to look at this in the context of the &euro;46 million that is being put into the youth guarantee and the extension of the back to education funding.  This is a good thing in that context.  No parent would want to see his or her children signing on the dole.  Members of Sinn F&eacute;in are probably the only people who might want to see that because they might get some electoral advantage from it.  I say that on the basis of what we constantly hear from Sinn F&eacute;in.  We are more ambitious for our young people.  The provision of youth guarantee schemes that will encourage them to go back to education or back to work is the way to go forward here.</p><p>Most of the scaremongering with regard to health has been led by Fianna F&aacute;il, which is very good at it.  Fianna F&aacute;il's power base is based mainly on the idea that it can deliver goodies to constituents regardless of whether they are entitled to them.  It is no wonder that Fianna F&aacute;il is screeching the loudest about our decision to make a structural change in the qualification and eligibility criteria for medical cards.</p></speech>

This Government believes this measure will cost &euro;37 million.  When Fianna F&aacute;il extended medical cards to those over the age of 70, it was a blatant attempt to buy votes without doing any mathematics.  As the Senator suggested, this was wrong.</p><p>I suppose I should not have said so much about Fianna F&aacute;il because I have run out of time.  It is necessary to kill certain ideas, such as the idea that the bereavement grant has been reduced.  Senator MacSharry said that the grant is &euro;4,500 in Dublin.  He does not know what he is talking about.  The bereavement grant is &euro;850.  Senator Byrne and everyone else in this Chamber who has dealt with this matter will have seen that the money needed in these circumstances is better and easier accessed as an exceptional needs payment.  Like Senator Hayden, I have seen this done in my constituency.  The structural change that is being made is to be welcomed.</p></speech>

I welcome his words as well.  We were not sure what was going to happen in this budget.  There was a great deal of talk in recent weeks, but we were not sure where it was going to go.</p><p>I must say I was concerned when I heard the Minister, Deputy Noonan, speaking about creating jobs.  I have a real fear when Governments feel they should create jobs.  I am delighted that the Minister for Finance is not emphasising that particular area and is instead speaking about allowing businesses and entrepreneurs to create jobs.  When the Minister, Deputy Howlin, mentioned creating jobs, it seemed to me that he was talking about public service jobs.  I am not sure that is right.</p><p>I welcome the extension of the 9% VAT rate that applies to tourism.  I have heard that Ryanair has already reacted positively to the decision to reduce air travel tax to 0%.  The home renovation scheme is certainly worthwhile and is to be recommended.  The same thing applies to the so-called build your business initiative.</p><p>I have a concern about the 41% rate that now applies to DIRT and pensions.  It seems wrong that someone who has worked the whole way through and saved their money or put it into a pension now has to pay the 41% rate, compared with a rate of 23% five or six years ago.</p><p>I think the exemption that will apply to self-employed people who start their own businesses should mirror the corporation tax exemption.  It seems that one will need to have been unemployed for 15 months to avail of this scheme.  Why not incentivise people who are currently working, rather than just the unemployed, to start new businesses?</p><p>I believe there are many good things in this budget.  Our main aim has to be to get people working again.  Rather than relying on the Government to do that, we must ensure we get people working through the creation of jobs by businesses and entrepreneurs.  I think employment is certainly going in the right direction.  I congratulate the Minister on the steps he has taken in that area.</p><p>I would like to speak about foreign direct investment.  A genuine question must be asked about whether the Government has blinked in relation to multinationals and international tax avoidance.  I can understand why the Minister has said that, in the future, companies will have to be resident in some jurisdiction instead of using various jurisdictions to be stateless, but I hope this step does not act as a disincentive and does not result in companies that might have engaged in foreign direct investment here deciding to go somewhere else.</p></speech>

I think we are just piddling around here, in a way, because if America goes over the cliff on Thursday, we are all banjaxed anyway.  The entire international financial system is rotten.  As I said on the Order of Business this morning, tens of thousands of people in Spain are being forcibly evicted, people in Portugal are starving and people in England are collecting food in supermarkets to feed the hungry.  I have railed about the conditions in this country for a long time.  The screw is turning and turning.</p><p>  It is interesting that the Government apparently wants to discuss a salt tax.  There are rumours around the place.  Certain economists have been discussing the possibility.  The French Revolution started after such a tax, the <i>gabelle</i>, was introduced.  It was the last straw that broke the peasant's back.  The peasants revolted.  I am waiting for that to happen all over Europe.  I do not think there is any equity at all.</p><p>  I would like to discuss the cut of &euro;20 in the long-term unemployment payment.  How are people in such circumstances supposed to be able to access education?  If everybody is satisfied, why am I getting heartbreaking letters and e-mails all the time?  F&Aacute;S apprentices are being asked to contribute, but how can they do so?  I just do not understand it.</p><p>  Who is making the decisions with regard to medical cards?  I do not believe they are being made very often on medical grounds.  I do not think I should get a medical card because I have a good income and I am comfortable now.  I have cancer and I will be 70 very shortly.  I approve of means testing.  I do not think people like me should get a medical card.  I am not bothered about that.  It is important that the means test is set at a level that ensures the vulnerable are protected.</p><p>  The decision that has been made with regard to the death grant is a howl.  They tax the bejaysus out of one while one is alive.  When one kicks the bucket, they give one a present of &euro;800 to thank one for doing the decent thing and sparing the economy.  I am not interested in that.  I will pay for my own funeral.</p><p>  I wish to mention an initiative that might be expensive but would help to create jobs.  Perhaps the Government might have the courage to introduce social protection for people who create jobs.  I refer to the self-employed and to employers in small businesses who look after their employees.  The employees get benefits, but the poor unfortunate people who go bankrupt get nothing.  That really needs to be looked at.</p><p>  I have referred to part of the brief I have for pre-budget submissions.  I apologise to all the organisations.  I will work in my own way when these issues come up.  It would be impossible to list them in two and a half minutes.  I hope some of the points I have made will strike home.  It is a global situation.  There is no real European solidarity.  An opinion poll has shown that the Germans are saying &quot;great for Angela Merkel, we are okay, and hump the begrudgers&quot;.  I ask the Minister of State to think about protecting those who give jobs and create employment.  They need to be brought in and encouraged.  They will have the courage to start a job if they know they will be protected if they lose that job.</p></speech>

As I said in this House earlier today, 34,000 jobs have been created over the past year.  I am glad that job creation is the priority in this budget.  This budget confirms the Government's commitment to job creation.  I welcome the decision not to change the weekly fuel allowance rates.  I am glad that no income tax or universal social charge increases are provided for in this budget.  I am particularly pleased that the 9% VAT rate that applies to the tourism and hospitality sector is to be retained.  As we are all aware, some 15,000 jobs have been created in this sector in the last two years.  The retention of the 9% VAT rate will ensure further job increases in this sector.</p> <p>The incentive of up to &euro;4,000 for renovation and maintenance work is to be applauded.  Many homeowners will welcome this initiative.  The build your own business initiative to promote entrepreneurship and support SMEs, including those who encourage unemployed people with ideas to start their own business, is to be applauded.  </p><p>In respect of the award of the national lottery licence for a figure in excess of &euro;400 million, I welcome the announcement that &euro;200 million of this dividend will be ring-fenced to ensure the construction of the long-awaited national children's hospital and that a further &euro;200 million in capital spending arising from the balance of the proceeds will be used to support local economic activity and job creation.  A sum of &euro;200 million will be invested in 2014 and will include the continuation of a new round of sports capital grants.  As we all know, many clubs, sporting organisations and communities throughout this island have benefited from these grants in recent years, which have improved sports facilities and dressing rooms for the benefit of all.  </p><p>I welcome the housing adaptation grants for older people and people with disabilities.  This wonderful initiative will help to revitalise the building industry.  I note that &euro;10 million will be provided for an unfinished housing estate resolution initiative and this is to be welcomed in every county with unfinished estates.</p><p>As I stated earlier, job creation is and will continue to be the top priority for this Government.  I am glad to state and others have referred to the fact that the unemployment rate is now down from 15.1% last year to 13.3% this year.  This Government will continue to invest in the people who through no fault of their own find themselves out of work.  We are continuing on the right road.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-10-15a.223" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1155" speakername="Kathryn Reilly" time="15:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013101500025#Y00200"><p>I am glad Senator Gilroy mentioned that he is ambitious for our young people.  I am also glad that when we held the EU Presidency, we championed the youth guarantee and that it was agreed under the watch of our Ministers.  As an EU member state with one of the highest rates of young people not in employment, education or training, it is fitting that we would lead the charge to help young people.  However, I found that once the parades were over and July came and following the fanfare, the press conferences, the ministerial meetings and the passing of the mantel, we dropped the ball spectacularly through what was announced by the Minister today.</p><p>The Minister for Finance opened his speech with a quote from a poem by W. B. Yeats so I will do the same.  I know I have used this quote a number of times.  Yeats mentioned that this is &quot;no country for old men&quot; but this budget proves that it is no country for young men or women.  Some of the rhetoric that has been uttered in the past couple of months relating to youth unemployment and the youth guarantee makes it look like Ministers and the Government have been talking out of both sides of their mouths.   We heard about the need for a well-resourced guarantee, that young people are our future and that youth unemployment was such a plague on our society and our economy that we need to address it urgently.  The talk was of giving young people their say and their independence and preventing emigration, the loss of skills and talent and a lost generation.  We spent the past six months talking the talk on the youth guarantee and youth unemployment but when it came to walking the walk, the Government fell over the boots it has become too big for. </p><p>What made my stomach lurch more than anything earlier was when I heard that the allocation for the youth guarantee was only &euro;14 million.  Only a number of months ago, Senators in this Chamber and Deputies in the other House welcomed the report I produced on the youth guarantee.  It was a cross-party report built on consensus and input from youth organisations.  We called for the Swedish model of the youth guarantee to be followed.  That would have involved the allocation of &euro;6,600 per participant, as Senator van Turnhout referred to earlier, but what did we do?  As I already mentioned, we championed this guarantee.  Yet, we allocated &euro;260.22 per young person officially unemployed.  Those quarterly national household survey figures are relatively conservative and do not take into account young people who are not engaged with the public employment services.</p><p>Why is it that a person aged between 18 and 25 years can vote, pay taxes, contribute to society in other ways and be held responsible for their actions but are treated completely differently to someone who is ten, 20 or 30 years their senior when it comes to being impoverished and in trouble?  This is discrimination in its most blatant guise.  The Minister of State with responsibility for trade and development, Deputy Costello, was right when he said of the Social Welfare Bill of 2010, which contained cuts to jobseeker's allowance for young people, that: &quot;A whole generation of young people are being shunned by the Government of their country.  They are being told that they are a burden and not wanted.  They must leave the country or live in dire poverty&quot;.  Who thought a Labour Minister would perpetuate this policy of age discrimination introduced first by Fianna F&aacute;il and slash jobseeker's allowance for young people again?  The Minister for Social Protection was right when she asked, &quot;What else has austerity done?  It has brought the return of the emigrant aeroplane&quot;.  It is a good thing the air travel tax was cut today because the emigrant aeroplane is back again and this Government has made sure that those who can afford to leave will do so while those who cannot afford to leave - we must remember that emigration is not open to everyone - will live in poverty.</p><p>In September 2013, the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Gilmore, made a promise to young people across the State.  He said that the generation that did so little to create this crisis should not be the ones to pay the highest price.  Today, just over a month later, a Labour Minister has done the complete opposite.  He has not only punished young people for a crisis they did not create but has ensured that the only guarantee this Government will give to young people is emigration.  Today is a bad day for Fine Gael and Labour, for the country and for young people.</p></speech>

I rebut Senator Reilly who said that today is not a good day for our young people.  I beg to differ.  As spokesperson for education, I will focus on ten positive points for education we have got out of the budget today.  The first one is the biggest criterion people look for in education, namely, the pupil-teacher ratio.  That is being preserved.  There will be no increase in the pupil-teacher ratio in either primary, post-primary or fee-paying schools.</p></speech>

This is significant and good news for our young people who are the people we need to value most.  Two thirds of those jobs will preserve class sizes and ensure that class sizes are kept down.  The other third will be for resource teaching.  The fact that &euro;1.3 billion will be protected for supports for children with special educational needs and that an additional &euro;33 million will also go into this budget is fantastic.  This is great news for our children.</p><p>The spending on the overhaul of the junior certificate, which was &euro;1.4 million, will be increased to &euro;4.8 million in 2014.  Again, it comes back to comments made by Senator Darragh O'Brien earlier.  It is very easy to be in Opposition and to slam and take everything out.  One must acknowledge the good points that are there and allow Senators time to speak.  The money that will be put into the roll-out of the junior certificate reform is good news.  Senator Darragh O'Brien said earlier that the Labour Party is inconsequential and has done nothing.  One must look at the work done by the Minister for Education and Skills in the field of education which must broadly be welcomed by everybody, especially in view of how far-reaching it is.  I know from going into and teaching in schools that they acknowledge the work that is going on.  </p><p>A total of &euro;9 million will be available to continue rolling out numeracy and literacy initiatives.</p> <p>It is good news that &euro;15 million will be allocated over the next three years for book rental schemes for all primary school children.  The roll-out of high speed broadband will continue so that all our schools have access to it.  That is another good move by this Government.</p></speech>

I disagree with Senator Darragh O'Brien's suggestion that the Labour Party has no presence in Government.  A Labour Party Minister managed to reduced the cuts in the social welfare budget from &euro;440 million to &euro;290 million, of which &euro;220 million will affect recipients.  A Labour Party Minister found other ways of making cuts to social welfare.  A Labour Party Minister came up with the provision whereby an insurance company will deduct the amount it pays to a claimant if social welfare has already been paid out.  Is the Minister for Social Protection not right to go after the insurance companies to ensure they compensate her Department for the money it paid to a claimant who has paid his or her insurance?  Why have we waited so many years to come up with this measure?  It should have been introduced years ago.  The Labour Party has had an impact in Government and we will continue to do so.  One cannot remove &euro;220 million from the social welfare budget without pain and unsavoury decisions.  I hope, however, we will get this country back on track so that we can revisit these areas in due course.</p></speech>

The social welfare rate of &euro;100 has been extended to recipients up to the age of 25 but the Government is investing more in job activation, education and training than it is taking out.  The intention is to get our youth activated.  We must change the attitude of employers towards youth so that they are not tasked with copying figures from one sheet to another.  They have a lot to offer.</p></speech>

It is also clear that one of the major spending Departments, the Department of Health, does not have a clue about what is going on.  The Labour Party should investigate what is happening before it attempts to deny that assertion.  Many of the children who will receive the under-five GP card will in the process lose their medical cards because the overall cuts to medical cards are far greater than the allocation for GP cards.  The Senators opposite shook their heads two years ago when I warned them about small school class sizes because they did not look at the details.  That is still happening.</p></speech>

The people who are entitled to medical cards are getting them.  When the changes announced in this budget are introduced, over 500,000 more people will have medical cards or GP cards.  We are managing to do that despite our current financial difficulties because we are getting better value for money for what we deliver.</p></speech>

That is the reality.  If Senator Byrne comes along to next Thursday's meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children he will get further clarification on the matter.</p> <p> I welcome the proposals on jobs.  It is important that we encourage businesses and people to take the risk.  The two-year income tax exemption for people who start up their own businesses is welcome.  Capital gains tax relief affects people who are prepared to put their money where there mouth is and do something instead of just talking about what should be done.  We should encourage such people.</p><p>The health innovation hub is important for my city and county, as nine of the world's ten top pharmaceutical companies are based within 50 miles of University College Cork.  Funding for that hub is vital.  Eli Lilly, Schering-Plough, Pfizer and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson are outstanding companies and employers and we must encourage their research and innovation.  This part of the budget is welcome.  Support is also being provided to Science Foundation Ireland, which plays an important role in developing new projects and research.</p><p>The IDA's target is to create 12,000 jobs in the next 12 months.  Enterprise Ireland's target is also 12,000 jobs.  The budget's provisions on the building industry will undoubtedly create more than 10,000 jobs in the next 12 months.  This is welcome.  The budget is concerned with the creation of jobs, through which there will be a lesser demand placed on social welfare and taxes will be accrued to support the services needed for the less well-off, including health services that can continue to be improved.</p><p>I welcome this budget.  It is well planned, well developed and well delivered.</p></speech>

I shared two minutes with him during our Private Members' business involving a section 37 Bill, which was also a first.</p><p>I join with Senator Darragh O'Brien in welcoming elements of the budget, including the retention of the 9% VAT rate.  The rate has been a lifeline for tourism businesses and will more than pay its way in supporting job growth.  The home improvement scheme is a positive initiative.  As Senator Moran pointed out, the cuts to education were not as bad as we had anticipated.  However, pupil-teacher ratio increases in smaller schools will come into effect in the next school year, but the expectation of harsher cuts has not been realised.  This is welcome and is a direct response to the campaign that was mounted by parents and groups during the summer to highlight the importance of education to this country's future in social terms and in terms of getting our economy back on track.</p></speech>

However, it must be noted that one sector that has been badly hit by the budget is that of further education.  Last year, the Minister stated that there would be a one-off funding reduction of &euro;25 million.  Today, he announced that last year's guarantee did not count, as the sector is getting hit for &euro;25 million again.  From the Estimates it is clear that the overall reduction is much greater, given the difference of &euro;62 million for higher education between this and last year.  The &euro;25 million accounts for some of that reduction, as does the &euro;18.5 million in the increased student service charge and the savings to be gained from the Haddington Road agreement.  Some people from the higher education sector have asked me to check whether the Minister can offer an assurance that an increase in the core grant is not hidden in the Estimates.  It is unclear from the numbers.  The Minister for Education and Skills has not provided the details.  As it is there is a great deal of concern in the further education sector about how it is meant to maintain quality and compete internationally when its budget has been reduced so much in the past three years.</p><p>One group that has been hit hard in recent years is people under the age of 25 years.  I mentioned the increase in the student service charge.  Despite the Labour Party's pre-election promises, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, will have presided over a doubling in that charge if the Government runs its course.  It was &euro;1,500 when he entered into office and will be &euro;3,000 in 2015.  This increase has hit low-income families hard, those who are just over the threshold for the grant and must pay for that education themselves.</p><p>Postgraduate grants have been completely removed, meaning that people from poorer backgrounds are no longer able to access postgraduate courses.  This is one of the most scandalous cuts, yet it has not received as much attention as it deserves.  It has deprived people of a necessary opportunity, given the increase in the standard of education among people competing for jobs.  When the Minister of State and I left college, the standard was an undergraduate course.  Now, people are expected to have postgraduate qualifications.  It is unfair that this standard has been put beyond the reach of many young people.</p><p>Senators referred to the cut in jobseeker's support for people aged under 25 years.  When it was first cut for younger people, I viewed it as a positive initiative, as it is not right that an 18 year old should walk in and be put straight on the dole.  Some are brought in by their parents and are members of families in which there is generational dependence on social welfare.  They are brought down to their dole offices on their 18th birthdays and told to sign on as if that was their future.  This should not be our expectation for our young people regardless of what area of the country they are from.</p><p>However, there is a significant difference between such people and someone who is 25 years of age, may have already been in college for six or seven years, may have a high level of education and cannot find a job.  The rate of youth unemployment is at least 30%.  This is the official figure and does not account for unemployment.  The reality is that one in two young people who finish college cannot get a job.  The Minister referred to back to education, but that is a lower level of education than many of these people have already attained.  The Minister of State can reply in his five minutes.</p><p>The youth guarantee-----</p></speech>

He or she probably would not qualify due to being above the educational threshold.  This provision has not been thought through.  The number of places being offered under the youth guarantee is only a fraction of those who will need it.  This is clear from the figures that have been published today.  There are 2,000 people on the education side, a few more in JobBridge and other schemes, etc.  The upper age threshold is unfair.  I ask that this issue be examined.</p></speech>

I welcome the budget in general.  All of the vibes so far have been positive, especially from the point of view of agriculture.  There is good news for the suckler welfare scheme, which will now be called the genomics scheme, under which &euro;60 will be paid for every calf that is born from 2014 onwards.  The old suckler welfare scheme has left the scene.  Farmers were worried that the sector would be undermined by a lack of confidence.  The new scheme is a positive measure.</p><p>The disadvantaged areas scheme is crucial in my part of the country in the west.  It has been in place since the early 1970s.  In 2009, &euro;1,000 was taken out of it.  Thankfully, the scheme is being maintained this year and there has been no further cut.  This will give vital confidence to farming families that depend on the scheme to maintain their incomes.</p><p>The sheep grasslands scheme will provide &euro;1,000 to people who undertake training and discussion groups with Teagasc.  They will gain a great deal of expertise.</p><p>Younger farmers who have been trained and are taking over or inheriting land from older farmers will be charged no stamp duty.</p> <p>That is very positive.  We want to see a cohort of younger farmers coming through the system.  Now that our agricolleges are full we will have more educated farmers.  It is important we support them and ensure they get off on the right footing.  This will drive the economy.  The possibilities in terms of the agrisector are massive.  Currently, 300,000 people are employed in the sector, which is also growing at the rate of 12,000 to 14,000 jobs per annum.  This boost will provide additional confidence.  Taken in conjunction with the CAP reforms which will kick-in in 2015, the future for the sector is exciting and positive.  </p><p>I cannot let this opportunity pass without welcoming the additional investment in the Wild Atlantic Way, which is a tourism project along the west coast.  Another positive initiative is the retention of the 9% VAT rate, in respect of which I have received many positive calls.  I welcome today's budget, which is positive.  I am delighted to be here to share this news with the House.</p></speech>

The families who have borne the brunt of the past six austerity budgets had hoped that the Government would put more money back in their pockets, thereby giving them a break and enabling them to pay their mortgages and bills and provide for their children.  Unfortunately, not only have the vast majority of these families not been given a break or had money put back in their pockets, the Government has taken more out of their pockets.</p><p>Regardless of how many times Senators, including from the Labour Party and Fine Gael, say this is a good budget, the reality is different.  The devil is always in the detail.  Let us look at what, according to Labour Party Senators, is good and great in this budget.  Prescriptions charges have been increased from &euro;1.50 to &euro;2.50.  Is that good and great?  The telephone allowance for elderly people has been abolished.  Is that good and great?  The bereavement grant has been abolished.</p></speech>

Are they not prepared to listen to people?  Can they not sit and listen and show some respect for speakers?  Do they have to continually interrupt?  I understand the Labour Party is on the floor and that in terms of this tough budget it has again sold out to Fine Gael.  Please listen and do not continue to interrupt when other people are speaking.</p><p>Jobseeker's benefit for those under 24 years of age has been cut.  Is that good and great?  How is that good for young people?  What hope is there for those whose benefits have been cut?  Perhaps some of the Senators opposite or, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, would explain the logic of targeting those young people.  When Fianna F&aacute;il reduced jobseeker's benefit, Fine Gael and the Labour Party opposed it.  The only logic for that cut is that the Government wants to force more young people to emigrate.  Perhaps it is because the Government believes this group are people who will not fight back or stand up for themselves that they have been targeted.  The Minister of State, might explain the logic of that cut, which I cannot understand.</p><p>I do not believe this budget is fair.  Independent analysis carried out by a range of organisations and agencies shows that the previous two budgets introduced by this Government were the most unequal, even more unequal than previous Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party and Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats' budgets.  This Government has not stood by working or young people.  It has not given people hope.  There is nothing in this budget which indicates this Government is serious about job creation or reducing unemployment and emigration.  In my view, it is more pain for people at the bottom.  While there has not been an increase of even one cent in income tax for those earning over &euro;100,000, &euro;200,000 or &euro;300,000, for an elderly person dependent on the household benefit package the telephone allowance has been cut and for a young person jobseeker's benefit has been cut.  It is shameful that Members opposite can stand over this and that the Government has again missed an opportunity to introduce a fair budget.</p></speech>

I know it is difficult to respond so quickly after the speeches in the other House have concluded.  Many of the issues raised will be clarified over the course of the next few days.</p><p>On the assertion that one party in government has sold out to the other, that is not how I see it.  This is a national Government of the two largest parties in the State, who have come together in a moment of economic crisis.  This is the third of five budgets the Government hopes to present to the Houses.  The Government is made up of the centre left and centre right, representing a broad spectrum of opinion in this country.  Despite all of the difficulties faced by the Government since taking office, I am proud of some of the things we have managed to do, in particular as mentioned by Senator Moran, the retention of the current pupil-teacher ratio.  We now have more teachers in our schools than was the case last year and the year before that.  This is an example of the fairness which this Government has put at the centre of its policy platform.  We stand over the following: that we managed to re-establish the national minimum wage, which was previously abolished by Fianna F&aacute;il; the exemption of 320,000 people from payment of the universal social charge and the charge on private patients, which contributes to the cost of public patient care in our public hospitals; and the taxing of people at the high end in terms of pensions cover.  All of this illustrates that fairness is at the heart of Government's decision making.</p><p>I accept the most recent budgets have been difficult, in particular the VAT increases.  However, it is logical.  When the crash occurred, Ireland was spending approximately &euro;50 billion per annum.  In 2008-09 the tax yield was only &euro;34 billion, leaving an enormous chasm of &euro;16 billion.  It was inevitable, even for the previous Government, that the first necessary step was to increase tax and reduce expenditure.  The truth is that the totality of budgets introduced thus far by the Government have been broadly progressive.  The view of the OECD, which has no axe to grind one way or the other, is that of the 36 member states of the OECD, Ireland has the third most progressive taxation system.  The European Commission has stated that of the four countries currently in a programme, Ireland's adjustment programme by way of tax rises and expenditure cuts is the fairest.  It was inevitable that during the early days of the programme there would be radical tax hikes.  We are now working on the expenditure side.  The decisions being made are very difficult ones given much of the fat has been already taken out.  Ministers are at the pin of their collar trying to identify additional savings.  </p><p>As I stated previously, we have a very high taxation burden in this country.  The top 10% of income earners in this country pay 60% of the totality of income tax.  It is not credible to suggest that one can continue to kick those people around and get even more from them and that this would solve the problem.  The problem is that we do not have enough wealthy people in the country.  Currently every &euro;1 over &euro;32,800 is taxed not at 41% but at 52%, plus 7% and 4% in USC and PRSI, respectively.  Self-employed people pay up to 57% in tax.  It is Alice in Wonderland economics to suggest that we can continually take more from these people in order to secure savings.  It is not possible and everybody knows that, including Sinn F&eacute;in and the people who are smart about these things, to whom the Irish people listen.  It was inevitable that the tax increase agenda would come to an end.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants the Government to abolish the universal social charge, which would cost approximately &euro;3 billion.</p> <p>The Senator also wants to reduce VAT from 23% to 21%, which would cost a further &euro;1 billion.  The hole in his party's budgetary arithmetic is not &euro;2.5 billion but approximately &euro;7 billion.  That is the truth.</p></speech>

The logical outcome of that argument is that the troika will take its money and instead of the adjustment we have suffered being &euro;28 billion over five years, it would be an equal amount over 18 months.  That would create an economic wasteland.  Overnight, Ireland would become a new Argentina but without Eva Per&oacute;n and the Per&oacute;nists.  As the Senator knows, that will not happen.  If the Communist Party of Ireland or even Sinn F&eacute;in were in government, they would face the same reality my Government must face.  Sinn F&eacute;in has to cut budgets in Northern Ireland and it does so quite well.</p><p>People need a break and must be given hope.  We have had reduced budgets for five or six years or for as long as the Second World War.  If, as we hope, all the targets for next year are reached, we will have 95% of the overall target.  The Central Bank has indicated GDP growth will be 2% next year.  Every 1% in GDP growth delivers approximately &euro;1.6 billion in revenue.  A growth rate of 2% next year would, therefore, give us &euro;3.2 billion in additional resources.  The adjustment for next year, as set out in the memorandum of understanding, is &euro;2 billion.  If we were to achieve 2% growth, next year's budget would not entail an adjustment.  That is the prize we must all try to win, irrespective of which party is in government. </p><p>The Government and its predecessor have had to grapple with many issues arising from the crash.  We are halfway through our term of office and our approach has been proportionate and fair.  Ireland was the second country to enter a programme and will be the first to exit a programme.  I argued the case for public private partnership investment in Ireland with 250 bankers at a recent meeting in London.  They told me they could not invest in countries that are in programmes.  As soon as we exit our programme, Ireland will, they said, become a realistic investment prospect.  One must only consider Standard &amp;amp; Poor's recent statement on the Irish rating in respect of investment.  We are moving away from the negativity surrounding Ireland.  If we exit the programme and manage to stay out of it, the big win will not be securing funds to finance our debt but securing investment in the country.  We are on the right track and I hope, with the support of my colleagues who have made constructive remarks, that we will be able to give people hope that the country will emerge at the other end to a prosperous future.</p></speech>

There is a vacancy in the hospital for a consultant urologist.  Urologists perform a variety of functions but the specific group I have in mind are children with spina bifida.  Children and adults with this condition experience serious problems with many of their internal organs and kidney failure is often the cause of death in people with spina bifida.  Only this year, a friend of mine with the condition went to his eternal reward and, as such, I am well aware of many of the problems experienced by children and adults with spina bifida. </p><p>The case I raise involves a mother in County Meath with a young child who is unable to have routine tests carried out on her child's kidneys as a result of the lack of a paediatric urologist.  I understand it is essential that people with spina bifida have regular standard checks done.  These include blood tests for kidney function, renal ultrasound, DMSA scans, bladder function assessments and a number of more infrequent tests such as video urodynamic studies and spinal MRI tests.  This type of routine monitoring of patients is not available for young children because of the lack of urologists in the Children's University Hospital, Temple Street, which deals with spina bifida.  The position is so bad it is not even possible to see a consultant privately because the country lacks the necessary facilities.</p><p>I ask the Minister of State to indicate when a paediatric consultant urologist will be appointed to the Children's University Hospital, Temple Street.  People need to be given hope that they will not find it necessary to travel abroad for routine medical treatment and monitoring.  I look forward to a positive response.</p></speech>

On average, 30 children are born each year in Ireland with open spina bifida, the most severe form of the condition.  Best practice is that there are multiple professionals involved on a spina bifida team.  Early intervention by a specialist and local team is essential to optimise long-term functioning of the children in question and prevent medical complications later in life.</p><p>The Children's University Hospital, Temple Street, is the national tertiary care centre for spina bifida.  All infants born in Ireland with spina bifida are transferred to Temple Street after birth for ongoing neonatal management.  Children with spina bifida are seen by a multidisciplinary team at Temple Street which includes a consultant paediatrician with a special interest in spina bifida, a spina bifida nurse specialist and neurosurgery input.</p><p>The model of care being developed by the Health Service Executive is to share care between the specialist team in Temple Street and the local team.  The best care should be provided nearest to the patient's home, with guidance and support from the specialist team.  However, it is acknowledged that many complex issues are best managed by the specialist team.</p><p>The multidisciplinary spina bifida clinic was established in Temple Street in February 2011.  However, there has not been any dedicated urological input to date.  A recruitment process was under way in 2009-2010, from which the hospital hoped to recruit a consultant urologist.  Unfortunately, the recruitment process did not produce a suitable candidate for the post and a further recruitment process in 2012-2013 was not successful either.  However, a new recruitment process is in train.  The post is with the national recruitment service, to be advertised by the Public Appointments Service.  The HSE is hopeful that this new recruitment process will succeed in hiring a suitable candidate.</p><p>While awaiting the appointment of a consultant urologist, spina bifida patients are being reviewed by a consultant surgeon who has been granted honorary status at the hospital.  The hospital has also been in negotiations to establish a regular clinic with a UK paediatric urologist.  This is complete and dates have been scheduled for 17 and 18 October and in December for visits from the UK paediatric urologist.  An appropriate service level agreement is in place.</p><p>Consultants at the Children's University Hospital, Temple Street, have identified patients requiring this support.  As an interim arrangement, children requiring urgent urological input are prioritised clinically and seen in the United Kingdom under the treatment abroad scheme.  All patients are being kept under regular review and are referred to the UK case by case basis for treatment, pending the appointment of a permanent urologist.</p><p>This Government is acutely aware of the challenges that patients with spina bifida and urological conditions generally and their families face in managing their care.  The Department is committed to providing the best possible health service and will continue to work with the HSE to ensure the best possible outcomes for spina bifida patients.</p></speech>

The HSE and Department should treat it as urgent to get somebody in to monitor these patients and keep them right as best they can.</p></speech>

The Courts Service has decided to close the courthouses in Kenmare, Cahersiveen, Killorglin and Dingle and has claimed it is a cost-saving measure.  I am afraid the service has not carried out a comprehensive analysis of the cost to the State of this move.  It has not considered how much it will cost the State in man-hours given that garda&iacute; who normally give evidence in Kenmare, Cahersiveen, Killorglin or Dingle will now need to travel to Killarney and will have to wait there for their case to be heard.  Witnesses, including expert witnesses such as medical practitioners and others, will need to make the same journey.  The Courts Service has not carried out any effective impact assessment - it has just considered the cost of the court buildings.  It has not considered the cost to the State of all these witnesses and garda&iacute; giving evidence in a centralised location, in this case Killarney.</p><p>The increased cost on citizens in south Kerry who will now have to travel has not been considered.  The 2006 Crowley report showed that 12% of the population in south Kerry do not have a vehicle.  In order to get justice those people would need to travel to Killarney.  Given the economic downturn since then, one can imagine that figure has not improved.  They would need to get a bus to Killarney and bus timetables do not always coincide with court sittings, particularly for return journeys if the court sitting continued until late in the afternoon.</p><p>Access to justice is a fundamental right laid down in the Constitution.  Up to now the most vulnerable, including those seeking barring orders and the elderly were able access justice locally but will no longer be able to do so as a result of this bizarre move.  I say it is bizarre because one would have thought the Department would have done a comprehensive review to determine the number of garda hours that will be taken up in travelling.  Going from Dingle to Killarney or Tralee and back takes two hours alone and the same applies in the case of Cahersiveen.  What is the cost for the State to pay for garda&iacute; to travel by squad car over to Killarney for court hearings?  What are the costs for the witnesses and citizens?  I ask the Minister to reconsider the issue.  What is proposed is centralisation, something of which he is aware given what has happened with Garda stations in his constituency.  Justice is being removed from the people at a local level and being transferred to the centre, meaning not only will the State be at a financial loss but the citizens will also be at a loss because access to justice is being put beyond their reach.</p></speech>

As the Senator may be aware, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service.  The 1998 Act provides that the Courts Service is independent in the performance of its functions, which, of course, include the provision, maintenance and management of court buildings.  Decisions about court venues are entirely a matter for the Courts Service board and the Minister has no role in the decision.</p><p>In the current financial climate, the service has been obliged to review all aspects of its organisational and operational structures throughout the country with the specific objective of ensuring that it can continue to maintain the delivery of front-line court services and an appropriate level of service to court users.  The Minister has been informed that no court venue has been singled out or indeed exempted from the review process.</p><p>A comprehensive review of all venues throughout the country has recently been completed, the purpose of which was to establish a general framework within which venues could be considered for closure taking into account a range of criteria such as caseload, proximity to an alternative venue, physical condition of the building, availability of holding cell facilities, etc.  The likely impact on other justice agencies, such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Prison Service, was also taken into account.  The Minister is informed that the review identified a range of venues nationwide, which, based on the criteria applied, could be considered for closure subject to a detailed assessment and the preparation of a business case in respect of each identified venue.</p><p>Since its establishment in 1999, the Courts Service has amalgamated nearly 160 venues while, at the same time, the service has benefited from a very substantial capital investment to upgrade court accommodation around the country.  The policy has been very successful, resulting in a more efficient use of time for the Judiciary, court users and garda&iacute;.  Rather than short sittings in the smaller venues, a full day's list can be dealt with which leads to reductions in delays in the District Court.</p><p>The Senator has inquired, in particular, about courthouses in County Kerry.  The Courts Service has informed me that Kenmare, Cahersiveen, Killorglin and Dingle have been identified as venues to be considered for closure subject to a detailed assessment and the preparation of a business case as mentioned earlier.  Standard courthouse requirements include basic facilities such as consultation rooms, victim support facilities and holding cells for prisoners which are essential to ensure public safety and efficient use of Irish Prison Service resources.</p><p>The Senator should note that the service has advised that the identification of venues as part of the review process does not necessarily mean that the identified venues will close, as each identified venue will be subject to a rigorous examination.  The Courts Service board will take no decision on the future of Kenmare, Cahersiveen, Killorglin and Dingle as District Court venues without full prior consultation with local interested parties and court users.  The Minister has been advised that the consultation on the identified venues is under way.  Submissions were sought from a range of local interests and the closing date for receipt of submissions was 25 September 2013.  The Courts Service has indicated that it has met local interested parties and the service has assured the Minister that the views expressed in the consultation process will be taken into account in the decision-making process.  As I already mentioned, the final decision on the closure of any venue is a matter for the board of the Courts Service.</p><p>I thank the Senator for raising the matter and I appreciate his interest in the administration of justice in County Kerry.  I know the Senator will understand the need for the Courts Service to take the necessary measures to promote greater efficiency in the courts, and I hope the constructive engagement involving the Courts Service will result in reasoned and appropriate decisions being made on the venues concerned.</p></speech>

I note the response in respect of the criteria being laid down by the Courts Service, which basically amounts to saying that if things such as holding cells, victim support facilities and consultation rooms are not in place, those courts are more likely to close.  However, those facilities have not been there for 90 years in some places.  We went through the Emergency and the Civil War and they did not have those facilities.  Now, as the Minister of State is aware, the criteria are designed by civil servants to justify the closure.  They are making the argument that these courts do not have Rolls-Royce facilities.  Although they have been functioning perfectly for more than 90 years, the Courts Service is using the lack of facilities as an excuse to close them.  I do not blame the Minister of State in this regard but-----</p></speech>

If we are to make statements in public fora such as this, we should try to extrapolate a little more from the data.  The data go back to 2006 and suggest some 3,000 houses do not have access to a motor vehicle.  We can extrapolate from that the number of people who will present before the justice system and it would be fair to say that the number would be a minuscule figure, but if they did have to present to a venue which is a little further away, to reiterate an earlier point I made, I imagine their access to justice would not be prevented in any way.  I imagine the neighbourly people of Kerry would facilitate them in any way they could.</p><p>As I have stated, the Courts Service operates independently and makes independent decisions.  There is no doubt that the Courts Service has identified venues which should be considered, as Senator Daly has outlined, but subject to a detailed assessment and the preparation of a business case.  The response I am giving from the Minister for Justice and Equality is clear in that sense.</p></speech>
