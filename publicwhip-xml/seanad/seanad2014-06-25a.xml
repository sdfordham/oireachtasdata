At a time when Ministers, including the current leader of the Labour Party, are fighting over who will be Ireland's next European Commissioner because they probably do not want to stand in the next general election, our health service is in crisis.  The head of the HSE has had an open and frank confrontation with the Secretary General in the Department of Health.  This is also happening at a time when our health service is struggling to cope with demand and provide services to the people who require them.</p><p>I request the Leader to facilitate a debate today on the health services.  If he is unwilling to do so, I will propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister for Health should come here today to discuss the crisis in our health service.  Morale has never been at a lower point, as any hospital staff member will confirm.  Wards have been closed, rosters are not being filled and gaps in service provision remain.  The Health Information and Quality Authority has written to a number of hospitals, including Tallaght hospital outlining that it had no senior doctor on duty in accident and emergency units when 24 patients remained on trolleys.</p><p>Last week my colleague, Deputy Kirk, raised the issue of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda where, in the first four months of the year 1,955 patients were obliged to remain on trolleys, an increase of about 40% on the same period in 2013.  Waiting times for procedural operations in hospitals are extending every week.  The HSE's answer is to recruit agency staff.  Agency doctors in hospitals cost around &euro;1,000 per day.  The appropriate answer would be to recruit the staff required.  Most of the senior consultants who have spoken out in recent weeks have agreed that there remains a national medical manpower crisis.  The Minister for Health is not willing to provide the manpower in order that the people who require medical assistance would receive it.  It is a crisis; we are at breaking point.  This week we learnt that the HSE or Department of Health is running at an overspend of approximately &euro;500 million.</p><p>We have all heard that a Government reshuffle is approaching.  While it may not come soon enough for some Ministers, the reality remains that the Minister who heads up the Department of Health is administering a crisis he cannot handle at the moment.  The people cannot take any more.  Staff working within the HSE and our hospitals cannot take any more because they are under-resourced and understaffed.  It is high time that we had a proper debate in this House exclusively on the service provision in our hospitals.  I hope the Leader will accede to the request.</p></speech>

Peter McVerry's statement this morning that he supports rent regulation as an important step in preventing homelessness.  As many Senators know, I have long advocated that we need robust rent control, particularly given the current circumstances, and greater measures to protect tenants and security of tenure.  I am aware that the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, is reviewing the issue at the moment.  Perhaps the Leader would invite her to the House to debate the issue.</p><p>I also welcome the news I received earlier today that the new tenancy protection service, which was launched in Dublin and is an initiative between the four local authorities in Dublin, the Department of Social Protection and the national charity, Threshold, has been contacted by more than 500 families who are at risk of homelessness and are being helped.  Many commentators have suggested recently that there is no solution to the current homelessness crisis.  Some of those statements are politically motivated.  As somebody who has worked in this field for many years, I can honestly say that the situation was worse in the 1980s when few or no homeless services were available and those that were available were really not up to scratch.  Therefore, we have been making progress.</p><p>While nobody is suggesting that the problem can be easily solved, tackling housing supply is an obvious answer.  Keeping people, particularly families with children, in their homes is a very important step and a very good start.  I welcome the success of the tenancy protection service to date.</p><p>I wish to mention some more good news.  There has been an increase in housing building starts, which have risen by 132% in the past year.  Unfortunately, some of the good news is tempered by analysis that many of these housing starts are being incentivised by certain developers wanting to get building projects before new more robust building standards come in.  Any of us who are aware of the dreadful problems caused in places such as Priory Hall and the difficulties with pyrite could never stand over any laxity when it comes to building standards.  I want us to have a building industry of which we can be proud, where the price of houses reflects the professional skills of people who have designed and produced them and do not, as they did during the Celtic tiger, simply reflect the cost of the land and the exorbitant profits made by developers in those years.</p><p>In that context I ask for a debate on the broader construction sector.  In particular I would like to dust off the Kenny report published in the 1970s, which was an excellent study into how we prevent a property bubble based on the price of land.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-06-25a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1145" speakername="Feargal Quinn" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014062500003#B00700"><p>My attention was drawn to the fact that rates on sporting clubs do not take into account that a very large amount of sporting clubs' space is not used as it has been rated.  One particular club contacted me.  Its bar only opens for two days or two and a half days at the most, but the club's rates are based on the total premises, including changing rooms and other facilities.  We should have a system whereby we can treat the club's facilities that are of benefit to the community as a whole differently than if it was all one bar.  The fact a club has a bar is useful, but it is only used for part of the week.  We should discuss that at some point.<br />The Consumers' Association of Ireland has drawn attention to a report this week - out today, I think - that indicates that a very large number of companies, including energy companies, broadband and mobile phone companies, offer great deals only to new customers.  I have been in business for a long time and have always believed that to survive one must look after customers to get them to come back again and again.  I cannot get over the fact that so many companies are now moving to offer deals that only apply for the first six or three months.<br />I have told the story in the past of my wife telling me that there was somebody with an English accent on the phone at home looking to speak to me.  When I took the call it turned to be out someone from <i>The Economist</i>magazine.  She told me that my subscription was running out and asked if I would like to renew it.  I said yes, I would be very happy to renew it, I enjoy <i>The Economist</i>, and I saw there was a 35% reduction.  She told me that that was only for new customers and did not apply to existing customers.  Therefore, I do not get <i>The Economist</i>anymore.  My wife now gets <i>The Economist</i>, which solved that problem easily enough.  I mention it because companies offering special deals only to new customers rather than to long-term customers are making an error.  I do not believe it should be legislated for.  I believe we should embarrass them by pointing it out.  On that basis we will be able to win the case on the part of the long-term customers rather than the one-timers.</p></speech>

This is a welcome step.  The criminalisation of cyberbullying sends a clear message to the State and society and ensures they understand how damaging it can be to the individual and, in particular, to young people.  I am pleased the report recommends that Internet safety should be taught in primary and secondary schools and parents should receive training on awareness around cyberbullying issues.  I note also that the report recommends that social, personal and health education in primary and secondary schools be updated to promote a positive, safer and more effective use of technology by children.  Recently, I organised a meeting with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, for a Galway company which was carrying out a pilot for a secondary school in Galway city.  He was extremely encouraging and supportive of that subject.  Given that the matter has been discussed at Cabinet, it would be opportune to invite the Minister, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, to the House to hear what he envisages in this area.  Perhaps the Leader would arrange such a debate.</p></speech>

As Senator Hildegarde Naughton has done, I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, to give the House an update on the success or otherwise of the amalgamation of the former vocational education committees into education and training boards.  It is important he would give us a report in this regard.  I am aware there have been difficulties in some of the education and training boards, particularly in the five that do not have training centres located within their jurisdiction.  There is a difficulty in respect of the allocation of the necessary funding for staff to provide such training and some other minor difficulties.  It is important the Minister comes in to give us an update on the success or otherwise of the amalgamation.</p></speech>

We were all looking forward to the replay next Saturday.  However, according to a media report this morning, it appears that our national sports organisation and the national broadcaster have bungled it, as one body will not facilitate the other in terms of the timing of the game.  The Irish hurling supporter will either have to be one of the crowd in Tullamore or will not see the match.  While Tullamore has a fine stadium, I understand it has a capacity for less than 20,000.  I ask the Leader if some intervention can be made on this issue.  Several hurleys were broken at that match last Sunday.  Hurleys are becoming a more expensive item.  Ash dieback appeared in Ireland in October 2012, and to date, so far as I can see from parliamentary questions, we have had 96 cases.  The price of hurleys is increasing.  Some 80% of ash is imported from the Continent.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, to come to the House to give us an update on the issue.  The last parliamentary question on the issue was answered in November 2013.  I understand, anecdotally, there have been a number of problems since.  Those who are interested in our national game want to know if hurleys will be available for the All-Ireland hurling final in Croke Park in September.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-06-25a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1133" speakername="David Cullinane" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014062500004#C00400"><p>I commend the pre-budget submission launched by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul yesterday, planning for the right kind of recovery.  In recent years, we in Sinn F&eacute;in have sought, through this House, proper debates on pre-budget submissions and alternative budgets from a range of organisations which, in fairness, take the trouble to make submissions to Government, and also political parties in opposition which publish their alternative budgets and pre-budget submissions.  We have the option of the public consultation committee of this House which can invite people.  It is one of those functions that should be used.  A lengthy debate on the role of the Seanad took place in the context of the Seanad abolition referendum.  Allowing organisations which publish their budgets to come to the Oireachtas for a debate with Deputies and Senators on their proposals would be a useful exercise for all involved.</p><p>The pre-budget submission from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul argues for a fairer approach to how the Government balances its books.  There is no contention from anybody that we do not address the deficit.  The contention is where the axe has fallen in terms of cuts and that fair or progressive taxation elements have not been introduced by this or the previous Government.  Low and middle income families and those on welfare have been hit the hardest.  All the evidence points in that direction.  Rather than dismiss alternative budgets or policies as fairytale economics, as the Government parties seem to do, it would be preferable to have a proper debate not only on the alternative budgets of the Opposition but also on those of organisations that are helping people who live in poverty and who are working on the front line in order that we would listen to what they have to say.  I ask the Leader to ensure we have a series of alternative budget debates facilitated by a number of Ministers, the most notable being those for the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Finance.</p></speech>

We can imagine the loss to Revenue if those got into the market.  It is the largest seizure of cigarettes in Europe this year.  I hope there will be more such seizures.  The illicit trade in smuggling on both sides of the Border, particularly in that area, is huge.  Recently, I met two Northern retailers who are in the supermarket and fuel business.  I was horrified to learn that close to the Border, and perhaps south of it, these large unmarked tankers are clearly visible.  While we accept there is active co-operation and close harmony in working together between forces on both sides, we need more active working together and co-operation between the police, Customs and Excise and Revenue.  If this is happening, and people are talking about it openly, I cannot understand the reason we have not had more seizures similar to what happened at Drogheda Port.  On the fuel side, apparently, those who are engaged in this activity are very active.  I am looking at Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill from a Border county and I think he is nodding in agreement.  I raise the matter because it is extremely serious and the loss of revenue is huge.  I hope more will happen in this regard.</p></speech>

I seek to draw the attention of the House to a document circulated by Seamus Dooley, general secretary of the National Union of Journalists, seeking urgent support for its campaign against the imprisonment of al-Jazeera journalists by an Egyptian court.  Al-Jazeera journalists Peter Greste and Mohamed Fahmy have been sentenced to seven years in jail while Baher Mohamed was sentenced to an additional three years for possession of ammunition.  Other al-Jazeera journalists have been sentenced to ten years <i>in absentia</i>.  All of these journalists are what they say they are, that is, journalists.  They are not terrorists or criminals but are journalists who have been jailed for doing their jobs.  This is a violation of the right to freedom of expression which must be condemned by the international community.</p> <p>The NUJ, in bringing this matter to the attention of both Houses, hopes that it will be raised in the Parliament and asks that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade condemn the abuse of human rights in Egypt and work with the governments of EU member states to oppose the criminalisation of journalists.  I would ask the Leader to convey what I would believe to be the sentiments of the entirety of this House in regard to these unjust imprisonments and to also convey the urgency of making a public statement in this regard by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, that he communicate directly with the ambassador of Egypt on the matter and that these matters, which seem to be politically motivated and inspired rather than in any sense of seeking justice, should be overturned, that the Egyptian Government should intervene and that President Sisi should also intervene to ensure that these journalists are allowed to be released, go about their work and return to their families.</p></speech>

I compliment Fota, its members and officials for the magnificent manner in which the course was presented, and commended by players, visiting journalists and worldwide commentators.  The event reached almost all corners of the world through satellite media.  The presentation of Ireland, as portrayed by Fota, will be of enormous benefit to the tourism sector in its efforts to attract visitors, not only to golf but to enjoy many of the first-class facilities we offer for the wide range of sports for the sports enthusiasts, for relaxation in first-class hotels and bed and breakfasts, or for touring around for literary or historical reasons.  Mikko Ilonen's victory this year will be lauded in the Finnish newspapers with the second placed Mr. Mollinari being front-page news in Italy.  So it has been year after year, country after country, all bringing favourable admiration to Ireland.</p><p>I would mention the praise the victor had for the west and for the scenery at one of his first wins in international competition in 1999, in the west at Rosses Point.  It goes to show the importance of further international events and what they can do to promote tourism, not alone in Dublin but throughout the country, realising that next year's open will take place in Royal County Down.</p><p>I commend Fota, Bord F&aacute;ilte and F&aacute;ilte Ireland for the part they played.  It was a magnificent international and we in Ireland should be proud of it.  I spoke to an American family who intend coming to Ireland later this year because of what they saw on television at the weekend.</p></speech>

I appreciate, with the way we do political business here, it is difficult for individual Senators to have a Bill debated, but I would ask the Leader to at least consider the possibility of debating No. 22.  Should that not be possible, it would be appropriate that we would proceed by way of statements on the question of the Irish nomination to the European Commission.  It is a matter which is currently being debated in the media and we have to appreciate the seriousness of the process underway.</p><p>Whoever is appointed by the Government must play a significant role in the further development of European politics and also play a role on behalf of this country, and we must consider the suitability of those being proposed for the job.  It is not absolutely necessary that the appointee or nominee be a member of Cabinet or, indeed, be a Member of the Oireachtas.  That may be the way business was done traditionally but I would ask all of my colleagues here to reflect on what was said, for instance, when former Minister, Mr. Charlie McCreevy, was nominated and when Mr. Richard Burke was nominated in the 1980s by then Taoiseach, the late Mr. Charlie Haughey.  It was seen as a nomination to solve a political problem.  Our appointment to the European Commission must not be about solving a political problem or getting somebody off the pitch on the basis that he or she is a vote loser at home or might not win his or her D&aacute;il seat in the next election.  We must appoint somebody who is suitable for the job, who fulfils the criteria and who has knowledge and experience of European and domestic politics.  We should have a broad trawl of suitable candidates.</p><p>If we cannot debate No. 22, I would ask the Leader that we would have statements on the process and perhaps invite the Taoiseach to inform us of his thinking of what kind of candidate is suitable, not only to represent Ireland in Europe but to play a strong, dominant role in the further enhancement of the European Union.</p></speech>

These are truly journalists, not involved in any way in illegal activities.  They bring news to the world.  This issue will be raised with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade today, but we, as Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, should keep the pressure on the Egyptian authorities to release those journalists as a matter of urgency.</p><p>In April of this year, a significant report was launched.  The report of the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas was commissioned jointly by the Ministers for the Environment, Community and Local Government and Agriculture, Food and the Marine - Deputies Hogan and Coveney respectively - and the commission was chaired by Mr. Pat Spillane.  That report set out the commission's vision statement to make rural Ireland, &quot;a dynamic, adaptable and outward looking multi-sectoral economy supporting vibrant, resilient and diverse communities experiencing a high quality of life with an energised relationship between rural and urban Ireland which will contribute to its sustainability for the benefit of society as a whole&quot;.  The report contains 34 significant recommendations.  It would be appropriate that Seanad &Eacute;ireann discuss it with a view to seeing how we can move matters forward and, hopefully, bring many of those significant recommendations to fruition.  As we all will be aware, rural Ireland is going through a particularly difficult time, with small businesses struggling, and particularly retail in small towns and villages under real pressure.  We, as Members of this House, should avail of any opportunity to promote rural Ireland and help it become re-energised.  A discussion of this report in the next session would be a first step.</p></speech>

Also, the alcohol consumption in Ireland document was published yesterday.  I do not know whether any of the Members were in the AV room last week where Alcohol Ireland make a good presentation.  It is timely that we would ask the Minister for Health to come in and have an in-depth debate on alcohol, its effects on our culture and on suicide rates, and the cost to health and the economy, with an absolute focus on our young people and on sport and sponsorship.  It is an elephant, not in the room but in the country.  It is something that we must address for the long term.</p></speech>

One of the elements of politics and government in this country that have scandalised people is how often decisions about personnel seem to be taken not on the basis of what is in the public interest or who is the best person for the job but according to which narrow political interest has to be placated.  I refer to the recent resignation of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  While some of his political proposals were socially toxic, not least the troubling children and family relationship legislation, he was unjustly treated in light of his work rate and ability.  It was a matter of protecting the Taoiseach and kowtowing to public perception rather than serving the common good.  If we want to improve the reputation of politics in this country we must start by appointing people to positions for which they are fit, appointing them on merit and to removing them for demonstrable malfeasance or incompetence.</p><p>A previous speaker requested that the Minister for Education and Skills be invited to the House.  I do not know who will be Minister in a couple of months' time but irrespective whether it is the current Minister, Deputy Quinn, or somebody else I would like to discuss the issue of civic, social and political education, CSPE.  The Association of CSPE Teachers has expressed concern about the prospect of CSPE being removed as a compulsory State examinable subject in the new junior cycle curriculum.  I recognise that the curriculum is crowded but the association rightly pointed out that Irish students rank highly in a comparative survey of civic knowledge among 14 year olds in 38 countries.  Is there a danger that our ranking will be affected if we change the status of CSPE?  When we consider people's disenchantment with politics and the lack of interest among younger voters in particular, it is important that we do all we can to promote active citizenship and participation in our political system.  The removal of the compulsory status for CSPE is cause for grave concern.  We want a population who are well educated politically and who understand how our institutions work and their role in ensuring their functioning.  I would like to hear from the Minister regarding whether that change is on the cards and if the decision can be reconsidered because it is a dangerous prospect.</p></speech>

A survey by the Irish Heart Foundation found that more than half of the public are in favour of a tax of 20% on sugary drinks.  It is time for us to seriously consider such a measure and I hope the Minister for Finance will investigate the matter.  It has been claimed that such a tax would only affect more vulnerable people but if we could incentivise the consumption of fruit and vegetables or reduce the taxes levied on them, we could offset any difficulties that may arise.  The next generation is facing an obesity epidemic and a sugar tax would be a simple way of discouraging people from buying drinks with a high sugar content.  Some 80% of those surveyed believed sugary drinks are adding to the obesity problem.</p></speech>

We will try to arrange for the Minister for Health to come to the House for a comprehensive debate on the health service but I doubt we will get him at such short notice.  The matters raised by the Senator were also raised yesterday on the Order of Business, when it was noted that up to 20% of advertised consultant posts have not been filled.  This is a cause for concern and it will have to be addressed.  The Senator suggested that the health service is under resourced and over staffed but in the same breath he contradicted his claims by referring to an overspend of &euro;500 million.  He cannot have his bread buttered on both sides.<br />Senator Hayden spoke about rent regulations as a way of preventing homelessness.  Fr. McVerry commented favourably on that subject recently.  The Senator noted the success of the tenancy protection service in helping people to stay in their homes.  I commend the service on its efforts.  The Senator also noted the significant increase in building starts but called for the construction of quality homes and the avoidance of a rush on planning applications in advance of the introduction of proper building regulations.<br />Senator Quinn spoke about rates for sporting clubs.  That is a matter for local authorities but the valuation process will also have to be considered.  We continue to await the valuation Bill.  I understand it is almost ready but it will be September before it is before us.  We can consider the issue of rates in the context of the valuation process and the Bill.  In regard to companies offering special deals for new customers, we saw how the Senator overcame that issue.  It is something that should be considered by others but I note the points he made.<br />Senator Naughton spoke about cyber bullying and safer use of technology.  This issue is of paramount importance.  The Minister for Education and Skills discussed the issue with us previously but it is something we should review on a regular basis and I will ask the Minister to come back to the House.  Senator Wilson asked for a debate with the Minister on the amalgamation of VECs and a progress report on the education and training boards.  I will ask the Minister to agree to a discussion on these matters.<br />Senator Landy spoke about television coverage of GAA games, including in particular next week's game.  There is some confusion as to whether the game can be broadcast.  I note his point on ash dieback disease.  We had a comprehensive debate on ash dieback some time ago.  I am sure that counties Tipperary and Kilkenny will be able to produce sufficient hurleys for Croke Park in September if they manage to get that far.  Senator Cullinane referred to the pre-budget submission by St. Vincent de Paul.  The Minister for Finance has assured us that he will examine every submission he receives but we will try to arrange a pre-budget debate in September, although we will not have much time in September and October for such a debate.<br />Senator Paul Coghlan referred to the seizure of illegal tobacco products and called for closer co-operation between the police, the customs service and Revenue and greater vigilance of fuel laundering.  This is a matter that Ministers and their counterparts in Northern Ireland and the UK have been working on for quite some time, and they are now making significant progress on it.  <br />Senators Mooney and Mullins referred to the imprisonment of al-Jazeera journalists, a matter which was raised by a number of Senators on yesterday's Order of Business.  Senator Brennan commended Fota Island on the Irish golf open and spoke about the importance of such events for tourism.  Senators Bradford and Mullen referred to No. 22, on Ireland's appointment of a European Commissioner.  This is a Government decision and I do not doubt that the interests of the country will be the paramount consideration when the Commissioner is appointed.</p> <p> Senator Mullen raised the possible removal of CSPE as an examination subject.  I believe this is a very important subject which should be studied and retained as an examination subject.  I will invite the Minister for Education and Skills to attend the House to discuss that matter.</p><p>Senator Mullins called for a debate on the report by the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA.  I have requested a Minister to attend the House to debate the recommendations in that report.</p><p>Senator Mary Ann O'Brien referred to alcohol consumption and alcohol abuse, which was also addressed by a number of Senators on the Order of Business yesterday.  I have invited the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Alex White, to come here to discuss that.  However, I have not yet received confirmation of a date for a debate on measures to combat alcohol abuse.</p><p>Senator Noone asked that a sugar tax be considered in the next budget.  I am sure that is one of many items the Minister for Finance will be considering in the context of October's budget.</p></speech>

I would like to welcome to the Visitors Gallery his daughters Elaine, Marion and Angela.  I express my sincere sympathy and that of the House to all his family and friends, who I am sure miss him dearly.</p><p>As a member of the industrial and commercial panel, Sam was elected to the 20th Seanad in a by-election in 1996 and served in this House until the end of that term.  I wondered - I mentioned it to Senator Quinn and others - how Sam managed to be elected in a by-election, which is usually dominated by the political parties.  I think the Government parties at the time backed Sam's election.  Looking at the by-election results, he secured 115 of the 221 votes cast.  He was a very valuable Member of the House.</p><p>Outside his political life in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, Sam McAughtry had many strings to his bow.  I understand he left school at the tender age of 14 and joined the Royal Air Force, in which he served for a number of years.</p> <p>He subsequently joined the Northern Ireland civil service.  Perhaps Sam will be most notably remembered for his fruitful career as a broadcaster, journalist and writer.  His voice frequently graced the airwaves of BBC Northern Ireland and his words frequently appeared in the columns of <i>The Irish Time</i>s, among other publications.  Some of his best known works include<i>The Sinking of the Kenbane Head</i>, <i>McAughtry's War</i>and <i>On the Outside Looking In, A Memoir</i>.<br />Born in a loyalist community in Belfast, throughout his life, Sam was an advocate of peace and North-South relations.  His passion for peace was illustrated in his speech on the day he was introduced to the Seanad, when he stated: &quot;it is my dearest wish to see this island inhabited by 5 million Irish people, living in two jurisdictions with consent, but with institutions established to emphasise their Irishness.&quot;<br />Sam was a great storyteller who was blessed with great wit.  His artistic contribution served to enrich the lives of all those who knew him, at home and abroad.  I extend my sincere sympathy to his family and friends.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</p></speech>

When one considers the remarkable contribution he made over a long period, it would take much longer than the time available today to go into his life in detail.  Writing in the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i>, former Senator Maurice Hayes described Sam as &quot;a really remarkable man &ndash; a writer and a political activist who had learned both trades in the hard school of life, a seafarer at heart who had survived many a stormy passage to reach serene old age as a dispenser of wit and wisdom, an advocate of civility and decency in public discourse, and a charitable concern for the underdog and the casualties of society&quot;. <br />Senator Cummins outlined Sam's life.  During the war, he joined the Royal Air Force and rose to the position of flying officer.  Returning to Belfast, he joined the Ministry of Agriculture as a temporary civil servant which led, in turn, to writing in a trade union magazine and newspaper columns and broadcasting on local radio.  He became involved in politics through the Northern Ireland Labour Party.  His first book was published in 1970 and was followed by a further nine works, of which the final one was published in 2003.  He helped to establish the peace train movement, which campaigned against the IRA's regular disruption of the rail link between Dublin and Belfast.  While these events seem a long time ago, they were real obstacles to peace at the time and there appears to be a form of collective amnesia about them.  Sam castigated and challenged the IRA for its negative mindset and the barriers it created between the two traditions on the island.  I believe most people will subscribe to that view. <br />Sam was a lifelong trade unionist.  He became a member of the Northern Ireland Labour Party and railed against sectarianism throughout his life.  Dr. Brigitte Anton of the Labour Party described McAughtry's contribution to the arts and development of non-sectarian labour politics in Northern Ireland as &quot;immeasurable&quot;.  Damien Smith, head of literature and drama at the Arts Council of Northern Ireland stated: &quot;To describe McAughtry as a much-loved chronicler of Belfast working-class life is to state an obvious truth - he was among the most rigorous, charming, eloquent and visible champions of the old Belfast of two-up/two-down values and the solidarity of the poor.&quot;<br />The<i>Belfast Telegraph</i>, in an obituary notice, referred to Sam as a &quot;rare, articulate Protestant voice&quot;.  With his passing, it added, &quot;the memory of almost a century of Belfast life disappeared from reach&quot;.  In his many newspaper articles, broadcasts, memoirs, interviews and volumes of stories, Sam gave voice to a version of the Ulster Protestant which remains rarely expressed.  He was, in his own words, &quot;a hybrid Unionist&quot; who came from a stock which had a more complex relationship with Ireland and Britain than nowadays we would be given to believe existed.  I am pleased Senator Cummins repeated the remarks Sam made in the House on his dearest wish.  <br />Sam declared himself happy to live in the United Kingdom and happier still to be Irish and proclaim his Irishness.  This is, in a way, the direction in which we are moving, namely, a position in which there is a recognition and acceptance of separate identities on this island.  Ultimately, Sam McAughtry's aspiration was for peaceful co-existence between, to use the words of Wolfe Tone, Catholic, Protestant and dissenter.

He was an accomplished and unique individual who crossed borders in a way only few have managed in the recent tumultuous decades which have thankfully become peaceful.  We are here to pay tribute to former Senator Sam McAughtry who passed away in March last at the age of 91 years.  Personally, I did not have the pleasure of knowing Sam but his voice was certainly familiar to me from radio broadcasts.  I remember him, in particular, for his contributions to the &quot;Sunday Miscellany&quot; programme on Sunday mornings.  He had a calm voice, which was great for radio. <br />Sam McAughtry's place in our shared history is well secured.  Leaving school at age 14 years, he joined the Royal Air Force and, subsequently, the civil service, before becoming a regular on our airwaves and in our newspapers.  He was a columnist for<i>The Irish Times </i>and could be regularly heard on BBC and RTE radio speaking on both political and personal issues.  Sam's voice was different in a time of trouble and difficulty.  He painted pictures with words on the effects the Troubles had on ordinary people, highlighted their difficulties and the way in which their lives were affected.  His thoughts and statements on radio programmes and his columns in <i>The Irish Times</i>over the years provided an interesting social history for generations to come. <br />Sam McAughtry was an accomplished writer whose works included <i>On the Outside Looking In, A Memoir</i>, <i>Blind Spot,</i><i>Play it Again Sam</i>, <i>Sam McAughtry's Belfast</i>and <i>McAughtry's War</i>.  In addition to the many achievements I have listed, Sam also led a very important public life.  As a member of the Northern Ireland Labour Party, he was passionate about trade unions and deeply committed to fighting sectarianism.  He also led a public life through his election in 1996 to Seanad &Eacute;ireann on the industrial and commercial panel.  He promoted peace and reconciliation against a backdrop of violence and called for a change in understanding, while some still wished to engage in and promote violence as a means to an end.<br />Before becoming a Member of the Seanad, Sam was a founding member of the peace train organisation.  As Senator Mooney noted, its members protested against and stood up to the threats of bombs on the Dublin to Belfast rail line.  As someone from Dundalk who lived alongside the line, I remember only too well the frequent disruption to services on the route.  As a founding member of the group, Sam helped to bring people together against the fear and threats.  He and his colleagues provided a train station platform for people to come together, say &quot;No More&quot; and refuse to allow fear to reign. <br />Sam McAughtry made contributions to many parts of Irish life and we are thankful to him and remember him for them.  He passed away in March at the age of 91 years, having made contributions to the political, cultural and social fabric of his time.  Importantly, he connected with an audience through his writing, speeches and work in a way that few others can match.  He was a man of many hats who contributed greatly to Irish life.  I express my gratitude for the path he paved.</p></speech>

I regard today as a celebration of Sam McAughtry's life.  I was a Senator at the same time as Sam and I remember well the first time I met him.  Looking at a photograph of Sam published in a newspaper the other day, his smile stands out.  He had a great, big smile which seemed to be there all the time.  I got to know him very well and I remember telling him I had northern connections.</p> <p>I told him that my mother came from the banks of Lough Neagh in County Armagh and my father came from the poor land of Attical located outside Kilkeel in County Down.  This is the land to which the native Irish had to move when the Ulster Plantation took place in the early 1600s.  Sam and I talked about this on that day and he said it was interesting to know.  He said that his background was such that he would not have had the opportunity to know, on normal terms, people like my grandfather who came from the banks of Lough Neagh or my other grandfather who came from Attical.</p><p>I told Sam the following story, which he loved to repeat, about meeting Sir Richard Needham who will not mind my telling this story.  He was a British Minister when Margaret Thatcher was in power and I met him at a function in the British Embassy.  At the beginning of the meal we addressed each other formally as Senator and Sir or Minister.  Towards the end of the meal we addressed each other as Feargal and Richard and I said to him I could not figure out his accent.  He responded by saying that he was from Northern Ireland with what I thought, as I said to Sam, a rather swanky Northern accent.  I could never claim that Sam had a swanky accent.  I asked Richard where he came from and he said Northern Ireland.  I responded by informing him that my people came from Northern Ireland.  I persisted and asked him whereabouts and he just said County Down.  He was not giving anything away.  Eventually I said that my father came from County Down, my mother came from County Armagh and asked him again where he came from.  He replied with the words &quot;south County Down.&quot;  Sam roared laughing at the reticence of Richard Needham to say exactly where he was from.  In the end I got it out of Richard that he was from Kilkeel.  I said to him we may be related because my grandfather came from Attical, from the poor land outside of Kilkeel.  He said: &quot;No, no.  My good man, you probably owe me rent.&quot;  Sam loved the story and loved to tell it.</p><p>Richard Needham was not born with the Needham name and was originally Lord Kilmorey.  He  dispensed with the title in order to go for the British House of Commons.  He recalled that when he was being put to bed, and then heir to the title of Lord Kilmorey, his nanny would say to him: &quot;You go to sleep now, young Richard, or long Fenians from Attical might come down and take you away.&quot;</p><p>The reason I have told my story is because Sam loved it so much and was interested in hearing about different sectors of society.  As Senator Moran and others have said, he was involved in many things aimed at creating peace and getting the different factions in Ireland together.  He worked so hard towards that aim.  He showed great commitment in everything he did and spoke about in this Chamber.  He forged links and was one of the people who established the peace train.  There was great division among so many people in the North.  The people from the banks of Lough Neagh and Attical, on the side of the Mourne Mountains, would have had no connection with where he came from in Tigers Bay and he would not have had any connection with them either.</p><p>Sam had a wonderful ability as a storyteller.  He left school at 14 years of age and became a civil servant after some time spent in the Royal Air Force.  Then he published his books at quite a late stage in his life compared with others.  He was a prolific writer and wrote many stories and books.</p><p>The Seanad was a richer place because Sam brought his humour and good sense to it.  I remember his first speech, which Senator Mooney quoted.  Sam had insightful views but was able to convey them with humour to the extent that we made sure we were present to hear him.  We could also listen to him regularly on his radio programme called &quot;Sunday Miscellany&quot; because he made as many as 200 broadcasts.  He had a wonderful Northern accent and displayed a wonderful sparkle of joy and humour.  He managed to demonstrate here, more than anything else, his hatred for sectarianism and a belief that we, in Ireland, could be one people, which he worded so well.  As Senator Mooney said, he expressed his pride at being a member of the United Kingdom but was also proud to be Irish as well.  He was able to put that in words, be committed and accept an invitation to become a Senator.  Later he was elected as Senator due to a by-election.</p><p>I wish to say to his three daughters here today that these tributes are a celebration of his life.  Those of us who knew him celebrate his life.  We wish to say how proud we were to have known him.  He added to this House and he focused our attention on non-sectarianism of which he was so proud.  He did so much, not just with the peace train but in everything else he did.  I wish his daughters to have those memories of him and I wish us to have those memories of him.</p><p>I express my appreciation to the Cathaoirleach for giving us the opportunity to have this session here today and to remind us all and put on record our memories of such a great man.</p></speech>

He added a splash of colour with his wit and storytelling.</blockquote>The same sentiment has been echoed by many Senators who knew him personally.  I did not know him personally but have heard a lot about him.  Many acts of reconciliation are taking place on the island of Ireland at the moment which benefit us all.  If we look back on the history of the Seanad, especially the contribution made by people like Sam and others who came from the North and a different tradition, a Unionist tradition, they were able to take their seats in this Parliament in the Republic, which was, in its own way, an act of reconciliation at a time when we had a conflict on this island.  Sam's contribution to the Seanad was very progressive which should be celebrated by his family, and certainly celebrated by all of us.<br />Sam represents the very complex issue of nationality, identity and how people see themselves in the North.  We have reached a situation where it is accepted that people can see themselves as Irish, people can see themselves as British or people can be both.  That is the Ireland we all want to live in.<br />The Leader will be aware of the debates we have had in the House on Seanad reform and wanting a more inclusive and reformed Seanad in this State.  I firmly believe that citizens in the North should have a vote in Seanad elections which would be a further act of reconciliation.  It is to be hoped we will see more people from the Unionist community represented in institutions here in this State.  We can look at the example given by the Assembly, at the moment, where people from different traditions work together in the best interests of citizens.  I hope, as an Irish republican, that we can progress towards a united Ireland, but we must always ensure people who see themselves as British have their rights respected.  It is important to say that they have as much right to be part of the Parliament in this State as we do.<br />Sam was a member of both the trade union movement and the Northern Ireland Labour Party.  As other speakers have said, he turned to writing and became a well-regarded and popular storyteller and author.  What he said when he was appointed to the Seanad has been quoted already but is worth repeating: &quot;I am a hybrid unionist in that I am happy to live in the United Kingdom but I am happier still to be Irish and to proclaim my Irishness.&quot;  He was also a supporter of the peace process and went on to say:<blockquote>As I stated on the day of my election, it is my dearest wish to see this island inhabited by 5 million Irish people, living in two jurisdictions with consent, but with institutions established to emphasise their Irishness.</blockquote></p> <p>We can all learn lessons in, say the debate in the North on flags and emblems, from his generosity and forward-thinking.</p><p>I express my sympathies to the McAughtry family who have come to the Seanad today to hear these tributes.  For anyone who is a supporter of the peace process and has progressive views like Sam&rsquo;s, we need to continue to build a more inclusive and better Ireland for all those who live here.</p></speech>

I happened to be in the other House when he served here but I quickly got to know him, as did all Members of the Oireachtas then.  We enjoyed his recollections and, for those horse-racing fans, we enjoyed discussing his racing tips.  Another side to his make-up was that he was a noted commentator on the horse-racing industry and had many valuable insights in that regard.</p><p>He was elected to the Seanad in 1996 in one of the most interesting by-elections that had taken place for many years.  As Members know, these tend to be won easily by the government side of the House.  The political numbers at the time meant that a tight by-election was in the offing.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party, in its wisdom, ran a candidate from Northern Ireland.  Sam McAughtry, probably at the instigation of the then leader of Democratic Left, Proinsias De Rossa, became the candidate of the rainbow coalition Government.  It was an active campaign with every Member canvassed.  Strong pressure was put on government Members to ensure we turned up at the appointed time and placed our vote.  Sam McAughtry secured 115 of the 221 votes cast, a significant achievement.  He obviously got the support of all rainbow government Members but also the Independents, a tribute to his skills.</p><p>During Sam McAughtry&rsquo;s brief time here, the first thing that always struck one about him, as Senator Quinn said, was his smile.  He was always positive, happy, chatty and good company in the social spaces in Leinster House.  His legacy to Northern Ireland, this House and Irish politics is significant.  His time here may have been short in political terms but it was a crucial time in the peace process.  We had had the breakdown in 1995 of the 1994 ceasefire.  His was a voice of reasoned loyalism and Protestantism in this House which was helpful.  Along with Senators Gordon Wilson, John Robb and others from Northern Ireland, they forced people in both Houses and in Irish society generally to face up to the fact that nobody had all the answers and that many of us were looking at the Northern difficulty from our own blinkered vision.  Sam McAughtry and others forced us to look at all sides of the story.</p><p>I want to pay particular tribute to his work with the Peace Train Organisation.  Today, all the gloss of the peace process seems to shine off those who had Pauline conversions.  Few people credit the men and women who always held the firm line that while change was necessary, bombing, murder, violence and mayhem was not the way forward.  Sam McAughtry and his colleagues in the Peace Train Organisation, in a simple demonstration, proved conclusively that those attempting to unite the island were dividing it further, doing grave damage to the citizens of this country.  Fortunately, the will and the wisdom of Sam McAughtry and others have prevailed and we all now work in a joint framework towards peace and prosperity on this island.  I thank him for that.</p><p>While his service in this House was relatively short, it was significant, along with his work as a journalist, a trade unionist and a member of the Northern Ireland Labour Party.  That party did huge service for working class people on this island and never asked one&rsquo;s religion.  It was a working class party about the working class and working people, not about sectarianism which, again, is conveniently forgotten by so many.  Sam McAughtry left a proud legacy of work, literature and an example of how real peace and dialogue can make a difference.</p><p>I sympathise with his daughters.  He is fondly remembered by all Members who had the privilege and pleasure of meeting him.</p></speech>

I also extend my sympathy to his wife, Phyllis, and extended family.<br />After the many fine tributes that have been paid to Sam McAughtry, it is very hard to have something new to say about him.  Sam was elected to the Twentieth Seanad in a by-election for the industrial and commercial panel.  It was an interesting period in our history.  For the first time ever, there had been a change of government without an election and John Bruton became Taoiseach in 1994.  Two Chathaoirligh also died during that period, 1994 to 1997, S&eacute;an Fallon, whose seat Sam took in the by-election, and Liam Naughten, who was killed tragically in a car crash.  Every Member respected him.  He spoke with authority on several subjects, least of all Northern Ireland.  He was chairman and a founding member of the Peace Train Organisation which protested against attacks against the Belfast-Dublin rail link.<br />He was a writer, broadcaster, columnist with <i>The Irish Times</i>and a great storyteller.  He was also a gentlemen with great wit and integrity.  I remember him telling me on one occasion that his first job was in a ladies&rsquo; lingerie shop which was probably called a ladies&rsquo; underwear shop then.  He was very young at the time but did not believe he was really qualified for the job because he had never heard the word &ldquo;knickers&rdquo; in public before.  He got out of that job as quick as he could.  One can imagine the very good job he made telling that story.<br />Sam McAughtry spoke with great authority in the House.  At the time, I was the Government Whip so I had close contact with him.  He was very dependable and always turned up for votes.</p> <p>As Senator Quinn said, he always had a smile on his face.  He took his work with great ease and lightly but seriously at the same time.  It was a great pleasure to know Sam McAughtry and to have worked closely with him over that period.  I would like to be associated with the vote of sympathy to him here today and the tributes that Members have paid to him.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-06-25a.53" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1145" speakername="Feargal Quinn" time="12:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014062500013#M00200"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p><p>I welcome the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, to the House.  We are getting to know him here as he comes in on a regular basis.  I hope he will welcome the Bill.</p> <p>I produced this Bill to address concerns which I have had for some time about certain aspects of the health insurance sector in Ireland.<br />There are features within the health insurance sector as well as surrounding the regulation of the health insurance sector which make me uncomfortable.  Special treatment for one provider over all others and conflicts of interest at the highest levels are not features of a fair and equitable health insurance sector where the consumer is prioritised above all other considerations.  Quite frankly, under the current arrangements the consumer comes a definitive last.<br />The Minister for Health currently stands in the position of being the shareholder and largest provider of private hospital services in the market through the HSE.  The Minister is also the shareholder of the largest health insurer in the market, VHI, and he also has responsibility for regulating the health insurance sector &ndash; exercising wide-ranging powers that have a direct impact upon both the HSE and the VHI.  By any measure, that is an unhealthy set of circumstances.<br />The fact that the VHI is not subject to the same regulatory or solvency requirements as other health insurance providers in the market is also untenable.  It is not a matter of choice.  The Government is required to give effect to the decision of the European Court of Justice in the case of European Commission <i>v</i>. Ireland.<br />The purpose of this Bill is to introduce reforms in three areas of the health insurance market.  First, the Bill provides for the transfer of the responsibility for the management of the State's ownership of VHI to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  This proposal is designed to bring about an end to any actual or perceived conflict of interest that comes about from the fact that the Minister has to wear a number of hats.  This is a relatively simple, but yet important, proposal.<br />Second, the Bill seeks to normalise the regulatory position of VHI by requiring VHI to meet the solvency requirements that are applicable to all other health insurance providers in the Irish market.  This proposal gives effect to the decision of the European Court of Justice.  It is not a matter of discretion for the Government.  Based on that decision, it must be implemented.  The fateful day has been set and has been postponed on a number of occasions.  We saw last week that VHI recorded a surplus of &euro;65 million.  It is time to cut the apron strings and let VHI stand on its own two feet.  The least consumers can expect in an open and progressive economy such as ours is that the health insurance market is transparent and equitable.  At present, I suggest this is certainly not the case.<br />Third, the Bill provides for the dissolution of the Health Insurance Authority, HIA, and the transfer of its regulatory functions to the Central Bank of Ireland.  All other insurers in the State are regulated by the Central Bank.  Why should the health insurance sector be any different?  What I propose is that we dissolve the HIA and transfer its functions and expertise to the Central Bank.  Not only does this proposal make perfect sense, it is also consistent with the Government's commitment to reducing the number of public bodies in existence.  Some time back, a former Minister for Health asked me to get involved.  At the time, I was not able to do so.  I could not believe the number of quangos and different organisations, some of which were in the same town doing the same thing.  I believe there is a need to reduce their number.<br />As those of the squeezed middle continue to be forced to abandon their health insurance, and as the cost of health insurance continues to rise year after year, we as legislators must act to bring some sense to this situation.  We can no longer tolerate a situation where, time and again, the welfare of VHI outflanks the welfare of the consumer.  That is unsustainable.<br />It is time to normalise the regulation of the entire health insurance market.  There can no longer be any favoured health insurance provider.  If that means the State must divest its interest in VHI or attract further investment, then so be it.  I am fully supportive of the State maintaining control over key public utilities, such as water, electricity, public transport and, indeed, air travel &ndash; certainly, air-traffic control anyway - but a case can no longer be made for the State's continued ownership and control of a health insurance provider.<br />I would ask the Minister to reflect on what I and my colleagues have to say here today and accept that the status quo in the health insurance sector can no longer remain, and to not oppose the passage of this Bill.  There are three parts to it.  I believe each is worthy of consideration, approval and support, and I urge the Minister to do so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-06-25a.55" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014062500014#N00200"><p>I welcome the Minister back to the House.  I hope the evening we had yesterday, taking his Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Bill 2014, will prove to be successful.</p><p>On this occasion it is an honour, as always, to second Senator Quinn's Bill.  I believe it has huge merit.  I believe it is the right thing to do.</p><p>There are so many problems arising in this area, not least, for instance, according to the Department's website, that the Minister appoints both the board of the VHI and board of the HIA, which is currently the regulator for the sector.  That would strike me, in sporting terms, as though one of the teams got to choose the referee for the matches on various Sundays.</p><p>I note also a concern of the Minister, of ours and of the IMF, that the health budget is 8.7% of gross national income and the comparator countries do it for 7.3%.  I cannot think of a stronger advocate than the Minister when the health insurance premiums were rising in that he asked the health insurers to compete with each other and to do deals, and asked them to question whether the number of tests were necessary.  All the Minister was saying was certainly music to my ears in the House.  We need to do that.  On an indexed basis, we are spending 20% more.  Our index would be 119 compared to the OECD countries' average of 100, and many of the OECD countries have older populations than we do.  There is a problem.</p><p>A question that occurs to me, on which the Minister agreed when we raised it in the past, is how come, between the last recession in the mid to late 1980s and the peak, we doubled the number of staff in the health service.  It went from 55,000 to 110,000.  The Minister had to, as part of the arrangements with the troika, bring it back to 103,000.  Surely, the other question is what on earth did we get for the 55,000 extra staff recruited over that 20 year period which have given us this extremely high-cost system which this Bill attempts to address.</p><p>One can do a certain amount - I do not mean that in any patronising way.  One can perform the actions that the Minister has, but it is difficult to do and the Department of Health is known as &quot;Angola&quot; for that reason.  There is considerable criticism of measures which are necessary in the financial interest of the Minister every time he tries to do that.</p><p>Looking at the Milliman report, given the average length of stay for a treatment of 11.6 days for VHI members and 3.7 days for best international practice, one can see the numbers of noughts mounting up.  That amounts to 20,000 extra hotel costs incurred.  I fully support the Minister's attempts to move procedures to outpatients and GPs.  However, if we pay hospitals more for keeping patients in longer and VHI with the State guarantee is seen as the easy way to do that, it will be impossible to reform the system.</p> <p>Unless we implement reforms such as those proposed by Senator Quinn compulsory health insurance will be about as popular as water charges.  Mr. Ben Dunne once said in respect of water that if 40% of the stock disappeared from one of his shops, he would not blame the customers.  This will become a burdensome and annoying tax unless we reform health insurance.  As we used to say when the then Minister for Transport, Jim Mitchell, both owned Aer Lingus and regulated the market, such wisdom is not given to mere mortals.  The European Court of Justice decision to which Senator Quinn referred, as well as the ruling in the Supreme Court, requires us to attempt to achieve the results sought in this Bill.  In 2011 the European Court of Justice ruled that the current arrangements whereby VHI is treated more favourably than other health insurance providers is discriminatory.</p><p>Let us keep this Bill on the Order Paper.  All of us seek a more efficient health service.  I am supporting the Bill because I want a company to be able to say to the Minister that it charges smaller premiums for health insurance because it can treat old and young people at a lower cost than the VHI.  Please allow it to continue to do so and do not require it to bring its costs up to the level of the VHI.  Without much evidence, the VHI has always stressed that it has a large number of older customers and that companies which recruited young folk into health insurance were in some way cheating.  If we can show that company X can do a better job for the Minister and the rest of society at a cheaper cost for young and old people, let us give it a try.  Health insurance is a financial service.  The Minister should give responsibility for it to the Central Bank rather than involve himself in appointing directors to the referee board of the Health Insurance Authority and to one of the competing health insurance companies.  </p></speech>

The code requires that particular care be taken to safeguard information concerning the commercial affairs of companies or organisations which have been submitted in connection with official business on condition or on the reasonable assumption that it would remain confidential.</p><p>Senior officials in this area also hold positions that are subject to section 18 of the Ethics in Public Office Acts 1995 and 2001.  Information received from any insurer is used solely in the carrying out of official duties and is not made available outside of the Department unless required under law.  As a commercial State body, the VHI has obligations to the Minister for Health under the code of practice for governance of State bodies.  These obligations are monitored by the private health insurance unit of my Department which, among other things, is charged with overseeing the maintenance of a competitive and sustainable private health insurance market, management of ongoing market issues and appropriate liaison with and governance of relevant State bodies.  I reject the assertion that there is preferential treatment of the VHI.  That is a misunderstanding of the situation.</p><p>I will address risk equalisation during the course of my speech but suffice it to say that if any of the other companies had the same proportion of older people to their membership as the VHI, there would be no discussion of this subject.  Risk equalisation is intended to address that.  If we all subscribe to community rating, whereby customers pay the same premium for the same policy irrespective of their age, sex or disease status, we have to compensate companies which have a higher proportion of older and sicker people as opposed to those which have a much younger customer base.  Nobody in this House is naive enough to believe that the market is not used by the insurers to chase the more profitable young people.  All one has to do to confirm this is to examine the products provided by new entrants to the market and the percentage of young versus older people on their books.  The story speaks for itself.</p><p>The Senator and I share the same objective for the private health insurance market, namely, to achieve a viable and sustainable system, affordable to all, which operates in the best interests of the public.  I want to make sure that this happens, but I think that there are different ways of achieving the objective.  The Bill before us proposes a number of changes to the regulatory infrastructure underpinning the private health insurance market.  While I appreciate the intentions in bringing forward this Bill, any changes we make must be in the context of moving to universal health insurance.  There have been many important and positive developments in the private health insurance market in recent times and legislation must take account of these.</p><p>The VHI's position has already advanced considerably towards authorisation by the Central Bank but the Bill does not take account of these developments.  Similarly the Health Insurance Authority will be the engine for reform of the private health insurance market and to implement the provisions of this Bill would be entirely inconsistent with the new role that I see for the Health Insurance Authority under universal health insurance.  It would be helpful to inform the House of the progress achieved to date in respect of sustaining the private health insurance market.  In addition, I will set out the policy supports that I will introduce shortly, and the planned reforms in respect of private health insurance before addressing the three key proposals in the Bill.</p><p>I acknowledge Senator Quinn's concerns about the decline in the numbers insured in the private health insurance market since its peak in 2008.  More than 250,000 people lost their jobs in the period since 2008 because of the financial decline of this country.  In addition, 250,000 medical cards were issued and 250,000 people left the insurance market.  They are not all the same 250,000 people but there is a relationship with the financial situation in which the country and the individuals who live here find themselves.  The current private health insurance coverage stands at 44.2% of the population.  I am keen to create the best possible environment within which more people will want to obtain and retain private health insurance cover that is affordable and competitive, and meets consumers' needs as we prepare to move to universal health insurance.  I am taking a series of steps to support the private health insurance market.  With all respect to Senator Quinn, I consider these initiatives, rather than those proposed in his Bill, are the most appropriate to promote a sustainable and competitive private health insurance market.</p><p>In June 2013, 1 appointed Mr. Pat McLoughlin, to work with insurers, the Health Insurance Authority and my Department to identify effective strategies for cost management in the market.  Mr. McLoughlin's first report, which was published at the end of December 2013, made a number of important recommendations, including the introduction of lifetime community rating as a measure to encourage younger people to buy health insurance.  Lifetime community rating is intended to encourage people to join health insurance schemes early and to retain their private health insurance cover.  Late entry loadings will be applied to those who join later in life.  There will, of course, be a grace period to allow people take out insurance without loadings and a strong communications campaign to give everyone adequate notice of the change.</p><p>The introduction of lifetime community rating will provide a mechanism to discourage people from only taking out private health insurance as they get older by allowing commercial insurers to charge higher premiums to late entrants to the market and thus provide an incentive for people to take out private health insurance at a younger age.  This is important because the health insurance market requires a sizeable cohort of younger members, who are generally healthier, to offset the high cost of older and less healthy members.  This is critical to the sustainability of our system of community-rated health insurance.  Many of those who are growing and require additional care are the very people who supported those who went before them when they were younger.  Officials from my Department, in consultation with the Health Insurance Authority and the health insurers, have been working to finalise regulations to provide for lifetime community rating.  I intend to sign the regulations to make this a reality shortly.  I also wish to help to address the substantial reduction in market penetration rates among those between the ages of 20 and 25 by providing for sliding discounts for all young adults up to age 24 years.  I propose to introduce phasing-in of full adult rates to smoothen the dramatic price increase currently experienced when student rates no longer apply, usually after the age of 21 years at present.</p> <p>I propose that this measure will be introduced in legislation later this year, for implementation in 2015.</p><p>In addition to the measures I have outlined, I have consistently emphasised the need for much greater cost control in the private health insurance industry so that premiums are affordable for as many people as possible.  I have urged all the private health insurers to do everything possible to keep down the cost of private health insurance.  I am determined to address costs in this sector in the interest of consumers and I have made it clear to insurers that I believe significant savings can still be made, the effect of which can be to minimise the need for premium increases.</p><p>In addition to the introduction of lifetime community rating, significant progress has also been made on the implementation of the other recommendations in Mr. McLoughlin's phase 1 costs review report.  For example, the HSE and insurers are now working together to implement a number of the report's recommendations on claims processing, and admission and discharge issues.</p><p>As regards fraud, waste and abuse, the private health insurers have agreed to use existing anti-fraud and confidential hotline structures under the auspices of Insurance Ireland to facilitate combating fraud in the private health insurance market.</p><p>As a shareholder, I have seen the letter from the VHI to my Department's Secretary General.  I know that the VHI is engaged in post-market surveillance.  When people have left hospital, they get a phone call which they find useful because it is nice to know that one's insurer is interested in how one got on.  They can also check whether the tests they have been billed for have actually been done.  The particular recommendations on case-based charging will be incorporated into the work already under way by my Department under the money follows the patient system.</p><p>Senator Barrett alluded to the need for clinical audits, which astonishingly we never had before.  Such audits can check whether or not the tests were necessary in the first place.  In addition, there will be more robust auditing both of doctors and hospitals, as well as benchmarking what we pay.  We are still paying several hundred euro for procedures that used to take two hours, but now only take 20 minutes.  In this respect, much work has to be done this year and the renegotiation of many of these consultant contracts will take place around this time.</p><p>Work on phase 2 of Mr. McLoughlin's report, which will deal further with the factors driving costs in health insurance, is progressing well.  This second phase report is expected to be finalised and published in the coming weeks.</p><p>Under universal health insurance, UHI, competing health insurers will form the backbone of the new purchaser-provider split.  Insurers will be the commissioners of a wide range of primary care services, acute hospital services and acute mental health care.  I recognise that in advance of UHI, we need an affordable, competitive market that meets consumers' needs.  I want to create the best possible environment within which more people will want to take out, and keep, health insurance cover.</p><p>Community-rated health insurance systems across the world use risk equalisation as a mechanism to distribute fairly some of the differences that arise in insurers' costs due to the differing health status of all their customers.  I alluded to this at the beginning of my speech.  I am committed to making further improvements to the risk equalisation scheme as a mechanism to support community rating in the private health insurance market.  In January 2013, I introduced a permanent risk equalisation scheme which takes greater account of the extra cost of treating older and sicker patients, compared with younger and healthy lives.  The scheme encourages insurers to focus on product innovation, efficiency and customer service.  Subject to expert advice and in line with existing legislation and other requirements, I am committed to the following: maintaining the current level of effectiveness and, where possible, over the period of 2014-16, increasing the effectiveness of the scheme to 85% for those in their 70s and to 90% for those over 80 years of age; adjusting the hospital bed utilisation credit as a proxy for health status; and introducing a more refined health status measure through the use of diagnosis-related groups on a phased basis between 2016 and 2018.  A robust risk equalisation scheme is also required as a foundation stone to delivering services under universal health Insurance.  The House will appreciate that the progress I have outlined, together with the proposed reforms, are in line with the Government's commitment to maintaining a viable and sustainable private health insurance market. </p><p>I will now address each of the Bill's three key proposals.  The Bill proposes to transfer responsibility for the VHI to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  As Minister for Health, I have responsibility under the Health Insurance Acts for maintaining the stability of the health insurance market.  The Government recognises that the maintenance of a healthy and functioning voluntary private health insurance market is an essential step to facilitate the transition to a market-based universal health insurance system, under the remit of the Minister for Health. </p><p>The VHI and the other open market insurers will play a key role in the delivery of services in a multi-payer UHI model.  In my view, therefore, transferring responsibility for the VHI to any other Minister would not be appropriate.  In addition, I would remind the House that the VHI, as a commercial body, recently announced that it does not expect to require Exchequer funding to achieve authorisation.  In these welcome circumstances it is unclear what role is envisaged for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  I commend the VHI and its new management for the great progress they have made.  When we came into government, we were looking at a bill in excess of &euro;250 million for Government to put into the VHI in order to make sure it was authorised.</p><p>Part 3 of the Bill deals with the regulatory status of the VHI.  I am pleased to note that the VHI submitted its application for authorisation to the Central Bank on 16 May.  A consultation period with the bank is now under way.  Subject to authorisation, which is of course a decision for the Central Bank, the VHI will be subject to the very same regulatory and solvency requirements as any other health insurer.</p><p>In addressing VHI's regulatory status to the satisfaction of the EU Commission, officials from my Department, Ireland's Permanent Representation to the EU and VHI officials have held regular and positive meetings with Commission officials.  The latest meeting was held on 20 May 2014.  The Commission was pleased that the VHl's application had been submitted and I am confident that the deadline for addressing the regulatory status of the VHI by 31 December 2014 will be met.  It therefore does not seem to make sense that the Senator would want me to wait until 2015.</p><p>The VHI has recently announced positive annual results for 2013 with &euro;65 million in profit after tax.  The Senator has already outlined that fact.  This is an improvement of &euro;10.7 million over the corresponding period last year, when reported profits were &euro;54.3 million.  It represents a marked improvement on the figures for 2011 of &euro;7. 4 million.  This is a positive indication of the future sustainability of the Irish private health insurance market.</p><p>Additionally, I welcome the fact that VHI has negotiated a further reinsurance deal for a four-year period from 2014 to 2017, inclusive.  The VHI believes it can achieve the solvency levels required by the Central Bank for authorisation without the need for capital from the Exchequer and a consequential State aid application to the EU Commission.  The improved profit level reported recently for 2013, the new reinsurance deal and a reported fall in claims costs of 2.1% for 2013 will, I believe, strengthen the VHI case for authorisation by the Central Bank of Ireland.</p><p>It is a great vote of confidence in the VHI that an investor of the stature of Warren Buffet's company would invest in it, as well as being a great vote of confidence in Ireland.</p><p>The section of the Bill regarding the VHI meeting solvency requirements by the end of 2015 is unnecessary as I have already set an earlier target date of 31 December 2014 by regulation, which is achievable.</p><p>Part 4 of the Bill proposes the dissolution of the Health Insurance Authority and a transfer of its functions to the Central Bank of Ireland.  The Central Bank is the Financial Regulator and, as such, it regulates matters governing the prudential and solvency requirements for financial markets, including the health insurance market.</p><p>The Health Insurance Authority is the independent regulator for the health insurance market and performs a range of specialist functions as set out in the Health Insurance Acts.  These functions include monitoring the market, advising the Minister for Health, operating the risk equalisation fund, provision of consumer information and maintenance of registers.</p><p>In the White Paper on UHI, the Government proposes that the Health Insurance Authority will have substantially increased responsibilities and powers which will include a range of important measures.  For example, under UHI the State will make a financial support payment for those on low incomes.  The Health Insurance Authority will have a key role in recommending the efficient market rate.  The authority will ensure compliance by insurers with the UHI standard plan.  It will play a critical role in regard to cost controls of the insurance market.  It will be responsible for managing a public complaints process for the health insurance market.  The HIA will manage the insolvency fund to be established to ensure that costs associated with insurer insolvency could be met.</p> <p>Another thing it will be empowered to do will be to determine the number of policies available on the market.  As Minister for Health and as a doctor, I believe that 256 different policies from one insurer is set to confuse the customers and not to aid them.  It needs to be much tighter.  I would defer to what the Health Insurance Authority believes is a reasonable number of policies to have in the market.  In my view, therefore, it would be very inappropriate to abolish the Health Insurance Authority given its considerable expertise in the health insurance area and the expanded role proposed for it under universal health insurance.  It would make no sense to abolish the authority and transfer its powers to the Central Bank of Ireland at a time when we will need a strong presence, dedicated to regulating the private health insurance market effectively.</p><p>I have consistently indicated the importance of maintaining a sustainable private health insurance market and I have detailed the significant progress made in this regard.  Taken together, the market reforms I have outlined to the House will help to ensure private health insurance remains affordable in the lead-up to universal health insurance.  The Government will continue to work intensively to ensure a well-functioning insurance system and it will encourage the VHI, as its sole shareholder and as the biggest payer, to ensure it drives down costs, reduces and eliminates fraud and waste, and tackles the issue of clinical audit in a robust fashion to ensure patients are not subjected to unnecessary tests and that the taxpayer, through its subsidies to the VHI and other insurers, is not burdened with additional costs either.</p><p>I thank the Senator for his contribution and acknowledge the considerable work involved in preparing this Bill.  However, I do not believe the Bill's proposals are appropriate or necessary given the work already completed and the planned reforms I have outlined to the House.</p></speech>

Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes this Bill as an important contribution to the debate on addressing what is now a serious crisis in health insurance.  Health insurance is seen by some people as a luxury for the well-off but the reality is that almost half the population has health insurance and probably half the population has medical cards.  Despite the worrying drop in health insurance take-up, many people still have health insurance and pay for it.</p><p>We support letting this Bill go to Committee Stage but I have some concerns about what Senator Quinn proposes.  There is no doubt there is a crisis, not only in this market but in terms of health care for families throughout the country.  An average of 4,000 customers left the private health insurance market every month in the year to March of this year.  Approximately 1,600 customers per week left in the first three months of this year.  That is a serious crisis which is not being tackled by the Government.  Before the general election, Fine Gael, in particular, placed great store on its fair care proposal.  It is unfortunate to have to say to the Minister that the reality is nothing much has happened.  I would say the Minister has had very little support from his colleagues, either in his own party or in the Labour Party, for this proposal.  The Minister gave himself ten years to do this at a time when the HSE itself was only six years old.  At the time, I thought it was a bit rich that even though the HSE was relatively young, Fine Gael was giving itself a longer period of time to implement universal health insurance.  That has not happened and, in the meantime, people are getting out of the habit of paying health insurance.  It is crucially important that Senator Quinn has brought this Bill forward to get the debate going on what we are actually doing in regard to health insurance.</p><p>The Bill seeks to normalise the regulatory position of the VHI by requiring it to meet solvency requirements.  That is obviously required under a legal judgment and must happen at some point.  It provides for the transfer of responsibility for management of the State's ownership of the VHI to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  We certainly have no difficulty with that.</p><p>The Bill provides for the dissolution of the Health Insurance Authority and the transfer of its regulatory functions to the Central Bank of Ireland. We are not as enthusiastic about that.  I am not sure that would be a welcome development and that it is entirely appropriate to treat health insurance simply as a financial product.  It is way more than that and is about people's health and lives.  I am not sure the Central Bank of Ireland has the expertise to regulate these bodies simply as financial organisations.</p><p>We have a consumer problem in health insurance.  The Minister mentioned the hundreds of policies available and the confusion that causes.  We need to bring in what Obamacare did and divide the policies into gold, silver and bronze and have a minimum policy.  Every policy would be classified in one of the categories, which is what Obamacare did.  It would be very useful as one would know what type of policy one was getting.  It is hugely confusing for people currently.  Companies should be able to offer whatever products they want and I certainly would not stop them offering all these products but there are ways around it and of classifying these products and how they good are.</p><p>I am not aware, although I could stand corrected, of any regulation which stipulates what type of cut-off payments or what type of co-payments are legally allowed to be required, what type of services can be offered and whether one can force someone to pay thousands of euro even though he or she has paid health insurance.  Much of that must be dealt with better through legislation and regulation.  The Health Insurance Authority's website is certainly very helpful but that is not the answer.  We need massive simplification by simply labelling the policies.  We also need to know what should be the minimum available on these policies.  I do not know whether that exists in law.  If it does, it certainly has not been looked at for quite some time.</p><p>To cut costs, insurance companies are offering fewer services and are removing hospitals in which people may want to be treated.  The Government is doing little about that.  Regulation and a legislative framework in respect of that need to be drawn up urgently by the Health Insurance Authority because these policies are very expensive and can be hugely necessary at certain times in people's lives.</p><p>I support the fact Senator Quinn has brought forward this Bill.  We certainly support its passing Second Stage.  This is an important debate, but there are much wider issues with health insurance in this country in terms of consumer protection and consumer information.  The Health Insurance Authority's website, although excellent, is not the answer.  We need a much simpler labelling solution for policies.  Our health spokesman, Senator MacSharry, is absent because, I have been told, there is a meeting of the banking inquiry currently.  I suspect this will happen regularly in the House over the next year or more.</p></speech>

I, too, welcome this Bill in the sense of having a debate on this important issue.  Major changes have taken place over the past three years in the health care sector and it is important we debate and scrutinise everything that has happened.  In fairness to Senator Quinn, much work and research have been done on this Bill and I thank him and his assistants on the work they have done in carefully drafting the Bill.  They dealt with three key issues.  I suppose one of the reasons he raises this whole issue is as a result of the European Court of Justice ruling in 2011 and the request by the competition section of the European Commission that the Irish State end the unlimited guarantee provided to the VHI.  In fairness to the Minister and the Department, they have responded to those issues.</p><p>As has been outlined, the three major components of the Bill provide for the transfer of responsibility for the management of the State's ownership of the VHI, require the VHI to meet its solvency requirements and propose the dissolution of the Health Insurance Authority.  The Minister dealt adequately with these three components and has made most of the points I wanted to make, but on the solvency requirement, the VHI made an application on 17 June for authorisation and secured a four year reinsurance deal.  The solvency issue would appear to have been dealt with and it will not be a concern from the State's point of view.</p><p>The fact the VHI made a profit in the past 12 months of more than &euro;65 million shows careful management by the company of the premiums it charges and scrutiny the claims being made.</p> <p> The Minister has responsibility for maintaining the stability of the health insurance market, which is important because, as he noted, more than 44% of the population have private health insurance.  Before the Government took office, a major insurance company, albeit one that is not active in the health area, reinvested a sum of approximately &euro;350 million in other markets, despite the requirement that this money be set aside to ensure sufficient funding was available for claims.  The Minister has an important role in maintaining stability, ensuring uncertainty does not arise, guaranteeing full accountability and protecting policyholders.  It is important that the Department continues to play a key role in these areas. </p><p>Section 3 dissolves the Health Insurance Authority, which plays an important role in the current market.  While major changes have been introduced to the way in which the Central Bank works, I am concerned about the proposal to add another function to the Central Bank following the dissolution of the Health Insurance Authority.  We need to have one body with the principal function of ensuring everything is above board in the health insurance sector.</p><p>Health insurance is an extremely important industry in which large sums are paid over by policyholders to health care providers.  The Health Insurance Authority plays an important role in regulating the issue of solvency and ensuring insurance companies comply with current regulations.  Its role also includes monitoring the insurance market, advising the Minister and operating the risk equalisation fund.  This fund is extremely important because one insurance company, the VHI, is carrying a high proportion of older policyholders who are responsible for a greater number of claims than other age groups.  Risk equalisation is an important tool in ensuring he age profile of policyholders is properly managed. </p><p>The Health Insurance Authority also provides consumer information.  It is important that information is provided on the products provided by insurance companies.  While the companies will engage in their own marketing efforts, it is important to have an independent authority monitoring the market and ensuring correct information is available to consumers. </p><p>I welcome this debate.  Major changes will be made to the health service through the introduction of universal health insurance.  It is important to have proper structures in place for the transition and the Minister is taking the correct steps as he moves towards the introduction of universal health insurance. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-06-25a.63" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1147" speakername="John Crown" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014062500018#R00200"><p>It is 21 years since I returned to Ireland.  At that time, I rapidly came to the conclusion that the health system was in fundamental need of reform.  The key problems that were obvious to me were the general poor quality, extraordinary inefficiency and highly unequal nature of the health system.  It struck me that the key problem was that we had two fundamentally different health systems operating in parallel.  The first followed what is known as the Beveridge model used by the British National Health Service, under which general taxation revenue is doled out by the central government in a prospective fashion to institutions which are told to live within a budget and cut their cloth, as it were.  The second is more closely related to the Bismarckian model, the first model of socialised medicine which was introduced in Germany in the 1880s by the Iron Duke himself.  Under this model, people have mandatory insurance and the amount they pay is fixed to the amount they earn.  Under this system, a form of progressive taxation applies in that rich people pay more than poor people and people with higher incomes pay more than people with smaller incomes to obtain the same level of health care.  At the end of the process, everybody has a freely negotiable insurance instrument which he or she can take to any doctor or hospital which must, by mandate, accept his or her custom.  We need to introduce this model here.</p><p>The Bismarckian model in Germany survived two world wars, a great depression, the Nazis, the division and reunification of the country and the many problems that arose from the economic consequences of unity.  It is extraordinarily successful, by far the most successful model for health systems in place in large countries.  It is, for example, much more successful than the British model and delivers much better access to care and much better quality outcomes than the national health system. </p><p>Countries which follow the alternative model, the Beveridge model, occupy the bottom five places in the OECD rating of access to care, with Ireland in last place and the United Kingdom in second last place.  This rating is calculated on the basis of information on waiting lists and so forth.  There are other moral hazards associated with the Beveridge model, a major one being that there is far too much lining up of all sources of information and power on one side of the health care equation.  The same people run, manage, provide, regulate and pay for the service and they have a powerful motivation to ensure the service is perceived in a good light.  They have at their disposal extraordinarily powerful tools to ensure the maximum positive spin is placed on any outcomes associated with the service.  A  significant amount of literature is bubbling through in the United Kingdom to show that whistleblowers are experiencing problems, with doctors, nurses and others who point out deficiencies in the British health system being victimised.  A near religious devotion is shown to the notion that if one disagrees with any aspect of the national health service, it can only be because one is an anti-social person, rather than someone seeking to point out problems.  </p><p>The reforms the Minister hopes to introduce will have the effect of delivering the type of high quality service provided in the top five countries in the OECD ranking.  It will give us guaranteed access to care based on need as well as social subsidisation and solidarity in the sense that the rich will pay more than the poor for the same service.  It will also have the effect of de-bureaucratising the system.  The Minister must study carefully the successful models in place in Canada, which has a single payer system, and Israel, which has a number of not-for-profit insurance companies and one or two for-profit companies.  Above all, he must examine the German system under which not-for-profit insurers compete with for-profit companies and the custom is to require citizens to take mandatory insurance.  Moreover, in Germany people who do not have an income have their insurance paid for by people like us who have an income, which is as it should be. </p><p>With respect to the current arrangements, I sometimes become a little nervous because some of the reforms taking place in the health service are not pointing us in the direction of the type of insurance model in place in Germany but instead in the direction of propagation, as it were, of the Beveridge model of central budgeting.  One wonders how, in a competitive environment, having a relatively small number of hospital groups will work and people who have their own insurance will be able to decide to go elsewhere.  One wonders if the skill set exists in the Department and Health Service Executive to manage such a radically different health service. </p><p>My colleagues in the Fianna F&aacute;il Party have raised objections to the insurance model based on the likelihood that it will result in the introduction of an additional stealth tax.  It will be an additional tax unless one provides that people can write off this payment against their existing tax.  People currently pay for a level of health care from general taxation.  If they are to be required to pay into a separate ring-fenced fund that is kept out of the clutches of the Exchequer and used for health purposes only, there must, by rights, be a commensurate decline in what individuals pay for their health care.  Otherwise, the new system will create an additional tax.  Parenthetically, this should also have been the case with the water tax.  We are always told we should not whinge about the water tax because water is not free must be paid for.  </p> <p>The reality, however, is that the tax we pay already covers water services.  If we are now facing a ring-fenced tax for water services, why is our overall tax bill not reducing by the amount taken under the new charge?  What we are seeing here is effectively double taxation.</p><p>There is a need for fundamental reform of the health system.  I am supportive of Senator Quinn's Bill as a step along the way, but the scope of the revolution that needs to take place is absolutely vast.  There is an conflict of interest in that the Minister as sole shareholder in VHI is also the person who dictates the terms of employment for hospital specialists, as he did several years ago when he made the decision to impose certain changes in respect of the employment of hospital-based specialists.  One could argue that he is exercising a rather monopolistic position by dictating the conditions under which people can work in private practice and the fees they are paid for private activities while, at the same time, having responsibility for governing the public system.  In so doing, he is preventing the natural competition that should be there.  Senator Quinn's Bill would have the effect of resolving part of that conflict of interest by removing the stewardship of VHI from the Minister.</p><p>The Minister has great responsibilities in running the health service.  I wish him all the best for a long career in his current role and in implementing the insurance reforms that are desperately needed.  He is the first Minister who has actually tried to do after an election what he promised to do before it.  I hope he gets the opportunity to see those reforms through, in which case I will support him 100%.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-06-25a.65" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1117" speakername="John Gilroy" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014062500019#S00200"><p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, to the House and thank Senator Feargal Quinn for bringing forward these proposals.  Although I do not propose to support the legislation, it affords us a welcome opportunity to discuss issues relating to the health insurance market  The explanatory memorandum refers to the significant decline in recent years in the numbers availing of private health insurance.  Indeed, some 266,000 people have left the market in that period.  As the Minister said, we must find a way to ensure that as many people as possible can retain their health insurance.  The Minister pointed to some of the market reforms he has introduced to that end and to initiatives such as lifetime community rating, which offers a form of discounted access to the market according to need and age.</p><p>The explanatory memorandum notes that health insurance providers are required to have a solvency margin of 150%.  VHI recently announced that it has free cash reserves of &euro;389 million, which gives it a solvency ratio, at 160%, over and above what is required.  As such, the need for this element of reform, as set out in Senator Quinn's Bill, is unfounded.  With 1.1 million customers, VHI is the largest provider of health care insurance in the Irish market.  It is the best guarantor of community rating and risk equalisation, which we all agree are necessary and desirable.  It is, of course, necessary to ensure a level playing pitch, but there are some aspects of the public good which the market is simply not able to provide.  Health care is one of them.  The Minister noted in his contribution that we can see some evidence of a lack of dedication to the public good on the part of private companies, which, notwithstanding their denials, are offering market segmentation strategies.  We know this is happening and we know it is not in our interest.</p><p>VHI achieved a profit of &euro;65 million last year, coming on top of a figure of &euro;54 million in the previous year, and its operating costs are down.  There has been much criticism of the company historically, but these numbers show it has taken significant steps towards reforming itself.  While it was necessary to impose a 3.1% increase in premium costs this year, that price rise is significantly below what was sought by its competitors.  The four-year Berkshire Hathaway reinsurance scheme, which will cost VHI &euro;20 million per year, means the Exchequer probably will not have to close the &euro;200 million gap in the company's reserves.  Taking the reforms VHI has initiated itself together with those imposed on it by the Minister, the Health Insurance Authority and the market itself, plus the vote of confidence by Berkshire Hathaway, the outlook is very promising for the long-term sustainability of the company.</p><p>The proposal in the Bill to transfer regulatory authority from the Health Insurance Authority to the Central Bank is not one I support.  The HIA has the capacity to perform certain specialised functions that are not available to the Central Bank.  When it comes to balance sheet issues or prudential issues of regulation, the Central Bank is the place to be.  However, the authorisation sought by VHI later on in the year addresses that aspect of the Bill's concerns.</p><p>The contention of a perceived conflict arising from the Minister's function as shareholder as well as steward is to be resolved under Senator Quinn's proposals by moving responsibility from the Department of Health to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  This is not a proposal I support.  Again, the HIA has specialised functions that are simply not available in that Department.  Moreover, transferring responsibility in this manner would not be consistent with the ongoing and longer-term objective of the Government and Minister to introduce a system of universal health insurance.</p><p>I could comment further on the proposals but the Acting Chairman has indicated that my time is up.  The provision of health insurance should not be determined by the identity of the provider, whether private operator or the public sector.  The determination as to whether a system of voluntary health insurance works must be based on whether it is efficient in delivering the best level of care at the best cost to the Exchequer.  While we do not propose to support the Bill before us today, I thank Senator Quinn for affording us an opportunity to air some of the issues relating to VHI and other health insurance companies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-06-25a.66" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1123" speakername="Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014062500019#S00300"><p>Like many other speakers, I welcome the thrust of the Bill and acknowledge the work done by Senator Feargal Quinn and his staff in bringing it forward.  It allows us a welcome opportunity to debate a range of issues which remain to be resolved relating to the health insurance market.  The difficulties in this regard are borne out by the fact, as acknowledged by the Minister, that many families and individuals can no longer afford private health insurance.  This has a knock-on effect on the public system and a primary knock-on effect on employment and service provision in private hospitals, as we saw last year and again this year.</p><p>These proposals come in the wake of the case taken against Ireland by the European Commission at the European Court of Justice in 2011.  The finding in that case was that the same regulatory or solvency requirements were not being brought to bear on VHI as those applying to other insurance providers, and this is having a destabilising effect on the Irish insurance market.  VHI is the front runner in that market, providing cover to the majority of those who take out health insurance in this country.</p> <p>It is the market-setter in terms of price as well.  It is also adding to the inflationary cost of providing health cover here regardless of whether one likes it.  For example, Aviva Health Insurance increased its prices by between 2% and 23% on adult premiums in March this year.  VHI increased premiums on 12 of its plans in April or May by between 5% and 23% for adults.  Laya Healthcare has finished its promotional price for children on its essential connect family plan on 1 May and the prices have increased here as well.<br />Coupled with the price increases and the current economic situation, we have seen a substantial decrease in those availing of private health insurance.  When considering the categories of people who are choosing not to avail of private health insurance or not renew their premiums, it is startling that the highest number is in the 18 to 29 age bracket, where more than 73,000 chose not to renew their premiums in the period from 2010 to 2013.  In my age group of 30 to 39, some 55,000 people chose not to renew their premiums.  If those people do not renew their premiums at that age, they will find it very difficult to obtain premiums in the years that lie ahead because, of course, the premiums will increase.  While it might not be evident at the moment, that will lead to a crisis in the years ahead.<br />That is having a knock-on effect in the private hospitals, with the Mater Private Hospital announcing 95 redundancies, representing 10% of the workforce.  Dermot Goode of <i>healthinsurancesavings.ie</i>has said that there is a serious risk that one or more private hospitals would close this year.  In January the Mount Carmel Hospital went into liquidation, and the Blackrock Clinic and Galway Clinic have reduced their profits.  While I am not advocating the support of private hospitals, I am saying that if those private hospitals are not offering the same level of care it is because fewer people are availing of private health insurance.<br />If a family does not renew private health insurance it is going into the public system, putting more pressure on it.  That is having a rippling, knock-on effect, as we mentioned on the Order of Business today, leading to the logjam in the public system at the moment.  It is an issue that needs to be addressed urgently.  I acknowledge that the Minister is taking steps in that direction.  Politically there should be a joined-up approach and one should not play politics with this on every occasion.  However, it is one of the issues that is crippling our health service at the moment.<br />I again acknowledge the work of Senator Quinn.  I appeal to the Minister even at this stage to accept the thrust of Senator Quinn's Bill, allow it to go to Committee Stage and work with Senator Quinn on amendments or revisiting parts of the legislation so that at least the Bill can progress without dividing the House.  I hope the Minister and Government Senators will accede to that.</p></speech>

He has been a pioneer in introducing legislation in this House, but I do not see how the Bill fits into the vision of a fair, equitable and efficient health-care system that I would like to see in this State.  The reality is that people are dispensing with private health insurance in droves because of the cost and because in many cases people are living in poverty.  People are in low-paid jobs and can no longer afford to pay the premiums.</p><p>I am deeply uncomfortable with the language we use regarding the market and health care.  I come from the position that health care should be provided as of right based on health need alone.  There should be no institutionalised queue jumping.  There should be no need for private health insurance.  If somebody needs to get private health insurance and wants to pay for better care, it should be fully covered by them and it should not be subsidised by the taxpayer at a time when we are taking money out of the health service, as this and the previous Government have done.</p><p>When the Minister for Health is not in the House, on the Order of Business on a regular basis we have Senators who call for his resignation because of the disastrous health-care situation.  However, when he comes into the House they are strangely silent or mute.  I take the view that if say something when he is not here, I should say it when he is here, which is that he should resign.  He should resign as Minister for Health for a range of reasons.  Even if he resigns and is replaced by a Minister of like mind, we will still have the same policy positions and the same disaster in our health service.  We had the complete disaster of the medical cards which has now been acknowledged by the Minister and the Taoiseach as a complete fiasco.  It was unfair on all those-----</p></speech>

It will not work and the Minister has not been able to deliver it.  I cannot let this opportunity go when the Minister is in the Chamber without reminding him of what is happening in my city of Waterford where we do not have proper dermatology services.

Opening it up further to private health insurance will not work.  The only system that will work and be fair and equitable is one funded through general taxation and delivered free at the point of delivery and based on equality and health need alone.  That is the only way in which health care should be provided.</p> <p>Any other way will continue the two-tier system and the inequalities we have in health care.  Unfortunately, as long as the Minister, Deputy Reilly, is Minister, and as long as there is a Fine Gael Minister for Health, we will get more of the same.</p></speech>

However, I do not appreciate some of what he said.  In his speech he indicated that he had urged all the private health insurers to do everything possible to keep down the cost of private health insurance.  To me, that sounds a little like the Minister for transport saying 20 years ago that he had urged all the airlines to keep their costs down.  It did not work.  We paid &pound;299 to go to London to the two existing airlines.  The situation did not change until Ryanair came on the scene and we now pay approximately &euro;19 instead.</p><p>I admire much of what Senator Cullinane said but I also disagree with him as I believe the marketplace will give us a better deal.  The Minister's approach in saying that he has urged all the private health insurers to do everything they can to keep down the cost is a long way from what could happen.  I do not think there is any evidence that new insurance companies ever refused to recruit older people.  If there was any evidence it would have emerged and if insurance companies had evidence they would have made it known.</p><p>I am disappointed the Minister has not shown a greater degree of openness to the objectives of the Bill.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill urged him to accept the Bill in order that we could consider it on the next Stage.  The diagnosis and prescription to help fix our broken health insurance market has been set down by the European Court of Justice.  However, it seems that the Minister and his officials are deep in denial.  The failure of the Department to adhere to a date for the regularisation of VHI&rsquo;s unusual position suggests to me that it lives by the words of St. Augustine who pleaded for the Lord to make him pure but not just yet.  There is evidence of such an approach by the Department.</p><p>The Minister might not like many aspects of the Bill but I am convinced that it contains core elements that are needed in order to restore stability to the health insurance market.  The kind of stability to which I refer is stability of membership and pricing.  When it comes to Government policy and the functioning of the health insurance sector, the consumer needs to take centre stage in the Department&rsquo;s thinking, which is not the case at present.  Policy decisions affecting the health insurance sector should no longer be driven or influenced by decisions which are taken solely in the best interests of the VHI or the HSE.  I thank the Minister for attending and giving the Bill his attention.  However, it would be better to leave the Bill on the Order Paper so that we could consider Committee Stage changes at a later point.

I thank her, as well as the Minister for Social Protection, for indicating the Government will accept this Labour Party motion.  I am also delighted Senator van Turnhout will second it as it is a genuine cross-House effort between Labour and the Independents.<br />This motion addresses an issue which has not been of enormous public concern to date in Ireland but has become an increasingly serious issue in other countries.  I am grateful to the Labour Women group, and Mary Flynn in particular, for bringing this issue to my attention some months ago on foot of a motion that Labour Women put to a Labour Party conference some years ago.  This motion concerns the legal minimum age at which persons may get married and the different, but overlapping, practice of child marriage and forced marriage.  Child marriage is where one or both parties to a marriage are legally a child, namely under 18 years of age.  A forced marriage is a marriage in which one or both parties are married against their consent or free will.  This can occur where one or both parties are over 18 years of age.<br />Clearly, it is much more likely that a person's will could be overborne when they are not regarded as an adult in law.  This is where we do have an overlap.  A child is much more susceptible to influence and has fewer legal rights to assert.  For these reasons, international conventions acknowledge the need both to ensure protection against forced marriage and protection of children within any law of marriage.  The right to marry in the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Article 16 is reserved to men and women in full age.  Article 16(2) states: &quot;Marriage shall be entered into only with the free and full consent.&quot;</p> <p>The 1962 UN Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age for Marriage provides, in Article 2, that State parties:<blockquote><br />shall take legislative action to specify a minimum age for marriage.  No marriage shall be legally entered into by any person under this age, except where a competent authority has granted a dispensation as to age, for serious reasons, in the interest of the intending spouses.</blockquote>The CEDAW, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, prohibits child marriage in Article 16.2.  In addition, a UNFPA report says that since 1994 more than 158 countries have passed legislation raising the minimum age of marriage to the age of adulthood, that is 18 years, albeit that many do allow exemptions on court application.  Therefore, we have near universal commitment to tackle both the practice of forces marriage and to end child marriage.  Nonetheless we see very high levels of under age marriage - of child marriage - particularly in developing countries.  The issue has also been highlighted in many developed countries. <br />Senator van Turnhout will speak more on the international context, particularly on the child protection context internationally.  However, I want to mention certain recent legal developments in Britain before I turn to examine Irish law in more detail.  <br />In Britain the prevalence of forced marriages and public concern about same has become a real issue.  In 2013, the UK Government's forced marriage unit dealt with 1,302 cases in which 82% of victims were female, 15% were under the age of 15 years and the cases involved communities from 74 different countries.  In response to the problem two recent legislative changes in Britain have been made.  First, the Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Act 2007 allowed the courts to issue forced marriage protection orders in order to protect individuals who were being coerced into marriage.  Second, we had the passage of the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014.  Among its provisions is one which makes it a crime, in England and Wales, to force someone to marry with a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment.  A very well known charity called Freedom Charity, set up by Aneeta Prem to educate young people in Britain about forced marriage, has pushed for the legislation and been very approving of this law.<br />In Ireland there has been no real public debate on the issue of either child marriage or forced marriage.  To my knowledge, this is the first debate on the issue in either House of the Oireachtas and I am delighted that the Seanad had led on this matter.  Senator van Turnhout raised the matter previously in a debate here and I have previously raised it with the Minister but I think this is the first full debate on the matter.<br />We have not passed any specific law concerning forced marriages and we still allow marriage to take place where one or both parties are under 18 years, on a court application for an exemption.  There is no provision in Irish law for any sort of child protection order to be made, or indeed any contact with child welfare agencies, where such an application for an exemption is made.  Of course we do have laws prohibiting coercion, at common law, and a marriage can be annulled if one or both parties have been forced or coerced.<br />The relevant legislation to which the motion refers is the Family Law Act 1995 and the Civil Registration Act 2004.  Section 31 of the Family Law Act 1995 provides that the minimum legal age at which people can get married in Ireland is 18 years.  However, section 33 allows an application to be made to the court for an exemption from this rule where one or both are aged under 18.  Section 2(2) of the Civil Registration Act 2004 has maintained the facility in section 33 to apply for the exemption.  Therefore, a relatively recent law still maintains this facility.<br />Senator van Turnhout and the Labour Party group are concerned that keeping the exemption in place may facilitate the practice of forced marriages.  It may lead to young girls, in particular, but also boys being coerced into entering marriages.  We put forward the motion in the context of a desire to protect the welfare of children and to ensure, in particular, that women and girls are protected.  Thus we argue that the State should consider whether to remove or amend the statutory provision thereby ensuring robust enforcement and adherence to the minimum marriage age of 18.<br />Our concern is that the exemption facility, provided in section 33, offers no protection to minors.  Let us look at the practicality aspect.  Applications for exemptions are made to the Circuit Court in private, there is no public record of them, and there are no guidelines on the criteria for granting the exemption.  In addition, there is no provision for the minors to be legally represented at the hearing or for the HSE and child protection authorities to be notified. <br />The Oireachtas Library &amp;amp; Research Service has produced a very helpful note which tells us that in 2012, according to CSO data, there were 28 marriages registered in Ireland where either the groom, bride or both were under 18 years.  In 21 of the marriages registered the bride was 16 or 17 years and the groom was 18 yeas or over.  The Minister of State's note told us that between 2004 and 2013 almost 400 parties to a marriage were under the age of 19.  Clearly, this is an issue in Ireland because section 33 is being used.  One of the unknowns when we commenced the investigation was whether this was an issue but clearly it is.  We do not know the circumstances of the 28 cases but we do know that children are getting married in accordance with the exemption in Ireland.  We know very little more about the matter.<br />We have a High Court judgment which unfortunately is unpublished but was reported on by RTE on 18 June 2013.  It referred to the fact that Mr. Justice MacMenamin, in the High Court, was dealing with an application for what he described as an arranged marriage.  He annulled the marriage which had been contracted between a 16-year old girl and a 29-year old man.  He said, as reported by RTE, that in certain circumstances the provision for marriage exemptions may give rise to significant child welfare issues.  He commented that legislation may be needed to assist young people who are placed in arranged or forced marriages, and that the system for seeking exemptions from the legal age limit for marriage requires review, as it raises child welfare questions in certain cases.  In particular, he said that a question arose as to whether the Circuit Court, when asked to hear an application under section 33 - and we know that there were 28 such applications in 2012, or there must have been, giving rise to thee 28 marriages - at the very least should be obliged to give notice to the HSE to inquire into the protection and welfare circumstances of the child in respect of whom an exemption from the marriage age is being sought.<br />I must say that in the particular case at issue there were very serious child protection concerns and the child concerned had been, I think, in care.  The judge also commented that the State agencies had behaved appropriately at all times.  However, he was critical - indirectly I suppose - of the Legislature for failing to ensure that there were protection measures put in place where applications of this sort are made.<br />It is in light of that case, and the concerns that have been raised with me by Labour Party women, and with Senator van Turnhout on the chid protection side, that we wanted to bring this issue to the fore.  We seek to pre-empt any abuse of the rights of children that may occur in Ireland in the future and we have seen occur in our neighbouring jurisdiction, and certainly in other developed and developing countries worldwide.  <br />Clearly, this is a difficult area because even if we amend or abolish the facility to apply for an exemption, found in section 33 of the 1995 Act, we still have an issue to deal with, the problem of coerced or forced marriage for those who are over 18 years.  We should then consider legislating to ensure that it is a crime to force anyone, even someone over 18, into marriage.  In other words, we should follow the British model.  <br />I anticipate that the Minister will establish an interdepartmental group, on foot of this motion, to consider the issue.  The group will need to consider age limits generally.  That may seem somewhat inconsistent when the Constitutional Convention has recommended lowering the voting age to 16 and recently the Oireachtas committee on education and social protection recommended an age limit of 16 for young people who wish to register a change of gender.  I think it is entirely consistent with child protection to say that we can consider lowering the voting age, and we can consider allowing people to register a change of gender at a slightly younger age.  Under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997, a child, at 16 years, can consent to medical treatment.  That is entirely consistent because those are decisions that affect that child.  They are decisions we can allow a child to make and recognise his or her own autonomy.  However, marriage is different because it is a legal contract between two parties.  Therefore, it involves particular issues and concerns around coercion which do not arise when a minor makes a decision, for example, on how to vote.  I think it is appropriate, in the context of concerns about forced marriage worldwide, and in the context of the international conventions that I referred to and internationally in general, that we would look to keep a line under the legal minimum for marriage at 18.  <br />Many years ago in Ireland it was the norm for people to get married much younger.  Now the average age for marriage has moved well above the legal minimum of 18.  We seek to preserve and protect childhood.  I know that many people have fought very hard to ensure that 18 would be the age up to which young people would receive protections, for example, within the criminal justice system and so on.  Therefore, it is appropriate that we would regard 18 as the legal minimum age at which a person may enter a legal contract of marriage.</p></speech>

I would like to thank Senator Bacik, who like me has worked on this issue, for initiating the motion before us.  I am very happy to second the motion and thank her for her co-operation.</p><p>I raised this issue back in May during the Seanad debate on the abducted schoolgirls in Nigeria that Boko Haram had threatened to sell into forced marriage.  Like many people, I felt helpless looking on at the situation and it made me wonder if there was anything we could do.  For me, this is one area that  we can do something about.  We can send the clear message that the age for marriage is 18.  That is something that we must take responsibility for doing.  During the debate I made the worrying correlation between Nigeria and Ireland because, in certain court ordered special circumstances, exemptions to the ordinary legal age for marriage of 18 years can be made.  That means Ireland does not currently prohibit all child marriages. </p> <p>It is important to note that Ireland is bound by a number of international human rights laws and standards, the provisions of which are profoundly incompatible with child marriage, for example, the International Bill of Human Rights, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, CEDAW, the Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the slave trade, and institutions and practices similar to slavery.<br />In September 2013, Ireland, with its fellow EU member states, supported the United Nations Human Rights Council resolution, Strengthening Efforts to Prevent and Eliminate Child, Early and Forced Marriage: challenges, achievements, best practice, and implementation gaps.  The European Union as a negotiating block at the international fora condemns the prevalence of child marriages yet makes provision for it in a number of its own jurisdictions, for example, in Germany and Italy.  In Germany, if one of the parties to be wed is at least 16 years old, but not yet 18 years old, the German age of emancipation, that party needs to seek approval from the family court in order to be wed.  Consent of the concerned party's parents is not sufficient.  In Italy, a sworn statement of consent to the marriage is required by the parents or legal guardian if the child is under the age of 18.<br />Exploitation of young girls through violence and abuse, including forced and arranged marriages, is a global problem.  According to Girls not Brides, every year, approximately 14 million girls are married before they turn 18 across countries, cultures and religions.  They are robbed of their childhood and denied their rights to health, education and security.  According to UNFPA, by 2030, the number of child brides marrying each year will have grown from 14.2 million in 2010 to 15.1 million, a 14% rise if the current trend continue.<br />In March 2014, the Iraqi Justice Minister tabled a Bill to allow girls as young as nine years old to marry.  While reports have indicated that it is unlikely that the law will pass, it represents a worrying trend toward religious tendencies usurping girls' human rights.  In response to the Bill, prominent Iraqi human rights activist Hana Adwar said: &quot;The law represents a crime against humanity and childhood.  Married underage girls are subjected to physical and psychological suffering.&quot;  This contention is known to be true.  The more than 60 million girls married under the age of 18 worldwide have a higher risk of death and injury during childbirth, fewer marketable skills, lower lifetime income, a higher rate of HIV, exposure to domestic violence, and illness for themselves and their families than their unwed peers.<br />It is inappropriate and, frankly, contradictory that we in Ireland speak out against child marriage in countries such as India, Nigeria, Malawi, Iraq, Nepal, Ethiopia and Bangladesh while our Statute Book still allows for exemptions to the normal marriage age, and fails to specify a minimum age for such exemptions.  As outlined by Senator Ivana Bacik in 2012, some 28 marriages were registered under the exemption.  As stated by the Senator, the exemption threshold is very broad and it uses standard language giving the court wide discretion.  This means that decisions pertaining to allowing children to marry are made behind closed doors, often subject to the <i>in camera</i>rule since the parties to the application are children.  Yet, from the moment they are married, they become adults and are outside all the child protection laws.  We never hear about those decisions and those vulnerable children.  In this regard, the Family Law Reporting Project has come across many of these cases, and may be able to shine a light on the prevalence and general circumstances in which they occur.<br />There is no written judgment in the High Court case referenced in this motion.  The case concerns the annulment of a 16 year old girl's marriage to a 29 year old man on the basis of the girl's lack of capacity to give true consent.  How can a 16 year old girl give consent to a marriage to a 29 year old man?  I am not speaking of a case in Iraq but in Ireland.  This happened in Ireland.  However, Mr. Justice MacMenamin felt the case raised concerns of such a magnitude that it warranted his making a general comment about the danger of the legal loophole to children.  We are faced with a choice.  As the Legislature, we must provide guidance for the courts to implement the statutory provisions as intended or, and this would be my preference, we can lead by example and remove or amend the statutory provision currently allowing minors to marry.  I believe Ireland should send a clear signal to children here that we protect childhood and that the age for marriage is 18 years.  We have had excellent debates here on protecting childhood.  We are talking about consent, the age for which should be set at 18 years.  That would mean that Ireland, as part of the European Union as a negotiating block, is not saying that it can understand cultural differences and our courts can adjudicate, but we do not trust the courts in other countries.  We need to send out a message that we are setting the age at 18 years without exemption.</p></speech>

As spokesperson for children I welcome the motion, for which I thank Senator Ivana Bacik and Senator Jillian van Turnhout.  It goes without saying that all children in the State should have adequate protection of their rights.  The Family Law Act 1995 provides that the minimum legal age at which people can get married in Ireland is 18.  However, section 33 allows a couple to apply to the court for an exemption from this rule where one or both are aged 18 or under.  I hate to admit it but I was unaware that this happened.  As a mother of a 17 year old girl I would be horrified at the thought that she would be able to marry.  I would be equally horrified if my son was legally able to marry at 16 years of age.</p><p>Anybody who deals with teenagers knows they change from day to day.  They go from being big fans of One Direction to suddenly being big fans of The Script and vehemently deny they ever liked One Direction because it is for children.  They change.  They are maturing and exploring life and all it has to offer.  They change from week to week.  Marriage is a lifelong commitment.  At 16 years of age our children are vastly different from what they will be at 18 years of age.  Frankly, I find the data from the Central Statistics Office very worrying.  In 2012, some 28 marriages were registered where either the bride or groom or both were under the age of 18.  In the majority, 21 cases, the bride was 16 or 17 years of age and the groom was 18 years or over.</p><p>International human rights bodies have agreed that 18 is the appropriate minimum age for marriage.  A UN report shows that since 1994 more than 158 countries have passed legislation raising the minimum age of marriage to 18 years.  I am mindful that Irish society has an increased cultural and religious diversity.  This is a good thing because for too long we were influenced by one all powerful church.  However, some religions have a culture of arranged marriages.  That is fine - each to their own.  However, when it comes to a child under the age of 18, I wonder if he or she has enough maturity to make a decision that potentially ties him or her to someone for the rest of his or her life.  If a girl or a boy is getting married at 16 or 17 years of age, it is highly unlikely that they are financially independent of their parents and, therefore, are vulnerable to parental coersion.  There is no legislation in place in Ireland which addresses the issue of forced marriages or marriages where there is no real consent.  </p><p>We are here as legislators and many of us are parents.  I am aware that a High Court judge recently expressed concern at exemptions to marriage age restrictions following a court annulment of an arranged marriage, as Senator Jillian van Turnhout said, of a 16 year old girl to a 29 year old man.  The judge further said that the system for seeking exemptions from the legal age limit for marriage needs review.  The judge is right and I agree with him.  I welcome the motion.</p></speech>

I was treating the Cathaoirleach in the neutral aspect that chairs ought to be in.  Of course, the Cathaoirleach knows what I mean.  However, I acknowledge the Chair.</p><p>If, as Senator van Turnhout has said, we are here to set example, to take a lead in the world and to be able to make any statement at all about our own care for our young people, then we have to do that by example.  Fine words never cut it, and certainly not in this case.  It seems the Senator has raised an important matter that can probably be dealt with relatively straightforwardly.  I hope that is the case.</p><p>Most of the reasons that might have existed prior to this or the past century for young girls being forced into marriage for social reasons, for political reasons, to avoid poverty or for religious reasons have collapsed in the modern world and we accept that the risks posed to young women by being married too young, and, potentially, being mothers far too young, certainly endanger their life in a straightforward fashion.  In addition, they almost certainly endanger their psychological and mental health with regard to their loss of childhood and all that goes with that.  The research is not to be questioned as there is so much of it.</p><p>We will have listened over many years to all those who visited countries where there is less advanced thinking in this matter and brought back the stories of those young girls, many of them children aged five, six and seven, being forced to marry, and we can still be shocked by that.  We should be shocked by ourselves here, that, in 2012, the last year for which figures are available, 28 young persons, or slightly more than one every fortnight, were married having got consent from the courts.  That is quite a lot.  Let us not be pointing figures at others.  The evidence is clear that such loss of childhood and forced arrangement is anti-woman.  Let us face it now.  That is what it boils down to.  I, for one, certainly would like to see that changed.</p><p>I believe in the equality of men and women, and where we can change laws and improve them to improve how we treat women, particularly young women in how they will grow up, it falls to us to do so.  Therefore, this motion is important in its own right, but it is more important in a wider picture in regard to our own views of women to which I alluded earlier in my observation about the state of the Chamber today.</p><p>I thank the Minister of State.  I hope and trust that we can make speedy progress.  I am not one generally for rushing matters merely for the sake of rushing them, but this is something for which there should be clear consent.  We now can set about fixing it so that we become one of those countries that states the minimum age must be 18 years and there will be no exceptions to that.</p></speech>

I also welcome this motion and fully support it.  What we are discussing here is the protection of children.  This motion is premised on the judgment of Mr. Justice John MacMenamin in the High Court last year.  The judge has subsequently been appointed to the Supreme Court.</p><p>Mr. Justice MacMenamin has vast experience in the area of child protection prior to and since his appointment to the bench, and was to the fore, prior to any Government action, in ensuring that the best interests of the child were the paramount consideration in any case that came before him.  Members should note that the judge was in charge of the minors' list in the High Court for three years and delivered some important decisions on the rights of children.  In other words, the views of this judge need to be taken seriously.</p><p>Whilst I recognise that there are many different cultural practices and wishes in Ireland, particularly due to our increased ethnic and religious diversity, any wish not to offend a minority cannot take the place of the common good and society's need to protect children.  In this regard there are several issues highlighted by the judge that we need to address at a minimum.  These include the fact that an application to the courts to exempt a minor from the age restriction can be made without any notice to authorities, including child protection; the lack of legislation directly addressing forced marriages; and the need for a designated person or agency to provide support in such circumstances.  Of course, none of the insufficiencies in the system noted by the judge prevents the Oireachtas legislating to remove the exemption fully, should it wish to do so.</p><p>Members should note that in England and Wales, parents of children forced into marriage now face up to seven years in prison and the practice has been outlawed in Scotland for some time.  I would voice one note of caution.  There is a distinction to be made, as in the new English legislation, between a forced marriage where one or both of the parties does not consent and an arranged marriage where the parties consent but can refuse to marry if they so wish.  We should keep that in mind and not confuse the two.</p><p>I thank Senator Bacik for putting forward this motion.  I refer, in closing, to the comment from our colleague, Senator Van Turnhout, that 14 million girls marry before the age of 18 annually throughout the world.  We cannot criticise this practice internationally and yet have insufficient protections domestically to stop it happening here.</p></speech>

My grandmother told me in one of those confidential moments one can only have with one's grandmother, not with one's parents, that her marriage to my grandfather had been sorted.  I am fully convinced that many of us sitting here in this room today are the progeny of arranged marriages sorted by somebody in the local village who knew the families well and made the arrangements that, perhaps, shy retiring men could not make for themselves, etc.  We all have read the John B. Keane <i>Letters of a Love-Hungry Farmer</i>, and the particularly gruesome end to that trial comes when the person concerned finds himself in an unfortunate rural situation where no arranged marriage was prepared for him and he ended up, in his 50s, living in a rural area with no arranged marriage.  I raise this, not to be whimsical but purely to say that the fact we live in a society where arranged marriages were the norm a number of decades ago does not take away from the situation we are dealing with today and the reason we are debating this motion.  It is important to distinguish between the experience in Ireland all of those decades ago and the situation today because arranged marriages are now firmly a thing of the past.  While I would love to be the one who suggests to my daughter that I would arrange her marriage for her, we have to be cognisant of the fact that this is a serious motion and it is one that we must take very seriously.<br />Forced marriage, as the UN statistics show, is a real issue in the world today.  We, in Ireland, in all of those years gone by, were not dealing with immigrant cultures living in our community.  We were not dealing with the idea of child marriage.  We were not dealing with the idea of somebody effectively being sold into slavery at a very young age without having any say over her own future.  All of that having been said, we have our own murky past to deal with.  There is the fact that many Irish women who did not accept what their families said found themselves living in mental institutions and county homes for the rest of their lives and we cannot simply place this in the remote distances of the past.<br />We have to acknowledge that this is a multicultural society and children are the victims of forced marriage.  Internationally, we cannot remove ourselves from that picture.  We have to acknowledge that it is a practice, as has been acknowledged already, similar to slavery and it was made illegal in international law nearly 60 years ago.  It is easy to say this is something that happens, in remote Pakistan or remote India or, indeed, in looking at the way society is developing in countries such as Iraq, and the practices of ISIS today, that there are 63 additional women and children who have been kidnapped in the very recent past.</p> <p>This is a live issue, for which a law is needed that is reflective of the practices in the world as it currently stands.</p><p>I had intended to raise the MacMenamin judgment that my colleague, Senator Naughton, has already mentioned.  It is an important judgment and may be one of the few available relating to this issue of age restriction.  However, it gives pause for thought and must be taken seriously.  As such, the question being posed to the Government by this motion is whether consideration must be given to the current position in Ireland with regard to allowing marriages below the age of 18.  There is enough international knowledge and practice extant to state it must.  As to whether there is a need to get more complicated about the issue, I am unsure whether there is.  We do not have a great deal of legal precedent but have a lot of United Nations documentation relating to the issue of forced marriages.  In a similar example, I was proud to attend an interparliamentary assembly at which I could cite Ireland as one of the few jurisdictions with female genital mutilation legislation that goes beyond its own jurisdiction in which we penalise people who remove children from this jurisdiction to engage in this practice in other countries.  The important point is that our laws must be fit for purpose and must reflect a multiethnic country.  Moreover, our laws cannot hanker back to an Ireland in which we had arranged marriages as that all is in the past.  It might all have been grand, to take an example from the books of Peig Sayers, when she rowed over on the currach and met her future husband and they basically winked at each other across an open fire.  We must acknowledge those days are long over and a legal system is needed that reflects this.</p></speech>

The Minister unfortunately is unable to attend due to pressing business although this is an important topic for everybody about which the Minister is particularly concerned.<br />This motion serves to draw the Government's attention to the important issues of child protection, coercion into marriage and the minimum age of marriage.  I am pleased, on behalf of the Minister, to support fully the motion.  It focuses on the issue of forced marriage of minors, which is an area of particular concern given the added vulnerability of children to coercion and threats.  Children are uniquely vulnerable in the context of forced marriage because of their dependence on the protection of their families.  They are especially vulnerable if those who are supposed be their protectors exert coercive force on them to enter marriages they have not freely chosen.  It is imperative to ensure that children are protected from any coercion in respect of a proposed marriage.  Parents may well be well-intentioned in arranging a marriage for a child.  However, it is our collective responsibility to ensure that no child should be put in the invidious position of being pressured into a marriage that he or she does not want.  After all, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child explicitly requires us to protect a child from all forms of exploitation prejudicial to the child's welfare.<br />Before turning to the response to the motion, it may be of some benefit to set out the international and national legal context with regard to marriage and the legal position on forced marriage in particular.  Article 16 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights establishes that:<blockquote>(1) Men and women of full age, without any limitation due to race, nationality or religion, have the right to marry and to found a family.  They are entitled to equal rights as to marriage, during marriage and at its dissolution.<br />(2) Marriage shall be entered into only with the free and full consent of the intending spouses.</blockquote>Thus, in accordance with the universal declaration, only men and women of full age have the right to marry.  Only a marriage entered into with the free and full consent of both spouses is valid.  The UN Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age of Marriage and Registration of Marriages expressly provides in Article 2 that:<blockquote>States Parties to the present Convention shall take legislative action to specify a minimum age for marriage.  No marriage shall be legally entered into by any person under this age, except where a competent authority has granted a dispensation as to age, for serious reasons, in the interest of the intending spouses.</blockquote>I should add that while the UN convention provides for the possibility of an exemption to the minimum age of marriage, it does not require that such exemptions be available.  Nonetheless, it states that minors can be allowed to marry, in certain circumstances, where the national law so provides.<br />Irish law is compliant with the universal declaration and with the UN convention.  National requirements concerning marriage are set out in the Civil Registration Act 2004, which is under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton.  Section 2(2) of that Act sets out who may not marry.  This includes a general prohibition on marriage by people under 18.  A marriage which is in breach of section 2(2) is void <i>ab initio</i>, meaning it is not entitled to any legal recognition.  However, section 2 also allows an exemption to the general prohibition on marriage of minors.  It allows minors under 18 to marry where the minor obtains a court-ordered exemption as provided for in section 33 of the Family Law Act 1995.  The Circuit Family Court is the competent authority which may grant such an exemption enabling someone under 18 to marry.  The conditions relating to the court exemption are that an application may be made informally, otherwise than in public, and that no fee shall be charged in respect of it.  The legislation stipulates the court may not grant an exemption unless it is satisfied that &quot;its grant is justified by serious reasons and is in the interests of the parties to the [proposed] marriage&quot;.  There are no additional provisions mandating any particular factors for the court to consider in arriving at its determination that the marriage is in the interests of the parties.  This is the legal context against which any issue of forced marriage of minors must be considered.<br />This motion deals with the situation where a minor is coerced or forced into an arranged marriage.  I should be very clear that what is at stake here is not the issue of arranged marriage more broadly.  In most cases, arranged marriages are marriages to which both intending spouses give their full and free consent.  What is unique about a forced marriage is that while it may be arranged, whether through families of the parties or otherwise, it constitutes a marriage to which at least one of the parties does not give free and full consent.  In this, it is clearly distinguishable from arranged marriage more generally.  This is an exceptionally complex area.  There is no clear agreement at international level as to what is understood by the term forced marriage and neither is it a term that is defined in Irish law.  The question indeed arises as to whether a forced marriage, involving the absence of free and informed consent, can be termed a marriage at all since marriage requires such free and informed consent. It might be stated that forced marriage is a contradiction in terms.  Nonetheless, where it occurs, it constitutes a serious problem in view of the potentially devastating impact on the lives of those forced into this situation.  Forced marriage is often the product of or the catalyst for a number of possible criminal behaviours, including human trafficking.  Situations in which individuals are forced to marry without their free and informed consent may effectively amount to human trafficking in certain circumstances.  However, it is important to note that the marriage in and of itself may be unlikely to be a significant factor in determining whether the offence of human trafficking has occurred.<br />There are a number of options under criminal law to tackle the issue of forced marriage.  False imprisonment, which essentially consists of restricting the personal liberty of a person, is an offence under section 15 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 and carries a life sentence.  Unlawfully intimidating a person with a view to compelling him or her to do something which he or she has a right not to do, for example, participate in a marriage ceremony, amounts to coercion.  This is an offence under section 9 of the 1997 Act punishable by a fine and up to five years' imprisonment.  The seriousness of the offence of false imprisonment is also reflected in the additional provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2007.  The 2007 Act allows for a person suspected of false imprisonment to be detained by the Garda for investigative purposes for up to seven days, subject to judicial authorisation.  It also provides for the courts to make monitoring orders for persons convicted of false imprisonment.</p> <p>Courts may also make Protection of Persons Orders prohibiting offenders from engaging in any behaviour that would cause the victim of the offence fear, distress, alarm or intimidation.  The same Act provides mandatory minimum sentences for repeat offenders.<br />Forced marriage, of minors or otherwise, is fortunately extremely rare in Ireland.  There is one known case in recent years where a minor was coerced into going through a ceremony of marriage against her wishes, after an exemption had been granted by the Circuit Court.  The minor concerned was subsequently granted a declaration that the marriage was void <i>ab initio</i>by reason of her lack of consent to the marriage.  I would imagine that the details of that case were a factor in contributing to the decision of the Labour Party Senators to bring forward this important and valuable motion.<br />In response to their initiative, my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality now intends to set up a small interdepartmental group involving officials from the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the Department of Education and Skills, the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Justice and Equality.  The group will consider the legal provisions allowing an exemption from the age of marriage and what additional protections may be necessary to protect minors, up to and including totally abolishing the possibility of an exemption from the minimum age.<br />A small but consistent number of marriages take place annually in Ireland where one or occasionally both parties are under the age of 18.  Some 29 of the 21,770 marriages registered in 2013 involved parties under 18.  Approximately 300 such marriages were registered over the last decade.  However, there is no suggestion that any of them were forced ones.  Most such marriages are entered into voluntarily.  In the case to which I referred earlier, the General Register Office properly did not register the marriage once doubts over the consent of the young girl involved were brought to its attention.<br />As such, it may be disproportionate to abolish entirely the possibility of obtaining an exemption in order to protect minors from the risks of forced marriage.  What may be needed is to tighten current procedures.  There may, however, be other sound policy reasons - such as that of encouraging completion of secondary education - to consider removing the exemption.  In this context, I propose to task the interdepartmental group with examining the broader aspects of this issue as well.<br />The motion calls on the Government to consider the issue of forced marriage of minors and its potential link with the current statutory exemption allowing minors to marry.  It has provided a catalyst for the Government to examine the issue of under-age marriage more broadly.<br />As Senators are aware, the Minister for Justice and Equality is deeply committed to the cause of child welfare.  Her concern, and that of Government, is to ensure that children get the opportunity to fulfil their potential.  Taking on the responsibilities of marriage at too young an age may limit a child's life chances.  While a child may desire to get married as a minor this, paradoxically, may not be in the child's best interests.  The Government welcomes the opportunity that this motion has provided to consider both the specific issue of forced marriage of minors and the broader question of whether under-age marriage serves a child's best interests.<br />The motion sets us on a journey to ascertain the most appropriate means to protect a child's life choices and life chances.  I welcome the debate on this issue.  On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, and on my own behalf, I thank the Labour Party Senators for tabling the motion.</p></speech>

It was as a result of a complete mix-up on our side as to whether I was to be here or somebody else.  I apologise to the Cathaoirleach, as well as to Senator Bacik and the Labour Group, and the House generally.</p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il fully supports this motion and I congratulate Senator Bacik for having tabled it.  I welcome the Minister's intention to establish a cross-departmental team to progress the matter in a broader context.  Notwithstanding people's traditions, the only arranged marriage that should be considered is one that the couple arrange themselves, rather than anybody else.  Clearly, however, it is an issue.  It is barbaric if it is forced in the way that has been suggested.  There seem to be quite a few instances of that happening worldwide, which are linked to human trafficking.  It is clearly a breach of human rights.  There are traditions that have arranged marriages whereby people are introduced by design and they ultimately agree to the arrangement.  I myself got married following a blind date, which I thought I might put on the record for fun.  It was not a Cilla Black-style one, so we did not have to line up behind a curtain, but it certainly was not intended the way it turned out.</p><p>The Minister of State should provide the cross-departmental team with some deadline, rather than establishing a group that will meet once ever six months.  We should not consider that the issue has been dealt with finally.  If the question arises again, we do not want to be told that the cross-departmental group is examining the matter and we will have news soon.  To that end, we should put an adequate six-month deadline after which the group can come back with tangible changes.  These changes can be the specific ones suggested by Senator Bacik, which will certainly form part of it, as well as additional ones such as finishing secondary school studies, as the Minister of State mentioned.  </p><p>I do not wish to delay the work of the House.  I apologise again that the debate got under way without one of our representatives being present.  I was supposed to be here but I did not realise that because I thought somebody else was coming.  There are many reasons for failure but there are no excuses, so I am sorry.</p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il fully supports the motion and I congratulate Senator Bacik and the Labour Group for having tabled it.  I look forward to the Minister reporting on it in due course.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-06-25a.115" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1174" speakername="Mary Moran" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014062500027#AA00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, back to the House.  I also wish to commend Senator Bacik for proposing this motion and Senator van Turnhout for seconding it.  It is a good day for the Seanad when we can have cross-party support for important issues such as this one.</p><p>It is disappointing that in 2014, young girls of all nationalities and backgrounds are being coerced into marriage in various parts of the world.  Our current legislation provides that the minimum legal age for marriage is 18, but there is a possibility for an exemption when one or both individuals seeking to marry are under 18.  It has been agreed by a number of reputable and highly-regarded bodies that 18 years is the appropriate minimum age for marriage.  This has also been agreed internationally in 158 countries where legislation has been passed to raise the minimum age to 18.</p><p>While the practice of under-18 marriages in Ireland is not as prevalent as it once was, many people in communities across Ireland are still aware of individual cases where a girl under 18 has entered into marriage.  I am personally aware of this occurring in my role as a teacher.  I remember having one pupil who belonged to a family where, as they reached the age of 16, the girls went into arranged marriages.  Not only were they being married as children, but they were often moved out of the town as well.</p><p>I remember one child to whom I taught music.  She had never played an instrument before but was very bright and took to music very well.  She came with me - it was her first time on a bus or an aeroplane - to play at an international competition.  When I resumed teaching in September that year, I was shocked to discover that this little one was married.  The following year I met her when she travelled from Dublin to Dundalk for the day with twins in tow.  This child was barely 17, yet she was married and had two children.  That was a few years ago, but it certainly brought home the situation to me, although she was quite happy.  However, I think of the opportunities we are losing due to the cultural differences involved.  I feel that we ought to let our children be children until they are at least 18.</p><p>If the minimum age for marriage was raised to 18, without exemption, we would be able to provide these safeguards and the possibilities of further opportunities for such girls.  When a child is forced into marriage they are stripped of their precious childhood years.  They are forced to grow up immediately and are exposed to adult realities.  As everybody else here agrees, that is completely unacceptable and wholly unfair.  These girls are given very little respect for their own abilities and worth.</p><p>I have already referred to a particular girl whom I had the good fortune to teach, but she was not unhappy.</p> <p>She was quite happy but she was 17 years of age and had two small babies.  I hope she had the opportunity to go back to education and be the person I know she could be.</p><p>It is estimated that 400 young women are trafficked into the country for the purpose of forced marriage, something of which I was not aware.  I recall a number of years ago hearing reports of migrant children as young as 12 years of age being forced into marriage.  The exemption currently provided under the law does not provide for an appropriate protection for minors involved.  It is surprising that there are no guidelines or criteria for the granting of an exemption and no provision for minors to be represented at these hearings.  What further worries me is that child protection authorities do not have to be notified in the case of an exemption.  That is very serious and a change is needed.</p><p>The Minister of State noted that the incidence of forced marriage is very rare in Ireland but I put it to him that we may be unaware of many cases.  Even one incidence is one too many.  It is positive that an inter-departmental group will be formed to consider this issue and I put it to the House that we follow up on this matter immediately when we come back in the autumn and include it in the legislative programme.  </p><p>We have had numerous motions in the House concerning child welfare.  I thank Senator Bacik and my Labour Party colleagues and Senator van Turnhout for seconding the motion.  I join with them in asking the Government to consider removing or amending the provision allowing minors to marry on the basis of a court exemption.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-06-25a.117" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1148" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014062500028#BB00200"><p>I thank all my colleagues for their support and the Minister of State for taking the motion and responding so positively to it.  As I said earlier, it is an historic debate.  It is the first time either House of the Oireachtas has debated the issue of forced marriage or child marriage.  I thank all those who contributed.  Senator van Turnhout really eloquently placed this motion in the international context, in particular referring to the horrific abduction of the school girls in Nigeria by Boko Haram.  As Senator Hayden pointed out, sadly, we see even more abductions taking place today.  These abductions are for what has been referred to as forced marriage but it is really not marriage at all but slavery.  The Minister of State and others made the point that where people are coerced or forced into marriage, it is not marriage and it is not a contract entered into freely.</p><p>Child marriage is not necessarily the same as forced marriage but Senator van Turnhout pointed out to me that child marriage may well be regarded as socially licensed sexual abuse and exploitation of a child.  If we look at the international figures, it is a persistent form of sanctioned sexual abuse of girls and young women.  Some of the international figures we have seen are really very startling.  A UNFPA report from 2012 states that one in nine girls will be married before their 15th birthday in a developing country and one in three before they are 18.  It is a very widespread practice and clearly not in the best interest of the girls, their families or their children.</p><p>The Minister of State pointed out that an arranged marriage may not be either a child marriage or a forced marriage and he is right that we need to be careful about language.  However, a child marriage and a forced marriage will often be an arranged marriage too.  Clearly, there are issues about how we deal with this.  </p><p>Senator Henry spoke about her own experiences as the mother of a 17 year old daughter.  As the mother of an eight year old daughter and a six year old daughter, I can only say that they change from being One Direction fans much younger than in the teenage years.  Senator Henry was right to point out the rapid change of children and the need to preserve and protect childhood.  Senator O'Keeffe referred to issues around poverty and gender discrimination which clearly are at issue here in the broader context.  </p><p>Senator Naughten reminded us that Mr. Justice MacMenamin is now on the Supreme Court and has a very proud record of expertise in child law and child protection issues.  I go back to his words because he pointed out in his judgment in 2013, to which I referred, that bearing in mind the increased cultural and religious diversity in Irish society and the significance afforded by the Constitution to equality, the status and rights of children and the institution of marriage, legislation may be necessary to address and support the position of very young people in situations where a marriage appears to be arranged in some way and where a child is involved.  </p><p>Senator Hayden referred to forced marriage as slavery and I think that is the correct expression to use.  Senator MacSharry referred to the link between forced marriage and trafficking because clearly that is a real issue too.  I thank Senator MacSharry for expressing the support of his party for the motion.  </p><p>Senator Moran referred to the need for cross-party support and her direct experience of seeing a child entering marriage.  That brings home to all us, as do the CSO figures, that this is a reality in Ireland and that children enter marriages in Ireland.  The Minister of State referred to other figures from 2013 which showed 28 marriages where one or both parties were under 18.  We need to be clear that this is not just something that happens in other countries.</p><p>What can we do about this?  This motion has really put it up to Government to consider whether to remove or amend section 33.  I remind colleagues that section 33 allows the Circuit Court, by order, to exempt a marriage from the rule that both parties must be 18 or over.  The only provisions relating to the application are that it may be made informally, which really offers very little protection to a child, it may be heard and determined otherwise than in public - we heard that, in practice, these applications are made in private - no court fee is charged and that it shall not be granted unless the applicant shows that its grant is justified by serious reasons and is in the interests of the parties to the intended marriage, which is taken from the UN convention.  As I said, no other guidance is offered to a judge in dealing with the application, nor is there any provision for a judge to seek the views of the HSE where there is HSE involvement or to refer the matter to the HSE or to a child protection agency even where the judge may be concerned.  </p><p>While other jurisdictions, including Britain, continue to allow exemptions on court application, what we tend to see is a much greater raft of protective measures for the child who is seeking the exemption.  As I explained, there is specific criminal law criminalising forced marriage in Britain but I do not think our legislation on coercion, false imprisonment and so on, helpful though it is, is specifically aimed at criminalising the practice of forcing someone into marriage nor does it apply extra-territorially, and Senator Hayden referred to that.  Our female genital mutilation Bill, which I initiated in this House, has an extra-territorial effect.  The British law on forced marriage makes it an offence to force someone to marry abroad as well as in Britain.  We need to look at our package of legislation providing for protections for children if we are to keep a facility for an exemption.  Frankly, I would prefer if we did not maintain the facility for exemption.  Other countries in Europe may do so but, as I said, they have other protections in place.  We should be world leaders in child protection.  </p><p>I welcome the fact that a small inter-departmental group will be set up to examine all options for reform and amendment, including the option of abolition of the facility for exemption.  I would like to see a firm time line.  We will hold the Minister of State to it and between the Labour Party Senators and Senator van Turnhout's group, we will certainly return to this issue in Private Members' time if we do not see movement on it at Government level.  We are clear that some legislation is needed to reform section 33 and I hope it will be initiated in the Seanad given that we have initiated this debate.  I thank all colleagues for their support for this important motion and the Minister of State for his commitment to take up this issue and, I hope, ensuring we become world leaders in child protection.</p></speech>

I tabled this motion on foot of an e-mail I received from an independent candidate who stood in the local elections in Clare who came across this issue regarding seven teachers in Clare.  Those teachers have been teaching for a number of years but find that they are neither on a panel nor a supplementary panel at this stage.  It seems grossly unfair, in light of the facts available, that such a position should be allowed continue.  I am not quite sure of the circumstances and why these teachers have not been accepted either to a panel or supplementary panel.  There may be an issue concerning the teaching of Irish but such matters can be resolved where there is a willingness to do so.</p><p>I am sure the issue is not unique to teachers in County Clare and it is reflected in other counties as well.  Nationally, there is a problem in the placing of young teachers coming out of college who are trying to advance their teaching practice, and there is an ongoing issue with teachers needing six months of consistent teaching experience in order to fulfil training requirements within the education programme and finding they cannot, through no fault of their own and having done countless interviews, find such experience.  The competition for the places is at such a level that many candidates do not seem to be able to secure the six months of practice.  A couple of things must happen in that regard.  The educational institutions which provide teaching must consider the easing of requirements, for example.</p><p>There are seven teachers in Clare whose lives are on hold because of this issue.  I understand they have contacted the Department and the office of the Minister, Deputy Quinn, who is fully aware of the circumstances.  Where there is a willingness to resolve a problem to everyone's satisfaction, it can happen when there is engagement between two parties.  I apologise to the Minister of State as the Adjournment matter are being heard earlier than we expected, and I was attending a committee meeting at the time.</p></speech>

Vacancies are filled in the first instance through the redeployment of surplus permanent teachers and this is the core function of the redeployment arrangements.  The redeployment of all surplus permanent teachers is key to the Department's ability to manage within its payroll budget and ceiling on teacher numbers.  Thereafter, schools are required under the panel arrangements to fill permanent vacancies from supplementary panels comprising eligible fixed-term and part-time teachers.  When the supplementary panel process concludes, any remaining permanent vacancies are then filled by open recruitment through the standard advertising process.<br />Department circular 57/2013 was published last autumn and it set out the criteria that fixed-term and part-time teachers must meet for gaining access to the supplementary panel.  The criteria include a requirement to be fully registered with the Teaching Council and be probated to work in all settings.  The Teaching Council is responsible for procedures and criteria for the probation of teachers.  In accordance with the council's current arrangements, where a primary teacher is employed and probated in a restricted setting, such as a special class, the probationary process is considered to be partially carried out and the teacher's registration will remain subject to the condition of probation.  It is open to such teachers who complete the probationary process in a restricted setting, and who wish to complete the probationary process in full, to do so when they are teaching in a mainstream setting.  Teachers who complete probation in a restricted setting are not subject to any time limit to complete probation in mainstream settings.  This is the position applying to the teachers to whom the Senator refers.  The teachers were not therefore given access to the supplementary panel.<br />It is open to the teachers to apply for fixed-term mainstream positions that are being filled by open recruitment through the public advertisement process.  There are many such positions currently being advertised on the website <i>educationposts.ie</i>.  Working in such positions would give the teachers an opportunity to get probated to work in a mainstream setting.  This would enable them to gain access in the future to the supplementary panel, assuming they meet the other standard criteria as well.  I hope this has helped to clarify the position for the Senator.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that a time period is not put on teachers fulfilling the probation period, but fairness must apply and after a certain period has elapsed it is important for a person's confidence and self-esteem that the probationary period should come to an end.  It would be the same as employing somebody as an apprentice whose apprenticeship continued to be renewed and they never progressed beyond it.</p></speech>

The Teaching Council is responsible for the procedures and criteria for the probation of teachers.  It is an independent, autonomous entity operating within guidelines underpinned by legislation passed through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  At the moment, teachers in the situation referred to by Senator Conway, are currently working in what is described by the Teaching Council as a restricted setting, which does not allow them to complete the probationary process in full.  If we were to do what Senator Conway suggests it would then mean having to change the criterion for the entire teaching profession.  It is my understanding that the Teaching Council does not think that is in the best interests of the teaching profession or of students.  I have much sympathy for teachers operating in such a difficult environment but for the moment the only opportunity available to them is to seek work in what one would describe as a mainstream setting and to complete the probationary process in such a setting, thus allowing them access to the full supplementary panel.</p></speech>

A number of people from the medical profession have been in contact with me.  Some of them are members of organisations within the medical profession and others are individual medical consultants.  The problem lies with the Medical Protection Society, MPS, which is a non-profit organisation that provides insurance for those in private practice.  My understanding is that because the number of claims has increased, insurance premia are to rise substantially.</p><p>I received a telephone call this morning from someone in the MPS in the UK.  I also received an e-mail.  It appears that the claims environment for private hospital consultants has deteriorated significantly in the past two years with actuarial estimates of the cost of indemnity per member increasing by more than 90%.  That is a result of large increases in both the rate at which hospital consultants are being sued and the average size of the claims.  Regrettably, that means the cost of subscriptions must rise to reflect the increasing risk.</p><p>The MPS is a non-profit mutual organisation owned by and accountable to members.  As I understand it, the capping at the moment for obstetrics, spinal surgery and neurosurgery is &euro;565,000 and for most other areas it is around &euro;1.13 million.  Those who approached me said it would be helpful if it is possible to reduce the capping in order to bring some kind of order to what is going on.  I understand that from 1 July, insurance for some people in the private sector will be as high as &euro;97,000 and in some cases might rise to more than &euro;100,000.  One might argue that medical consultants charge large fees but there are other costs in addition to insurance.  One person said recently that it cost them approximately &euro;250,000 per annum before any income is earned.</p> <p>It is costing on average approximately &euro;250,000 per annum before they have any income, which is a problem.</p><p>The other issue that has been highlighted to me is that 41% of elective surgery is carried out by those in private practice.  Any reduction in the level of private practice available has the knock-on effect of that having to be dealt with by public hospitals which puts increased pressure on them.  I am raising the issue in that context.  I know the MPS has had discussions with the State Claims Agency and the Department of Health.  However, I tabled this on the Adjournment because the matter is being revised on 1 July.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-06-25a.135" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" time="15:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014062500031#EE00200"><p>The indemnity caps for medical consultants in private practice were introduced, with Government approval, in February 2004, following the migration into the State's clinical indemnity scheme, CIS, of hospital consultants engaged in public practice.  With the establishment of the CIS, the medical defence organisations, such as the Medical Protection Society and the Medical Defence Union, had a significantly diminished income stream to meet the cost of future claims.  Without the caps, indemnity subscription rates of consultants in whole-time private practice would have been greatly increased.</p><p>Under the cap scheme the State's clinical indemnity scheme covers claims over a certain cap or amount against private consultants arising from adverse clinical events occurring after 1 February 2004 in private hospitals.  In July 2013, the Government agreed to continue to provide the cap scheme for another five-year period.  It was also agreed that the caps would continue to be adjusted annually from 1 July 2014 in line with the consumer price index.  The present cap rates are as follows: for obstetricians, neurosurgeons and orthopaedic surgeons undertaking spinal surgery &euro;565,000 per claim, including damages and legal costs, subject to annual aggregate limit of &euro;1.695 million per consultant; and for all other specialties, the limit is &euro;1.13 million per claim, including damages and legal costs, with no aggregate limit.</p><p>The Medical Protection Society provides indemnity cover to the majority of medical consultants in Ireland.  The MPS has notified the Department that it faces major challenges in maintaining a solvent indemnity fund for its Irish consultants and without an increase in premiums this year its income from premiums will not match its liabilities.  It notified its members earlier this month that the membership fee for indemnity would increase by an average of around 42% for all members.  The Department has been informed that approximately 1,000 consultants are affected - 350 in full time private practice and the rest have B consultant contracts which allows them part-time off-site private practice.</p><p>The cost of Irish clinical negligence claims is much higher than the cost in the UK.  A major problem is the long period that it takes before Irish cases come to trial.  This results in significant increases in awards and in legal costs.  Legislation is being drafted by the Department of Justice and Equality to address various pre-trial aspects of litigation but the impact of a change in legislation on awards will not be seen for a number of years.</p><p>The Irish Hospital Consultants Association is seeking a reduction in the caps for low-risk specialties and for high-risk specialties in order to reduce the level of the increase in premiums for its members.  It argues that if this is not done, consultants may be forced out of business, while others may pass on the increase to patients.</p><p>Changes cannot be made in the short term without an in-depth actuarial analysis of the impact of any change on the financial risk to the State of such change.  The State Claims Agency, which manages the clinical indemnity scheme, has commissioned this analysis.  Discussions are under way between Department officials and the State Claims Agency in this regard.  Officials from my Department have also met representatives of the Irish Hospital Consultants Association and the Medical Protection Society about the issue.</p><p>It took months of consideration and assessment before the Government agreed in 2013 to the continuation of the caps and the Government decision stressed that a value-for-money review should be undertaken before any change was made to the scheme.  At a time of huge financial pressure on the public system any change to the caps system for the consultants in private practice must be carefully considered and a Government decision would be needed to effect such change.</p></speech>

A representative of that organisation telephoned me this morning to clarify that it did not intend to withdraw from providing insurance cover in Ireland.  However, that also happened with the Medical Defence Union when it withdrew from Ireland, which left its own problems.  We need to be careful on this matter.  There is concern that any reduction in the level of services being provided in the private sector will result in the public sector having to pick up the pieces.  We need to bear in mind that 41% of all elective surgery is done by medical consultants working in a private capacity.  This needs to be given serious consideration given the pressures within the sector at the moment and given the number of consultant vacancies in the HSE.</p></speech>

There are a couple of hundred more than there were in 2008.</p><p>On the substantive issue, it would require a Government decision to enact any changes in this.  We are awaiting the outcome of the actuarial study that is being undertaken.  I thank the Senator for raising the matter.</p></speech>
