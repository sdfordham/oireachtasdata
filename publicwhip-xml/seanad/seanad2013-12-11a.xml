Specifically, this debate should focus on the areas of the sustainability of some of our sporting bodies, such as the FAI and the IRFU.  It is important to have the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, in the House for a full debate on how sport in general is funded and on which areas are well resourced and which are not.  It is important to provide time for this debate early in the new year.</p><p>In regard to the pyrite Bill, which will establish the pyrite resolution board on a statutory basis, I understand it is to be introduced next Monday.  This House has done a lot of work in this area.  I ask for adequate time to be provided for this Bill and for time to be allowed between the various Stages so that we may revert to groups like the Pyrite Action Group and others for feedback from those affected.  It is important adequate time is provided over a number of days.  I welcome the Bill, although I have not seen it yet.  We need time to examine it properly to ensure it is right and that the board starts off on a proper footing.  I ask the Leader to request the Minister, Deputy Hogan, to ensure this time is provided.</p><p>I also call for a debate on the issue of health.  The Department of Health is in meltdown.  We were looking at an overspend this year of &euro;351 million, but putting it mildly, through some very questionable accounting measures the Government has now brought this down to a &euro;219 million supplementary payment that will have to be made to the Department of Health and the HSE to balance the books this year.  This is being put in the context that next year the Government, apparently, will cut between &euro;666 million and &euro;1 billion from the health budget.  The Minister for Health has had the service plan for almost two weeks now, but he has not published it.  He will not do so because, as I said weeks ago, this is being staged to ensure the Minister publishes the HSE service plan when neither House is sitting.</p><p>I guarantee Members that this plan will be published towards the end of next week or early the following week so that there will be no scrutiny of it and that the Minister and the Government hope people will have forgotten about it by the time the D&aacute;il and Seanad return on 16 January.  I assure the House we will not forget about it.  This is one of the most underhanded measures the Minister for Health and the Government have taken to date.  This plan is months in the making and the Minister has delayed it time and again, purely to get to the Christmas recess.  That is the only reason it has been delayed.  We could be debating the plan this week and assisting make improvements in areas where we believe savings can be made. </p><p>The health service will not function with &euro;1 billion removed from it.  It is in meltdown at the moment.  The Minister has proven time and again that he is not up to the job.  I want the Minister to come to the House in our first week back to stand over the service plan of his HSE appointees.  All of the people who serve on the board of the HSE are his appointees.  The HSE plan is his plan and his Government's plan and it needs to be debated in full in early January.</p></speech>

There is real merit in the points he makes.  We all welcome legislation to address this long overdue issue.   It is clearly preferable that we would be given time to consider a Bill at each Stage, even a Bill that is welcomed by both                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       sides, particularly when we have not seen the text of the Bill.  We will all take that on board.</p><p>Yesterday Senator Hayden called for a debate on direct provision in the new year and I support her call.  It is an issue that we have raised many times across the floor of the House, most recently in Private Members&rsquo; time.  We should return to it because in years to come people will question why we did not do more to stop the appalling conditions that some people in direct provision are living in and to address some of the issues that have arisen in the direct provision hostels and so forth.  The Minister has been promising the immigration, residence and protection Bill and we will discuss the direct provision context in that context, but if the Bill is not due to come to the House until later in the first quarter of the new year, we might have a debate specifically on direct provision in advance of that.</p><p>May I request a debate on the findings of the Smithwick tribunal, about which there has been much comment since the publication of the report.  Clearly the findings are a cause of concern.  It will take some time for us to read through it.  I have certainly had a look through it, but I would like to have more time to review it and that we would have a debate on it in the new year.  I am sure my colleagues will share that view.  We will have a meeting of the justice committee today and I think many members will raise it at that meeting also.</p><p>As regards the reports of sex abuse against children in institutional care, yesterday the audits from the Catholic dioceses raised very disturbing findings, in particular in relation to the scale of allegations against Christian Brothers.  I know we have had debates on the Murphy commission report and the Ryan report, but may I ask the Leader for a debate in a timely fashion in the new year to consider what has been done in the wake of those reports and in order to implement the recommendations of those reports and protect children against such abuse in the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-11a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1146" speakername="R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121100003#B00300"><p>I agree with my colleague, Senator Bacik, on the issue of direct provision.  It is very important that we have a debate on matters relating to immigration and the relevant legislation, in particular about direct provision.  Many people have a concern that the current system of direct provision and the way that people are being treated is an affront to human dignity.  I would like to see it being debated in the Seanad as soon as possible.</p><p>Recently I spoke to an Irish language scholar and discussed the emergence of new words and phrases in various languages.  Everybody is aware of what a &quot;selfie&quot; is, thanks to the antics of President Obama and others yesterday.  We were trying to come up with an Irish phrase to cover the concept of a top-up and my friend suggested cr&uacute;b sa phoca.  I think that captures the greed in our society and the greed that seem to underlay the policy of paying top-ups to people who are already very well paid.  This is a matter of considerable concern.  I have been told in recent days that people have stopped their standing orders to certain charities.  What is really damaging, and this has been pointed out by the head of B&oacute;thar, is the loss of confidence in charities, which do not warrant this loss of confidence, because people are afraid the money they are donating is being wasted.  That is part of the real harm.</p><p>It is important to send out a message that people should not stop giving to charity because of what has happened.  They should certainly be more discerning but they should ensure that their level of charitable giving continues, in particular to organisations that do not spend a large amount of money on salaries and administration.  We should welcome that the former chief executive of the Central Remedial Clinic has remitted a portion of his salary to the Health Service Executive.  I wish the Committee of Public Accounts every success in examining this matter.  There can be a time when it is appropriate to compel witnesses to come before the Committee of Public Accounts.  The aim of the exercise should not be to humiliate anybody.  I do not know if it is appropriate for Mr. Conlon to come before the committee of his own volition or to be compelled to do so. </p> <p>I have no brief for anybody in this and I regret the culture of top-ups that seems to have existed but the people who must come before the committee are those who authorised such payments.  I am certainly not interested in the humiliation of those who received excessive payments, if they did so lawfully but those who were involved in authorising such payments, either for themselves or for others, should certainly be called before the committee to give an account of their actions.  We need the work of the committee to focus on ensuring that this practice does not occur in the future and that proper structures are put in place to make sure that is the case.  </p><p>I welcome the fact that on Human Rights Day yesterday a very dangerous report on abortion, the Estrela report, which sought among other things, to try to pretend that abortion is some kind of human right and to close down conscientious objections of doctors and others, was defeated in the European Parliament.  It was defeated narrowly, it must be said, which is a matter of concern, but it was defeated nonetheless, thanks to an alternative motion tabled by the European People's Party, among others.  That was a very positive development on Human Rights Day, underlining the fact that these matters must be left to member states to decide and that there should be no attacks on the right to conscientious objection.  </p></speech>

We throw out an average of 280 kg per person per year of food.</p></speech>

The level of waste is even more concerning in the context of the number of people in the world who are starving.  I wish to compliment the charity Bia Food Bank which was established in 2012 and is deserving of help.  I saw a television programme last week presented by Philip Boucher-Hayes, who discussed the issue of food waste with shopkeepers and restaurant owners in Cork.  It was very interesting to see how much food waste could be prevented through awareness and education.  We have a duty to ensure that we help Bia Food Bank in its efforts to alleviate food poverty in Ireland.  The charity is only serving a small area in Dublin at the moment but is planning to expand into areas in Cork and Galway in 2014 and in Donegal and Sligo in 2015.  It will not be able to do this on its own and the Government has a duty to help it.</p><p>The EPA is running a Stop Food Waste campaign but we do not hear enough about it.  I am simply trying to raise awareness of the issue in the run-up to Christmas.  I am asking people to think about food and about preventing food waste.  Last week one of the Sunday newspapers published a graph showing average consumer expenditure at Christmas and Irish consumers were way off the scale in comparison with our European neighbours.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the subject of waste prevention in the new year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-11a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1133" speakername="David Cullinane" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121100004#C00500"><p>It is three weeks before Christmas and, unfortunately, one of the country's most popular department stores closed last Saturday as workers embarked on a one-day stoppage over pension rights.  I understand we will see another stoppage at Marks and Spencer tomorrow.  This is a no-win situation for the workers, the company and the general public.  The company has a reputation for quality, not only in its products but also in terms of its record as an employer.  The general perception is that Marks and Spencer is a good employer which respects its workers and provides them with decent terms and conditions.  However, its decision to close the workers' defined benefit pension scheme, which it is now arguing is discretionary, flies in the face of that general perception.  In September of last year discussions took place between the company, the Mandate trade union, SIPTU and the workers involved.  A number of proposals were put by the company to the unions aimed at saving money and an assurance was given to the workers that what was on the table at that time was the full entirety of the savings plan.  The company then unilaterally decided to close the defined benefit scheme which was a bombshell for the workers.  We must stand in solidarity with the workers involved here and indeed, with the many other workers who are facing a crisis in their pensions.  We saw what happened with workers at the ESB and Waterford Crystal.</p></speech>

We are talking, in many instances, about workers in low-paid jobs.  The vast majority of those in the retail sector are low-paid workers.  We are having this discussion on the same day that one of my colleagues, Senator Quinn, is introducing a Bill to the House that would essentially criminalise workers and their unions for taking strike action.</p></speech>

The intent of the Bill is to open up a discussion about all of these issues and I will take the opportunity this evening to air my views on the Bill.  In the context of the industrial action at Marks and Spencer, I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on pensions because both public and private sector workers are very concerned about this issue.  It is important that we would debate the matter early in the new year.</p></speech>

He spoke about funding for sport and we could also debate sponsorship of sporting organisations by drinks companies.  We could have a wider debate on the potential of sport to create employment, which is an issue that merits further examination.  I would welcome such a debate in the new year.</p><p>I also ask the Leader to organise a debate with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, on the possibility of streamlining the Garda vetting process.  We all appreciate the fact that the vetting process is vitally important in ensuring the safety of children and vulnerable adults.  However, the system is cumbersome.  Currently a person is vetted for a particular purpose rather than for a period of time.  This means that an individual who is working with a number of organisations has to go through the vetting process several times.  In the voluntary sector many people very generously give of their time to many organisations.  In that context, it would make eminent sense to have a system under which a person is vetted on one occasion.  That would bring greater flexibility and efficiency to the system.  The individual could be vetted again after a period of two years.  The volume of vetting in this country is very significant.  It is expected that 350,000 people will go through the system this year alone.  The current waiting time is about seven weeks.  The elimination of duplication would bring much greater efficiency to the system and reduce the amount of bureaucracy involved.  It is worth giving serious consideration to this suggestion and I hope the Minister will make himself available for a debate on the matter in the new year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-11a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1149" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121100004#C01100"><p>I wish to move an amendment to the Order of Business.  I ask that either the Minister for Health or one of the troika of Ministers overseeing the Department, namely, Deputy Howlin, Deputy Noonan or the Taoiseach, would make himself available to the House today to discuss the spending overrun in the Department and the HSE service plan which was published a number of weeks ago.</p><p>It appears that the overrun now stands at &euro;350 million, &euro;199 million of which is being made available through a Supplementary Estimate which will be discussed by the Select Sub-Committee on Health tomorrow.  I believe that Supplementary Estimate should be discussed by these Houses and not just by the Select Sub-Committee on Health, a committee which often sits at the same time as the Order of Business is taking place in this House, which is disrespectful to the primary business of the Seanad. </p> <p>It will be discussed in the D&aacute;il next week.  I gather the remainder of the shortfall will be made up from, among other areas, &euro;82 million in pension lump sums.  Is this being taken from some pension scheme?  Will this affect future superannuation payments?  We have heard much talk in recent weeks about how pension funds are under-resourced and so forth.  What implications will the taking of another &euro;50 million from capital expenditure and the transfer of savings from the Department of Health have for the Health Service Executive?</p><p>I do not wish to be personal about the Minister for Health.  However, it is simply unacceptable that this level of mismanagement is allowed to continue.  It is not the Minister&rsquo;s fault but it is somebody&rsquo;s.  Questions need to be answered.  Meanwhile the chief executive officers of various hospitals have pointed out in writing that their hospitals are at breaking point, with budget overruns of &euro;67 million.  We have not even got to the position of trying to get the &euro;666 million in so-called savings for next year.  In its final assessment of the Irish position, the EU cautioned that, looking to the future, in view of the fact that only 30% of the Minister&rsquo;s predicted savings were made, there were serious implications for the health budget.</p><p>While I appreciate that the Minister has made himself available to the House to discuss legislation - he will he here today to deal with legislation - the overall financing of health and its management needs a specific debate urgently.</p></speech>

The amount we are talking about to balance the budget is very small in comparison.  It is a budget that can be very variable.  One cannot predict at the start of the year the demands on the budget by the end of the year.  Is Senator MacSharry suggesting that we close down two or three hospitals to make up the budget?  We have to provide a health service and that is what the Minister is doing very well.  He has made services far more efficient, getting better value for the taxpayer.</p></speech>

In 2008, the then European Commissioner went to China to make representations about the number of defective items coming from there.  One problem was the use of lead paint in toys, which is dangerous for children.  As a result of these representations, the Chinese authorities closed down more than 700 factories involved in supplying defective products.  A good and robust system has been put in place to deal with defective items.</p><p>These days many people purchase toys online.  People need to ensure that products they purchase outside Europe are safe and are not a risk to children.  An advertising campaign may be needed to raise awareness of this issue.  It is important that when a defective item is identified, the relevant authorities are notified so that it can be removed across the State and Europe through the Rapid Exchange of Information System, RAPEX.</p></speech>

There are other similar efforts elsewhere and we should do everything to publicise them.  The waste of food is sinful.  The Crosscare agency in Dublin is doing a great job which could be repeated across the country.</p><p>Will the Leader consider a debate in the new year on human rights and older people?  A policy document on this issue was launched yesterday in Dublin City Hall, based on the Seanad&rsquo;s public consultation session on community health service held last year.  We need to publicise how the Seanad brought this to the forefront.  I know Senator White has spoken on the issue in the past.  The Seanad initiated this policy document and its recommendations, which deserve much more attention.  I would like to think the Seanad can continue in this regard and have a debate on the issue of human rights and older people in the new year.</p></speech>

The Institute of Technology Tralee, ITT, has fielded weekly calls from prospective employers inquiring about graduates from its courses, which highlights the growth in the agricultural machinery sector.  Up to 25,000 of the 58,000 jobs created over the past several months were in the agricultural sector.  I urge students to consider applying for agricultural courses.</p></speech>

The debate should focus not just on reporting mechanisms in the past and the severe failures among religious orders and dioceses in that regard, but how they treat survivors of abuse now.  They are survivors, as many people, because of the abuse they suffered and the cover-ups by the religious orders involved, took their own lives.</p><p>I would also like to have a debate on the report on the Christian Brothers and their current attitude towards survivors of abuse.  They are continuing to abuse survivors.  The way they treat them in the legal system is nothing short of abuse.  Last month, there was a case in which the Christian Brothers admitted 450 different counts of abuse.  They employed two senior counsels and two junior counsels and dragged the survivor in question through the High Court for four days, not contesting that abuse took place but fighting the amount of compensation the victim would get.  Not only did they do this, but they also employed one of the most reputable - if one could use that word in this case - but notorious criminal lawyers in the State, who defends murderers, rapists and drug dealers.</p></speech>

I call on all Senators, if possible, to call out and talk to them about the issues they are raising about undocumented migrants in this State and the support they would like them to receive.</p><p>  T&aacute; an-d&iacute;om&aacute; orm leis an fhreagra a fuair m&eacute; &oacute;n gCeannaire inn&eacute; ar a gceist a bh&iacute; ann maidir leis an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga agus go dtiocfaidh an tAire McGinley insteach le m&iacute;neadh a thabhairt chun taca seo, faoin gc&aacute;s sin agus ceard a dh&eacute;anfaidh an Rialtas faoi.</p><p>  I was very disappointed with the Leader's reply yesterday on the issue of the Irish Language Commissioner.  It is a very serious issue and has been raised with me again and again by Irish language groups.  It is being debated in the media.  The Minister, Deputy McGinley, is on radio stations discussing the issue <i>ad nauseam</i>.  The Minister is always available for matters on the Adjournment and he was here last night to hear the Adjournment debate on matters which were not even related to his portfolio, so access to the Minister is not the issue.  Rather it is the willingness of the Government to debate why the Irish Language Commissioner felt he had to resign because he felt he was not getting proper support from the Government.</p><p>  This is the biggest issue that has arisen in Irish language circles in many years.  It is also a much broader issue in that it is the first time such a commissioner has resigned in such a matter.  That is a serious, urgent issue that needs to be debated.  I call on the Leader once more to facilitate a debate on the issue with the Minister of State, Deputy McGinley, as soon as possible.  The commissioner is to resign at the end of February.  He has indicated that whoever takes over from him needs to have these issues addressed before then, and we will not be back until mid-January so I ask that this debate happens before Christmas.</p><p>  T&aacute; an cheist an-t&aacute;bhachtach seo &aacute; phl&eacute; sa D&aacute;il inniu, de r&eacute;ir cos&uacute;lachta, agus n&iacute; ceart go mbeadh an Teach seo in &aacute;it na leathphingine.  Ba cheart go mbeadh d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht againn ar an &aacute;bhar sa Teach seo chomh maith.  M&aacute; t&aacute;imid in ann &eacute; a phl&eacute; amuigh sna me&aacute;in, ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeimid in ann &eacute; a phl&eacute; anseo sa Seanad.  Mura dtagann an tAire St&aacute;it isteach inniu n&oacute; am&aacute;rach leis an gceist seo a chur os &aacute;r gcomhair, masla a bheidh ann don Teach seo.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-11a.69" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1176" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121100006#E03100"><p>I have a question for the Leader which I would have raised on the Adjournment but I would like some advice.  We are all aware that this is human rights week.  I have some issues around how human rights are upheld at a national level here.  Last year when the heads of Bill on the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Bill were published by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, he made a commitment to ensure that the body would be more effective, efficient and cohesive than the bodies before.  He indicated that with the merger there would be saving of &euro;500,000.  He also admitted that the &euro;4.4 million in funding made available for 2013 may not meet the new body's staffing and operational needs.  Yet I understand that the new body's budget for 2014 has been cut again.</p><p>The Human Rights Commission operates on fewer than six staff members.  The Equality Authority has 28 and during 2012 it operated with only one solicitor.  That is unacceptable and unsustainable.  The Minister, Deputy Shatter, recently said funding and staffing levels must be restored to a level which will allow the new commission to operate in an efficient and effective manner.  At the recent launch of the two bodies' annual reports he indicated that some difficulties had arisen between his Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in reaching a consensus on the budget and staffing allocation for the long-awaited new body.</p><p>This is still going on but with the proposal from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, that the funding should be cut for 2014 and Deputy Shatter challenging that.  Perhaps the Leader could advise me.  Should I request both Ministers to come in and address these issues?  Maybe we could get the negotiations completed to ensure we do not have a cut for 2014 to ensure the beginning of that very important body will be sustainable.</p></speech>

T&aacute; s&eacute; ceart go bhfuil pr&aacute;inn faoi leith ag baint leis an gceist seo.  Ag cruinni&uacute; den choiste Oireachtais inn&eacute;, socra&iacute;odh go nd&eacute;anfar pl&eacute; ar an &aacute;bhar seo.  T&aacute; s&eacute; i gceist ag an gcoiste cuireadh a thabhairt don iar-Choimisin&eacute;ir, agus b'fh&eacute;idir an Coimisin&eacute;ir nua.  Ba bhre&aacute; liom a fheice&aacute;il go mbeadh rud &eacute;igin d&eacute;anta faoi seo roimh na Nollag.</p><p>On another matter, might the Leader find us even one hour to discuss the excellent work being done by charities in this country?</p> <p>The country has a very proud record when it comes to supporting charitable causes.  The recent controversies in the charities sector have not helped.  We do not have all of the facts and are not privy to them.  The goalposts keep changing and there is sensationalism, but those who will suffer are those who need help and support.  There is no doubt that there is a degree of confusion among the public.  I am not asking for an hour to discuss the controversies; I am asking for an hour in order that we can speak about the work of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Simon and the hundreds of other charities beavering away every hour of the day to help people who cannot help themselves.  Whatever stand we take as a result of the controversies, we should not punish those who need help and support.  We have had great debates in the House, but at Christmas time I cannot think of anything more important than an opportunity to publicise the good work of charities, to put people's minds at ease and to ask them to continue the generosity evident in the country during the years.  I am very emotional about this issue when I see people who need our help urgently and immediately.  They are not part of the great debate or the controversies.  All they want to do is live and survive with dignity.  If the Leader can help us by providing an hour to give us a chance to help these charitable groups by acknowledging and endorsing their work, it would be good for us as a people.  It would be right to do it in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</p></speech>

The previous Government was warned by the same economists that we were in a property bubble.  It did not listen and it cost taxpayers &euro;64 billion.  The wind energy strategy has the potential to cause an even bigger crash in the very near future.  Will the Leader bring the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to the House to prove to us that the wind energy strategy is economically viable?  We need to see the figures and start listening to the same economists who tried to advise the previous Government.</p></speech>

I support Senator John Kelly's call for a debate on the issue of the multi-million euro wind energy industry.  Every citizen with an electricity bill pays for the wind energy industry through a public service obligation levy of approximately &euro;10.  Where does this money go?  It goes to fund the wind energy sector.  It is a bubble which is getting bigger under the watch of the European Commission and the Minister.  We need a debate on the issue.  International investors now see Ireland as ripe for pickings.</p><p>On rural development funding, there has been much discussion on Pillars 1 and 2 of the CAP and the co-funding requirements.  Funding for rural development under Pillar 2 is split approximately 50:50.  A total of &euro;4.8 billion was available under the rural development programme from 2007 to 2013.  At the end of November &euro;800 million of this money had not been spent.  Ireland will lose this European Union money if it is not spent.  It is for rural Ireland which is losing out.  The rural broadband scheme was launched by the previous Government and continued by the Government, but it is now off the radar.  Ireland will lose &euro;13.5 million because the Government has decided to scrap the scheme.  A total of 12,500 properties in the State do not have access to broadband.  Many of these are in rural areas such as Arranmore Island, Tory Island and Dunlewey in County Donegal.  In reply to a recent parliamentary question the Government stated there was no demand.  I contacted the companies willing to provide the service and they wrote to me to state they had not even been consulted.  The Scottish Government has drawn down money and provided the service for 2,500 residents.  It is outrageous.</p></speech>

I know time is tight before Christmas, but it would be unfortunate if the money was not drawn down or advances were not made between now and the new year.  I appeal to the Leader to debate this issue, if not before Christmas, as soon as we return.  Why should the country and rural Ireland lose out when the money is available?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-11a.76" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1164" speakername="Diarmuid Wilson" time="11:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121100007#F00600"><p>It is very much welcome that the Minister for Justice and Equality will announce today in Templemore at the passing out of newly qualified Garda Reserve recruits that he will open recruitment for new members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I hope an adequate number will be appointed fairly soon.  I request the Leader to invite the Minister to the House in order that we can hear his plans for the Defence Forces.  Since he took over as Minister for Defence, the numbers serving in the Defence Forces have reduced dramatically.  He has closed Army barracks throughout the country and depleted the resources available to the Defence Forces to carry out their duties.  Now he is reducing the numbers employed.  This is not good enough and the issue requires to be debated urgently.</p><p>I call on the Leader again for a debate on the Smithwick tribunal report.  Very serious findings were made regarding the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and I would very much welcome a debate as soon as we return in the new year.</p><p>I agree with Senator Paul Coghlan and would also welcome more co-operation between the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling diesel laundering and other illegal activities which cost the State millions per year in lost revenue.  I would not like to detract from the fact that communities in the Border area are law-abiding.  Senator Paul Coghlan might not like to highlight the fabulous scenery and excellent tourist potential in the area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-11a.77" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1131" speakername="Fidelma Healy Eames" time="11:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121100007#F00700"><p>I support the positive work charities do, following what Senator &Oacute; Labhr&aacute;s Murch&uacute; stated.  I am relying on the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to help a man with a bill of &euro;1,440 in order that he can have his electricity switched on.  Without the support of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, we will be lost because there is no heart in the ESB to deal with such cases.  Such positive work must continue to be supported.</p><p>I welcome the important independent Supreme Court decision to allow work on an ecological development centre to proceed in County Wicklow.  It is a great decision for the nation and County Wicklow.  The project will mean 2,000 construction jobs and 800 jobs in the ICT and horticulture sectors.  It could have been lost to Ireland because of unreasonable delays in the planning process.  The planning process for the project has continued for two or three years and I do not know how the entrepreneur involved stuck with it.  He obtained planning permission in County Wicklow which was the subject of an appeal by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  That is fine and I have no difficulty with the process.  However, he was brought to the High Court where he won, but he was then taken to the Supreme Court.</p> <p>We are all interested in sustainable jobs.  We are interested in an open and transparent planning process.  I believe the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government will be in the House all next week.  Can the Leader provide one hour for a debate on An Bord Plean&aacute;la?  To whom is it accountable?  Who oversees its decisions?  What justifies it appealing a case from the High Court to the Supreme Court, with the loss this country could have experienced by such a decision?  Misery has been put on Irish people over the last few years because of a lack of jobs, and the lost opportunity that has been here for at least two to three years.  This is part of a much broader debate.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la must be reviewed.</p></speech>

The Minister expressed the wish to deal with all Stages on Monday, but I will take on board the considerations of Senators O'Brien, Bacik and others that we should break that up if at all possible.  I know it was the Minister's intention to bring it before the other House next week.  We will facilitate him as much as we can, and given that it is such a small Bill, I think it can be dealt with together, but perhaps we should not deal with all Stages together.  I will certainly take that into consideration when planning next week's business.</p><p>Senator O'Brien also called for a debate on health.  I outlined last week that the Minister had until 16 December to accept or reject proposals that came from the HSE on the service plan.  It is unlikely that we can have a debate on it, but hopefully we can bring the Minister before the House early in the new year.  Senator MacSharry also called for a similar debate.  I still must remind people that under Article 28.4.1 of the Constitution, the Executive is accountable to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I cannot compel Ministers to come in here.  I can ask them to come in, and we have succeeded in having them in here on a regular basis, but it is not my in my remit to compel them.</p><p>Senator Bacik spoke about direct provision.  We mentioned that yesterday in respect of the report from the Irish Refugee Council.  I am sure that we will have a debate on that in the new year.  She also asked when the immigration, residence and protection Bill will come into the House, and I will get back to her on that.  Senator Bacik, along with Senators Coghlan and Wilson, also called for a debate on the Smithwick report.  I have already agreed that we would have that debate early in the new year with the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Senator Bacik also called for progress to be made on the recommendations in the various reports on child abuse.  We have addressed this matter on several occasions, but this new tranche of reports certainly need to be debated as well.</p><p>Senator Mullins commented on the public accounts committee's examination of the CRC.  That is a matter for the committee and I think it will deal well with that.  Senator Keane raised the issue of food waste, which is something Senator Quinn has raised on several occasions, as recently as yesterday when he spoke about food provenance.  I note her points on the issue.  Senator Cullinane spoke about the dispute at Marks and Spencer.  I hope that both sides can come together and reach agreement soon on the issue.  The Senator called for a pensions debate.  The Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2013 was discussed here last week and the week before, so I am not sure if we will have an another one in early course, but we certainly come back to it at some stage.  Senator Mullins also spoke about the streamlining of the Garda vetting process.  Considerable progress has been made to date in that, but I agree with the Senator that more needs to be done.  We can ask the Minister for Justice and Equality for an update on that process.</p><p>Senator Burke spoke about toys, the importance of safety and risk of purchasing online from countries outside the EU.  It is important to highlight that coming up to Christmas, when people may be inclined to buy on the Internet.  They should remember the importance of health and safety when purchasing toys in particular.  Senator Quinn spoke about the policy document on human rights for older people in Ireland.  As he rightly pointed, our first public consultation committee contained a very comprehensive report on that issue.  This House initiated that and we can certainly have a further debate on it in the new year.</p><p>Senator Comiskey spoke about growth in the agrisector and encouraged students to take up the many courses that are in place in our institutes of technology and universities.  Senator Daly spoke about the fourth tranche of reviews on the safeguarding of practice in the Catholic dioceses and religious congregations, and he made references to the Christian Brothers.  We will arrange a debate on that whole area in the new year.  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh spoke about the resignation of an Comisin&eacute;ir Teanga.  This is the third time the issue has been raised by the Senator.  We dealt comprehensively with it on the Order of Business last week.  He raised it yesterday and he has raised it again today.  It is a very important issue and it is important that a new commissioner be appointed in early course to replace the person who has resigned.  Last week we thanked him for his efforts.</p></speech>

That is what the Minister for Justice and Equality actually stated.  We have had cuts in many areas, and that is a matter for the Minister, Deputy Howlin.  He has dealt with every Minister on the issue of cuts in expenditure, which is absolutely necessary.  We can have a discussion on it, but I think we should request the Minister for Justice and Equality to come in and discuss the matter.</p><p>Senators &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Healy Eames spoke about the work of the charity sector.  There is no doubt that many worthy charities, such as the St. Vincent de Paul and Simon, are hit by recent events.  It is very important that these charities be supported.  We have a very comprehensive list of Bills to get through over the next week and we will be sitting until Friday week, so I do not know if I can get in an hour's debate on that subject.  People have called for several items to be debated.  Senator Kelly called for a debate on wind energy and the economic viability of such a strategy.  We will ask the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, to come before the House in the new year.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill called for a debate on CAP and Pillar 2 co-funding.  I can assure him that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is working hard on that and that we should have an announcement on it very soon.</p><p>Senator Wilson welcomed the Garda recruitment notice and asked for the Minister for Justice and Equality to come in and outline his future plans for the Defence Forces.  I am sure the Minister will be quite willing to do that.  Finally, Senator Healy Eames spoke about the ecological centre in Wicklow and called for a debate on An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I doubt if we can have that before Christmas.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government will be here with the local government Bill, the pyrite Bill and the water services Bill between now and next Friday week, so there may be an opportunity to discuss An Bord Plean&aacute;la under the first of those Bills, but I cannot have a particular debate on the issue before then.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-11a.90" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="11:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121100010#J00300"><p>The Credit Reporting Bill 2012 will establish the legislative framework for the creation of a central repository of credit information to be known as the central credit register.  A credit register is a database of credit information based on credit applications and agreements, which assists lenders in making informed lending decisions and the identification of high risk borrowers.  The creation of a central credit register was sparked by reports produced in recent years by the Law Reform Commission, the expert group on mortgage arrears, the Central Bank and the Government&rsquo;s banking inquiry, which illustrated the prevalent weaknesses in the Irish reporting system and highlighted the potential benefit of having an effective credit reporting system.</p><p>While there are privately run credit bureaux operating in Ireland, there is no central repository of credit data on a statutory basis, nor is there a statutory obligation on financial institutions to report credit data to the privately run credit bureaux operating in Ireland.  Such private bureaux require their members to report credit information.  However, as a number of financial institutions are not members of any credit bureau, the information gained does not represent an accurate picture of how much creditors are lending and how much an individual borrower is borrowing.  Consequentially, the full extent of a borrower&rsquo;s indebtedness is not apparent.  The current system does not allow the Central Bank of Ireland to see the overall borrowing situation in Ireland, which may lead to lenders being unable to properly assess total borrower exposure.  Moreover, the current system does not allow for the identification of systemic risk. </p><p>This unsatisfactory position resulted in the establishment of an inter-agency working group tasked with developing a strategy to put in place an effective credit reporting system.  The report of the inter-agency working group on credit histories was presented to me at the end of June 2011.  The recommendations contained in the report which were developed following consultation with stakeholders helped to inform the Department of Finance in drafting the general scheme of the Credit Reporting Bill published at the end of August 2012.</p><p>Following the publication of the general scheme, further consultations were held with representatives of the finance industry, the Central Bank and the Data Protection Commissioner.  Their comments were taken on board in developing the general scheme in the Credit Reporting Bill published on 28 September 2012.  The achieved deadline of the end of September 2012 was a structural benchmark under the EU-ECB-IMF programme for financial support.  Changes made to the general scheme were in the interests of enhancing consumer protection and technical changes which were required.  As the Bill progressed through the D&aacute;il, Deputies from the Opposition parties were very supportive of the Bill and positively engaged in the debate on various proposals.  The contributions from the Opposition have helped to clarify issues and by bringing forward beneficial amendments the quality of the Bill has been greatly enhanced.  I am very thankful for the great support received while the Bill passed through the D&aacute;il.  I am pleased to note that we are on track to complete the passage of this important Bill through all Stages in both Houses of the Oireachtas by the end of the year.</p><p>The key elements of the Credit Reporting Bill are the establishment of a central credit register which will be maintained and operated by the Central Bank of Ireland; the creation of a statutory credit reporting system under which lenders will be obliged to report information on loan applications and loan agreements which reach a threshold in excess of &euro;500; the Bill provides for the categories of personal and credit information to be held on the register and the purposes for which it can be used; detail is provided as to when this information can be accessed and by whom; the Bill requires lenders to check the register when considering approving credit applications of more than &euro;2,000; the circumstances in which information on the register can be amended are provided; and the Bill prohibits the misuse of the information held on the register.</p> <p>The Bill prohibits the misuse of the information held on the register. </p><p> I will now outline the main provisions of the Bill.  Part 1 is the preliminary and general section.  Section 1 provides for the Short Title and the commencement provisions.  Section 2 is the standard interpretation provision defining the terms used in the Bill and setting out the scope of the Bill.  Section 3 provides that any regulations or order made under the Act may contain incidental, supplementary or consequential provisions.  Section 4 is the standard section for expenses incurred in the administration of the Act. </p><p> Part 2 pertains to the central credit register.  Section 5 provides that the Central Bank of Ireland will establish, maintain and operate a database of personal and credit information to be called the central credit register.  Section 6 defines the personal information relating to credit information subjects which may be held on the register.  The type of personal information which can be held is determined by whether that subject is an individual, an individual carrying on a business or not an individual.  Personal information includes names, addresses, place and date of birth, telephone number, PPS number, employment status and tax reference number.  Power is given to the bank to make regulations to specify additional personal information which may be held on the register.  The bank must consult with the Data Protection Commission and is required to obtain the consent of the Minister for Finance before specifying any additional information.</p><p> In addition to the personal information referred to in section 6, the register may hold credit information relating to a credit information subject.  Section 7 provides that the type of information held will depend on whether the information is obtained in relation to a credit application or a credit agreement.  Section 7 also provides details as to what constitutes credit information, which will be held in relation to a credit agreement made by a credit information subject or a credit agreement of which the credit information subject is a guarantor.  The bank also has the power under this section to make regulations, following consultation with the Data Protection Commission and with the consent of the Minister, specifying additional credit information which may be held on the register. </p><p> Section 8 provides for the period for which information may be held on register.  Section 8(2)(<i>a</i>) specifies that data retention for this information is linked to the closure or discharge of a debt arrangement, rather than that arrangement's entry on the register.  Section 8(2)(<i>b</i>) specifies that data retention for this information is linked to the date of its entry on the register not to any specific credit agreement.  Section 8(2)(<i>c</i>) clarifies that this kind of information should be retained for five years after the closure of an account not immediately upon closure.  Section 8(2)(<i>c</i>) provides that personal information be treated separately and not linked to a specific credit agreement but rather to a credit information subject more generally.  In relation to anonymised information, this section permits the information to be held on the register indefinitely.  </p><p> Section 9 illustrates the application procedure to make an amendment to the information held on the register.  Applications from credit information subjects or credit information providers to amend information held on the register must be made on the basis that the information is inaccurate, not up to date or incomplete.  Where the Bank makes the decision to amend the credit information held on the register, a number of parties must be advised of this decision as provided for in section 10.  Notice of the decision must be given to the borrower, the credit information provider and any person who is party to an ongoing credit agreement.  Where the bank decides not to amend the register it must, if requested to do so by the subject, enter on the register a record of the amendment sought.  </p><p> Section 11 obliges credit information providers to supply certain information to the bank, which the bank will then hold on the register.  This section also allows the register to impose some minimum standards around the data to be reported and the verification procedures with which credit information providers must comply.  Finally, this section also provides that the bank may, with the consent of the Minister, make regulations specifying the information and the form in which it is to be provided.  Those regulations may differentiate between classes of applications, agreements, providers and subjects. </p><p> Section 12 obliges a credit information subject who makes a credit application to give notice to the credit information provider of any aggregate foreign debt in excess of &euro;5,000 outstanding.  This refers to credit agreements not covered under section 2(2).  Section 13 permits a credit information subject to add to the register, a short explanation of no more than 200 words, about the subject&rsquo;s credit information held on the register.  The bank is obliged to include this information on the register.  Section 14 obliges a credit information provider to access information on the register which relates to a credit information subject when that subject makes a relevant credit application.  The threshold for access can be amended by regulation but as a default is set at &euro;2,000.  The register does not have to be accessed where the credit information provider has previously accessed information relating to the subject in question within seven days before the credit application is made.  Information accessed under this section may only be used for purposes specified in section 16 of this Act. </p><p> Under section 15, a credit information provider may apply to access information on the register where a person has made a credit application for an amount less than &euro;2,000 or is proposing to give a guarantee or indemnity in connection with a credit application made to a credit information provider.  This section also provides access for a lender beyond the performance of credit agreements it has entered into with a particular credit information subject, to the performance of credit agreements entered into by that credit information subject with other credit information providers, where there is a change or a breach of terms of a credit agreement.  This will allow a credit information provider a fuller picture of a person&rsquo;s indebtedness resulting in more responsible lending.</p><p> Information accessed in accordance with this section may only be used for purposes specified in section 16 of this Act.  Section 15 allows a credit information subject or any person who has the consent of the credit information subject to access information relating to that subject.  This section also permits the bank to use the information held on the register for the performance of its functions.  </p><p> Section 16 details the specific reasons for which information on the register can be accessed by credit information providers.  The reasons include verification of information provided; evaluating risk from the affording or extending of credit to or the taking of a guarantee or indemnity from a credit information subject; evaluating any risk arising from any changes to the credit agreement or guarantee; monitoring failures to comply with any obligation under a credit agreement; evaluating whether to make any proposal or arrangement with respect to the debts of a credit information subject in circumstances in which a credit information subject has made a request for such an evaluation to be made; and analysing the nature of the credit information provider&rsquo;s portfolio of credit agreements.</p><p> Under section 17 the bank may, having consulted the Data Protection Commissioner and with the consent of the Minister, make regulations relating to applications to access information to which the bank is required to give access in response to such an application, when access to the information is to be given and the manner in which such access is to be given.  A credit information provider is required to keep a record of each application made to access information on the register for a period of five years.  If required to do so by the bank, a credit information provider is obliged to provide information about any occasion on which that provider has been given access to information on the register.  The bank is required to keep a record for five years of all occasions on which access to the register was granted.  Section 17 allows for a credit information subject to request from the bank a report detailing each occasion access has been given to information relating to that subject within the previous five years, the identity of the persons who applied for access and the dates on which those applications were made.  </p><p> Section 18 allows credit information subjects to place pre-emptive flags on their register accounts notifying any prospective lenders in respect of their identity being compromised.  This enhances consumer protection on the register.</p> <p>This enhances consumer protection on the register.  Where a notice of suspected impersonation is entered on the register, the bank is required to notify the credit information subject, at least within 48 hours, if any application is made to access information on that subject or if information is provided for the bank in connection with a credit application made by that subject. </p><p>Section 19 applies the provisions of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 to credit data held on the register for individuals and bodies corporate with an annual turnover of not more than &euro;3 million.  The Data Protection Commissioner will, therefore, be able to deal with complaints from microenterprises and SMEs in respect of their data held on the credit register.  The section provides that the bank may make regulations, with the consent of the Minister, specifying how and by reference to what year annual turnover is to be calculated.  The bank must also notify the Data Protection Commissioner of any systemic problem identified and take action to eliminate or minimise any such systemic problem.</p><p>Under section 20, a credit information provider is required to take steps to verify the identity of a credit information subject who makes a credit application or credit agreement with that provider or proposes to give a guarantee or indemnity in connection with a credit agreement to which that provider is a party.  The bank has the power under this section to make regulations, following consultation with the Data Protection Commissioner and with the consent of the Minister, specifying the steps credit information providers must take to verify a subject&rsquo;s identity.  These regulations may make different provisions for different classes of credit information provider or different classes of credit information subject.</p><p>Section 21 obliges a credit information provider to take reasonable steps to verify the information it obtains from credit information subjects.  Under section 22, a credit information provider shall notify a credit information subject where that provider reasonably believes the subject has been impersonated by any person.  Section 23 imposes an obligation on credit information providers to ensure credit information subjects are made aware of their rights and duties under the Bill.  Section 24 stipulates that credit information providers are required, at the application stage, to notify applicants that the Bill requires information on qualifying credit applications and agreements to be supplied to the bank for inclusion on the register. </p><p>The register will not be set up to generate profit.  However, section 25 allows for a levy to be imposed on credit information providers to meet the expenses of the bank in performing its functions under the Bill.  The levy will be set with the consent of the Minister.  The regulations will determine the parameters of any levy to be introduced.  The regulations may also differentiate between different classes of credit information provider.  This will assist in ensuring smaller lenders are not disproportionately affected by a levy.  The section also provides that any party engaged by the bank to operate any aspect of the register is able to recover levies owing to it by way of court proceedings, instead of requiring the Central Bank to bring such proceedings.</p><p>Section 26 instructs that the bank may make regulations, with the consent of the Minister, to set out the fees to be paid for accessing information kept on the register or being provided with a record of occasions on which access has been given.  The regulations will determine the parameters of any fee to be introduced.  However, regulations under subsection (1) may not prescribe a fee for access to information by an individual under section 15(5) if the access is pursuant to the first application made by the individual in any year. </p><p>Section 27 outlines how the bank may compel credit information providers to comply with their obligations under the Bill.  If the bank considers a credit information provider has failed, or is failing, to comply with any imposed obligation, it may direct that the credit information provider take specific steps to comply with its obligations.  If necessary, the bank can apply to the High Court to make an order requiring the credit information provider to comply with the direction. </p><p>Section 28 outlines the provisions of a direction under section 27.  Section 29 provides for a number of offences.  It is an offence for a credit information provider to knowingly supply false or misleading information required to be supplied under the Bill and it is an offence for a credit information provider to knowingly use information, accessed by the provisions of the Bill, for a different purpose than those set out in the Bill.  The penalties for the offences provided for in the section are a class A fine and a term of imprisonment not exceeding six months following summary conviction or a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or both, following conviction on indictment. </p><p>Section 30 provides that the bank may produce credit scores of credit information subjects and also general reports, analyses and statistics which contain anonymised data only.  This means data that cannot be used to identity credit information subjects.  The section also allows the bank to publish and sell items produced under this section, including to potential market entrants.</p><p>Section 31 requires certain staff of the bank to attend before the relevant Oireachtas committee and provide the committee with information on the performance of its functions under the Bill, if so required.  Section 32 prohibits the unauthorised disclosure of confidential information received by the bank in connection with the performance of its functions under the Bill.  The disclosure of confidential information constitutes an offence. </p><p>Section 33 provides that summary proceedings for offences under sections 29 and 32(4) may be brought and prosecuted by the bank.  Section 34 is necessary in circumstances where the Central Bank engages third parties to carry out specific tasks.  Consequently, section 33AK should include a reference to an agent of the bank, in line with the proposed section 32 of the Credit Reporting Bill 2012.</p><p>Section 39 is an amendment of section 5 of the Central bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013.  It amends section 5(2) and (3) of the Central bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 to change &ldquo;to 3&rdquo; to read &ldquo;to 4&rdquo; and ensure it shall be treated as always having had that effect.  It corrects a technical error relating to a cross-reference.</p><p>The Credit Reporting Bill aims to support the removal of the deficiencies in the Irish financial services industry by establishing a statutory credit reporting system.  This aims to support the promotion of responsible borrowing and lending.  It will also aid the supervisory functions of the bank and enhance consumer protection measures in respect of lending.  The legislation will assist in providing a tool to produce an overall picture of the level of indebtedness in Ireland.  The establishment of a mandatory credit reporting and credit checking system, regulated and operated by the Central Bank of Ireland, will ensure lenders have access to the most accurate and up-to-date information on a borrower's total exposure.  The provision will benefit both borrower and lender and ensure lenders are in a position to make informed lending decisions.  The establishment of a central credit register will also help to support policies to combat over-indebtedness.  The Bill achieves this and I commend it to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-11a.93" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1139" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="11:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121100012#L00200"><p>I welcome the Minister and thank him for his detailed explanation of the Bill which is an important step forward in improving the current arrangements for the recording of consumer credit information.  We will support the Bill in the Seanad, as we did in the D&aacute;il.</p><p>When will the new regime be up and running once the Bill is passed?  There have been some reports that it will be as late as 2016.</p> <p>Perhaps there could be clarification of when the Minister believes the new system will be up and running, as it is important it is done soon.  It leads to much improved transparency for the customer, first and foremost, and it will ensure that decisions made by banks, particularly about individuals with a heavy debt burden, will be accessible.  In the US, people are far more familiar with accessing their credit information and ratings on a regular basis but in Ireland it is something people generally do not do.  By rolling out this new process under this Bill, we will have to engage in a consumer education and information programme.  I welcome the Minister's statement that the individual will not be charged if an application for an update is made once every 12 months, as that is reasonable.  A nominal charge could apply to cover expenses of the Central Bank for more frequent updates.  I suggest that the levy applied to banks on credit information providers should not be passed to the consumer in a loan application.  This has been done with other fees and it should be made clear to the banks that even if it is a nominal charge to cover the bureau's expenses, it should not be passed on to individual customers in full or in part when there is an application.</p><p>The limit is set at &euro;2,000 and anything above that should be checked with the bureau.  It is mentioned in section 15 that the limit can be lowered and there has been mention of &euro;500.  Money lenders, sub-prime lenders and particular short-term credit providers are prevalent in England and are becoming more prevalent here.  These are lending amounts of &euro;200, &euro;300, &euro;400 or &euro;500.  It might get some of these lenders out of a bind if they can say that under law, they do not have to check Darragh O'Brien's rating, for example, to see if I am up to my neck in debt.  Powers have been provided so that institutions can look at amounts of less than &euro;2,000 but I wonder why there has not been a stipulation that the bureau should be consulted on amounts more than &euro;500.</p><p>The National Consumer Agency suggested that spouses, guarantors and executors would be allowed access individuals' information but I warn against that, as it is not appropriate.  In his comments, the Minister indicated that should a borrower give consent to an individual, he or she may access the information but I wonder if the Minister is just referring to the institution.  For example, if I give written permission to my wife allowing access to information, does that go to the bureau and is it put on its system?  How will that work in practice?  I welcome the fact that the Minister has not automatically given the right of access to credit scores to spouses, executors or guarantors.</p><p>I understand the Data Protection Commissioner has some concerns about personal public service, PPS, numbers appearing on loan applications, and it is intended that the credit bureau will hold such information.  The commissioner makes a fair point in that a PPS number is not for the benefit of private or lending institutions so how will that information be protected?  What discussions did the Department have with the Data Protection Commissioner, as the office seemed to strenuously oppose banks collecting individuals' PPS numbers?</p><p>I have already mentioned consumer education, which is important.  I do not intend to delay the Minister as the Finance (No.2) Bill which we will discuss later has much more meat on it.</p></speech>

There is quite a lot to it.  With regard to errors, I welcome the fact that if somebody - usually the lending institution - makes a change to a record, the individual must be advised of that.  I assume the advice must be in writing.  That has not happened up to now and most people would have no idea what information is held with the credit bureau on their behalf or the type of statements that are made.  The Minister mentioned errors by financial institutions and where they happen, the procedure must be very clear for where people go and they follow up.  I was one of the thousands of people affected by Ulster Bank's "technical issue", and mortgage payments were not made because of the glitch.  I phoned the credit bureau after that to ensure there was no incorrect information held.  If mistakes are made by institutions or somebody's payment is not made because of an institutional error, how would somebody go about following up?</p><p>I welcome the Bill and this will improve the conditions for both lenders and borrowers.  I am particularly interested in finding out when the Minister sees this coming into being.  I hope it will not be 2016, although there may be a good reason if it is to be that date.  Will the Minister elaborate on those points?</p></speech>

It is not that often that a piece of financial legislation meets general approval from both Houses but it seems to be the case on this occasion.  I do not intend to delay the Bill, as it is a good piece of legislation.  Perhaps it was required in the past, and I have argued before that the lack of legislation in the financial area was one of the reasons we ended up in such a fantastic mess.  It is amazing that coming to the end of 2013, coming to midway through the second decade of the century, we are only putting this type of very important legislation on a statutory footing.  It is a deficit that has to be addressed in the interest of the consumer.  I support Senator O'Brien's comments in that any fee should not be put down as a box to be ticked on a form by a financial institution, with the cost passed to the consumer.</p><p>We can deal with particular sections on Committee Stage.  Section 30 deals with the power of banks to produce credit scores.  I welcome the fact that a consumer will get one copy per year if requested but the record should be user-friendly.  Far too often people who discuss such matters know about banking and finance but they do not comprehend that the public may not be able to make head or tail of it.  I am not talking about dumbing down the report but it must be user-friendly.  A person should be able to analyse the report and see exactly what it states.  More often than not, this aspect is overlooked.</p><p>Information will be made available to financial institutions and there is an obligation on them to request that information.  If the Central Bank sends a report to a financial institution, is there a follow-up if it is obvious that somebody is overly indebted?  Does the Central Bank have another role when it is clear that a loan of a certain amount was made?</p> <p>Has any analysis been made to determine how a financial institution allowed this person who is obviously over-indebted to borrow that amount of money?  I am not sure this is within the scope of the legislation, but perhaps it should be.  It would act as a brake on financial institutions and we would never again see what happened with Anglo Irish Bank and other institutions.  Perhaps it does not form part of the Bill, but I ask whether it should.  If it should form part of the Bill, how do we factor it in?</p><p>I am not sure I agree with Senator Darragh O'Brien's point on guarantors.  If somebody agrees to be a guarantor of a loan, the credit history of the borrower should be made known to him or her.  At least, if that box was not ticked and the borrower did not agree to releasing information on his or her credit history, it would set off alarm bells for the guarantor.  It would reinforce the point for him or her that he or she would be responsible if the loan repayments were not made.  </p><p>The lower limit in the legislation is set at &euro;500.  The limits for credit cards can be above that amount or equal to it.  Some people use credit cards very prudently which is very wise, given the rates of interest payable on them.  Some use a credit card to pay for small items like cinema tickets, make online purchases and so forth and do not use their cards on a daily basis.  If these small amounts are not cleared in time, will that go against a person in his or her credit history?  Will a sum of &euro;50 or &euro;70 work against an individual?  A person could have a very good credit history in the case of larger credit items like mortgages and so forth, but failing to pay smaller bills could spoil his or her credit history in an unfair way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-11a.99" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1145" speakername="Feargal Quinn" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121100014#N00200"><p>I welcome the Minister and thank him for his explanation of the Bill.  I conducted some research on the subject and was surprised to find that we were way behind other countries in this area.  Many other countries already have a system like this in operation.  I hope it will be one tool that will prevent reckless lending in the future.</p><p>We should look at the Bill from the perspective of the consumer or business.  How can consumers or businesses build a good credit rating, not just in terms of their dealings with banks?  In some countries the credit register takes into account an individual's or a business's dealings with retailers, trade creditors and utility companies, as well as their dealings with regular financial institutions.  I know from my experience in business that some suppliers or retailers were totally reliable and trustworthy, but they could have had a bad credit rating because they had missed a payment some years earlier.  If they wanted to expand their business, a bank could refuse them a loan, in spite of the fact that I, as a bigger retailer, knew how reliable they were.  On top of this, even today I am aware of businesses that do not have traditional relationships with banks.  Could we include a provision in the Bill in order that retailers, trade creditors and utility providers could feed into the register?   In doing so, we would be emphasising the good in individuals or businesses instead of focusing purely on the negative, with the register being used to justify a refusal of credit, based on the data therein.  My idea would, in theory, see a business that would generally be refused a loan because of its credit history actually being offered a loan because I, as a retailer, had fed so much good information on it into the system.  Surely such day-to-day dealings are as reliable, if not more so, than some loan repayment information.  The World Bank supports this practice and argues that sharing information on reliable repayments allows customers to establish a positive credit history and improves the ability of lenders to distinguish between good and bad borrowers.  </p><p>In Spain it is the practice to distribute credit information from retailers, trade creditors and public utility providers, as well as from financial institutions.  Could we learn from this best practice?  Could we get utility providers, retailers and trade creditors to electronically report on good payment practices by their customers?  It is also worth noting that in Panama a law allows entrepreneurs and SMEs to request the addition of information on utility payments to their files, helping them to build a good credit history to improve their chances of securing credit.  If the Minister is not open to getting retailers or utility providers to report on a customer, could he, at least, allow SMEs to request additional information on utility payments to be added to their files?  That would be a small first step which could make a difference to the very survival of a business.  In a recent report the World Bank cited an example of a utility company in the United States, DTE Energy, an electricity and natural gas supplier, which began full reporting of customer payment data to credit bureaux.  DTE Energy customers with no prior credit history - approximately 8.1% of its customer base - gained either a credit file or a credit score.  Customers began to make payments to DTE Energy a priority and within six months the company had 80,000 fewer accounts in arrears, which is very significant.  This would be a pro-business measure and I ask the Minister to indicate whether he would be open to the idea.  Spain has undertaken this measure, with 57 other countries.  We could learn a lot from them.</p><p>The Bill allows people to access their credit history data, but could we allow SMEs to insert explanations or complaints about negative instances in their credit history reports?  Their side of the story must be heard.  It is not always about figures; there are people behind the numbers.  Panama allows this to happen and it would be a good addition to the Bill which would help to balance it out.  </p><p>I welcome the Bill and the effort that has been put into it.  I was rather surprised to find that Ireland was one of a number of countries that did not have something like this up and running.  It is welcome that we are developing this system now and I echo Senator Darragh O'Brien's question as to when it is likely to come into operation.  Is it not expected to be in operation before 2016?  I hope it will be operational a lot earlier than that date.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-11a.100" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1117" speakername="John Gilroy" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121100014#N00300"><p>I welcome the Minister.  The Bill is technical in nature.  It contains 35 sections, most of which are very detailed about the legislative framework for the creation of a repository for credit information.  This is to be welcomed; the creation of a central credit register has been welcomed by all stakeholders involved in the collaborative process behind the drafting of the legislation.  I followed the progress of the Bill through the other House and was glad to see that it had received universal support.  So far today, it has received the support of this House.</p><p>A private credit bureau is already in operation here.  It is doing some of the work the new credit register will do.  However, the data available to the bureau do not represent the full picture on the level of lending in the country.  It cannot do so because of its non-statutory nature.  The Central Bank, as a result of this legislation, will have a fuller view of the lending landscape.  Had this register been in place at the height of the boom, we might not be in our current difficult position.</p> <p>What action is available to the Central Bank if some institution is imprudently lending to people who are already over-indebted?  It would seem necessary that such a role be covered by this legislation.</p><p>It is enough to frighten the lives out of customers when they hear their banks or lending institutions will be keeping information on them.  Sections 18 to 24, inclusive, have achieved some balance between the necessity of recording customer information and individual&rsquo;s data protection.  Why is there a restriction under section 13 of 200 words for any information held on the central credit register?</p><p>Section 30 provides for the power of a bank to produce credit scores and anonymised information.  What kind of data might this be and what use could it be put to if it is at such a macro level?  Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, in his good contribution earlier, referred to banks passing on fees for accessing information to their customers.  It would be in a bank&rsquo;s interests to seek credit information but also not to pass on any levy or fee.  However, I am not sure that can be covered by this legislation.  Will the Minister elaborate on this, as we know the banks are not altruistic or charitable in their approach to customers?</p><p>I look forward to discussing this important Bill in more detail on Committee Stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-11a.102" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1155" speakername="Kathryn Reilly" time="12:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121100015#O00200"><p>I welcome the Minister for Finance to the House.  As in the D&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in will support this legislation.</p><p>This Bill aims to create a more responsible lending environment and to prevent any further reckless lending such as that which occurred in the past.  While the Minister referred to improvements made to the Bill in the D&aacute;il, I am concerned that in some elements of it there is still room for improvement.  The Bill states that the central credit register must be checked when any loan over &euro;2,000 is requested.  Earlier, it was stated that many moneylenders typically lend under that amount at higher interest rates and are, accordingly, excluded.  This would reduce the effectiveness of the register.  I understand the Minister has indicated his willingness to review this, which is welcome.  Will he update the House with regard to when we can expect amendments in this respect?</p><p>The National Consumer Agency stated that the register would only be as useful as it is known.  There already exists a credit register privately run by the Irish Credit Bureau.  However, very few people are aware of its existence.  I agree with Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy that a register should be user-friendly.  How does the Minister intend to publicise the existence of the central credit register?</p><p>The register should not be used as a stick to beat those who are having difficulties with mortgage repayments.  If a family moves into a restructuring plan and meets its terms, any black marks on its credit record should be wiped away.  The register lays down penalties for abuse of the system.  Without some sort of will to use these, the register could become a way for certain lenders to chase and drum up business.  We have been told the Bill is watertight in this regard.  Without strict monitoring, however, there is a danger that some of those rules could be ignored, allowing some borrowers to be open to speculative lending.</p><p>While Sinn F&eacute;in supports the Bill, will the Minister give more detail as to when the register will come online, exclusions and other matters to be addressed on Committee Stage?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-11a.103" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1187" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="12:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121100015#O00300"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House.</p><p>The Bill&rsquo;s purpose is to promote more responsible borrowing and lending practices among borrowers and lending institutions.  Much has been lamented about our Celtic tiger years and how too many people are now paying the cost of reckless lending by our financial institutions to industry and the consumer back then.  Banks lent moneys to developers whose ability to pay was based on the continuing rise, or at least continued stability, of the property market.  Banks also lent moneys to people across the board who wanted to get on the property ladder, as they were advised to do so at the time.  Some on low incomes overestimated their earnings to secure loans.  We know of older parents re-mortgaging their own homes to help their children get on the property ladder.  There appeared to be no checks and balances to protect the institutions from being overexposed or to protect the consumer from borrowing beyond his or her ability to repay.  Financial institutions and consumers were exposed, accordingly, to significant risks if things went wrong in one sector of our economy.  The consumer who borrowed to purchase a home was overexposed to large debt if the property market crashed, which it did.  Did we hear the alarm bells?  Some did, but others did not want to acknowledge them.</p><p>This Bill will help prevent a return to the past.  It creates a statutory centralised register of credit applications.  The information on it will help the Central Bank form a picture of borrower indebtedness and how much financial institutions are lending.  In essence, the checks and balances that should have been in place in the past to prevent the overexposure of lending institutions and the consumer will now be put in place.  This has to be welcomed.</p><p>The Government has been active in supporting the small business sector and recognises its vital importance to the economy and its role in the economy&rsquo;s recovery.  This legislation will extend the role of the Data Protection Commissioner to deal with complaints from microenterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, with a turnover of less than &euro;3 million with respect to their data held on the credit register.  This initiative may provide some comfort to enterprises that have concerns about the potential storing of inaccurate data but may not have the resources to take legal action to have it corrected.  Inaccurate data on the central credit register could result in the refusal of credit to a small company.  Such a refusal could do irreparable harm to a small business, resulting in the loss of its good name and jobs.</p><p>The database of credit information will be owned by the Central Bank.  How will this information be stored and managed?  I note the Central Bank could outsource the operation and maintenance of this register to a third party.  Given the sensitive nature of this information for both businesses and consumers, can the consumer be guaranteed that his or her information will be safeguarded in a central location, using the best available software to prevent data breaches?  In the interests of all consumers, it is important that such information is not transported on laptops but stored centrally.</p><p>Credit providers will be required to make mandatory credit checks with the register for all credit applications above a threshold of &euro;2,000.  This should help prevent both businesses and consumers from borrowing too much money, ending up with debts they cannot afford to repay.</p> <p>None of us wants to go back to the past system of reckless lending, therefore I welcome this Bill to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-11a.105" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121100016#P00200"><p>We have had a very constructive debate on the importance of the Credit Reporting Bill, which will create the legislative framework for a central repository of credit information to be known as the central credit register.  The register will go some way to resolving what were identified as weaknesses in the Irish financial services industry by providing a tool which supports responsible borrowing and lending.  It will assist the Central Bank in its supervisory role and augment levels of consumer protection in respect of lending.  I thank all the Senators for their constructive input to this debate and the Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in parties who supported the Bill in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  I am grateful that we have had quite a number of very interesting contributions.  A number of Senators, including Senator Quinn, intend to bring amendments forward on Committee Stage.  I welcome their helpful contributions and discussion of the Bill and will be happy to discuss their proposed amendments on Committee Stage.</p><p>I will respond to a number of issues, proposals and queries that were raised during today's debate.  Senator Darragh O'Brien and others asked when the register will come into operation.  The Central Bank intends to take a phased approach to the establishment and development of the register and has suggested that the indicative timeframe for the implementation phase would be over 2015 to 2016.  It is anticipated that 2014 and much of 2015 will be spent in procuring, developing and testing the technical solutions in partnership with all relevant stakeholders with data being supplied on a phased basis over the course of late 2015 and into 2016.</p><p>The indicative timetable will depend on and be influenced by the successful enactment of the Credit Reporting Bill by the end of 2013 and subsequent agreement on secondary legislation in 2014.  It will also depend on the successful development of a technical solution, which is likely to involve a substantial public procurement process and the capacity of credit information providers to meet the significant operational challenges within a tight timeframe and within the context of other competing demands.</p><p>A number of Senators raised the question of control of the data to be held on the register.  This is why we have provided for strong controls in section 16.  This section outlines the purpose for which information on the register can be used, which would preclude the use of the information on the register by credit providers for marketing purposes, as is feared by some Senators.  Data protection concerns have been, and continue to be, of utmost importance during the development of this legislation.  It is important to note that the Data Protection Commissioner has contributed to the development of the Bill, ensuring that the rights of consumers are protected at all times.</p><p>Regarding the thresholds set by the Bill in sections 11 and 14, which Senator Darragh O'Brien raised, we will consider the contributions made by all Senators.  It is very important that we correctly strike a balance between trying to prevent a lender from avoiding having a check or report to the register.  I would not like to make it overly bureaucratic by setting the threshold too low.  I am satisfied that I have been provided with sufficient power to amend the thresholds, if necessary.  A concern was raised in the D&aacute;il and here again today on the threshold being pitched too low regarding moneylenders.  Senator Reilly raised this issue.  It is anticipated that banks and credit unions would be the first credit information providers to be phased in under section 11, which will place on them an obligation to provide information to the register and to access information on the register in certain circumstances.</p><p>I am satisfied that the threshold is satisfactory.  I have the power to amend the threshold following consultation with the Central Bank having regard to the consumer price index, implications for the effective and efficient operation of the register and the effect on credit information providers and credit information subjects.  It would be more appropriate to determine if the threshold should be changed after a period of practical operation of the credit register following the phasing in of moneylenders.  The register will be capable of providing statistics that could be examined by the Central Bank to assist it in its supervisory function.  The Central Bank would be in a position to determine whether the behaviour of a particular credit information provider illustrated the need to change the threshold or whether legislation is required to provide for a threshold specific to a particular credit information provider.  This is not the vehicle primarily to regulate moneylenders.  It is a register for capturing information to support credit and lending decisions and prudential supervision of the financial services industry.</p><p>Senator Darragh O'Brien suggested a widespread programme of consumer education should be conducted.  I agree and believe it would benefit the consumer, particularly as the Senators have highlighted the lack of awareness of the ability of consumer credit information.  I agree that it is very important that citizens be made aware of the register and what implications it will have.  It is equally important for consumers to know they have the ability to access a free copy of their credit report each year.  Consumer awareness and education are imperative for the legislation to have the positive effect it is intended to have.</p><p>The Central Bank will carry out a public awareness campaign during which it will highlight the opportunity for individuals to avail of a free copy of their credit report each year.  The National Consumer Agency has indicated that it is keen to engage in this important consumer issue.  In response to Senator Darragh O'Brien's question about a free report each year, this is provided and we will help to clarify issues and corrections that need to be made on Committee Stage.</p><p>This represents an opportunity to develop a responsible reporting structure which will benefit both borrower and lender and ensure lenders are in a position to make informed lending decisions.  The register will help support our continued policy to combat the overall indebtedness of this country.  In response to questions by Senators Michael D'Arcy and Gilroy on the role of the Central Bank where evidence of over-indebtedness is available, the register will be capable of providing significant useful information.  The Central Bank will have the power to use this information for its supervisory functions.</p><p>The consumer credit regulations and the mortgage credit directive, which was voted on by the European Parliament, provides for creditworthiness assessments.  The Central Bank has and will have a role in regulating financial service providers and ensuring they adhere to the requirements of the various pieces of legislation in operation.  The credit register will greatly assist the role of the Central Bank in meeting its statutory obligations.  Again, I thank the Senators and I commend the Bill to the House.  I am very grateful for the support from all sides and the very good preliminary debate here on Second Stage.</p></speech>

I do not want to speak on any section for too long as the House has much business to get through today.  We made our position on the Bill quite clear on Second Stage.  It is important to put on the record as we debate Committee Stage the various concerns we have about the Bill.  I believe in universal health care; that people should pay tax, which they do; and that we should decide what services people should receive as a right.  The Minister of State made this point in a response on the issue of universality on Second Stage.</p> <p>The reality is that we are moving away from that principle.  While the Minister will argue that in time, we will see free GP care, the reality is that we are going to see a private health insurance-based model for this country, rather than universal health care, which should be provided by the State and funded from general taxation, which is the model that I would prefer.  Whether the Minister agrees or not, there are people losing their medical cards left, right and centre in this State.  I know that when politicians raise this, they can be dismissed as opposition politicians saying that their offices are full with people calling to them about different issues, but for the issue of medical cards, I have never dealt with so many queries from people with discretionary cards who have had them either reduced to GP-only cards or withdrawn altogether.  I was dealing with one lady this week who needs an injection that costs &euro;1,200 every two weeks, and her card was taken away from her.  We are trying to sort that out, but that is one example of thousands we know are happening across the State.</p><p>It is not fair to say that we are moving towards universal health care and that more people are getting medical cards, when we see the reality that many people are losing their cards.  In terms of figures, more people might be getting medical cards simply because more people are out of work.  More people are qualifying because of the circumstances in which they find themselves.  That is why there might be more people with cards, but there are people who need the cards on medical grounds but from whom they are being withdrawn, and that is not a good thing.</p><p>This Bill will change the criteria for those aged over 70.  Why is that being done at a time when the Government claims it is moving towards universal health care and towards GP care for all?  Why would the Government then remove the medical for those aged over 70?  Is that not moving away from the principle of universality?  I can see the Minister of State shake his head, but I do not understand why we would then take medical cards away from people-----</p></speech>

That is now being means tested, albeit in a measure brought in by Fianna F&aacute;il before the current Government reduced the thresholds.  That means medical cards are being taken away from people who have them.  They had universal health care and full cover, and now many of them will not have cover.  The argument being made is that these people can afford to pay for health care.  In my view, that moves away from the principle of universality.  The Minister of State made the point well that we pay taxes to make sure that people get education and yet we do not argue that education should be means tested.  Why then should we apply the same principle to health care, if it is a fundamental right?</p><p>When this was first brought in by the previous Government, we argued that once a threshold was set at &euro;900, it was always going to change and be revised downwards to &euro;800, &euro;700, &euro;600 and &euro;500.  What is the acceptable level?  Will it go down to &euro;400?  Will it be &euro;300?  That is the difficulty we have with all these measures.  Once they are introduced, it becomes a slippery slope and more people start losing their cards.  Senator Gilroy made the point on Second Stage that &euro;500 is a significant amount of money for a pensioner who should be able to pay for medical expenses, but the same argument was made about &euro;700, &euro;800 and &euro;900.  So if we go to &euro;300 next year, are we then saying that &euro;300 is an acceptable amount of money to be means tested?</p><p>Age Action Ireland is concerned about this.  The parliament which represents older people has expressed its opposition.  I could remind the Minister of State of the protests that old age pensioners had in 2008 outside the D&aacute;il, at which his party leader spoke and at which the Taoiseach spoke.  They clearly said that what was happening was wrong and should not be happening, yet that is exactly what is happening in this Bill.  The Government cannot walk away from that.  It is exactly what Fianna F&aacute;il were doing.  I cannot understand why the Minister of State's head is shaking because there is no change-----</p></speech>

Those people are better heeled.  In my view, they were expecting an additional hit and could shoulder that burden, yet we chose to ignore it.  I very much regret that we did that, because I would gladly pay additional tax even at my salary - &euro;65,000 - to ensure the relative security and health of the elderly and less well off.  That is something we should have examined.</p><p>Whether or not they have a few shillings in the bank, people in their 70s, under this probity review, are being forced to fill out forms and consider a situation that should not apply to them at this stage in their life.</p> <p>As I said on Second Stage, in view of the relatively positive signals and signs of additional taxation coming in to the Exchequer, we ought to look elsewhere to try to make the savings required.  Everybody understands that savings are required and cutbacks have to be made.  What divides us is how that is done.  If the whip were removed, I do not think anybody would truly embrace this particular measure as one that is fairer than others that would affect people who are better heeled to shoulder that burden.  I will not speak again until the end.  Suffice to say we are utterly opposed to this level of adjustment for people in the relative autumn of their lives.</p></speech>

I wish to correct what has been said.  This measure is not about removing medical cards from the over 70s.  The impression has been given that we are removing medical cards for all over 70s.  It is removing medical cards in respect of a particular category.</p></speech>

However, they will still get a GP card.  It is important to note that where a person pays more than &euro;144 per month for medication the cost is borne by the State.</p><p>Senator David Cullinane gave the impression that the Government is taking medical cards from everybody.  Since we came to Government, an extra 254,000 medical cards or GP-only cards have been issued.  As of June 2013, we had gone from more than 1,730,000 medical cards on 1 January 2011 to more than 2,100,000 medical cards or GP-only cards.  If the Senator thinks the Government is being mean and divisive in the way it has managed the issue, I am not sure what we are getting wrong, given the number of additional cards that have been given out.  We ensured the criteria were not substantially altered.  However, in this case the criteria are being altered slightly.  We are talking about a group of people who have a substantial income and for whom we are making this adjustment in order that we can cater for those who have far less income.  Recently I spoke to a person in a rural area who has a non-contributory pension of &euro;216 per week.  He does not have a bus service or many other facilities.  That is the type of person we need to look after and ensure they are provided with a level of care, whether through social welfare or medical care.  That person has a total income of about &euro;11,000 per year.  It is difficult for him to survive on that income, given that he does not have access to public transport and other services.  </p><p>I am sorry to raise this issue, but I have on my desk notification of a medical card review for a 91-year-old lady.  I am astonished at what is being sought from her.  She is a lady who has not sought anything from the State, including a pension.  She and her made sure there was adequate provision for her older years.  Her medical card has been withdrawn.  The first she heard of the card being withdrawn was when we went to her pharmacy for a prescription and she was asked for &euro;87.  If I or the Minister of State were told the cost of a prescription was &euro;87 that would be a shock, but to tell that to a 91-year-old lady is a little different.  I have received a letter from the medical card unit seeking a whole series of documents from her, even though she submitted audited accounts, certified by an accountant, including the document from the Revenue Commissioners which assessed her income tax.  It is seeking the rent books of properties from which she has rental income and copies of share certificates.  She receives a small pension from the US.  It also seeks a letter from the Social Security Administration in the US, even though she has already provided a letter from the US embassy setting out exactly what she is earning.  To ask a 91-year-old lady for such documentation is going a bit too far.  I am sorry for raising the issue but I am very cross about it.  She has given all the information, yet more is being sought even though all the necessary documentation has been submitted, including documentation accepted by the Revenue Commissioners.  That is wrong.  It is one of the reasons so many people are complaining about this issue.  I ask for a more diplomatic approach when assessing people over the age of 70.</p><p>I support the Bill because there is a need to look after people on lower income levels.  That is what the Government has done on coming to office.  While it would be better if we did not have to introduce the measure, we have to be careful about how we manage the finances to ensure those at the lower end are not left out of the loop.  I think this is the best way of managing the health services and managing people's entitlement to medical cards.</p></speech>

However, I have a problem with this measure.  I mentioned last week - Senator Fidelma Healy Eames has tabled an amendment on this which has not been allowed - the medical card income limits of &euro;500 for a person living on his or her own and &euro;900, rather than &euro;1,000, for a couple.  As the amendment as not been allowed I cannot speak on it.</p><p>Yesterday I attended the launch of the Human Rights and Older People policy paper.

I am sorry to see this happening and urge that consideration be given particularly to older people.  I can understand if a person over 70 has a certain income and certain assets, but that lady of 91 years of age needs to be treated with sympathy and regard for her position.  The present situation is such that it is not being done in that manner.  It would be far wiser not to go ahead with this measure.</p></speech>

I understand my amendment has been ruled out of order because it could impose a charge on the Exchequer.  Nevertheless, I would like a say a few words about it.  I got quite a reaction to this issue.  A couple, as defined in the Bill - I presume this means a married couple or a couple in a civil partnership - are discriminated against unfavourably compared with two single people living together in the same household.  For example, if a brother and sister are living within the same household their income ceiling to qualify for a medical card is &euro;500 each - that is, a total income of &euro;1,000 - while if one has the misfortune to be married or in a civil partnership the income ceiling is &euro;900.</p> <p>What is that but discrimination against a couple?  I read the research behind this.  It is meant to relate to the cost of living.  It is contended that it is cheaper for a couple to survive but that is </p><p>disputed in the case of a brother and sister, two sisters or any two others who live together in the same household.  The Minister of State's argument falls there.</p></speech>

I know of a couple over 70 whose income is &euro;909.  They are &euro;9 over the limit.  They live in an extreme corner of County Mayo.  The lady must travel on a weekly basis to Galway University Hospital for cancer treatment.  The couple made the point to me that this is not about the cost of living but about the cost of medical treatment.  The couple cannot share medical treatment or drugs just because they are husband and wife.  The costs are unique to the health issue of the individual.</p><p>As Senator Quinn said, this is an unfair singling out of older people.  It worries them.  Their income is finite and they feel rather powerless and disabled - if I may use that word - by this measure.  I would like the Minister of State to address the anomaly I have pointed out.  I refer in particular to where two people who are not a couple are living under one roof.  They can avail of the &euro;1,000 limit, or &euro;500 each, whereas a married couple must avail of the &euro;900 limit.  What can the Minister of State propose by way of resolution?</p></speech>

I will start with Senator David Cullinane's point on universality.  He is correct that I have addressed this before in the course of the discussion on this Bill and other discussions.  It is a discussion we have in both Chambers and across the board when talking about health services generally.  The question of universality arises in respect of other public services also.  I am a subscriber to the principle of universality in terms of access to medical care and treatment on the basis of medical need rather than ability to pay.  There is a long tradition of support for that approach, not just in my party but also in other parties.  It has been achieved to a greater or lesser extent at various times in our history, but there is certainly a tradition of support for universality across the board.  This is worth bearing in mind when examining the future of health services.  I am not 100% sure about the current position of Fianna F&aacute;il on universal health insurance but I do not believe it is opposed to it in principle.</p></speech>

I believed the Senator was more concerted in his approach than that.</p><p>Universal access to primary care, the area with which I am most concerned in my remit, is a commitment in the programme for Government.  It is essential.  The objective is shared by both parties in government.  I refer to the objective of having universal access to one's doctor, to primary care, without the barrier of fees.  It is not just desirable but we must achieve it.  As I said in this debate last week, unless we start to shift the focus of health services towards primary care and away, in so far as it is possible, from the acute services into the community, we will not be able to address the health needs of citizens in the future.  It is essential not just to achieve the equity Senator David Cullinane advocates but also to fund health services in the first instance.  To fund them, we must have a better system of primary care and access to primary care without the barrier of fees.  That is what I am absolutely dedicated to achieving, as is the Government.</p><p>What are we doing?  We set out our proposal in this regard in the programme for Government.  There was a further elaboration on the particular route we intend to take on universal primary care earlier this year.  In the budget, there was an announcement of an extension of universal access to primary care for children under six, that is, children aged five and under.  That is part of a plan to extend universal access without fees to the entire population.  That remains absolutely the commitment of the Government.</p><p>This brings me to Senator David Cullinane's objection.  He stated, not for the first time, that the proposals in this Bill are inconsistent with the broad policy.  For the umpteenth time, I contend they are not.  If we were depriving anybody of free access to a GP under this Bill, the Senator would have a point.  We are not, however.  I do not make light of this.  Senator MacSharry is correct that nobody, and certainly no Minister, embraces in this House the fact that we must change or adjust eligibility criteria for those over 70.  I do not embrace that-----</p></speech>

The fact is we are not depriving anybody of access to a GP without fees in this legislation.  It is simply not true to say the section is inconsistent with the policy of universal access to GP care.  It does not fly in the face of it at all.  Ensuring anybody who loses out on the full medical card will have the GP card is entirely consistent with our direction of travel with regard to access to GP services.  I ask the House to accept that because it is factually the case.  We can argue about many matters but that is a fact.</p><p>Senator David Cullinane made other points about people losing their medical cards for other reasons.  An example pertains to the discretionary medical card and other issues.  From a rhetorical perspective, I understand from where the Senator is coming although I disagree with him to some extent.  One can get into that discussion all right, but let us not misrepresent anything in this legislation.  It does not remove free access to GP care for any citizen in the State.</p><p>Ninety-three percent of all citizens over the age of 70 will still retain free access or access without fees to their GP.  Approximately 85% will still have the full medical card if this Bill is passed.  The 15% of those over 70 who will not have medical cards are relatively better off.  Some 85% of the population over 70 will still have the medical card and 93% will still have free access to their GP.  These are the facts and it is important to ensure we stick to them.</p><p>I will not rise to Senator MacSharry's bait.  Perhaps we will have another opportunity to talk about what people would have done had they had the chance in government or were they still in government; suffice it to say that Senators Marc MacSharry and David Cullinane devoted much of their time on Second Stage to reminding people on this side of the House what they had said in 2008 and 2010.  If that is the level at which we are to debate this, we will be here until teatime and beyond reminding Senator MacSharry what he and his party said during the term of the last Government and of what it said and did not say during the election campaign.  One point Fianna F&aacute;il did not make, which point was conspicuous in its absence from the party's manifesto and any other document, was on the notion of a higher rate of universal social charge or taxation for big earners.  It was in the Labour Party's manifesto but it was not a matter on which we got agreement in government.  It is a little hard to take Senator MacSharry's saying he is now in favour of what I described considering we know perfectly well he was not for it until it suited him to be so.  He came in here so he could use the argument in a rhetorical way against us.  Let us take this argument seriously.  What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.</p> <p>No one embraces this proposal.</p></speech>

Despite the required savings in the health sector in 2014, we know it will still be an extremely challenging year for the health service.  Maintaining safe and quality health services will be as much a priority of the Government in 2014 as it has been in 2013, as will ensuring fairness in the measures that will have to be taken and that the burden is spread in a just fashion, not adversely affecting those who are most vulnerable in communities.  The Government has done the best job possible in ensuring that will be the case.</p><p>The less well-off who account for four fifths of the over-70s population will not be affected by this legislation.  The Government recognises that the living costs of an individual living alone are more than half the living costs of a couple living together.  Expenditure does not necessarily diminish relative to the number of people in a household.  In that context, the over-70s income limit for a single person has been reduced proportionately less than that for a couple.  This is not new or unique to this legislation, as I indicated on Second Stage.  For instance, the State pension is &euro;230 per week for an individual and &euro;436 for a couple.  There is the provision of the living alone allowance, with an extra payment for those in receipt of social welfare pensions.  Differential income limits also apply in the case of medical cards for persons aged under 70 years.  In the assessment of supplementary welfare allowance, a differential rate applies whereby the rate for a dependent qualified adult is not half the personal rate of the applicant.  Under the Insolvency Service of Ireland guidelines, there is not a significant extra sum allowed per month for a couple compared to a single person.</p><p>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames referred to medical costs.  I accept that costs are a factor in assessing anyone&rsquo;s means.  However, this is a means test to determine eligibility.  In these circumstances, it is reasonable to have regard to economies of scale as between a couple and a single person such that there would be differential limits.</p><p>I take Senators Colm Burke&rsquo;s and Feargal Quinn&rsquo;s point on the review process for medical cards.  Senator Colm Burke referred to a case brought to his attention and what appeared, sometimes, to be repeated requests for information.  It is a difficult issue.  The HSE has a responsibility to ensure the resources we have available are spent properly and that those entitled to a medical card retain it, but those who are not so entitled ought not to retain it.  This is not a reflection on the case raised by Senator Colm Burke.  However, there needs to be a reasonably robust review system in place.  Is it necessary for us to make repeated requests?  The HSE and the PCRS, primary care reimbursement service, have taken a sensitive approach to this issue as best they can.  It is a pity and does surprise me that people are still finding out from their pharmacist that their medical card has been withdrawn.  I am advised that in the review process there is a three month letter of notice followed by a one month letter of notice.  People receive notice well in advance.  There is also a procedure under which a person&rsquo;s doctor can extend the period by three months.  Fail-safe mechanisms are in place.  If the system is not working properly, I welcome Senators drawing to our attention ways by which it could be improved.</p><p>Senator Feargal Quinn stated we should not single out those over 70 years of age.  We are not singling them out.  We have a review process across the board.  It is not targeted at those over 70 years of age, which would be unacceptable.</p><p>Anyone who loses out by this change in eligibility and is affected by the revised income limits will still be able to access his or her GP for free.  Persons aged over 70 years whose gross income is above the revised limits may still apply for a medical card using the standard net income means test which is open to those in the general population who believe it applies to their situation.</p></speech>

Much of what he said I agree with, but we need to be clear about the arguments being made on all sides of the House.  I have never said access to GP cover is being removed in this legislation from anyone.  My arguments relate to the income limits which are changing.  They were first introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il and have been reduced several times since, including in budget 2014.  While I do not misrepresent what is contained in the Bill, equally it is unfair for Senator Colm Burke to misrepresent what I said.  At no point did I say all pensioners would lose their medical cards.  I have said discretionary medical cards are becoming a problem.  If Government Members are not receiving the same volume of complaints that I am receiving, there is something wrong with their constituency services and clinics.</p></speech>

Prior to 2008 people over the age of 70 received a medical card without a means test.  That is a fact.  That was the position then.  We then moved from a position of universal medical card cover to partial removal of the cover for some people because of the application of the means test.  That is a fact.</p><p>We then had a U-turn by the previous Government on its decision to seek to remove all medical cards for those aged over 70.  We cited the comments made by Opposition leaders during the protest at that time.  We must remind ourselves of what the Minister for Health specifically said on this issue at that time and put it in the context of the Bill before us because it is important.  He described the decision at that time as a vicious attack and a savage assault on the elderly, but it was not only with regard to the removal of the medical cards for everybody over the age of 70.  When that decision was changed he said it was a desperate climbdown and that the then Government was simply tinkering with income limits, which he described as being nowhere near good enough.  &quot;Tinkering with income limits&quot; and &quot;nowhere near good enough&quot; were his words, but then he came into office and did exactly that, he tinkered with income limits.  If it was not good enough then, it should not be good enough now.</p><p>I do not want to be misrepresented on the point I was making about universality.  I do not see universality in the provision of health care as being solely in the context of GP cover but in the context of all health care.  It should be provided as a right in respect of primary and acute services, including medication, funded through general taxation.  That is how I see it being done.  We had this discussion on a different Bill yesterday with regard to people paying the universal social charge.  They would ask themselves why are they paying the universal social charge, PRSI, more tax under the PAYE system and paying private health insurance and yet they still have to pay at the gate for health care.  People pay three and four times in this State for health care.  It might be more helpful if the Minister were to come into the House and have a discussion on universal health care and universal health insurance.  I do not intend to speak again on this Bill as I have made my point.  I just wanted to respond to what I consider to be as a misrepresentation of my argument.  I fully accept that this will not have an impact on GP access for any older person but my understanding and view of universality of health care is broader than just GP access.</p></speech>

If he does not want to embrace it, he should not do so; he should go back and say to the Ministers, Deputies Howlin and Noonan, that what we want to do is to raise more funds from the people who are better heeled to shoulder the burden, and those people are there.  In terms of universal health care, as a individual on a personal basis, I am absolutely against it.  If one is particularly wealthy and is not elderly or young and has the funds to be to pay for this, then I agree one should pay, but that should not apply to the elderly, the infirm or the most vulnerable.  </p></speech>

Lowering the qualifying income thresholds to &euro;1,400 for a couple and &euro;700 for an individual was a savage attack on the elderly.  What is it other than that when there are choices.

Has the Minister of State choices?  Yes, he does.  Can he take them?  Yes, he can.  I have even suggested how and where he can take them.  His inability to get this over the line in terms of his internal discussions with Ministers is his business and his problem.  Does this have to happen to raise &euro;25 million?  No, it does not.</p><p>We can talk about the past.  Yes, Fianna F&aacute;il made mistakes, it lost 53 D&aacute;il seats and its manifesto was rejected.  The collective Fine Gael-Labour Party one was accepted and those parties threw it out the window as quick as they could and said they would cut threshold of &euro;1,400 down to &euro;900 and discriminate against women or men who live together as a couple.  I would say the Minister of State, in his other profession as a lawyer, would have good craic with that one down in the Four Courts in terms of the rights and costs of a couple living together versus those of an individual.  I would say there would be a good few euro made on arguing that case in the Law Library, as the Minister of State would well know.  The Fianna F&aacute;il did this and did that rhetoric is fine and I have no difficulty with it; I know the mistakes that were made.  The Minister of State will recall that when I was a finance spokesperson on the opposite side of the House I was severely critical of the Minister for Health on a wide variety of issues.</p></speech>

When Fianna F&aacute;il made the grave error of trying to do what it did for the over-70s at the time and then came back with much more generous qualifying income thresholds of &euro;1,400 and &euro;700, the elderly who were out protesting in Molesworth Street and in Clarendon Street church at that time did not have any idea what was coming down the track from the people who purported to be supporting them.

How does the Minister of State justify the anomaly that the ceiling for a couple who are married or in civil partnership is &euro;900 whereas two single people living together within the same household, such as a brother and sister, have a ceiling of &euro;500 each, which amounts to &euro;1,000?

It arises in relation to health issues.  The only reason I responded to the question of what people said back then was that most of what Senator MacSharry has said - a good proportion of his speech on Second Stage and again today, as well as of the contribution of Senator Cullinane - was all about what people had said previously.  This is a Parliament.  Members are perfectly entitled to raise what people said in the past and to ask questions.  No one objects to that.  The point is that we come to expect something a little bit more than that in terms of an argument, but we hear less and less - particularly, I am sorry to say, from Senator MacSharry.  If the only case against the Government is that what we are doing is not what we said would do, it ends up being quite thin.  I am still waiting for a health policy.</p></speech>

A significant debate is needed in that regard and perhaps we should have it in the Seanad.  No health policy whatsoever is coming from the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, other than simply to express annoyance, irritation and sometimes anger about what was said five years ago while the party claims the opposite is now being done.  Senator MacSharry is entitled to make that point, but surely the Irish people are entitled to expect from the Fianna F&aacute;il Party something additional to that, yet we do not hear anything whatsoever.</p><p>Reference was made to choices.  We live up to our responsibility in government.  We are two parties in government working together in the interests of the Irish people.  Of course we must make choices and of course we do not always agree, at least initially, on precisely what choices we should make, but the fact it is that we do come to conclusions, very good and balanced ones.  The two parties in government did not have a collective manifesto, as described by Senator MacSharry.  We had two separate manifestos and approaches to the Irish people.</p></speech>

The Fine Gael Party came back to the other House with 76 or 77 seats and the Labour Party had 36 or 37 seats.  We then came together in a coalition, which involves debate, discussion, agreement and making choices.  We are taking responsibility.  I ask Senator MacSharry to be serious and to pluck up something rather than to seek to embarrass the Labour Party.  He knows that although we have a particular view on taxation, that did not form the full Government view.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party then wants people to believe it has credibility in advancing such a proposal when it did not do so three years ago.  That is the reason I put it to him that he cannot have any credibility in saying that we should do something now when we know it was not his view prior to the election.

Fianna F&aacute;il will not do that.  That is the reason I say that Fianna F&aacute;il is devoid of credibility and that Senator MacSharry is bordering on dishonest when he suggests something that he knows in his heart of hearts that Fianna F&aacute;il would never propose to the Irish electorate, namely, taxing high earners.  It never has done so and it never will do so.  Both parties are taking responsibility in government.  It is true that we are making choices.  It is also true that many of the choices and decisions we have to make are extremely difficult.  However, the fact is that we must ensure the public finances are brought into balance.  We are achieving that.  We are making a start, which is hugely important for both parties in government, on the kinds of policy choice that have to do with universal access to primary care.</p><p>I accept Senator Cullinane's point that there is more to primary care and health than access to GP services.  Other services are required as well, but let us get people focused on primary care and access to GPs.  We must get people to visit their GPs on a regular basis and take responsibility for their own health.  People must work with their GPs on preventative strategies in the community.  The GP and ancillary services around the GP are central to that.  For as long as there is a barrier of fees and people have to pay a fee to see the doctor we will have a huge obstacle to the advancement of our health care policy.  I am passionate about universal access to GP services.  I do not exclude the fact that there needs to be a debate about how we extend cover and pay for health insurance, all the acute services and the other community services, but in primary care, at which the GP is at the centre, let us remove the barrier of fees from that service.  In so doing, we will greatly improve the health service as a whole.</p></speech>

Before I comment on the Finance (No. 2) Bill 2013, it might be appropriate to examine the economic context in which it is proposed to be enacted.  Considering the economic backdrop against which the budget was set, and although we experienced a difficult first quarter, the Irish economy returned to growth in the second quarter.  The most recent figures provide room for optimism for the remainder of this year.  The Government has been particularly encouraged by the positive developments in the labour market of late.  Employment increased by 3.2% during the year to quarter three, marking a fourth successive increase in employment on a year-on-year basis.  In line with such developments, the economy returned to growth in the second quarter, and more recent figures provide grounds for continued optimism.  Next year, a more supportive external environment and a continuation of positive domestic developments should allow for more robust growth.  Economic output is expected to increase by 2% in 2014.</p><p>On the fiscal side, the recently published Exchequer returns show that tax revenues increased by almost 10% year-on-year to November.  Strong income tax receipts from both PAYE workers and the self-employed are encouraging and are consistent with recent data on the recovering labour market.  In addition, expenditure remains below profile across most Departments.  These returns give confidence that, once again, Ireland will meet and, indeed, better its fiscal targets in 2013.  Building on this, budget 2014 targets a deficit of 4.8% of GDP.  This represents an over-achievement in respect of the deficit target and will deliver a small primary surplus.</p><p>As we move to examine the Finance (No. 2) Bill, there are a number of key points I wish to make.  Sometimes the finance Bills are simply seen as the means by which the taxation aspects of the budget are formalised and given legal status and effect.  However, legislation of this nature also provides the Government with an important opportunity to introduce significant new measures which help to stimulate economic growth and underpin fiscal policy.  For example, on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, made the point that the Bill before the House introduces provisions relating to corporation tax and our policy based on the three Rs, namely, rate, reputation and regime.  I echo the comments made by the Minister in his budget speech to the effect that while the Government has over the past two and a half years focused on implementing and ultimately exiting the EU-IMF programme, we have also been following a parallel programme - the programme to support businesses, create jobs and get people back to work.  This is why measures that assist us in achieving these objectives are an important feature of the Bill before the House.</p><p>The Finance (No. 2) Bill 2013, as passed by D&aacute;il Eireann, comprises 83 sections and runs to 103 pages.  As I said here when I introduced what became the Finance Act 2013 in this House last March, this legislation is not only the product of work done by legislators and officials.  We in Merrion Street do not just devise measures.  The measures in the current Bill are the product of much discussion and dialogue across all Departments and consultation and interaction with representative organisations, Members of both Houses and individual citizens.</p><p>I will now take Senators through the main points relating to the Bill.  I will not cover every section but I will highlight some of the more relevant ones.  Section 3 relates to tax relief for acquiring an interest in a partnership.  This relief will be withdrawn on a phased basis over four years.  Relief will not be allowed for new loans taken out after 15 October 2013.  The relief will be reduced by 25% per annum until its eventual total abolition in 2017.  Existing claimants will retain the relief on a reducing-rate basis until 1 January 2017.  The provision was amended on Committee Stage in order to permit replacement loans where the loan being replaced would have qualified.  This will enable borrowers to refinance loans at a lower cost if they have the opportunity to do so.  The latter will reduce the cost to the Exchequer because the interest payments on the restructured loan will be lower and, as a result, the tax relief provided will be reduced.</p> <p> Section 4 provides for the budget day announcement of the abolition of top slicing relief for <i>ex gratia</i>or discretionary lump sums paid on or after 1 January 2014.  There has been some confusion about the measure since it was announced and I would like to make it clear to Senators that the measure will have no impact on lump sums payable from occupational pension schemes.  The existing exemptions for discretionary lump sums are also being retained.  It is only the concessionary rate of tax that may apply to any taxable element of such lump sums that is being abolished.</p><p> Section 5 introduces a scheme of tax relief for home renovation work, the home renovation incentive, which has been warmly welcomed by the construction sector.  This is intended as a much needed boost for the construction sector and to assist homeowners who wish to wish to carry out works on their homes.  Relief will be granted at a rate of 13.5% on qualifying expenditure up to a maximum of &euro;30,000, excluding VAT.  The minimum expenditure must be &euro;5,000 inclusive of VAT.  Relief will be granted by way of a tax credit split over two years following the year in which the works are carried out.  The scheme will run from 25 October 2013 until 31 December 2015.  Works carried out in 2013 will be deemed to have taken place in 2014 and the credit will be awarded in 2015 and 2016.  </p><p> Section 6 proposes an employment activation measure, the start-your-own business incentive.  This will provide an exemption from income tax, up to a maximum of &euro;40,000 per annum for a period of two years, for qualifying individuals who have been continuously unemployed for a minimum of 12 months and set up a qualifying, unincorporated business.</p><p> Section 7 abolishes the one parent family tax credit and replaces it with a new single parent child carer credit.  Following the many representations made by Deputies and Senators, the Minister amended the provisions in this section on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il to allow the new credit to be claimed by a non-primary carer where it is relinquished by a primary carer.  This may apply to a grandparent.</p><p> Section 8 provides for the budget day announcement of the new ceilings of &euro;1,000 per adult and &euro;500 per child on the amount of medical insurance premiums that qualifies for tax relief.  These provisions were also amended on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il to provide that where a student is being charged a full adult premium, the adult ceiling for relief will apply.  In addition, the Minister also removed the existing requirement for a defined relationship between the policyholder and the individual insured in order for the tax relief to apply to premiums paid on behalf of others.</p><p> Section 16 provides that the employment and investment incentive will be removed from the high earners restriction for a period of three years in the hope it will stimulate investment in SMEs.  It also provides that capital allowances for plant and machinery used in manufacturing trades claimed by passive investors in a leasing trade will be included as a specified relief for the purposes of the high earners restriction.</p><p> Section 18 contains a technical amendment to ensure the incentivised scheme of early retirement operates as intended.  The section also relates to section 782A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and strengthens the override provision introduced to enable access to additional voluntary contributions without the need for changes to be made to pension scheme rules or trust deeds.  </p><p> Section 19 relates to employee share ownership trusts.  The legislation is being amended to allow ex-employees to remain in employee share ownership trusts for a period of 20 years, as is available to existing employees.  </p><p> Section 21 will increase the amount of expenditure eligible for the research and development tax credit without reference to the 2003 base year from &euro;200,000 to &euro;300,000.  The section will also increase the limit on the amount of expenditure on research and development outsourced to third parties from 10% to 15% of the total amount of expenditure on research and development qualifying for the credit in a given year.  It also amends the key employee element of the research and development tax credit, in conjunction with section 13.</p><p> Section 23 makes a number of changes to deposit interest retention tax, DIRT.  The main change is the increase in the rate to 41%, with effect from 1 January 2014.  The section brings dividends paid or credited to regular share accounts of credit unions within the DIRT regime from 1 January 2014.  The previous exemption from DIRT for certain interest paid on special term accounts offered by banks and building societies and special term share accounts offered by credit unions has been discontinued from budget night, 15 October 2013.</p><p> Section 25 provides for the withholding tax that will apply to payments made by companies qualifying for film relief under section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to performing artists resident outside EU and EEA member states.  </p><p> Section 30 introduces a single rate of exit tax of 41%.  This applies to payments and deemed payments from life assurance policies and investment funds, in place of the existing rates of 33% and 36%.  The higher rates applying to investments in personal portfolio life policies and personal portfolio investment undertakings have also been increased.  The rate changes are to be introduced with effect from 1 January 2014.</p><p> Section 31 extends the scope of the Living City initiative to include residential properties in certain designated areas constructed up to and including 1914.  There are also a number of technical amendments.  The initiative is subject to EU state aid approval and a commencement order.  The Minister announced in budget 2014 that the initiative would be extended to certain designated areas in the cities of Cork, Galway, Kilkenny and Dublin.  The areas to be designated have not yet been decided.  This will be done in conjunction with the relevant local authorities and other Government agencies.</p><p> Section 33 provides for the removal of the 50% restriction on the amount of prior year trading losses a NAMA participating institution can set off against trading profits.  This should protect the value of deferred tax assets at the banks, improving capital ratios under the new Basel III rules and enhancing the valuation of the State's equity holdings in AIB and Bank of Ireland.  This restriction served only to extend the period of time over which relief for losses could be claimed by the banks but did not restrict the total amount of relief to be claimed.</p><p> In the light of recent rulings from the Court of Justice of the European Union, section 35 provides for an option to defer payment of exit tax in cases where a liability arises following migration of a company's residence to another EU or EEA member state.  Section 34 makes the necessary amendment to the company tax residence rules contained in section 23A of the Taxes Consolidation Act to ensure an Irish-registered company cannot be stateless in terms of its place of tax residency.</p><p> Section 40 makes an amendment to rules relating to additional credit relief for foreign tax paid on foreign dividends in order to bring provisions relating to relief for foreign tax on dividends paid to Irish companies into line with rulings of the Court of Justice of the European Union.  </p><p> Section 43 restricts the extent of losses that may be claimed for capital gains tax purposes in situations where a loan or part of a loan relating to the purchase of the disposed asset has been forgiven or written off by the lender.  </p><p> Section 42 extends capital gains tax retirement relief to disposals of leased farmland in circumstances where, among other conditions, the land is leased over the long term, the minimum lease being five years, and the subsequent disposal is to a person other than a child of the individual disposing of the farmland.</p><p> Section 45 provides for a capital gains tax incentive to encourage entrepreneurs, in particular serial entrepreneurs, to invest in assets used in new productive trading activities as announced in the budget.  Commencement of this measure is subject to receipt of EU state aid approval.</p><p> In Part 2 of the Bill section 48 introduces a new section in general excise law to provide that alcohol products held for sale on unlicensed premises are liable to forfeiture where that premises remains unlicensed because the person who should hold the licence does not qualify for a tax clearance certificate.  </p><p> Section 49 amends section 138 of the Finance Act 2001 which provides that a person suspected of an offence of dealing in, or with, unstamped tobacco products must provide information for a Revenue officer or a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p> <p>It also provides that a Revenue officer or garda may search any bag or receptacle that he or she reasonably believes to contain tobacco products that are concerned in the offence.</p><p>Section 50 amends the provisions of general excise law to clarify that a Revenue officer may, while assigned to the Criminal Assets Bureau, continue to exercise the Revenue powers, functions and duties that have been delegated to that officer.  This section also provides that appeals against excise decisions may be made directly to the appeals commissioners with the exception of VRT matters, which will still be made to the Revenue Commissioners in the first instance.</p><p>Section 51 provides for the introduction of a relief from solid fuel carbon tax on solid fuels with high biomass content.  The relief will be limited to the biomass element of the finished solid fuel.</p><p>Section 52 gives effect to the increase in the rates of tobacco products tax which came into effect on budget night and which are estimated to raise &euro;15.4 million in 2014.</p><p>Section 53 gives effect to the increase in the excise rates of alcohol products tax, which came into effect on budget night and which are estimated to yield &euro;148 million next year.</p><p>Section 58 in Part 3 provides for the retention of the 9% VAT rate on tourism-related services.</p><p>Sections 59 to 61, inclusive, and 65 contain VAT anti-avoidance measures.  Section 62 extends a Finance Act 2013 provision relating to receivers and the capital goods scheme.</p><p>Section 63 increases the VAT cash receipts threshold from &euro;1.25 million to &euro;2 million with effect from 1 May 2014.  This was an extension of a provision we included in last year's budget to help SMEs.</p><p>Section 64 increases the farmer's flat rate addition from 4.8% to 5% with effect from 1 January 2014, as announced in the budget.</p><p>Section 66 provides that the VAT rate applying to the supply of horses and greyhounds, and to the hire of horses, will increase from 4.8% to 9% in compliance with a judgment of the European Court of Justice.  However, the 4.8% rate will continue to apply to livestock in general and to horses that are intended for use as foodstuffs or for use in agricultural production.  I just want to put Members off their Christmas dinners.</p><p>Section 67 extends the existing VAT exemption on water supplied by local authorities to the supply of water made by Irish Water.</p><p>Part 4 deals with stamp duties.  Section 69 adds three courses to the list of qualifications, any one of which must be held to be eligible for the relief from stamp duty on transfers of agricultural land to young trained farmers.</p><p>Section 70 provides for an exemption from stamp duty on the transfer of stocks and marketable securities of companies listed on the enterprise securities market of the Irish Stock Exchange.  The exemption is subject to a commencement order.</p><p>Section 71 provides for an additional 0.15% stamp duty levy on pension fund assets for 2014 and 2015.  The existing 0.6% levy will cease at the end of 2014.  This pays for the 9% tourism-related VAT rate.  If Members want this rate, they must find us the money to do it.  If they do not support this levy, they must support other provisions.</p></speech>

The levy will operate for a period of three years and will be payable on 20 October in each of the years 2014, 2015 and 2016.  The levy is projected to raise a sum of &euro;150 million per year.</p><p>  Part 5 deals with miscellaneous provisions.  Section 77 provides for an exemption from tax for <i>ex gratia</i> payments made by the Ministers for Justice and Equality and Defence and certain payments made by the Minister for Social Protection to beneficiaries pursuant to the Magdalen commission report.  This exempts women who obtained funds under the Government decision from tax and the section deals with the treatment of these payments under tax law.</p><p>  Section 78 amends the mitigation powers of the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister for Finance regarding various fines and penalties</p><p>  Section 79 amends section 917D of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 by including &quot;the Customs Acts&quot; in the range of taxes and duties to which electronic filing of returns and electronic payment of tax and duties will apply.

This system of annuities was implemented by section 22 of the Finance Act 1950 to avoid borrowings for voted capital expenditure making a permanent addition to the national debt.</p><p>  Sections 86 and 87 cover standard annual provisions.</p><p>  I hope in setting out briefly the various sections that Senators will take the opportunity on all Stages to examine the financial statements made by the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform in October in the round.  That the Bill must be enacted by 31 December represents a major logistical and seismic change in the way in which finance Bills are treated.  I very much hope the oversight, questions and analysis, which was useful in during the debate in the other House, will continue in this House, as it has in the past.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State for his detailed explanation of the legislation, which copperfastens and reinforces a terribly unfair and savage budget.  However, I welcome a number of provisions such as the abolition of the travel tax and the home improvements credit.  More should have been done about providing early access to pension funds and I encourage the Minister of State to continue to work on that.  The take-up of last year's budget measure to provide access to additional voluntary contributions in such funds has been minimal.  Are figures available from Revenue in this regard?  An enhanced early access provision could play an important role in allowing people to pay down their debt and make their futures more sustainable.  I previously proposed this measure in writing to the Government, including an additional surcharge for such access and it should be examined.</p><p>The remaining Stages of the Bill will be guillotined tomorrow, as they will all be taken in one block.  I will oppose that because that is not the way to do business.  Neither is it the way the Government parties promised they would do business when they took up office and there is no need for it.  I will raise that on the Order of Business in the morning.</p><p>Anyone who is prudent and responsible has been whacked by the budget.  Anyone with savings, a pension or private health insurance has been penalised.  Section 8 provides for a reduction in tax relief on private health insurance.  The Minister of State did not mention the &quot;gold-plated&quot; private health insurance arrangements referred to by the Minister for Finance on budget day in his contribution.  I raised this with the Minister when we had the budget debate and the Government now agrees 90% of policies will be affected by this change.</p> <p>It is a fact-----</p></speech>

Many of them are aged 50 years or older and they do not necessarily have the ability to move providers.  The Government will now push many younger people who are struggling to pay mortgages and other debts out of the private health insurance market.  That is just one aspect and there is also the issue of what the Government is doing in charging private patients &euro;800 per night for the use of a public bed, which will also help to destroy the private health insurance industry.  Perhaps this is the Government's move towards universal health care in that nobody will be able to avail of it.  This measure is regressive and very regrettable and may be an unintended consequence of the Minister's actions.  Perhaps he did not realise that his actions would have such a massive effect, but there is a detrimental consequence for individuals.</p><p>The Government is effectively ensuring there is no point in people saving any more or putting money on deposit.  The deposit interest retention tax, DIRT, rate is 41% and the exit tax on insurance policies and savings bonds has been increased further.  That means that there is no point in saving or having private health insurance.  There is also very little point in having a pension.  I debated the issue directly with the Minister of State when the Government introduced the private pension levy of 0.6% and argued that the Government was putting its hands in pension pots.  This affected people who were paying into pension funds or existing pensioners who were paying into underfunded schemes and the Government expects these schemes to make cash payments to the Exchequer.  The Fine Gael and Labour Party Government promised last year that this would be the last year of the pension levy.</p></speech>

There has been use of really cute language and the Government has managed to talk about the private pension levy without saying "0.75%".  There has been mention of an additional 0.15% stamp duty levy on pension fund assets in 2014 and 2015, but the existing 0.6% levy will cease at the end of 2014.  There seems to be a really good spin doctor in the Department of Finance who is able to state the private pension levy is to be increased to 0.75%.  What is the cost of this?  According to the Irish Brokers Association, a normal person earning &euro;60,000 and paying into a pension fund since the age of 25 years will be hit for approximately &euro;875 per year.  Retained and retired members have seen pensions and payments reduced to make this cash payment.  There is a massive pension fund leaving the country on 1 January because of the private pension levy.  These regressive decisions have been made by the Government and not only is it bad for the industry, but it is also bad for people who are trying to make provision for their retirement.  At the same time the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Bill seeks to reduce existing pension rights in the private sector, with no change to public sector pensions or a move to a funded basis for such pensions, as opposed to paying them from current expenditure and the tax take.  The person who is making an effort is being whacked.</p><p>I will move specifically to the one-parent family tax credit.  I acknowledge that the Government has made a minor shift in allowing the primary carer who is not working to transfer the tax credit.  There will be 15,700 families affected by this measure and the provision is &euro;1,600 per year.</p></speech>

I agree that the area needed to be reformed and this was put forward on the day almost as an anti-fraud measure.  Family units may split from time to time and with this measure, effectively, the principle of shared parenting has gone out the window.  I will propose an amendment tomorrow that if there is a child support and parenting agreement in place that is legally bound, the credit be shared between the two parents, regardless of whether they are working.</p></speech>

It would allow the credit to be shared.  Will the Government think about this?  This measure will have a massive impact, particularly on those in the average industrial wage bracket of between &euro;30,000 and &euro;40,000, as a &euro;1,600 tax credit is significant.  We all know that there are additional costs for parents looking after kids in different homes, where a marriage or partnership has broken up, as can happen.  The Government should consider people's existing maintenance arrangements as if a person was paying &euro;400 per month and losing a tax credit; there will be a raft of maintenance agreements and orders to be renegotiated, possibly through the courts.  Even with amicable separations, there is the possibility of grave difficulties between two partners who may be doing their best to look after their kids.  I do not believe this was the Government's goal and there is still time to change it to allow a credit to be shared.</p></speech>

This is not the Government's intention but rather how the Revenue Commissioners are applying the measure.  The people concerned are trying to keep their businesses going, but they are being classed as high earners when they are not.  I know the Minister of State has received representations from the Irish Hotels Federation and specific hoteliers.

These are huge strides.  There has also been the sale of Irish Life to Great-West Lifeco for &euro;1.3 billion, with a dividend of &euro;40 million for the State.  We have come a huge distance in the past 12 months.</p><p>With that said and being honest about it, it becomes irrelevant if one is among the approximately 400,000 people who are unemployed.</p> <p>I will return to that and to jobs later.  The one thing I have been talking about since I became spokesperson on finance is that we are now up to all the limits in taxation.  There is no further level of taxation we can go to.  We are at the very top of all of them.  Our income tax is high.  The OECD is of the opinion that our progressive rates are fair.  They are harsh, but fair.  VAT and excise are high.  The only tax we could increase is corporation tax.  I have made the point that perhaps we should raise that question, and the answer is, &quot;No, we are fixing it, we will create certainty, there will be no increase in corporation tax.&quot;  I made all those points because middle Ireland, those earning between &euro;30,000 and &euro;60,000, ends up paying all these taxes.</p><p> An opinion poll in <i>The Irish Times</i>a number of weekends ago asked how much one must earn to be in the top 10% of earners in the State.  People said &euro;150,000, it is &euro;75,000.  That top 10% pay the maximum levels of income tax and higher rates of PRSI.  However, people who earn between &euro;30,000 and &euro;60,000 are the engine of spending in this State and they are being taxed at a high rate.  At some stage we will have to give those people some breaks.  We are not there yet.  We would love to be there, but it will take a little time.</p><p> In giving effect to the budget with today's Bill there are areas that must be welcomed.  These include the abolition of the travel tax, the housing renovation scheme to pull people back from the black market and the VAT rate for the hospitality sector remaining at 9%.  We all lobbied for that.  There was not one of us who did not chase that down and try to get the Government to retain that rate.  It is there, and it is being paid from somewhere.  In our pre-election manifesto we said we would take an amount of money from the pension pots and allocate it to that.  We said we would do it and we did it.</p></speech>

I want the corporations in this country to pay their fair share.  I do not want middle Ireland to pay it all.  We were criticised in US Senate hearings.  There was a debate on whether or not it was fair.  I do not know, but we suffered significant reputational damage because of that.  We cannot resolve internationally the practice of very efficient tax lawyers and accountants doing the job they do very well.  Some of the best in the world are based here.  However, we can be part of the resolution of this because it must be resolved.  I saw the small amount of tax Amazon paid in the UK with the number of employees and turnover it has.  I am just using Amazon as an example.  It is probably no better or worse than a number of other international companies.</p><p>I was very disappointed with the below-cost selling by the multiples, in particular the supermarkets.

It is difficult to measure that damage but in time the health sector will be impacted by some of the beers in particular which have 5% or 6% alcohol.  The private health care sector has been impacted.  Approximately 50% of people had been participating in private health care.

The 58,000 people in employment today who were not in employment this time last year are the only way we can come out of this recession.  It is being called the "great recession."  That is probably not a bad thing; we did not slip into a great depression.  Those people will be the engine of recovery.  I welcome the JobsPlus and JobBridge schemes which are moving in the right direction.</p><p>I have sympathy for separated couples.  I accept that it probably was not feasible for the tax credit for a separated couple to be available to two people when a married couple or a couple in partnership has none.  Equally, when couples separate there are financial implications that are difficult to measure.  I welcome the opportunity for the tax credit to be made available to one person who is working if the other person is not working.  I would like to think that perhaps there is more we can do, although I do not know if there is.  I would like to think there would be a very deep scrutiny and analysis of this measure if it is having a very detrimental impact.</p><p>It is no fun for people who are separated.  It is not easy.  I have friends who are separated, one of whom, a garda, is older and has moved out of that poverty trap, which it is for some people.  He told me that were it not for that tax credit he would have been in a very dark financial place.  It is something we should analyse.  As I said earlier, I am not one to ignore the fact that a tax credit is a cost to the Exchequer but if undue difficulties result from this we should revisit it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-11a.280" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1171" speakername="Jillian van Turnhout" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121100029#DD01800"><p>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House and comprehensively outlining for us what is in the Finance Bill.</p> <p>I join others in welcoming measures such as the travel tax and the home renovation incentive but I will spend my time on the matters with which I have issues, which are section 7, obviously, and Part 3 on VAT where other matters could have been addressed but were not and I would like to take this opportunity to raise them with the Minister of State.</p><p> Section 7 deals with the single person child carer credit, introduced by the Finance Bill to replace the one parent family tax credit which will be abolished.  I have great difficulty with section 7 because it will impact on separated, divorced, unmarried and single parents.  I welcome the proposal made by Senator O'Brien.  I would prefer if we were not doing this at present but if we must do it let us find a fairer way to do so.</p><p> In addressing this issue I will adopt terminology to reflect that in the vast majority of cases - I do not say in all cases - the resident primary carer will be the mother and the non-resident co-parent will be the father.  The Bill refers to the non-resident co-parent as the secondary claimant, which makes it sound as though one parent is secondary to the other.  The Bill makes efforts to make arrangements for the non-resident co-parent to be able to avail in whole or in part of the single person child care tax credit where the primary carer is not using it.  I welcome the fact that as the Bill went through the D&aacute;il the Minister made amendments but they exacerbate the problem.  I urge the Minister of State to reconsider the criteria set out in section 7(2)(<i>b</i>) whereby it must be proved the child or children spend a minimum of 100 days with the non-resident co-parent in each given year.  This is excessive and unnecessary, and arguably it is unworkable particularly for unmarried fathers.</p><p> Before I address the practical issues I must state I believe there are flawed concepts.  We should act the best interests of the child and Article 3.1 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child states in all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration.  The 100 day requirement reinforces a negative stereotype of single fathers in particular, implying they must be cajoled into participating in their child's life to avail of a tax credit which can be significant for some fathers in terms of income.  Fathers will lose an estimated &euro;215 per month which is &euro;2,500 annually.  I have met groups such as Treoir and individuals affected by this and it has been suggested to me some single fathers are already under so much financial strain they are considering giving up work to relieve themselves of their maintenance payments.  I wonder whether this is a labour activation measure.  It ought not to act as a further disincentive to fathers working.  The majority of fathers do not have to be incentivised to partake in caring for and bringing up their children.  Despite the breakdown of relationships the majority of parents come to consensual arrangements on co-parenting their children.  Sometimes this takes time in the first stretches of a separation or divorce, but over time they come to consensual arrangements.  I do not see why the State is interfering in the way it purports to do.  It is an overprescriptive measure and an unwarranted interference in family life.  It is particularly unwelcome since the breakdown of the parental relationship is often stressful and fractious and can be subject to stops and starts with regard to reaching agreements on visitation and access arrangements.  The State should be supportive of reaching consensus rather than laying down preconditions.</p><p> To go back to the practicality and feasibility of the 100 day requirement, it would mean a father would have to see the child every single weekend throughout the year to qualify for the tax credit with no room for manoeuvre.  To give an example, it is unreasonable and totally undesirable to expect the mother of a newborn baby or infant to forego the care and company of her baby to the extent required.  It would be especially problematic where the mother is breastfeeding.  If a child is ill, perhaps in hospital for a period of time, he or she will not be able to travel or stay overnight.  Where parents live a considerable distance from one another a weekly arrangement will not be financially viable.  Children have events at weekends such as dance recitals and sports matches, of which I know the Minister of State is more than well aware, which can also impinge on this.  The work hours of either parents might change or the relationship between the parents might temporarily break down.  In some cases teenage children will want to determine their own activities and what they do, but they will be told they must see their father for taxation reasons.  The State needs to be very careful about involving itself in family life.  We could all come up with many more problems with the 100 day rule.  Who will monitor it?  Who will police it?</p><p> There are situations where the State gets involved in family life to ensure children's welfare and protection but this is not one of them.  It is wholly inappropriate for the State to interfere with parents consensual child-rearing arrangements in this way.  I would prefer if section 7 were not in the Bill.  I support the outline of the amendment proposed by Fianna F&aacute;il but I would have to see the wording of it.  Perhaps the Minister could look to replace the 100 day requirement with a situation where it is possible the secondary claimant could avail of the single person child carer credit through a transfer at the request of the primary carer if the parents consensually agree.  Alternatively a request from the primary carer could be accompanied by a self-assessment from the primary carer that the non-resident co-parent is deserving of the tax credit, under a principle already established by Revenue for the local property tax.  There are other ways we could do this, but the 100 day rule is problematic and not workable.  It is the State interfering in family life.  I urge the State to conduct an impact analysis on how the issues I have outlined will be dealt with prior to commencing this part.  Perhaps we can amend it before it finishes its time in the House.</p><p> I wish to raise a number of issues with regard to VAT.  We are trying to encourage small businesses online but many of them tell me the fact non-Irish Internet companies can make &euro;35,000 before the VAT regulations dictate they must declare it is hugely problematic.  It is also not fair, particularly when one examines the EU directive on VAT groupings.  We need to examine this issue to allow Irish companies compete on a fair playing field.</p><p> The Irish Heart Foundation has raised the issue of VAT being charged on defibrillators and such devices and on advertising campaigns.  The Irish Heart Foundation runs an annual campaign on stroke awareness and one can demonstrate the savings this awareness makes for the State.  This is a service on behalf of the State and the Irish Heart Foundation works with the Department of Health on it.  It must pay VAT and cannot reclaim it even though there is a direct cost benefit.  There is no incentive for it to run such campaigns although we can see a direct cost saving.  I do not want to hear an answer about the EU because the UK has found a way around it.  The UK is able to allow charities in certain areas to reclaim VAT on advertising or goods where certain criteria are set down.</p><p> Prior to the budget I wrote to the Minister, Deputy Noonan, on mobile phone donations to charities.  At present mobile phone operators have a problem with their billing system whereby they can only bill people at one VAT rate.  One would think it would be simple to introduce a second VAT rate but it cannot be done.  We saw the success of the fundraiser on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; with Majella O'Donnell who shaved her head for the Irish Cancer Society.  VAT was charged on all the text messages.  The Revenue Commissioners state there does not have to be VAT on them.  It should be possible to reclaim it but the mobile phone company would have to go to each individual to ask him or her to reclaim the VAT.  Will the Minister make a ruling that VAT charged on text donations is not allowable for the reclaiming of VAT?  The mobile phone companies would then have to hand over all of the VAT claimed.  At present mobile phone companies have a fund which is donated.</p> <p>In the Majella O'Donnell case the fund surpassed itself.  We want to encourage people to donate and I shall forward my proposal to the Minister of State.  I want to use this opportunity to draw attention to the fact that there are other ways to give back to society.  I thank the Acting Chairman for his latitude in the debate.</p></speech>

He is always very welcome and we appreciate his frequent visits to the House.</p><p>It is worth reflecting that history matters.  With regard to budget 2014, the Bill contains the measures that were announced, in the main, on budget day.  We stand on the cusp of exiting the EU-IMF bailout programme on 15 December so it is important to examine the measures before us in a broader context.  First let us consider the exiting of the bailout and look at the difficulties that we have endured as a nation.  The Irish people have made great sacrifices over the past number of years.  It is also important to acknowledge that the economy is improving, we are creating jobs at a rate of 3,000 per month, reducing unemployment, retail sales figures have increased by more than 5% and there is renewed confidence in the housing market as mentioned in the newspapers recently.  That confidence may be a mixed blessing.  We are making progress on mortgage arrears and, thankfully, there are more visitors to the country now than in the past number of years.  </p><p>I wish to draw attention to the fiscal assessment report prepared by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council which criticised us in the past.  Therefore, it is important to note its comment that, &quot;Good progress continues to be made in bringing sustainability to the public finances and in restoring the borrowing capacity of the State.&quot;</p><p>The Minister for Finance has mentioned a projected growth of 0.2% in 2013 and 2% in 2014.  We are turning the corner but we must acknowledge the risks.  In the past week we have heard about the prospect of a patent cliff damaging export potential.  However, there are green shoots in the bio-pharmaceutical sector and we are more than holding our own and increasing job creation in the sector.  When examining the Finance Bill and its measures we must acknowledge that IFAC has identified budget risks in the group forecast.  It has also stated that the risks are tilted on the downside and that we are on the right path.  As a Government we are sometimes very willing to examine specific issues.  I shall raise a few issues during my speech later because I am not entirely happy with the Finance Bill.  However, it is important to look at the big picture and acknowledge what has been achieved.  </p><p>As Senator Michael D'Arcy mentioned, there is further hope on the horizon following the Bank of Ireland's announcement that it intends to buy back its preference shares worth over &euro;1 billion.  I hope that sum will be available to us for further capital investment in the economy.  There is more buoyancy in terms of the European element, particularly the recovery of the UK economy.  I hope that we are on track to exit austerity in the same way that we will exit the EU-IMF bailout programme.</p><p>We must recognise that we have done a lot, particularly in this budget, by not taking more from the economy than necessary.  It was critical that we did not take out &euro;600 million.  I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and attended meetings where I listened to both perspectives, the employer perspective and union perspective, who urged the Government to take no more than necessary.  Not taking out more was critical to domestic confidence in the economy.  The retention of a buffer of 0.3% in order to get us over the line to exit the bailout was also important.  As I said at the beginning of my contribution, history matters.  We have done the right thing for the economy and Irish people and the Finance Bill should be considered in that context.</p><p>I shall now deal with the detailed provisions of the Bill.  I welcome some sections but have concerns about others.  With regard to sections 5 and 6, I welcome the home renovation incentive announced on budget day and the measures contained in the Bill.  The measure ticks a number of boxes.  Despite the anger felt towards the construction sector post the demise of the Celtic tiger we all now realise that the sector has suffered greatly with the recession.  There are many construction workers in receipt of social welfare payments and that number is stubbornly high.  The current state of the construction sector is unsustainable.  Its reduced size and capacity is not consistent with the size of the economy.  A construction sector of around 10% would be an appropriate size for the economy and its necessity to grow.</p><p>Cynics have said that the home renovation incentive measures are designed to take people out of the black economy.  Most people are compliant and want to deal with a builder who can give a guarantee and will be in existence in six months' time.  The measure is important but I ask that the Minister keep the minima and maxima under review and monitor whether it delivers for the construction sector and the needs of the economy in terms of thermal efficiency.</p><p>I have one issue with the measure.  The incentive, as currently drafted, is only available to owner-occupiers and owner-occupied properties.  Most of the worst properties in the State are in the rental sector which, as the Minister of State will know, constitutes over 20% of the overall housing sector.  I know that the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and Threshold have serious concerns about fuel poverty and poor standards of accommodation.  I ask him to consider the rental sector.  Better standards are required from landlords but we must be fair to them and ensuring they are encouraged to improve rental properties.  The State has spent a significant amount of money on improving council houses, for example, in order to bring them up to scratch.  I ask the Minister of State to consider extending the measure to the rental sector with a view to improving standards. </p><p>Section 6 could play a critical role in encouraging former construction workers to return to work thus taking advantage of the economic recovery and measures such as the home renovation incentive.  That is a very important measure.  The requirement of 18 months has been reduced to 12 months, which is most welcome.  </p><p>I echo Senator van Turnhout's concern about section 7.  I have had a lot of experience dealing with people who live in single parent scenarios.  In other aspects of the social protection and tax codes we give lower rates of payment to people who live together thereby acknowledging that there are extra costs for people who live separately.  We must be conscious of the fact that in a marital breakdown situation it is not possible to get consensus in many scenarios.  Arguments over who gets what, where the children go and will go, when, why, where and wherever can sometimes be an unnecessary source of discord in a very traumatic situation.  I again argue that we need to monitor the measure, to keep it under review and to say that we are prepared to revisit the mater, as we have done with other Government measures, if we discover that it does not work and is detrimental to childhood and family life.</p><p>Section 8 refers to the ceilings that were introduced for private health care.  I must be honest with the Minister of State, I am a great believer in the poetry of Yeats who said that this is &quot;no country for old men.&quot;  I hope that is not the situation.  I want us to move into a new tomorrow post-troika where older people here do not have to worry about the amount of money they must pay for private health care.  I hope that the public health system will be so good that older people will no longer need private health care.  As Senator Michael D'Arcy mentioned, 47% of people will be unaffected by the measure in its entirety and the remaining 53% will be marginally affected.  Again, we need to keep the measure under review.  If it has an unnecessary or unavoidable consequence on the number of people in private health care then we will need to reconsider.  At the same time we must move in the direction of providing free overall health care, as we did in this budget, for the under-6s.</p><p>Section 23 deals with the deposit retention tax.  We have moved positively, over the past number of budgets, to increase rates of capital acquisitions tax, capital gains tax and to bring capital taxes more in line with income taxes.  It has always been my view, as I have mentioned on a number of occasions, that somebody who works in a supermarket for an extra hour should not pay more taxes than somebody who makes a share transaction on the Stock Exchange.  The same must be true for deposit interest retention tax and it must fit in with all of the other taxes. </p> <p>My concern about the 41% is that it does not discriminate between people on higher incomes and those on lower incomes who, if subject to income tax rates, would be paying a much lower rate of tax.  The Minister should look more closely at the overall rates of all of the taxes, capital and otherwise, to ensure they operate in a consistent fashion.</p></speech>

Here I make one request also: that it be extended to renovations that do not necessary relate to owner occupation.  Many of the properties to which the Living City initiative applies are accommodation of the &quot;Strumpet City&quot; type in the private rented sector.  It is important, particularly in the context of the inner cities of, for example, Dublin, Limerick and Waterford - and places such as D&uacute;n Laoghaire, where there are rented inhabited pre-1914 properties - that owners are not discouraged from renovating them because they happen to be in the rental sector.</p><p>I thank the Minister for being in the House.</p></speech>

I suppose our concern is to ensure we do not return to the bad old days and let the previous operation of the Irish economy return to haunt us.</p><p>As the Minister of State plots the future, his Department needs to look at financial regulation.  In recent times, we have had discussions on the regulation of accountants, which is under the remit of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, and the regulation of pension funds, which comes under the Department of Social Protection.  These are financial services and when they are not operating efficiently they undermine the prospects of recovery.  That obviously refers to banks and insurance companies, as well as credit unions which have joined that list.  A traditional function of the Department of Finance - regulating the financial sector - is necessary as we try to recover.  I favour strict loan-to-value ratios and strict loan-to-income criteria because we want a banking system that is ready and fit for purpose as the Government tries to plot the recovery following the bailout as and from next Sunday.</p><p>I worry about the amount of material in the Bill that is from the world of tax lawyers, tax accountants, lobbyists, etc.  As we move forward into the new scenario, I favour simple low rates of tax with no deductions and no allowances across the board.</p><p>Particularly in light of our discussion on the Water Services (No. 2) Bill 2013 last night, it is necessary to reassert the old role of the Department of Finance in project appraisal - the examination of whether investments are worthwhile.  Left to themselves, spending Departments will go on spending sprees.  The restraining hand of the Minister is needed.  There is a need for stricter regulation of accountants and pension funds, which are referred to in the Bill.</p><p>I thank the Minister of State for his broad assessment of the economy.  On our constructive dialogue with the fiscal advisory council, to which Senator Hayden referred, the members of which came before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform last week, that seems to be working well.  As the troika leaves, there is another independent source of advice and dialogue between the Minister and his officials.</p><p>I note there is a new strategy being prepared as we try to find a way forward without returning to the era of mistakes, which to my mind means we must avoid relying on the construction sector or property subsidies in the future.  They did get us into trouble.  I note Senator Hayden would let them off the hook more lightly than I would, but the damage caused by that type of economics was serious.</p><p>The research and development subsidy was mentioned.  I have an OECD report from October 2013 which states that governments should ensure that research and development tax incentive policies provide value for money.  There is much kick-and-hope in a great deal of what we invest in research and development, and I hope that when we discuss the Bill on Committee Stage there will be evidence.  In a recent report from the United States, one of the headlines is that the US Congress should not extend or make permanent the research credit without making reforms.  One hears about groupthink and herd instinct, which got us into trouble in previous times.  Let us hope that an uncritical belief in research and development does not add to that.</p></speech>

As the Minister of State has said on so many occasions, we need evidence-based policy.</p><p>Section 15 deals with retirement relief for sports people.  I wonder whether the sentence in the explanatory memorandum is what is intended; perhaps the Minister of State might look at this prior to Committee Stage.  It states, &quot;In addition, instead of having to be resident in Ireland at the time of retirement, a sportsperson may claim relief if they are resident in an EEA or EFTA country at the time of retirement.&quot;  Does that mean that all the members of the Minister of State's Leinster team will go to France and not stay here?  How would we face the Minister, Deputy Noonan, if the Munster team has disappeared to France for the same reason?  I do not know if that is what is intended.  It should be that the sports people can avail of the relief providing they are still playing and then retire when in Ireland.  Where they go afterwards is up to themselves.  I wonder whether that contradicts the intention as per the explanatory memorandum.</p><p>On the film relief, the explanatory referendum states that under section 24, an individual can qualify for tax relief &quot;regardless of where the individual is resident.&quot;  Are we extending tax relief from the Irish Exchequer to persons associated with the film business who do not even live here?  I ask that the Minister examine that before Committee Stage.</p><p>In section 44, the Minister includes a provision to address the problem of supply and delivery of marked gas oil for laundering.  According to the Smithwick report, the two officers who were killed were investigating smuggling in the Dundalk area.  In the past year, a tanker was stolen from Aiken Barracks in Dundalk and it has disappeared into the south Armagh triangle.  I commend the Minister's officials on trying to cover this as best they can but, given the level of criminality to which this has led in so many Border counties, including a find in Meath, is it time for discussion with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on whether subsidised fuel is the best way of assisting agriculture?  The Department has tried everything to make this business legitimate but if farmers get a source of cheap fuel and it is passed on - I note my distinguished colleague from County Louth is here-----</p></speech>

On this matter, everybody is on the Minister's side.</p><p>I am concerned about pension funds.  The Minister has chosen to dip into them but, as Senator Michael D'Arcy stated earlier, the sector itself is in fairly awful shape.  We had this discussion with the Minister of State's colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton.  The sector has much higher expense ratios than in the United Kingdom.  It failed to anticipate longevity.  It gave out too much in added years and early retirements.  Would it reassure the pensioners if the Minister, in taking the levy as he proposes, made the sector smarten up so that pensions would not be reduced and the revenue he needs could come from efficiency gains?</p><p>I would wonder about the section that provides for the early retirement scheme.  Why is the Minister still doing that?  That is old hat.  Pension funds need employees to work for longer.  It is almost going back to the era of social partnership, with persons around the table awarding each other early retirement and leaving a massive debt for Deputy Brian Hayes's generation of Ministers to take up.  I do not know why it is still here in the 2014 budget.</p> <p>These are among the many matters we will discuss.  I like the idea that we will make recommendations, rather than amendments, tomorrow in our discussion on how best to plan the finances of the country.  Very good progress has been made in this regard.  With the troika set to leave on Sunday, we must plot new ways to ensure that, consciously or subconsciously, we do not drift into making the same mistakes that brought us to the circumstances we experienced in 2008.</p><p>I would like the Department to take a stronger role in the regulation of financial services.  It should not leave pensions to the Department of Social Protection or the regulation of accountants to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  These areas must be up to the mark and project appraisal must be better than what the beneficiary industries would like.  These industries receive the benefits while the State bears the costs.  I hope the Government will not find it necessary to introduce additional taxation again in the years ahead to pay for capital investment that did not yield a return.</p><p>There is much that is positive in the legislation and I wish the Minister of State well in his endeavours.  I look forward to Committee Stage.</p></speech>

He referred to the economic backdrop against which the budget was set.  I am pleased to note that the projected growth rate for 2014 is 2% or more and domestic demand is expected to pick up.  The target of achieving a general government deficit of 4.8% is prudent and in line with what has been long planned.  It is also noteworthy that 2014 marks the first time since the crisis began that Ireland will achieve a small primary surplus.  We are on our way back.</p><p>In the past two years, the focus has been on implementing and ultimately exiting the EU-IMF programme.

I was not particularly pleased with the abolition of the one-parent family tax credit and its replacement with a new single-parent child carer credit, as provided for in section 7.  It has been said that this change was recommended by the Commission on Taxation.  The commission also recommended taxing child benefit, yet the Government has not done so.  This measure could have the unintended consequence of discriminating against separated fathers, because the principal carer in the vast majority of cases is the mother, notwithstanding the time separated fathers spend with their children.  This goes back to the theory of separate spheres, according to which women are characterised by feeling, caring and emotion, while men are characterised by reason and business acumen.  This theory is old hat.</p><p>  We spent a weekend at the Constitutional Convention discussing the role of women in politics and the home and the need to recalibrate the constitutional outlook on this issue.  It is necessary to have a similar recalibration in respect of the role of fathers in the home and in marriage, which must be recognised in legislation and the Constitution.  We should not take backward steps in that regard, which could be the perception of this measure.  The single-parent tax credit was probably the only recognition afforded to separated fathers.  It is now being abolished, although I was very pleased that, following representations, the Minister introduced an amendment on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il to the effect that, where the designated primary carer relinquishes the credit, it may transfer to what is described as a &quot;secondary claimant&quot;.  The secondary claimant is then entitled to claim the credit in respect of the qualifying child concerned.  This measure should be extended so that, by agreement, the credit could be shared or divided. </p><p>  Section 7(2)(<i>b</i>) provides that to be eligible, the secondary claimant must prove that the qualifying child is resident with him or her for at least 100 days.  How will this provision work?  I do not believe there is a District Court judge in the land who would state that this can be proved or disproved.  Will children be brought before the courts to make a statement that they spent 100 days in the previous year with their mum or dad?  Must the claimant keep a record?  I respectfully request that this provision be removed, as Treoir and other organisations have requested.  </p><p>  The 50 cent increase in excise duty on a bottle of wine should be the final such increase.  The Government should introduce a minimum pricing policy for alcohol.  Wholesalers are finding the increases in excise duty on wine especially tough.  A bottle of wine that cost &euro;5 two years ago now costs &euro;10 as a result of VAT and excise duty increases.  As the Minister of State is aware, percentage profit is based on the cost price plus excise duty. </p><p>   Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire St&aacute;it as teacht isteach anseo.

The Minister has missed an opportunity to pursue Tesco, Dunnes, Aldi, Lidl and other multiples for additional revenues from alcohol sales.  Nothing was done in the budget to address the issue of large retailers wiping out small off-licences.</p><p>There has been much hype about the forthcoming exit from the troika programme.  While the country exits the programme, almost 450,000 people are out of work and between 70,000 and 80,000 young people have emigrated, with more leaving every week.</p> <p>The Department of Social Protection is advocating that young Irish people should go to Canada to find employment instead of finding it in Cork, Dublin, Galway or Donegal.  That shows a lack of joined-up thinking in tackling the jobs issue.  Until jobs are created and the promises made before the last election are achieved, including in the five-point plan, to create 100,000 jobs in the first three years in office, no one can take solace.</p><p>I am not laying the blame at the feet of the Government because it cannot create jobs in the private sector.  It can create the environment to allow jobs to be created in the private sector.  It can be done by regulation or enforcement of the banking sector.  It pains me to see the manner in which our banks, some of which have been bailed out, are treating the SME sector.  Government policy is focused, through the IDA, on foreign direct investment but very often our SME sector is left on the hind tit and there is very little support available to it.  When SMEs seek co-financing on small grants from the county enterprise boards or other State agencies, they are unable to find it.  Officials from BIM appearing at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine confirmed this yesterday.  I am not making a political point, State officials say there is no co-financing available even for small grant aided projects of &euro;5,000 or &euro;6,000 where a job is being created.  Until that is tackled, we will not see jobs being created in many parts of the country.  The alternative, even when Fianna F&aacute;il was in government, is that the State should intervene to create a banking system similar to the ACC system in the 1980s, where at least there is some control over the leveraging of finance and the availability of finance for SMEs.</p><p>Some 100,000 people are facing into Christmas in mortgage arrears and the problem has not been tackled.  Under this Government's watch, the banks have been given additional power to write to customers and to deem customers unco-operative.  As a result of the letter, the customer's rights are diluted.  The manner in which banks are reacting is disgraceful.  I know of cases where banks telephoned customers but did not leave messages and because the customer did not pick up on messages from a blocked number, the banks wrote to the customers and told them they were unco-operative.  The banks need to get a life but it can only happen if the Government is determined to deal with them in a appropriate manner.</p><p>The measure dealing with the one-parent family is a retrograde step.  It penalises families and parents who are not living together through no fault of their own.  People will lose up to &euro;2,500 per year and this will typically affect men.  I welcome the retention of the 9% VAT rate.  I lobbied for it and it is a good idea for the tourism industry.</p><p>I do not share the ambition of the home improvement tax credit.  It is a complicated, cumbersome scheme and the threshold, at &euro;5,000, is too high.  If someone wants to replace the garage door or house door, a small piece of work is precluded.  The situation where contractors must subscribe and make returns will create difficulty, particularly for elderly people trying to avail of the scheme.  A simpler system could have been worked out, using grant aid or a tax rebate.  The system should be examined, even at this late stage, to make it as user-friendly as possible.  It does not come across that way.</p><p>I refer to the physiotherapy issue.  The Minister for Finance recently said at the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, that if self-referrals for physiotherapy were allowed, the estimate of the additional cost to the Exchequer is unquantifiable but that it would undoubtedly increase the cost of the relief.  The statement has been vigorously rejected by the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists.  The body has provided the Minister and the departmental officials with international evidence of the cost effectiveness of allowing direct access to physiotherapy.  The case made by the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists, that self-referral will cut the cost, has been fully supported by the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly.  The process is referred to in section 9 of the legislation and it should be extended to physiotherapy.  I ask the Minister of State to examine this point and we may table an amendment on Committee Stage.  People should be allowed to self-refer in physiotherapy.  It makes perfect sense if we are trying to keep people out of hospitals through primary care.  Why should we need another medical practitioner to refer people to physiotherapists if people know they have sore backs, knees that do not function properly, strains or injuries from falling down stairs?</p></speech>

I have been debating with Senator Michael D'Arcy about whether it feels like a long three years or a short three years since the troika came to town.  We are in disagreement on it but it is welcome to see them departing this weekend.  It is a momentous event to regain economic sovereignty.  Looking back over the past five years, when the country was staring over an economic abyss, particularly when the troika eventually came in, we have seen an immense improvement even though it is slow and unemployment levels are still too high.  We are seeing positive changes, to which the Minister of State alluded, in the return to growth in the second quarter and the employment increase by 3.2% over the past year to the third quarter.  We are seeing better news and it seems as if we are in changed times.</p><p>The less momentous change is the change in the budget time and the fact that we are having this debate in December, rather than having the debate on the Finance Bill.  Normally, the budget would be fresh in our minds this week.  The timing of the budget in October is preferable as it gives greater stability and gives people a chance to absorb the fiscal and tax changes made in the budget in advance of the Christmas period.  It has led to a less fraught period around the budget.</p><p>I welcome many of the measures in the budget designed specifically as job stimulation and activation measures.  It is not just about setting out tax changes but also economic policy and job creation.  There are important initiatives and I take issue with the comments of Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill about the home renovation incentive provided for in section 5.  It creates excitement and positivity among small building contractors in respect of home improvement works they can bid for.  People who have been putting off getting the work done will be encouraged to do so and it is about increasing confidence and getting people thinking about spending money on home improvements.  Based on my conversations with people, we will see a good level of take-up.</p><p>Other speakers have referred to the retention of the 9% tourism VAT rate.  The figures speak for themselves in terms of increased tourism revenue and in the number of tourists with The Gathering.  We hope the momentum will keep up next year.  Everyone must be cognisant of the fact that The Gathering provided a boost and let us hope that boost continues.  The retention of the VAT rate in section 58 was good news for the tourism sector.</p><p>I refer to the incentive to start your own business in section 6 and the extension of the Living City initiative in section 31.</p> <p>All these measures will boost confidence and stimulate job creation.</p><p> Section 77 provides for an exemption from tax for <i>ex gratia</i>payments made following the Magdalen commission report to survivors of the Magdalen laundries.  This is a welcome and important measure, which everyone will support.</p><p> However, I would like to devote the remainder of my contribution to section 7, about which there has been much debate.  Senator D'Arcy raised the issue in the House on 22 October and I supported him on 23 October.  Many of us at that stage had identified a potential unforeseen consequence of the change to the one-parent family tax credit.  It is welcome, as Senator D'Arcy said, that the Minister made a significant amendment to the section in the D&aacute;il.  I acknowledge the reasons for the introduction of the change.  The one-parent family tax credit is to be replaced with the new single person child care credit.  At face value, a positive reason for this is that it would be a job activation measure that would assist single parents or carers with the cost of child care but it was only to be made available to the primary carer of the child.  There were concerns that the credit had been claimed by multiple individuals in the past and it offered non-cohabiting couples more favourable tax treatment than cohabiting couples.  A departmental note points out it could have been a perverse incentive not to cohabit.  These were good reasons at face value to make the change but once one read between the lines, one could see the potential adverse consequences, most importantly, for children of separated parents where the role of the separated father in their lives could be diminished.  Perhaps that is reading too much into the effect of the change but that is how it was taken.</p><p> As a feminist, it is troubling there is still an old fashioned view of a primary carer and a breadwinner, as Senator D'Arcy said.  There are different models of parenting but even following divorce and separation, there are shared parenting models and both parents are primary carers.  They may both work outside the home and be primary carers and, therefore, the old fashioned model which we debated at the Constitutional Convention has to be given a more inclusive reading.  We have to be careful, therefore, about how we frame our legislation in that regard.  I am glad for those reasons that the previous formulation, which would have restricted the tax credit to the primary carer, may be relinquished by the primary carer and the secondary claimant may be entitled to claim in respect of the qualifying child.</p><p> Like Senator D'Arcy, I have a difficulty with the tricky provision whereby to qualify the secondary claimant must prove the child resides with him or her for periods of at least 100 days a year.  That may be difficult and it may undermine the positive value of the change.  Could that be improved?  We can tease this out in more detail on Committee Stage, as I am still grappling with it.  Originally, the notion many of us had was that the credit would be shared by the parents.  The Government's response is that would be difficult for logistical and legal reasons. </p></speech>

I will not suggest, like Senator O'Brien, that the Government whacked anyone but it was not a fair budget and this is not a fair Bill.</p><p>My party has always said that the budget deficit had to be closed and we provided a fully costed alternative to the Government's budget showing how we would do everything differently.  Next week, the Government parties will announce their medium-term economic strategy and the Minister for Finance told my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, that he has met more than 200 individuals to discuss it.  The vast majority of these representative voices come form the world of enterprise and finance and I am concerned that representative groups for the poor and disadvantaged have not been consulted as much as they should have been.  Before a new strategy is implemented, equality budgeting must be considered in serious detail.  I acknowledge this is Labour Party policy but the Government should test policies in the context of how they affect people in terms of gender, age, income, marital and disability status.  That is the way forward and we need to examine this concept in future budgets and finance Bills.</p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in did not support the Bill in the D&aacute;il and we will put it to a vote in the House later but we have put forward alternative proposals.  We have again proposed a wealth tax but we have not costed it.  However, the figures to do that have not been made available and that demonstrates a conservative approach to how we tax wealth.</p><p>I refer to a study by the Nevin Economic Research Institute and I would like the Minister of State to comment on its wealth tax proposals and its reference to progressivity in the tax system.  In the working paper, Direct and Indirect Tax Contributions of Households in Ireland, Dr. Miche&aacute;l Collins and Dara Turnbull, found that the poorest 10% of income earners pay as much tax as the top 10% and our tax system is less progressive than has been claimed previously.  They examined figures from the CSO household budget surveys in 2009 and 2010.  The poorest 10% of income earners paid a tax rate of 27.67% while the top 10% paid 29.24%.  The study examined the impact of all taxation, including income tax, USC, PRSI, indirect taxes such as VAT and excise duty and levies such as television licences and vehicle taxes.  A number of previous studies into the tax contribution high income groups make only considered income tax and-or PRSI and, therefore, this study was a divergence from the norm.</p></speech>

It refers to the different forms of taxation people pay and where their income goes.  While the Minister of State has issues with the CSO data, does he envisage more room for progressivity?</p><p>  Like every other Senator, I would like to discuss the single parents issue but I will not labour the point too much.  Many alternatives have been put to the Minister of State but one proposal that could offer breathing space in order that proper assessments can be made is to use a ministerial order.  That would give the Minister for Finance time to examine alternatives which would be a better way to ensure all children and parents are not affected.  It was discussed at length during the debate on the Bill in the D&aacute;il and a number of amendments were made in this regard.</p><p>  I welcome the home renovation scheme but the impact will be limited.  As Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill said, the threshold is too high for many to avail of the scheme.</p><p>  Under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012, VAT is payable on services provided by personal insolvency practitioners.  I acknowledge this is not covered by the Bill but the issue has been raised with me and I wonder if the Minister of State could comment and seek to have these services exempted from VAT.</p><p>  Earlier this week a sexually transmitted infection, STI, prevention campaign was launched by the Dublin Aids Alliance, USI, <i>spunout.ie</i>, the HSE, the Crisis Pregnancy Programme and the Think Contraception campaign.</p> <p>I wish to discuss the application of VAT to non-oral contraceptives.  Oral contraceptives have a 0% VAT rate but non-oral contraceptives attract a 13.5% rate.  Previously such contraceptives had a 21% rate applied, but that was reduced in a budget a few years ago.  There should be no tax on safe sex, especially in this day and age and when we are trying to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted infections.  We should be promoting the consistent use of condoms, so perhaps the issue could be considered in future.  These are the issues I wished to raise and I am interested in hearing the Minister of State's comments on the Nevin Economic Research Institute study and progressivity.</p></speech>

Like my colleagues, I welcome the fact that the troika will be leaving very shortly, which is good news for all of us, and it is great that we will have our sovereignty returned as we approach Christmas.  I hope it will give people a boost so that they will go out and do a bit of shopping.  My colleagues have welcomed VAT rate changes in the tourism sector, and the decision to keep the rate at 9% has been welcomed across the board.  That has done much for the sector, and representatives have been in touch to tell us how they welcome the retention of the 9% rate.  It will provide a major boost.</p><p>I welcome the introduction of the home renovation grant, which is a very positive move.  This is something I have spoken about for quite a long time, along with a number of colleagues.  It will give small builders, mainly in rural Ireland but also in towns and villages, an incentive and allow them to take on employees.  I would like to see the scheme extended to cover landscaping projects or cases in which people have trouble with a septic tank and may not qualify for the grant available for repairs, for example.  Such an extension would be positive, and many septic tanks are manufactured in Ireland and supplied and fitted by local people.  If people could reclaim VAT through a tax incentive, it would bring about a major boost, create jobs and improve the environment.  I have spoken about this with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, on a number of occasions and I have also mentioned it to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan.  Perhaps the issue could be considered.</p><p>There may be retired people who wish to improve their houses but are in a difficult position because they may not be able to afford the work.  A number of people have told me they are disappointed they cannot get any incentive in this regard, so perhaps such cases could be examined.  There is a grant available through the warmer homes initiative, for example, but perhaps an incentive could be given where there is major work to be done to a roof or windows and the people involved are not in the tax sphere.</p><p>We should consider changes to vehicle taxation.  In some cases people have two vehicles, with one for transport to work and another for working on a farm, for example, such as a jeep for towing trailers.  Privately taxing such a jeep or van would cost approximately &euro;1,500, but if it could be taxed commercially the amount would be &euro;300 or &euro;400.  The vehicle could be used to take children to school as well as being used on a farm to pull trailers and related work.  It would be a major help in a household if it could be used to take children to school and so on.</p></speech>

I am a great believer in not spending time looking for new customers but, rather, spending time with existing good customers.  I suggest that if people have been running or working in a business and they decide to set up their own business, the scheme should also apply to them.  Will the Minister of State examine that possibility?  To say that a person must be unemployed before being able to avail of the scheme does not seem right.</p><p>The Bill includes entrepreneur relief, which will allow a capital gains tax credit for entrepreneurs who reinvest the proceeds from the disposal of assets.  I propose the idea that new businesses be allowed to convert tax credits into much-needed cash.  Everybody agrees that start-up businesses need cash, especially during the early stages.  The proposal would be that if a start-up company hired an employee, the tax credit could be converted directly into cash.  This exact initiative took place in the US and the cash incentive worked.  On the day President Obama took office, the US had less than 2% of the world market in manufacturing high-powered batteries for hybrid or all-electric cars, but on the day of the congressional elections in 2010, thanks in large part to the cash incentive policy, the US had 20% of global capacity, with 30 new battery plants built or under construction.  It would be a super idea to try this out in a finance Bill in order to help small and medium-sized enterprises.  Will the Minister of State consider this idea of allowing start-ups to convert tax credits to cash?</p><p>There is the issue of access to pensions.  There was a Government promise to end the pensions levy, but the Government will be taking even more from private pension funds, which has a big effect on such funds.  Why is the Government not touching public sector pensions, and why is the Government not allowing people who need cash to access their pensions to fuller degree, especially when it is okay for the Government to do so?  This relates to businesses getting access to cash, and I have advocated for the release of some pension funds to allow citizens some relief and get cash flowing into the economy.  I have welcomed the move in the past year to allow people access to 30% of their additional voluntary contributions, AVCs.  However, this should have been extended again, perhaps to allow people more access to tax-free cash, which is especially important for businesses.</p><p>I was recently talking with a man who was able to access part of his AVC, and he told me that meant he was able to buy his daughter a new secondary school uniform and books, although she is not attending a fee-paying school.  He could also pay a host of bills, including credit card bills, and he may have a holiday for the first time in a long while.  He indicated that many of his friends had availed of the deal too and that it had lifted their morale and mood.  It is life-changing but it also gives a monetary boost to the retail sector.  This has a positive effect on the country and the economy.  The big message is that being able to access AVCs can lift the mood of gloom that hangs over people, many of whom have been cashless for years; now they can access some cash and alleviate worry and anxiety.  These people will spend money and provide the boost we are seeking.  The man to whom I was speaking described having access to some cash as a big weight lifted off his shoulders, and it also puts money into circulation when the banks are all but closed.  A move to extend this would help thousands of people in trouble and would be a very forward-thinking.  It would help people, and we should be able to do something in that area.  The Government must realise that people are being crippled by household debt.  We should consider extending the initiative I have mentioned.  If a person or small or medium-sized enterprise could access several thousand euro tax-free from their pensions tomorrow, they could pay off a credit card debt and maybe several overdue bills.  They could simply get back on their feet or even start their own businesses.  It would also stimulate the economy as it would help to pay for house renovations, holidays or even changing a car.  It would simply get cash flowing back into the economy.  The possibilities for a person who can start over by accessing some cash are very exciting.  If people can do this, then we will have set the conditions for them to do something like starting a business.  This is what government should be all about; rather than simply giving people a job it should help them access the cash that is so vital in setting up a new business.  Is the Government open to the possibility of freeing more cash through private pensions?</p> <p>People should be treated like adults and if it is their money they should be allowed access to it.  Iceland has just announced it is encouraging people to access their pensions and get back on their feet.  I know there is a problem with people accessing pensions and damaging something that has been saved, but if somebody has saved money in a pension fund we should not say they cannot take it out until a certain age.  They should be able to take some of that money out, particularly if it is to start a new business or to develop, but even if it is just to spend money in the economy.  It will boost the economy and that is what we all want.  There is much in the Bill that others have covered but in this case we can still do a number of things and I hope it is possible to at least prime the minds of the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes and the Minister, Deputy Noonan for some of the changes we can make and which could benefit the economy.</p></speech>

It is great to see him here again.  We are in a very different place from this time last year when we spoke and it is thanks to the Government's policies.  When <i>Forbes</i> magazine says Ireland is the best country in the OECD in which to do business we must be doing something right.  That has a lot to do with business.  Governments do not create jobs.  Business is putting us back on the right foot.  We have seen growth in employment, trade and inward tax investment exceed Government projections.  This is all good news.</p><p>  I listened from upstairs to what the Minister said, so I will not go through much of the Bill.  As spokesperson on the environment it struck me that the tax relief on home improvement will create jobs but will also be good for the environment as people insulate their houses.  Senator Reilly quoted the Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI, on how poorly we were faring.  What she said did not measure up to what I have been reading, which states that Ireland is a very progressive country regarding taxation.  The OECD and ESRI conclude that the Irish tax system is very progressive.  It hits high earners very hard and has a relatively low or no tax on average incomes.  A single self-employed person on &euro;120,000 will hand over 44.8% of his or her income and a married couple fares a little better on 41.2%.  The numbers for PAYE workers are becoming similar to the self-employed and that is a mark of the success of this Government in alleviating some of the tax reliefs on that.  Tax on an income of &euro;175,000 has risen to 46%.</p><p>  By any standards, including comparison with our major trading partners and competitors, these tax rates are high and kick in at relatively much lower income in this country compared with our European neighbours.  The numbers support other studies from the OECD and ESRI.  When we add all the other taxes together, such as property tax, the high earners hand over 60% or more of their income in tax.  That is an average all-in rate of tax, not a marginal rate.  This raises some questions.  If we want people to work and provide jobs for others we cannot tax them at 100% because that tells them this is not a good country to do business in and we will not have <i>Forbes</i> magazine saying Ireland is the best country in the OECD to do business.  It would not say that if we did not have a progressive tax system.</p></speech>

I have never heard Sinn F&eacute;in answer that question when it proposes huge tax on this, that and the other.  We need a progressive system but I want it to be realistic.  I have done quite some research and those are the figures I have found.  I have not created these figures.  I have looked at institute figures.  NERI had a meeting in Buswells Hotel today.</p><p>I came here to speak on section 7 of the Bill, because it is an important section.  We have had many representations from around the country on it.  I will concentrate on one point, the single person child care tax credit and the requirement that a child spend 100 days with the claimant.  Both parents are important but Senator Jim D'Arcy said most of the caring is usually done by the mother.  I was recently quoted as saying it comes down to one thing, namely who is minding the baby, but the father is also very important and we must ensure there is fairness.  The recent Government amendment to ensure that by agreement and co-operation two people could share the tax relief is good but the 100-day rule makes it virtually impossible to guarantee or implement it, or for a judge to rule on it.  It goes right into family life and says there is a big eye looking down on people if a child is ill, in hospital, cannot travel or is far away.  That section should be re-examined.  The recent amendment was very beneficial but that section must be examined regarding implementation, fairness and, where there is agreement, how it will be worked out.</p></speech>

I lobbied the Minister for Finance on that throughout the year and an excellent campaign was run by the Restaurant Association of Ireland and other groups pointing out the business case for it, that it has paid for itself and supported employment particularly in small businesses.  The restaurant and hospitality sector is a very labour-intensive industry so I was delighted that the special 9% rate was retained in the budget.</p><p>I also welcome the home renovation tax relief although I share comments by others about how it could be more comprehensive.  It is too limited to restrict it to primary residences.  As Senator Hayden and others said, this is an opportunity to improve rented housing stock.  Will the Minister consider reviewing that on Committee Stage?  I will speak in more detail about the single parent tax credit on Committee Stage as we will table an amendment on this.  I share the concerns expressed by Members on both sides of the House.  This measure is extremely regressive.  It is in every child's interest to have the strongest relationship and the most contact possible with both parents, whether still living together, separated or divorced or whatever the circumstances of their relationship may be, whether it is amicable or whether they have had to fight through the courts to reach agreements on access and custody.  We should do everything possible to ensure both parents have contact and a positive relationship with their children.</p><p>It can be financially difficult because separated parents must run two homes on the same income that used to provide for one.  I have received e-mails from fathers all over the country pointing out the impact separation has had on their income.  After they pay for maintenance there is little left to pay for accommodation that has enough space to take their children at the weekend and to take them out to the cinema or spend quality time with them.  We must recognise that it is more expensive for separated parents to look after children than if they are a married couple.  It was appropriate that we had a tax credit that recognised that and gave them a bit of support and it would be incredibly regressive to remove it.  I would prefer if we could leave the situation as it was because it recognised those extra costs.</p> <p>That was appropriate but I hope the Minister of State will accept amendments to ensure that at the very least the credit can be transferred so that it is not just left to the primary carer but can be used by the parent earning the bulk of the income, who, in many cases, is the father.  Trinity College has conducted research on Irish separation cases which shows that in 97% of cases, the courts deem the mother to be the primary carer, even where there is 50:50 access.  The courts overwhelmingly deem the mother to be the primary carer.  Restricting the credit to primary carers is regressive.  Mothers should be able to sign the credit over to the father if he is earning the most money or it should be possible for the credit to be shared.  However, I can see difficulties in sharing the credit, particularly where the separation is not an amicable one.  In fact, I think this entire provision is unnecessarily messy and regressive and would ask that the Minister reconsiders it.</p><p>We will also be tabling an amendment on Committee Stage relating to physiotherapy referrals.  We raised this issue with the Minister last year because we believe people should be able to get tax relief on physiotherapy services if they self-refer.  They should not have to go through a GP to get tax relief on physiotherapy.  They do not have to do this for other medical services.  When we raised this issue earlier in the year with the Minister for Finance he gave a commitment to look at it in the context of the budget but it was not included.  We ask that the Department consider this issue again on Committee Stage.</p><p>As I said earlier, I welcome the retention of the 9% VAT rate for the tourism and hospitality sectors but there is a need for fundamental reform of our VAT regime.  Senator Reilly mentioned the fact that there is no VAT on oral contraceptives but that VAT is payable on non-oral contraceptives.  There are lots of other illogical examples of the application of VAT.  For instance, there is no VAT on many high-fat, unhealthy processed foods but we pay 23% VAT on bottled water; there is no VAT on limousine rental but we pay 23% VAT on walking sticks;  a rate of 9% applies to lap-dancing while marriage counselling is subject to a rate of 23%.  Perhaps the  Minister of State will give his views on that  in his response.</p></speech>

It is time for the entire VAT system to be reviewed.  This issue has been raised repeatedly in this and the other House.  I am a member of the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Social Protection and we regularly discuss school costs, particularly the high cost of school books.  Many schools are trying to reduce such costs for parents by moving to greater use of e-books but they are often more expensive than the standard text books because of the rate of VAT on them.  Any time we raise this issue with the Government we are told that Ireland is tied into the EU regime in this regard, which is true.  However, we must challenge that regime and ask for the VAT rules to be reformed.  Are we pushing at EU level to have the VAT rules reviewed?  It is beyond time that it was done, right across the European Union.  I ask the Minister of State to work on that issue, either in his current capacity or indeed, in any future role he takes up which might be more relevant.</p></speech>

This debate on the Finance (No. 2) Bill affords us the opportunity to review the nation's finances and the Government's policies.  It comes at an opportune time, in terms of the ending of one political era and the beginning of another as Ireland prepares to exit the bailout programme.  We learned today that the Taoiseach is scheduled to make a state of the nation address on Sunday, his second such address.  I recall the first one two years ago, which was the cause of much speculation.  At that time he was giving a summary of the difficulties and challenges which faced the Government, from an economic perspective.  Presumably on this occasion he will try to outline a plan or vision for the future.  In doing so, we must all try to ensure, along with the Taoiseach, that the type of political thinking and financial and fiscal approach which brought economic chaos to our country will not be repeated.</p><p>I wish to refer to one or two aspects of the Bill before us in the aforementioned context.  I welcome the incentives given for house improvements because they will allow important construction work to be carried out and will create local employment.  However, in the context of the broader housing debate, I ask the Minister of State, along with his Government colleagues to ensure that we have a very holistic debate about housing in this country.  There has not been such a debate since the 1970s when we had the famous Kenny report.  Government after Government has used housing, the price of houses, the income generated from VAT and other taxes, as an economic driver.  The housing industry, rather than being an industry to provide families with homes and to build communities, has been used on many occasions to build a false economy.  The approach taken in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s has put our country and economy in a very weakened position.  Collectively, in these Houses and outside, we must have a very mature debate on our housing policy, our tax reliefs, our mortgage interest reliefs and other property-based incentives.  I hold the Minister for Finance in the highest personal and political regard but when I heard him welcoming the fact that financial institutions are again about to offer special favours to landlords in the form of interest-free loans, as announced some days ago by certain banks, I became worried.  </p></speech>

I wish to put on the record my concern at this type of thinking and the view that prioritising one sector will solve our housing problems because it will not do so.  Indeed, it may well cause us to drift back to the sort of thinking which saw housing not as a means to a social end but as a means for a small number of developers and others involved in property to get very wealthy and to do so on the back of home owners.  While this may not be entirely pertinent to the Bill under discussion, it is relevant in the context of the financial position of the country.</p><p>During the Committee Stage debate I intend to make a contribution on the ending of mortgage interest relief.  Admittedly, the Government must find money from somewhere and if it wants to pay Peter, it must rob Paul.  However, the ending of that relief will cause a lot of difficulties for people on the housing ladder.  We should at least try to look at other options and alternatives in that regard.  </p><p>One sector of the economy which the budget has attempted to support on a continuous basis is the agricultural sector and I welcome the changes in the Bill in that regard.  We are all aware that while the general economy has been in free fall for the past number of years, investment has continued by the agricultural community in rural Ireland.  Agricultural production has been enhanced and a lot of work has been done across the various branches of agriculture.  Our exports have grown and new jobs have been created, which is very welcome.  The Horizon 2020 plan and the changes to EU support mechanisms with the ending of milk quotas means that more jobs can be created in that sector in the future.  I welcome the helpful provisions in the Finance (No. 2) Bill in this regard.</p><p>The priority of the Taoiseach, the Government and everyone in these Houses is job creation and getting people back to work.  The Minister for Social Protection has introduced a number of interesting mechanisms which are working.</p> <p>I am sure it is the focus of every Department, particularly for the Minister for Finance, to ensure our tax and jobs support system is geared towards investment and job creation.  I agree with Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy that we are at our maximum tax take and no more can be squeezed from the taxpayer.  Those who present these simple formulae about wealth tax, super tax and hidden taxes should look at examples from around the world where these were introduced.  They will see this type of economics was quickly ended because it did not work.  We all favour fair taxes.  We must ensure corporation or PAYE tax is paid in full and that shelters, as well as other avoidance measures, are tackled.  I will go into these matters further on Committee Stage.</p><p>I generally welcome the Finance Bill.  It is part of putting Ireland back to work, as well as restoring our financial sovereignty and independence.  Like every Bill from every Government, I am sure there are ways it can be improved, however.</p></speech>

It gives a certain amount of time to reflect on and deal with it.  Some of the budget&rsquo;s measures are grossly unfair, continuing a level of unfairness that has been the hallmark of the Government, an unfairness well documented by the ESRI and Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly.  The Government has really taken the poor to task with its budgets while protecting its wealthy friends.</p><p>We all supported the Restaurants Association of Ireland campaign for the retention of the 9% VAT rate for the tourism sector, as it has visible benefits for this part of the small business sector.  As Senator Power stated, however, there are anomalies to this measure as lap-dancing clubs and the newspaper industry benefit from it too.  No justification has been given for this.  Neither has there been an independent cost-benefit analysis of the measure.  The Restaurants Association of Ireland has been involved in the most successful lobbying campaign in recent years to retain this low tax rate.  While I compliment the association on this, a significant amount of foregone tax take is involved.  Has a cost-benefit analysis been done on this?  Other sectors of the economy have not benefited from a similar lobbying campaign or a lower tax rate.  Notwithstanding the genuine benefits the restaurant sector gets and the jobs created, I would rather we were doing the budget on an economic assessment of what is best rather than just dealing with campaign arguments from lobbying groups.</p><p>The continuation of the pension levy is the main issue of unfairness in this Bill.  A small number of pensioners have been hit hard by this levy such as the Tara Mines pensioners with whom I have met.  There was an absolute commitment to remove this levy when it was first introduced as part of the so-called jobs initiative.</p><p>Do I have the Minister&rsquo;s attention?</p></speech>

For many of them, the levy has had a permanent impact on their incomes.  The cut to pensions in some cases reached 10% and is not just for four years but forever.  It goes back to the old law that when one introduces a temporary tax, it turns out to be very difficult to get rid of it later.  No matter who is in power, they will be tempted to keep the moneys coming in from this levy.</p><p>The Government introduced this levy so that it would be used for job creation.  A large portion of it was not spent on jobs, however.  Up to &euro;350 million has been washed into the general Exchequer and not spent in accordance with the levy&rsquo;s purpose.  The Government has been strongly criticised by newspaper columnists and the troika on its ability to get people working and the training schemes it offers.  Part of the criticism is that the Government did not spend all the moneys from the pension levy on what it promised which was jobs and training.</p><p>This pension levy is not just being maintained but increased to 0.75% next year but will be reduced to 0.15% in 2015.  Do we really believe that?  Do we really believe there will not be pressure from lobby groups to maintain the pension levy to avoid levies in other sectors?  Will the Minister give an assurance that this levy will be ended in 2015 or will not be increased to 0.75%?  Has the Government looked at the levy&rsquo;s impact on pensioners?  Pensioners, such as those from Tara Mines, were told the levy would be deducted from the pension company&rsquo;s own profits but that did not happen.  They were also told when they met the Taoiseach that they should inquire about it from the Revenue Commissioners, a case of passing the buck.  These pensioners should be given more consideration because they got a significant cut to their income.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-11a.346" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1128" speakername="Paschal Mooney" time="16:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121100039#OO01500"><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.</p><p>Will the Government&rsquo;s fiscal policy prime-pump the economy, generate more spending and increase revenues?  That is what the Minister for Finance must ask himself.  All the indications from the Government are that we are over the worst in austerity with just a little further to go to hit the 3% deficit mark.  However, &euro;2 billion cuts are looming in the next budget.</p> <p>Apart from the money this budget is taking out of the economy, in 2014 there will be the new water charges and the full impact of the property tax on top of all the other tax increases.  The question remains where the Government will go from here.  I await with great interest, as I am sure the Minister does, the economic indicators going into next year.  All sorts of different growth figures are being put forward.  Some suggest growth will be as high as 2.5%.  I hope that is true considering we are expected to hit approximately 0.01% at the end of this year or 1% in total, and those figures have yet to be calculated.</p><p>I am curious to know the policy behind the decision to increase the DIRT rate.  Single pensioners earning over &euro;18,000 or couples earning over &euro;36,000 will be liable for DIRT at the full rate of 41% even if they are subject to income tax at only 20%.  It is suggested that the Department believes engineering an environment of low returns on savings will prompt consumers to increase spending.  The only reason I can see for it is to unlock people's savings and put them into the general economy.  The Minister of State might have a view on the reasons behind this decision.  The strategy severely penalises people who are putting money aside for expected future expenses.  In light of the continuing reduction in interest rates it is a negative to consider putting money into the bank, even without DIRT.  Some of the rates on offer are most unattractive, and now there is the extra whammy of the increase in DIRT to 45%, including PRSI.  From next January savers will receive only just over half the interest earned on cash deposits.</p><p>Another aspect of the budget relates to farm leases.  Our side will table an amendment to this on Committee Stage.  It relates to the problem with section 5, which states that a qualifying lessee is an individual.  The word &quot;individual&quot; rules out a farming company from being a qualifying lessee.  As the Minister of State is aware, an increasing number of farmers are converting their businesses into farming companies, particularly dairy farmers who are undertaking expansion.  The current exclusion of a company is restricting the transfer of land through leasing.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has stated that he is anxious to promote long-term leasing of land to younger farmers.  There seems no justifiable reason for excluding a farming company from being an eligible lessee.  If the restriction were removed it would facilitate land transfers in many cases.  Perhaps the Minister might respond to that.</p><p>Senator Jim D'Arcy and others have raised the one-parent tax credit.  In many cases the primary carer may not have sufficient income to fully avail of the tax credit and it could result in a loss of &euro;48 per week, an estimated &euro;2,500 per year.  This move is obviously causing considerable anxiety and distress to many lone parents already struggling to meet the costs of supporting their children.  The proposal will be very hard on separated and divorced fathers in particular.  Research from Trinity College points to the fact that in 97% of separation cases in the State the courts deem the child's mother to be the primary carer, even in the case of 50:50 access.  The proposed measure, even though gender-neutral in wording, will have a grossly disproportionate adverse effect in operation on one social group by reason of gender.  Many fathers rely on the value of the tax credit to assist them in supporting their children.  To take this away will inevitably led more child poverty.</p></speech>

We greatly appreciate that contribution.  It was a very worthwhile debate in allowing us to survey where we are in terms of the general economic picture and to tease out some of the ideas the Ministers, Deputies Noonan and Howlin, have advanced as part of the budget.  To answer my good colleague Senator Mooney's question, we have an adjustment to make next year but the objective is that if we get the 2% growth, or more, that adjustment becomes easier.  Every 1% growth in GDP equates to &euro;1.6 billion in additional revenue for the economy.  If our GDP grows by 2% we would get &euro;3.2 billion and that would ameliorate the adjustment required.  It is predicated on growth.  As former Taoiseach, Charlie Haughey, said years ago, &quot;We are going for growth.&quot;  I remember that famous strategy he outlined in 1987.  Mr. Haughey was right then, as the Taoiseach and Ministers are right now.  If we get more GDP growth, more taxes and revenues will come in to ensure the adjustment required is not as dramatic.  That is something we have not managed to do because of the general problem in the eurozone economy in recent years.</p><p>  I very much agree with Senator Bacik on the advantage of having the budget now.  Going into the Christmas period the budget is effectively behind us.  People know what they will have to live on next year and the tax and VAT rates that will apply and there is a degree of certainty.  As we go into a crucially important period for the domestic economy in terms of sales and services, we have that certainty.</p><p>  Taking up the point Senator Reilly raised on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in, my argument with NERI is that it bases it figures on CSO data, which is household data.  It examines the total income in a household and divides it up per person but the real world does not work like that.  We base our projections on Revenue data.  They are a much more reliable indication internationally.  It is real taxpayers with real amounts of money they pay on their tax and real data from the agency responsible for collecting that tax revenue.  We argue that our figures are a good deal more reliable.  One can get any projection one wants based on whatever starting point one obtains, but the international view is that Revenue data is more reliable than CSO data.</p><p>  My good colleague Senator Michael D'Arcy mentioned the recent <i>The Irish Times</i> survey on who pays for what, what wealth is and to whom we refer when we talk about people who earn &euro;75,000.  The results of that survey were very interesting.</p></speech>

This may not help Sinn F&eacute;in because once the truth on this is known there will be difficulties with its tax proposals.</p></speech>

One could argue that we should continue to go after that group of people at the top who pay a marginal tax rate of 41% plus 11%, between USC and PRSI.  It is 52%.  On &euro;32,500 one is whacked on everything.  Anyone earning more that is whacked on 52%.  A self-employed person is whacked on 56%.  The first thing the previous Government had to do was to whack up the tax rates because in any radical adjust programme the first thing changed is tax, surprise, surprise.  In each year of the last decade we were merrily going on our way, taking in approximately &euro;50 billion in tax annually and then in 2008 &euro;16 billion was knocked out.  No other western European economy or industrialised society has seen such a reduction in tax revenue over a 12-month period.  We went from an economy taking in &euro;50 billion in tax to an economy taking in approximately &euro;34 billion.  The first task of any government would be to whack up the tax and reduce the expenditure.  Inevitably, the first phase of this adjustment process was skewed in favour of tax changes with a more radical reduction in expenditure in the second phase of it.</p><p>  We must have a debate on progressiveness because the facts are not known, as evidenced by the recent <i>The Irish Times</i> opinion poll.  Thanks to the attempts by this and the previous Government, we have a much more progressive tax system.</p> <p>According to the OECD we have the second most progressive tax system of the 37 member states.  The European Commission examined the former bailout countries in terms of what they went through and argued the adjustments in this country were the most progressive as those at the top have paid more than those at the bottom and rightly so.  The view, not of the Government parties or the ESRI but the international community, is the adjustment process under way has been a good deal more progressive in this country than is the case in others.</p></speech>

I agree.  Fianna F&aacute;il is good for something at last.  I very much challenge the notion of progressivity.  Our system of taxation has become much more progressive and fairer.</p><p>One of the reasons I was looking at my iPad and phone was to source material.  I was not being ungracious and I was listening avidly as I always do.  Last year Senator Reilly stated she was against the reductions in child benefit so I presumed that in this year's budget, which she told us about, she would reinstate it.  I went looking but there is no sign of it.  Senator Reilly and my good friends in Fianna F&aacute;il told us they were in favour of the 9% VAT rate as it was good for tourism and The Gathering.</p></speech>

She wrote a very interesting piece in the <i>Financial Times</i> last week which is worth highlighting, in particular for politicians.  She made the point when we entered the crisis in 2008 or 2009 politicians underestimated the scale of the rapid economic recession which emerged and also underestimated the holes in capital systems throughout the financial markets.  She also made the point recently that one can frequently underestimate the scale of the rebound.  This is important because it goes to the heart of confidence, to which Senator Bacik referred.  The worst of this is over and we must start to concentrate on rebuilding our country from top to toe and ensuring that collectively we can produce policies which make the country more competitive and get people back to work.  This country has a huge advantage because of the fact our cost competitiveness has returned to be more in line than is the case in other eurozone countries.  We have reduced by approximately 8.5% and the eurozone has increased by 15%.  If I were the IDA trying to attract businesses here this is a great opportunity because we have become a much more competitive economy as a result of the restructuring which has taken place over the past five years.  We need to celebrate this as we go through the process.</p><p>  It is also important to state the Finance Bill is only one means through which we can continue to have better economic governance and surveillance.  The Government needs to constantly listen to people.  We will not get everything right but we have not got everything wrong either.  It is a point of genuine celebration for our people who have gone through the mill in recent years that we can come out the other end of the financial programme, get back on our feet, get money back to the country in terms of the sovereign bond market and get money back into our banks, public limited companies and semi-State companies.  The real test and benchmark of economic sovereignty is whether people are prepared to invest in one's country.  I contend the decisions the Government and the previous Government had to take to bring the country to a better place are paying off and our people want to see a dividend.</p><p>  I very much hope this is the end of the austerity budgets.  I will not pretend to the public we will find a dramatic new pot of money next year, but we are 95% of the way through the adjustment process.  I will not say we need to start talking up the economy but we do need to believe again the country can get a better place as a result of the measures we all want to see put in place.</p><p>  Many colleagues spoke about a single person child carer tax credit and I would like to deal with it briefly.  It is fair to say we had a very extensive discussion in the other House on the issue.  I am aware of the 2009 Commission on Taxation report which argued this is analogous in circumstances where it is given only to people who are not cohabiting or not married.  The point was raised by colleagues this is about two individuals trying to stay close to their children.  From going to my local schoolyard I know many married and cohabiting parents have two homes.  I know of many fathers who leave the country to go to London on Monday and return on Friday, or who work in Donegal or Longford and return for three nights a week.  No one will defend a situation whereby the credit can be given to one family type and not the other.  We will examine how we have gone about it on Committee Stage.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, introduced an amendment in the D&aacute;il which has helped to ensure the primary carer can relinquish the credit to assist a non-primary carer, particularly with regard to taking up employment.  This is a labour activation issue and we are conscious of introducing it.  We will have a longer debate on it.  If there are undue difficulties, a point made by Senators D'Arcy, Hayden and O'Brien, we will have to examine it to ensure the replacement measure we have put in place is right.</p><p>  Senator O'Brien asked me to put on the record of the House the question of AVCs given the change introduced in last year's Finance Bill.  In the six months to the end of September this year 7,000 drawdowns were made which had an aggregate value of &euro;50 million which is an average drawdown of &euro;7,000.</p></speech>

In the pre-budget submission we made in the Shelbourne Hotel in December 2010 before we came to government, which I remember very well because I was one of the parties responsible for writing it, we made a clear and absolute commitment to introduce the levy because we knew to be credible as an incoming government we had to state where we would get the money for the jobs and stimulus fund.  We stated it in opposition and in the manifesto and we are doing it in government.  The big issue for the industry at the time was the question of obtaining tax relief at the marginal rate, which remains in place.  We have created this additional pool of money which has made a big difference at 9%, and hey presto everyone in opposition wants to keep 9% rate-----</p></speech>

Revenue estimates that 577,000 policyholders avail of the existing tax credit for medical insurance.  Of these, 43% will see absolutely no change, while, as the Minister pointed out, for the great majority - 53% - who could potentially see a change there will be only a minimal change.</p><p>I ask Senators to be fair to the Minister.  The comment on gold plated medical insurance policies was taken out of context for political purposes.</p></speech>

The total tax liability is about &euro;400 million.  If matters went unchecked, it could be &euro;1 billion by 2020.  Having regard to the position of the public finances, the State has to taper the tax credit in a fair way and we have done on our best in a difficult decision that had to be made.</p><p>Senators Michael D'Arcy, Darragh O'Brien and Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill raised the question of supermarkets and low cost selling.  Any policy related to minimum units of pricing would have to be dealt with on an all-Ireland basis.  </p><p>Senator Michael D'Arcy raised the question of increases in the rates of alcohol product tax.  Excise rates for beer, cider and spirits, as a percentage of the average retail price, are lower than they were in 2003.  I welcome the Senator's comments in acknowledging the changes we are introducing on international tax issues which will help the reputation of the country on the question of residence.</p><p>Senator Aideen Hayden welcomed, as did others, the home renovation initiative.  I welcome all of the comments made.  The objective is to stimulate growth in the construction industry.  Some 60% of the people who have lost their jobs during the crisis were directly or indirectly attached to the construction industry.  Doing something that will help people's homes, while also getting the construction industry back on its feet, is important.  Landscaping and works to upgrade septic tanks are covered by the home renovation initiative.  I think it was Senator Michael Comiskey who raised that question.</p><p>I agree with Senator Sean D. Barrett's remarks on research and development.  That is why one of the papers we issued as part of the publications on the Minister's Budget Statement was a specific cost benefit analysis of the research and development tax credit.  We need to keep these issues under constant review and have some evidence based policy.  This paper was published on budget day and we might have a chance on Committee Stage to deal with it in greater detail because it will help to inform the debate.</p><p>We will certainly look at these issues on Committee and Report Stages when I think the Minister will be here.  In circumstances where there is very little money around the place, we have to be creative and innovative with schemes.  This is the Minister's third budget and he has attempted to bring forward schemes that will help to provoke domestic demand and get people get back to work, while not imposing huge additional tax liabilities as a consequence.  As we exit the bailout programme, there is an opportunity to generate much more growth in the domestic economy.  While the economy will go up and down based on exports and the position of the international economy - we are very heavily dependent on exports, unlike the Mediterranean economies - we need to start talking about the position of the country post the bailout, getting our confidence back and believing in the country again.  I hope the positive comments colleagues, collectively, can make in that respect will help in the process, be they on this or other finance Bills.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-11a.424" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1145" speakername="Feargal Quinn" time="16:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121100045#VV00200"><p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;</p><p>  I welcome the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton.  I hope the debate will be an interesting one and one in which I hope there will be an exchange of views.  </p><p>  There are a couple of points I wish to explain at the beginning.  This Bill was prepared over a number of weeks.  There are those who think I looked for an opportune time to prepare it when there was the threat of a strike, but it so happened that it occurred at the same time.  A lot of work has gone into the Bill in terms of what happens in other countries.</p><p>  The supply of water and electricity to homes and businesses in this day and age is a basic and an essential service.  The threat of an ESB strike was a real cause for concern in communities around the country last week.  I was particularly concerned about the impact a strike would have on the elderly and in homes in which somebody was sick or being cared for.  Many homes still depend on electricity as their sole source of heating and an ESB strike would have a major impact on them.  On top of this, Ireland's reputation as a place in which to do business has suffered because of the threat of a strike.  I was really struck when I heard Barry O'Leary, chief executive officer of IDA Ireland, say the prospect of an ESB strike was damaging Ireland's international reputation.  If we cannot guarantee the supply of basic services such as water and electricity, how can we credibly persuade investors to do business here?  I know that in recent years Minister has put in a huge amount of work into doing exactly this, trying to get investors to do business here.   </p><p>  Artificial interruptions to the supply of water and electricity should not be tolerated.  The continued supply of these basic utility services should not be allowed to become a bargaining chip in an industrial dispute.  A threat to these services is not tolerated in many countries in Europe and I do not see why we should allow it to happen in this country.  Historically, the trade union movement has made a valuable contribution to the improvement of the rights of workers and the conditions under which they work.  The role of trade unions is recognised in Article 40.6.1&deg; of the Constitution and Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights<i>,</i> both of which protect the right of freedom of association.  The Bill does not seek to extinguish or modify these rights, something I have to say so often.  On the Order of Business today Senator David Cullinane did not appear to understand this.  The Bill is not understood by many people.   </p><p>  The right to strike is an important part of the armoury of trade unions and can be a very effective tool.  However, in the context of basic services such as water and electricity supplies, it can be a very blunt tool.  I say this because when workers in electricity or water supply companies down tools and go on strike, their actions do not just upset their employer but can also have a direct and dramatic impact on the everyday lives of people and businesses across the country.  As legislators, we should seek to balance the right of workers to strike in a disruptive manner against the right of individuals to a supply of water and electricity.  The aim of the Bill is to strike that balance in a proportionate and minimal way.  The Bill seeks to provide for the security of supply of mains water and electricity and it seeks to achieve this in two ways.  First, it would make it an offence for a person to induce another to cause an interruption to the supply of a critical utility service.  Second, it would also make it an offence for a person to engage in industrial action which causes an interruption to the supply of a critical utility service.  It not seek to remove the right to strike, the right to picket or the right to take industrial action.  Let there be no doubt about this and I cannot say it often enough.  Strikes can still take place, but what the Bill would require is that strike cover be put in place to protect the continued supply of water and electricity.  I would expect the supply of electricity and water to be maintained on a day-to-day basis with a skeleton staff.  What I am saying in the Bill is that staff in businesses which supply electricity or water are free to go on strike; however, when they do go on strike, they would have to provide strike cover &ndash; a minimum level of cover &ndash; so as to maintain basic services.</p><p>  The principle of safeguarding an essential service is already provided for under legislation.  Section 18(3) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 goes much further than the Bill; it prohibits garda&iacute; from becoming members of a trade union.  Section 59(1) of the Act makes it an offence for a person to induce a garda to withhold his or her services.  Although now repealed, the Electricity (Special Provisions) Act 1966 provided for an outright ban on strikes and pickets in the ESB.  The Bill is far less draconian than that legislation.</p><p>  In many member states there is an obligation on strikers, under law, to maintain a minimum level of service while on strike.  Legislation to protect critical utility services has been enacted in Belgium, France, Germany and Greece.  Other countries have gone even further to protect utility and other services.  In Bulgaria strikers must not impact on the supply of gas, electricity, public transport, broadcasting and telephone services.  In Hungary strikers are required to ensure there is no disruption to transport and telecommunications services and electricity, gas and water supplies.</p> <p>A similar, broad approach is taken to the protection of services in Portugal and Romania.  There is a wide range of steps being taken in other countries.  There are many precedents for what I am proposing in the Bill, although my approach is far more timid than that adopted in a number of other countries.<br /><b></b>The need for this legislation is even more compelling than it was.  I am pleased that the threatened ESB strike has been averted, but this legislation is no less important this week than it was last week.  We are looking to the future.  I have been working on the Bill for some time and it is important to understand it is not just an immediate reaction to the danger of a strike.  I have long held the view that the continued supply of critical services should not be used as a bargaining tool in industrial disputes.  The resolution of the ESB dispute does not alter that principle but actually serves to demonstrate just how vulnerable the critical utilities are to the whims of trade union leaders.  We need to act now to protect critical services from the effects of strike action that might take place in the months and years ahead.</p><p> The Bill does not seek to remove the rights to strike, picket or take industrial action.  What it would require is the arrangement of strike cover to ensure electricity and water supplies would not be interrupted during strikes.  The Bill seeks to balance carefully the right of workers to strike and the right of customers to key utilities.  The result would be a reasonable and proportionate approach.  I, therefore, urge the Minister to support the Bill.  I look forward to a debate in order that we can understand the issues involved.</p><p> We have had nurses strikes during the years, but when nurses go on strike, they ensure no lives are endangered.  They ensure there is a skeleton staff to run essential services to keep people alive.  They do not want to be responsible for deaths.  This is a very good example of what we are proposing in the Bill.  A skeleton staff should stay back to ensure electricity and water would continue to be supplied because they are essential.  There are those living at home who would die if they did not have electricity or water during strikes.  In the future, when a strike occurs in the areas I have outlined &ndash; I would love to believe there would never be a strike as we have become so good at avoiding them &ndash; a skeleton staff should ensure the two essentials, water and electricity, would continue to be provided.  It is a life and death issue.  Therefore, the Bill would have a long-term effect.  The threatened strike this week drew attention to the issue, but the onus is on us in this House to ensure we have legislation in place that stipulates we should not endanger lives.  I urge the Minister to support it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-11a.426" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="17:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121100046#WW00200"><p>I welcome the Minister.  It is an honour to support Senator Feargal Quinn&rsquo;s Bill.  Last night the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government indicated we consumed 145 litres of water per person per day.  Some 82% of this water is for drinking, sanitation and the washing of dishes, etc.  One can imagine that a cessation of the supply of water would soon lead to health problems as people would be unable to flush toilets or wash themselves or their dishes.  The supply of water is vital.</p><p>Owing to the recent strike threat referred to by Senator Feargal Quinn, we have addressed the issue of the supply of electricity.  There are so many continuous-process industries that the Minister has been so active in promoting in recent years, following on the work of previous Ministers.  The high-tech sector needs a continuous supply of electricity.  Food would be wasted very quickly in the food sector if we did not have power for refrigeration, which is part and parcel of retailing and the activity of every hotel.</p><p>We have a 24 hour economy.  I was talking to the Minister some days ago and noted he had been to so many places.  These places link up with us 24 hours a day.  This is needed and we cannot say we are shutting down for a number of hours because we are supplying electricity only in zone B, for example.  We must link up with industries on the west coast of the United States that want us to be operational and send them data and supplies when needed.</p><p>Our reputation is important.  We have had to build it up in so many fields because of the financial collapse and the collapse of banking.  We should consider how much damage was done in Belfast because of the flag protest.  Shopkeepers in Belfast tell me that sales decrease significantly when such a protest occurs.  We do not need to return to the bad old days.  We progressed from having a strike problem to having one of the best records.  Former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern who is not often praised and thanked nowadays did a notable job in changing an unacceptable industrial relations record to one that allowed us to be proud of our reputation.  Our reputation is important, given that so many of us have had to leave the country in recent times.  A reputation as hard workers precedes those moving to Canada, the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom and New Zealand.  We are at risk if the two vital supplies Senator Feargal Quinn mentioned are at risk.</p><p>There is a right to strike and picket, but this stems from an era in which we had much more exploitative employers.  All of the State's industrial relations machinery provides for a much more co-operative experience than heretofore.  Senator Feargal Quinn asks that the striking parties have a skeleton staff available to provide vital services such as water and electricity.  We do not want to harm innocent bystanders, nor do we want the so-called law of unintended consequences that would have a small dispute affect the whole macro-economy, leaving everyone worse off.</p><p>Industrial relations evolve and become much less confrontational and much less based on exploitative employers such as those of 100 years ago in 1913.  I am glad that this evolution has been happening in the time I have been examining the economy.  Formerly, employees worked in dreadful conditions in coal mines and so on.  Through the success of Governments, the trade union movement's powers of advocacy and politicians improving social services all the time, we have evolved from the world in which now traditional industrial relations laws of 100 years ago had to be framed to protect workers.  The legislation proposed is to protect society as a whole from the unintended consequences, as well as to protect innocent bystanders.  It is to ensure patients in hospitals, children, food stocks, the national reputation and the ability of high-tech industries to continue to attract investment and employ people on a 24 hour basis would be protected.  Strikes that would do damage in all of these areas do not really solve problems.  We have many other ways of solving problems.  We are asking that, when problems arise, the plug not be pulled on the water supply as it would have serious consequences for the country as a whole.</p><p>The Bill is an important contribution to bringing industrial relations to another stage of consultation, without damaging third parties and innocent bystanders.  We escaped from the brink ten days or so ago.  I commend the Minister, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, for his work in that regard.  We should discuss matters in Parliament, however, because people say the D&aacute;il and the Seanad are irrelevant.  This was a very important issue and we should be prepared, with the proper machinery, to deal with the problem if it arises again.  We should have a consultative framework in place to prevent huge losses among innocent bystanders.  Senator Feargal Quinn is to be commended for his initiative in bringing forward the Bill which I am proud to support.</p></speech>

I hope the other Chamber will also debate this issue.  Certain services are critical to the common good.  Electricity, water, fuel and transport services are all essential on this island and I would like to see them being protected for the consumer.  How we go about this is the question.</p><p>I have reservations about how the Government could square the Bill's provisions with the need for industrial peace.  We have had genuine industrial peace for many years and it has contributed to much of our economic development in the past 20 years, but there was a price to pay.</p> <p>There were national wage agreements that at the end of the day had to be paid for, in the main by the taxpayer.  Unions fought their corner, employers fought theirs and the Government sat as judge in the middle as both employer and representative of the taxpayer.</p><p>I, and others, would venture to say that the vast majority would support the view of Senator Quinn that essential utilities, such as electricity and water, should not be cut off by industrial action, but how do we do it?  While we strive to rebuild a shattered economy, the last thing we need is to face into large-scale industrial action in essential services.  I can remember the power strikes of the 1970s and 1980s where there were rolling power cuts all over the country.  Since then, many large employers have been attracted to this country by industrial relations stability and also by a guaranteed supply of labour, water and, most importantly, electricity.</p><p>While the threatened ESB strike has for now been averted, we should use all methods of intervention to settle disputes without having to introduce new laws to prevent industrial disruption.  Unions in these utilities have a duty to look after their members but they must recognise there is also a duty to the common good.  I have spoken to many small business owners who state that they can see business picking up in the economy, but they were horrified to see what was going on with the ESB unions and that they had called a strike for the day after this country would finally leave the bailout programme.  The thinking behind this is to bring the country to its knees again and to tell international markets that Ireland is not a place in which to set up because a union can turn off the lights at a moment's notice.  It is sheer madness to threaten to cut off the power to the homes of the elderly who are struggling to heat themselves through fuel poverty, to cut off the power to industries which are fulfilling orders for the domestic and foreign markets and to cut off the power to shops at their busiest time of the year when they work all God's hours to bring in the money that will keep them and their employees going in the quiet periods of the year ahead.  All of this is because of a perceived deficit in a pension fund.</p><p>The power of these utility unions must not be abused.  In 2001, IBEC called on the Government to ban strikes in essential services.  This has been repeated by Retail Excellence Ireland in November of this year.  In August 2010, the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development advised the Fianna F&aacute;il Government to consider banning strikes in essential services.</p><p>This is not the first time this has been raised, but it is the first time that somebody finally put down a Bill which has started the debate here.  Senator Quinn has an impressive CV in business and politics.  He has been an employer of thousands up and down the country and I recognise his sincerity in bringing the Bill before us today.</p><p>Unfortunately, I cannot support the Bill.  I certainly support the spirit and the thought process whereby we can never have a gun held to our head by any group in this country as we allowed happen in the past.  I am trying to figure out how to, as the fellow says &quot;square the circle&quot;, how we can deal with that in support of the Bill.  There were debates about how we should deal with the likes of the power unions and the power supply.  At this stage, we need to look seriously at those utilities and never allow the type of threat that was put over head over the past couple of weeks.  I am aware it is not taking place, but it is not good enough to even contemplate that, given what the people of this country have gone through over the past number of years.  It is an appropriate Bill to have arrived.  I am aware that in a sense it is by accident that it arrived.  It sends a big message as to where we are at and we need to address this seriously over the coming months.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-11a.429" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1154" speakername="Averil Power" time="17:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121100047#XX00200"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House.</p><p>  I echo many of the sentiments expressed by the previous speaker.  There is much agreement across the House that the ESB strike, if it had gone ahead, would have been disproportionate.  No doubt workers have a right to protect conditions of employment such as their wages and, as was at issue here, their pensions.  The ESB showed bad faith in appearing to unilaterally change the status of the workers' pension schemes and the workers were right to be outraged about that.  They have an entitlement to resort to industrial action to protect their rights, as do any workers.  At this, the coldest, darkest time of year, if the union had gone ahead with its threatened power cut this week, the consequences for the country would have been disastrous.  As has rightly been pointed out, it would have ended up where householders, many of whom would be elderly, sick or have families with young children, would find themselves in a situation where they would have no light or heat in their homes, and where they cannot use their cookers and cannot provide food for their families, and in small businesses having to close their doors because they do not have the essential services to open at the one time of year in the few weeks leading up to Christmas where many of them bring in one third or more of their annual turnover.  This is already one of the most difficult times for small businesses.  They are struggling as it is.  They do not need that extra burden.  Restaurants, with perishable stock, would find themselves in a position where they would have to dump food.  It would impact on large companies, such as the pharmaceutical industries to which Senator Barrett and others referred, that employ thousands of staff in this country.  It would do considerable damage, not only to persons' daily lives but also to Ireland's international reputation as a place to do business at a time when, more than ever, we desperately need not only to protect existing jobs, but to attract other leading international companies to Ireland to do business.</p><p>  I saw the coverage during the week.  Members referred in the previous debate on the Finance (No. 2) Bill to <i>Forbes</i> declaring Ireland as one of the best places in the world to do business.  I welcome that we are starting to get positive coverage internationally and commentators are noting that the economy is turning around.  I would have some concerns about some of the criteria on which they based that analysis, for instance, in seeing a high unemployment rate as a positive development for employers, but it is essential that we on all sides of the House would support any measure that would help to get the country back on track and turn the economy around.  A power strike would have been disastrous.</p><p>  Within my party's Seanad group, there are different views.  We debated the Bill on a couple of occasions over the past week and members had different views on it.  Some of my party's Senators believe in the absolute right to strike, particularly when essential terms and conditions or wages are at risk.  Others strongly support the principle in Senator Quinn's Bill that the right to which I refer, which is protected by the Constitution and by the European Convention on Human Rights, should also be balanced against the right to essential services for the population and the public order and common good interest which are equally protected by the Constitution and by the European convention, and that there should at least be provided the minimum level of service to which Senator Quinn referred.</p><p>  Senator Quinn was quite correct to point out that his Bill does not propose that all industrial action would be ruled out in utility companies and rather it would insist that there would be a minimum level of service or, as he stated, a skeleton staff would be in place.  Speaking on behalf of the group, I reflect that diversity and state that we had different views.   I appreciate that Senator Quinn pointed out that his Bill was in the works before the current industrial action was threatened but, of course, it falls to be considered in that context because that is the big issue at present.  While we as a group respect the rights of the ESB staff to protect their terms and conditions, equally, we were alarmed and shared the concern that most Irish people would have that it would get to a point where one would end up two weeks before Christmas with no power in the country.</p><p>  Personally, I would be concerned, if we are returning to a strike culture and a period of industrial unrest, to see both the threatened ESB strike and the threatened strike by the ASTI because that kind of culture will work well for certain types of employees.  If one is in a job where one holds a bargaining chip, such as that one can threaten to turn off the power or close the schools, then one is in a fairly strong position, but the vast majority of workers in this country are not in such a position.  It would not be right to resort to a situation where some workers are more protected than others only because they happen to work in environments where they can make such threats.  Every worker, regardless of whether he or she is packing bags in a supermarket on minimum wage or is a highly paid professional, should enjoy the same protections under the law, should be able to avail of the same mediation processes, including independent mediation when something goes wrong, and should have the same chance as others of success in a dispute.  It should not depend on where one works or how strong a bargaining chip one holds.</p><p>  Both this threatened strike and the ASTI one, raise issues with the industrial relations machinery, as did CIE strike which, thankfully, also was resolved last year.</p> <p>Again, it looked like we might end up in a situation where other workers in Dublin would not be able to get to work.  It is timely that we review our industrial relations machinery to ensure it is fit for purpose and that all workers are protected equally.</p><p>I commend Senator Quinn for tabling this Bill.  He is known to all of us as a compassionate and responsible employer.  When I was still in school, one of my part-time jobs was packing bags in Superquinn.  The shop in which I worked closed at 6 p.m. and the Senator wanted it to stay open until 7 p.m.  He came into the shop and sat down with all the staff personally to negotiate with us as head of the company and listen to our concerns.  He is someone who cares about workers' rights and has a good track record on this issue.  I respect his bona fides in this debate and I ask the Minister to reflect on the issue in the cold light of day now that the immediate threat of strike has diminished so that processes are put in place to ensure we do not end up in a similar situation in future.</p></speech>

I have the utmost respect for Senator Quinn not only as a captain of industry and entrepreneur but also as a commendable employer who set the highest of standards.  He has the support of Senator Barrett, who also commands our respect when he speaks.  However, not all employers are as decent as Senator Quinn or as forthcoming with their employees.  We have to consider this issue in the round.  It is fortunate that the immediate threat has been diffused because our discussions on this Bill would have taken a different tone in the previous climate.  I understand the motivation behind what occurred over the last several weeks.  All of us feared the prospect of a breakdown in industrial relations in ESB that would wreak havoc on families, the elderly and the infirm in the run-up to Christmas and would damage our economy and international reputation.  There is great relief that the immediate threat has passed and I commend both sides in the dispute and the Labour Relations Commission on the tremendous work it has done behind the scenes to diffuse the dispute.</p><p>It was confirmed during the week that certain trade union officials - I will not name anyone in the House - and their families received serious personal threats.  That is despicable.  Nobody deserves to be personally vilified for representing workers, even if we do not agree with the extent to which they were willing to push matters.  In this instance, the threat of strike action was disproportionate to the nature of the problem and I am glad it has been resolved.</p><p>It is ironic that we are having this debate during the centenary of the Lock-out.  It would be no harm to reflect on the progress that has been made by both sides in our society.  It is also interesting that we are having the debate against the backdrop of Nelson Mandela's passing this week in light of the plaudits given to the Dunnes Stores workers for their courage in taking a stand in 1984.  I do not think Nelson Mandela realised how many friends he had in Ireland.  There are certainly more people on his side today than was the case in 1984.  The same goes for the Dunnes Stores workers.  A number of people jumping on that bandwagon were not as full as praise for those young women at the time.  History is judging the Dunnes Stores workers positively for their courage and perseverance but not all of those who are commending them today were behind them when they were on strike.</p><p>Over the weekend we saw the sad sight of Marks and Spencer workers picketing in the run up to Christmas.  Again, it was mostly women on the picket line.  They did not want to be picketing but felt they had to strike because their employment terms and conditions, their pension entitlements, their holiday pay and their weekend rates were under serious threat.  I know of no worker who wants to be out on strike or on the picket line.  This Bill refers to utilities but we should consider these issues in the round.  As a member of the NUJ since I was 17 years old, I have spent time on the picket line.  Nobody wins in a strike situation.  It is important to acknowledge the significant progress that has been made in industrial relations in this country.  In the 1970s, we lost 58,000 days per annum due to strikes.  We became known as the sick man or basket case of Europe.  The situation improved somewhat in the 1980s, during which we lost an average of 32,000 days per annum.  Industrial peace and industrial relations mechanisms have improved the situation significantly, for which both employers and the trade union movement should be commended.  Employees have dug deep to help this country rebuild after the fiasco of the bank bailout.  I would not like us to squander that progress by criminalising or vilifying workers who feel they have to strike as a last resort.</p><p>One of the best, if not the best, union in the country is the Irish Farmers Association, which is fantastic at looking after the interests of its members in farming and rural communities.  All of us are relieved that the ESB strike has been diffused but I remind the House that Mr. Justice Peter Kelly stated in the Commercial Court that there was a deficit of &euro;1.8 billion in the company's pension fund.  The workers feared that the funds to which they were contributing would be lost.  Many workers in this country have been short-changed by the collapse of pensions.  People who saved prudently throughout their working lives found out upon retirement that their pension funds were insufficient to meet their requirements.</p><p>While I understand that Senator Quinn is approaching this issue in good faith, I cannot support his Bill because it could be seen as provocative legislation.  That is the last thing we need at present.  Instead of taking sides, we should continue working together.  The threat of strike in ESB brought people around the table and focused hearts and minds on achieving a result that was of benefit to the entire country.</p></speech>

Senators' views diverge on the issue of whether critical workers should be allowed to use the ultimate sanction of striking when it comes to industrial action or whether there should be a minimum level of service.</p> <p>One of the critical issues concerns those at home, who have necessary and vital equipment for kidney dialysis and medical devices to keep them alive and healthy.  We know hospitals and vital services have back-up generators but there is the issue of ensuring critical industries are maintained and sustained during any period of industrial action.  Some of the views expressed in the debate on the topic among our group concerns where to draw the line on critical industry.  Electricity is one, so are water and telecommunications.  Very few utilities are not critical.</p><p>Senator Whelan pointed out that this is the 100th anniversary of the Lock-out.  There is a fine balance between the worker and the employer.  Where the worker has a monopoly, being the only provider, he can hold the State to ransom and that situation must be dealt with through the trade union mechanism.  The worker has the sanction of strike but if he or she did not, the balance of power would go to the employer.  The ESB is a semi-State company with a commercial mandate and has the objective of making money as well as providing electricity.  If the bonuses, to use the word bandied about in the committee rooms today, of such employers are related to profits and the workers do not have the sanction of striking, the employer will continue to make profit at the cost to the employee.</p><p>We have seen this in private industry in respect of pensions and pension rights.  In private industry, pensions were not there when the workers needed them.  There is no sanction for the employer.  Where did it go?  Who was in charge of ensuring the fund was there for workers?  The ESB workers do not have a State pension to fall back on, as may be the case for others.  One of the critical points is Irish Water, a huge superquango that is a disaster given that we cannot measure the quantity of water being used in urban areas such as Dublin.  Nevertheless, we will spend billions of euro putting in infrastructure through a superquango that may not fulfil its remit.  It is an essential service.</p><p>The issue of the strike is off the table and it takes away the pressure from the debate.  However, if everyone's electricity was to be shut off on Monday morning and we were receiving phone calls about the electricity being shut off, Senator Quinn would have a heated debate.  The country could not tolerate it in respect of those who would rely on it for life-sustaining medical devices and maintaining current jobs.  It would be a disaster for the country.  If the industrial relations mechanism had failed abysmally, we would be a different situation.  We would be voting on it but with a different view taken by the Government.  The chief executive officers of large multinationals and Retail Excellence Ireland said this is vital.  That is why we have labour relations mechanisms, which are tortuous but exist so that it does not come to the 11th hour, at which point we are facing emergency legislation to prevent the strike and to keep on the lights.  I welcome the debate on the Bill.  The Bill might be brought back by the Government.</p></speech>

The context of the Bill, trying to protect critical utilities, is important.  This afternoon, I thought back to the 1970s and 1980s, to which Senator Whelan referred, and the power strikes.  We were given notice of the time we had power and we prepared for it.  Senator Quinn referred to a minimum level of cover to maintain basic services.  We can understand in respect of nurses or health care settings but for utilities such as electricity, it is either on or off.  Where do we decide the services are essential or basic?</p><p>We had a discussion on the Water Services (No.2) Bill about cutting off water.  That will not happen but pressure can be reduced and people can have supply restricted.  In the case of electricity, it is either on or off.  Over the past 20 years, industrial peace has come about through negotiation with unions, the Government and those involved in partnership talks.  Many who were not involved in partnership talks and who were in opposition were quite critical of the fact that discussions and agreements were not made public.  Agreements were made behind closed doors and the debate was not held in a public forum.  Nevertheless, we have had industrial peace following for social partnership, which I acknowledge.  It has come at a cost and we are paying the price in terms of coming to grips with the costs in terms of delivering public services in an economically different time when frontline services are suffering because of our economic situation.  Public services expanded when it could be afforded but there was no foresight on how the expansion could be sustained.</p><p>I commend the Labour Relations Commission.  The Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, asked it to step in last week.  It has essential expertise and it has delivered previously in other difficult situations.  It is an important mechanism in the industrial relations procedures.  The code of practice on dispute procedures includes procedures for essential services.  There is a framework for resolution and perhaps the Minister can address the point.  It was not utilised in the past number of weeks.  We need to recognise, as Senator Quinn said, that his proposal does not take away the right to strike but that certain workers are working in essential areas.  If they are going to work in an area that is critical and essential and we go down this road, the issue of pay and employment rights will have to be different to those deemed not to work in essential services.</p><p>Concerning critical services and infrastructure, the quality of our infrastructure is important and we must ensure we invest in it.</p> <p>I am thinking of EirGrid and the ongoing debate around the country.  The company's mission is to ensure security of electricity supply into the future.  Uisce &Eacute;ireann will be responsible for ensuring critical infrastructure is maintained and guaranteeing the quality of drinking water.  That is important and we are addressing that in legislation before the House to establish Irish Water.</p><p>It is important to have this debate without the threat of a strike in the background.  As a country seeking investment and selling itself abroad, we need to be make sure we have supplies of critical services such as water and electricity because they are essential to attracting investment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-11a.436" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1133" speakername="David Cullinane" time="17:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121100050#AAA00200"><p>I cannot, as is customary, commend the author of the Bill for bringing it forward.  I spoke to him prior to the debate because this legislation is abhorrent and unhelpful and it is beyond me how any Oireachtas Member would put effort into criminalising workers.  The Senator disagrees but I will demonstrate how it does.  He also said the legislation does not and will not prevent workers from withdrawing labour but it makes it a criminal offence for a person to engage in industrial action that causes an interruption to the supply of a critical utility.  If ESB workers withdraw their labour, that could cause a interruption to services.  If we were to accept the Bill, therefore, it would prevent them from doing so.  That is the reality and, therefore, it is odious legislation.  It would criminalise some groups of workers.</p><p>The language used is clear and self-explanatory.  The Bill states, &quot;It is an offence for a person to engage in industrial action&quot;.  It provides for fines, indictments and prison terms, all of which I would characterise as criminalisation.  It will also be an offence &quot;to induce an employee of a critical utility to do anything which directly or indirectly causes an interruption or stoppage to the supply of a critical utility.&quot;  The punishment, fine or deterrent for such behaviour can be 12 months imprisonment and, on indictment, a fine of &euro;250,000 or five years imprisonment and a fine of &euro;50,000.  I fail to see how that would not criminalise workers if the Bill was passed.</p><p>I do not believe that such right wing, Thatcherite, oppressive and anti-labour policies have any place in this country.  These policies were introduced in Britain in the 1970s.  The plan then was to crush unions, demoralise workers and break organised labour.  This was done by recourse to the law, courts, police and prison.  The Bill is a replica of the anti-union legislation passed at that time but the reality is this is not Thatcher's Britain in the 1970s; it is Ireland in 2013, 100 years after the 1913 Lock-out.  I am certain the Senator who proposed the Bill is aware of and understands history but the history he seeks to identify with is that of William Martin Murphy and not the workers of Dublin or Larkin or Connolly.  This was prompted by IBEC and a number of other employer representative organisations which want such legislation introduced in order that they can be as vengeful, narrow minded and selfish as their colleagues in the 1900s.</p><p>The Bill also makes it an offence to induce an employee of a critical utility to do anything which might disrupt supply.  What does &quot;induce&quot; mean?  Induce and seduce have a similar sound and meaning.  Is Senator Quinn of the opinion that unions induce workers to engage in industrial action?  Is he saying workers are unthinking and cannot make up their own minds?  The intent of the Bill is clear to workers and trades unions.  Perhaps it is beyond the Senator's comprehension to imagine workers as thinking human beings who are capable of making up their minds on such matters.  They are also rational beings and they are aware of the consequences of industrial action because no worker wants to strike.  More than 40% of workers earn less than &euro;30,000 a year.  The fastest area of growth in terms of those falling into poverty is among the working poor.  There has also been a dramatic increase in part-time, insecure contract employment.</p><p>One wonders why the Senator did not dream up legislation that would make it a criminal offence for senior management in strategically important companies to break agreements with their workers and unions.  I do not see legislation coming on these issues but that is what the ESB did.  Why else would workers have contemplated such extreme action as a strike in the first place?  People do not go on strike for the fun of it; they go on strike because they are being denied basic rights and the industrial relations machinery has not worked in their favour.  It is a fundamental right to strike and that right is recognised in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights which states, &quot;Everyone has the right to form and join trade unions and the right to strike&quot;.  The explicit right to strike is also recognised in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, which states: &quot;Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association with others, including the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his or her interests and to engage in industrial action&quot;.  It is about solidarity and it is also about the common good.  We have made several requests on the Order of Business for the Minister to come to the House to discuss what form of collective bargaining rights the Government will introduce.  I remind him in the context of this odious legislation that workers still do not have the right to be represented by their trade union and or to engage in collective bargaining in this, the centenary of the 1913 Lock-out.</p><p>I very much look forward to the legislation the Minister brings forward but I robustly stand against this legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-11a.437" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1162" speakername="Denis Landy" time="17:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121100050#AAA00300"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House and I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  The proposed Bill has been tabled by Senator Quinn for whom I have great regard.  He was a fantastic businessmen who employed thousands of people and I worked closely with him during the recent Seanad referendum campaign.  Despite that, I will not support the Bill because it seeks to take advantage of the plight of ESB workers to introduce counterproductive measures that provide for the imprisonment for up to five years of workers who choose to strike.  Striking is the last act of a worker in dispute.  Sometimes ESB workers are blamed for the jobs they have but it is easily forgotten that the same people were out in snow blizzards restoring power this time three years ago for weeks on end.  In some quarters, they are said to be privileged and, therefore, they should not have the right to strike.</p><p>We are in the fortunate position as a country that the lights will be on for Christmas.  I would like to record my appreciation to the Labour Relations Commission, the trade unions and ESB management for their efforts in resolving this dispute.  Churchill famously said: &quot;To jaw-jaw is always better than to war-war&quot;. </p> <p>In this instance, "jaw-jaw" proved to be the winner.  The workers involved themselves, through the union, in healthy horse trading and transparent bargaining, which is part of any democracy, and Ireland is no different.  What seems to be lost in all this is empathy for the workers involved, the same people who in some cases for 40 years paid into pensions and were told there would not be a pension available when they retired.  The ESB workers are men and women with families and in many cases they have given the best years of their lives to the company which sought to pull the rug from beneath them.</p><p>Much has been said tonight about strikes and industrial action.  It is worth noting that the last strike in the ESB of any significance was in 1991 and lasted four days.  In my research I have been unable to find any strike in water utilities in the past 30 years.  It is important to remember such facts when we debate not allowing these people the right to strike.  I commend their spirit and solidarity, and I hope their actions show the public the power of the collective and a clear demonstration of the importance and relevance of the trade union movement 100 years after the Dublin Lock-out.</p><p>Pay, pensions and working conditions of all workers in this country have been dramatically eroded since the beginning the recession and now that we are entering a post bailout Ireland, we have the opportunity to shape our society and our economy.  This Bill, if accepted, has the potential to prevent nurses, doctors, teachers and other public sector workers from entering an industrial dispute.  What kind of anti-worker message is that?  We are talking about workers who have carried this economy on their backs and taken all of the cuts and pain since the recession began.  That is not an Ireland of which I want to be part.  We should as a country and a Parliament look to be strengthening workers' rights rather than trying to divide and conquer, eroding the gains fought for so hard by workers.  The public and private sectors should be standing in solidarity with the Marks &amp;amp; Spencer workers all over the country, the ESB workers and the Milne Foods workers in Offaly if we are ever to move away from the radical individualism that infected our great country as the Celtic tiger roared.</p><p>The Labour Party has worked hard in order to protect the low-paid and workers in precarious employment since we took the responsibility to clean up the mess left behind after Fianna F&aacute;il.  I am proud that as a Labour Party during the worst economic crisis in the history of the State we restored the minimum wage, took 330,000 low-paid workers out of the USC net and, against much opposition, fought for joint labour committees, JLCs, and employment regulation orders to be reformed and revitalised while putting them on a safe and secure legal and constitutional footing that will protect workers earning their wages in those sectors.</p><p>People have referred to Hungary, a country which in 2011 introduced legislation of this nature.  On nine separate occasions, workers sought to have the right to strike but each time this was refused by the equivalent of our Labour Relations Commission in Hungary.  In 1981, then US President Ronald Reagan passed legislation that forbade strikes by Government employees where public safety was at risk.  On that occasion, air traffic controllers were forced back to work, and America now has the most glaring example of a two-tier society in the world, with union membership dropping to 12% and the disparity between rich and poor growing by the day.</p><p>The programme for Government includes a statement that we will &quot;reform the current law on employees' right to engage in collective bargaining (the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001), so as to ensure compliance by the State with recent judgments of the European Court of Human Rights.&quot;  I am also pleased that the T&aacute;naiste has announced that the Government will begin the process of legislating in the coming weeks to give employees the rights to engage in collective bargaining.  In the year of the 100th anniversary of the 1913 Lock-out, Mr. Jack O'Connor, SIPTU general secretary, has stated, &quot;Even to the extent that the right of collective bargaining, the core issue at stake in the Lock-out, which is respected in virtually every EU country, is still denied in this republic.&quot;  I am glad to say it will not be denied for much longer.  I look forward to the Minister's response.  I thank Senator Quinn for moving the legislation so we could have an open and frank debate on the matter.</p></speech>

I also welcome this debate, and it is refreshing to hear contributions like Senator Landy's.  Senator Landy and I may come from different places on the political spectrum but I hope it will not in any way affect our political friendship.  His contribution nonetheless would not have been out of place in the political and industrial language of the 1970s and 1980s.</p><p>I spoke to a number of friends and colleagues earlier and as we normally do, we wandered into all sorts of political tours of history.  We were discussing the former British Labour Party leader, Neil Kinnock.  I reminded one of my friends about Kinnock's address to a famous conference of the British Labour Party when he tackled the militant element within the party.  He challenged the Liverpool Labour Party leadership, which had a militant tendency and at that stage was running and ruining the city.  As Kinnock stated, taxpayers' money was being used to send taxi drivers across Liverpool to hand out redundancy notices to members.  His challenge at the time to the party was for it to live in reality rather than the ideology of a past era.  He asked the party to accept that society had changed and the relationship between workers and their bosses had also moved on, with everybody having to accept new realities.</p><p>In a few days the country will mark the official exit from the bailout.  The Taoiseach, his Government and anybody concerned about the future of the country wants Ireland to be a place where people can invest and we can put hundreds of thousands of unemployed people back to work.  Anybody wishing to invest in the country needs a number of certainties; such people need certainty about investment policy, long-term planning, taxation and the issue raised by Senator Quinn.  We are lucky not to have an ESB strike on our hands next week as that would be an appalling vista for the country.  It is not just a question of lights being shut off as tens of thousands or perhaps hundreds of thousands of workers across the country would have been at significant financial disadvantage as a result.</p><p>There is a role for worker representation and unions but we have all moved into different types of thinking, and both employers and employees must see co-operation as part of the new and better equation.  In his Bill Senator Quinn makes it very clear that he is not seeking the removal of the right to strike, picket or take industrial action.  The legislation is trying to ensure that citizens of the country - workers and non-workers - will have certain guarantees of essential services, and it is very difficult to argue that there should not be a guarantee that when one needs to switch on a light, it will come on, or that when a tap is turned, the water supply will work.  We are discussing the new water Bill in the House but we must ensure such basic services are guaranteed in whatever ways are practical and possible.</p><p>This should not precipitate a major philosophical or political divide and the issue is about common sense.  This is about offering certain assurances to every citizen in the State.  Whether one is young or old, it is not unfair to expect basic services to be guaranteed.  Everybody in the House demands basic health services, which is correct.</p> <p>We rightly demand that basic education and other essential services be protected.  This proposal would ensure some of these basic services would be guaranteed and could not be switched off at a whim.  When there are industrial, political or other disputes, as Mr. Churchill said, &ldquo;To jaw-jaw is always better than to war-war.&rdquo;  Why have the war-war option at all?  Why not only have the option of jaw-jaw to force people to negotiate and compromise?  Society, industrial policy and labour relations have moved on; our industrial relations mechanisms should move on also.  Basic utility services such as water and electricity, utilities essential not just to the everyday running of the economy but also lives, require certain minimum guarantees of supply.  Accordingly, I hope Senator Feargal Quinn&rsquo;s Bill will receive the maximum consideration from the Government.</p></speech>

I thank those involved in bringing the negotiations between the unions, management, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, and the Labour Relations Commission, LRC, to a successful conclusion for everyone&rsquo;s benefit.</p><p>Those employed by the ESB and other critical utility companies such as water and telecommunications providers are perfectly entitled to be members of trade unions and I support their right to join them.  I also support the right of workers to strike, but the cause must be proportionate.  The recently threatened strike in the ESB was out of proportion.  The last strike in the company was over 22 years ago, one in which I participated on the picket line.  There is no satisfaction for workers walking with placards on cold and dark nights on a picket line.  It is a last resort.  Those past ESB strikes were dark days for the workers, businesses, schools and hospitals.  Even then, a minimal supply was maintained for hospitals and those living near them were lucky to keep their supply, too.  Thankfully, we have not had similar strikes since, with no blackouts for over 20 years owing to successful negotiations between the unions, workers, management and the LRC.</p><p>Senators Feargal Quinn and Sean D. Barrett always make significant contributions to debates in this House.  However, I am concerned that the Bill which would remove the right of trade union members in certain utilities to go on strike might impose criminal sanctions for going on strike, a penalty we should avoid, as it could be counterproductive and undermine the entire trade union movement.  I agree that the Bill has merit in providing for a minimum supply, where necessary.  The State&rsquo;s industrial relations system has served us well, however, in reaching agreement between unions, workers and management, which has ensured no strike action has taken place in the ESB in the past 22 years.  I hope the system will continue to be successful and that we will not have a disruption to supply again, with the country being held to ransom, for another 22 years.  At that stage, I will not personally be concerned about the issue.</p></speech>

I also compliment Senator Feargal Quinn on bringing forward this legislation for debate.  In every utterance he makes in this House he is constructive and promotes the country&rsquo;s interests.  I know he is motivated by the best possible intentions in introducing this legislation which proposes to provide for the security of supply of electricity and mains water which can be deemed to be critical utility services.  While the Minister will not accept the Bill, we are having a mature debate on how to ensure critical utilities are protected from industrial disruption.</p><p>The recent threat of an ESB strike brings into sharp focus how vulnerable we really are in this regard.  The proposed action was disproportionate, with one group of workers putting the livelihoods of many other workers across the country at risk.  That is simply unacceptable.  I met many concerned small retailers in my home town of Ballinasloe who were concerned that they would be without a supply in the run-up to Christmas and, accordingly, not able to keep their businesses open.  If the strike had gone ahead, the impact on their businesses and employment levels would have been catastrophic.  We have many large manufacturing companies across the country that have continuous manufacturing processes which require continuity of supply.  The manufacturing and production sector would have been severely damaged by such a strike.</p> <p>Much time has been spent by the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and every other Minister in repairing the damage done to our reputation in recent years.  Overnight, all of this good work could have been undone and we could have suffered a serious loss of investment, not to mention the impact on the ordinary citizen.  The elderly in particular were likely to be seriously stressed and discommoded by having no light and heat over the Christmas period.  Our transport system and other vital services would also have been severely affected.  </p><p>It is not right for key utilities to be used as a bargaining tool in an industrial relations dispute.  While I have some reservations about the use of statutory provisions that contain criminal sanctions, I feel that consideration must be given to establishing negotiated agreements that include a no-strike clause in identified critical utility providers.  That is a road we should go down.  We have had good industrial relations in recent years and we can never go back to the bad old days of the 1970s and 1980s.  I pay tribute to the staff of the Labour Relations Commission and to all of those working for the industrial relations machinery of the State.  They have ensured that days lost through strikes have been kept to a minimum in recent years.  However, we saw last week how vulnerable we are and we need to address this particular issue if we want to continue to develop our economy.  We still have more than 390,000 people unemployed.  We cannot do anything or allow anything to happen that will in any way damage our efforts to get our people back to work and to attract inward investment.</p><p>I totally acknowledge the right of employees to withdraw their labour if they are not being treated fairly by their employer, but where key utilities are concerned, we need to put in place special systems and structures to deal with that.  Disputes within those critical providers must be capable of being addressed without resort to strike action.  I applaud Senator Quinn for giving us the opportunity to have a discussion on this key issue.  We must ensure we never arrive at a situation in which critical utility providers are closed because of an industrial dispute.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-11a.444" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="18:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121100053#DDD00200"><p>I thank the 12 Senators who participated in this debate.  It has been a very interesting discussion.  Like others, I welcome the recent resolution of the dispute at the ESB, which is a good example of our existing industrial relations machinery in action.  The trade unions, management and staff of the Labour Relations Commission certainly deserve recognition for ending the uncertainty that threatened a disproportionate outcome to the matters in dispute.  That must be put on the record.</p><p>I thank Senator Quinn for tabling his Bill, which was done with the very best of intentions.  We live in an increasingly interconnected world and our communities are dependent on one another in ways that simply were not even thought of decades ago.  Through our communications, our dependence on health systems, energy, transport, power and so forth, we are deeply interconnected in a way that was not the case in the past.  No one is more aware than me, in my current job, of the importance of confidence in our industrial relations environment.  It is very important for investment, success, for good quality employment and for allowing companies to grow.  All of that is built on trust and confidence.  It is vital that we have good industrial relations, which helps to contribute to and secure economic progress.  </p><p>As Senator Mullins and others have said, our framework for industrial relations has delivered remarkable industrial peace in this country for many years.  We must understand the nature of that success and how it has been built.  It is built on a voluntarist system and at its heart is the constitutional freedom of association, the right to join trade unions, the linked freedom to withdraw one's labour, the protection from tort where dispute procedures have been followed and a voluntary system of collective bargaining.  It is not built on criminal enforcement or mandatory industrial relations procedures.  It is not built on that foundation.  Not only is it built on a voluntarist approach, it is also built on the development over many years of exceptional experience in our industrial relations machinery, coupled with exceptional ability to build the sort of confidence and trust across the industrial divide that secures good outcomes.  These are embodied in institutions such as the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  That is an asset which we have built over many years and it has served us well in developing a strong export-led economy.  I will not get into the difficulties we have had in recent years, but we must rebuild that strong economy.</p><p>Clearly, for the voluntarist system that we have developed to continue to work, those who are involved in industrial relations in critical utilities must know that they carry an enormous responsibility.  That is absolutely vital.  Senator Quinn singles out water and power providers, but one could also include communications, energy and health providers.  The same principles apply to all.  We must ensure that our very strong voluntarist code continues to develop so that it can continue to handle the challenges that are thrown up by our more interconnected world.  Under our industrial relation legislation, a code of practice for dealing with disputes in essential services was first developed in 1992.  It is designed to assist employers and trade unions in making agreements which recognise the rights and interests of parties concerned.  It outlines procedures to resolve issues in a peaceful manner, avoiding the need for the parties to resort to actions which will lead to disruption.  The code recognises that there is a joint responsibility on employers and trade unions to resolve disputes in essential services without resorting to strikes or other forms of industrial action.  The code also recognises that there is a joint obligation to have in place agreed contingency plans and other arrangements to deal with any emergency which may arise during an industrial dispute.  In particular, the code states that employers and trade unions employed in providing an essential service should co-operate with each other in making arrangements concerning the maintenance of plant and equipment, all matters concerning health safety and security, special operational problems which exist in continuous process industries, the provision of urgent medical services and supplies and the provision of emergency services required on humanitarian grounds.  In the case of essential services, the code contains provisions to the effect that general dispute resolution procedures should apply along with additional procedures and safeguards which are necessary for the peaceful resolution of disputes.  These should be included in the appropriate agreements between employers and trade unions.</p> <p>These services include those the cessation or interruption of which could endanger life or cause major damage to the national economy or widespread hardship to the community, particularly health services, energy supplies, including gas and electricity, water and sewage services, fire, ambulance and rescue services and certain elements of public transport.</p><p>The code is a guide to the way we need to develop our industrial relations in these critical areas.  While some employment groups have engaged, the code has not been incorporated to a sufficient extent into relevant dispute procedures in the case of essential service providers.  It is worth looking at how the provisions of the code could be incorporated in a more concrete fashion into the dispute procedures of such entities.  This would be worthwhile.  As Senator Michael Mullins said, we ought to see &quot;no strike&quot; clauses contained in agreements.  There are some cases in which this has happened.  This protection needs to be encouraged.  I will certainly look afresh at how we can bring about greater application of the code which is well structured.  This is the route we should take and as a consequence, I will not support the Bill.</p><p>I agree with speakers who have said introducing criminal powers or mandatory obligations to a system we have developed over many years would not be the correct route to take.  If this were to happen and if, in the context of a dispute, we saw the courts introduced, the police involved and arrests occurring, I do not believe this would be seen as a route to resolve the issues involved or provide the certainty we seek.  We need to build on a model that has served us well, but we must not be complacent and pretend it is perfect.  We need to strive constantly to improve it.  The existence of the code needs to be promulgated further.  This is the route we need to take.  In recent years industrial relations have been extremely good and we can build on that experience and deepen the commitment on both sides.</p><p>This debate is timely and underlines again the importance of some of these services in the interconnected environment in which we live.  The debate has been worthwhile.  The direction I would like to see us take is the one where we use and develop the model in place to deal more effectively with these new areas and categories of service.  Despite the respect demonstrated on all sides for the Senator and his motivation in bringing it forward, I cannot support the Bill.</p></speech>

I found it interesting that Fianna F&aacute;il had appointed somebody with the name Power to debate the issue of electricity.  I wondered whether the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, whose name is Robert Watt, was also going to turn up to speak.</p><p>I listened to and appreciate everything the Minister said.  I also appreciate the contributions made to the debate.  I do not want to be complacent.  We have had good labour relations in recent years.  However, my concern is that there is a degree of complacency.  There is a huge responsibility on everybody involved in labour relations to ensure that even the threat does not do harm.  There was a threat last week and it did harm to the hard work the Minister had been doing to try to get industry to come to Ireland.  The threat that power or water may be lost is dangerous.</p><p>I looked into this area and discovered that eight countries in Europe had legislation covering essential supplies.  This is a debate that should continue here, which is the reason I suggest I adjourn this debate in order that we may continue it in the future.  Perhaps we might come back to it on another day.  I thank everybody who contributed to the debate and thank the Minister for his kind words about the Bill.  In particular, I thank Senator Sean D. Barrett who seconded the motion.  I hope we now have time to think about and discuss the Bill and, perhaps, come to a conclusion.</p></speech>

In May 2013 LDCs were awarded revised allocations under the Leader elements of the rural development programme. Two main issues are relevant in understanding the rationale n&oacute; an f&aacute;th gur tharla s&eacute; seo.  Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, sa bhliain 2012 iarradh ar ghach comhlacht forbhartha &aacute;iti&uacute;il a gcuid airgid a chaitheamh, d&aacute; dteast&oacute;dh sin uathu, on first-come first served basis.  Bh&iacute; an seans c&eacute;anna ag gach comhlacht an m&eacute;id airgid a theastaigh uathu a chur isteach i dtogra &aacute;iti&uacute;il.  </p><p>The second issue relates to the change in co-financing rates.  During 2011, the European Commission approved a change in the maximum co-financing rate, from 55% to 85%, for the Leader elements of Ireland's RDP, but only for expenditure incurred in 2012 and 2013.  S&eacute;ard a thit amach ansin n&aacute; go raibh laghd&uacute; ar an m&eacute;id airgid sa chl&aacute;r - laghd&uacute; &oacute; &euro;427 milli&uacute;n go dt&iacute; &euro;370 milli&uacute;n, &iacute;sli&uacute; de 13%.  An toradh a bh&iacute; ar seo n&aacute; go raibh laghd&uacute; ar an mh&eacute;id airgid a fuair Galway Rural Development agus FORUM Connemara.  The redistribution of available funding was conducted in as fair and equitable a manner as was possible, with many comhlachta&iacute; forbartha &aacute;iti&uacute;la experiencing an &iacute;sli&uacute; freisin.  The allocations were adjusted to ensure that all comhlachta&iacute; forbartha &aacute;iti&uacute;la received at least 80% of the allocation bun&uacute;sach a bh&iacute; acu.  Had this not been done, d'fh&eacute;adfadh a l&aacute;n comhlachta&iacute;, including Galway Rural Development and FORUM Connemara, ciorruithe n&iacute;os m&oacute; a fhulaingt in the context the allocations were calculated sa tsl&iacute; is f&eacute;ar&aacute;ilte gurbh fh&eacute;idir.</p><p>Tugadh &euro;22 milli&uacute;n do Galway Rural Development, FORUM Connemara agus Gaeltacht na Gaillimhe.  Chomh maith le sin, fuair Comhar na nOile&aacute;n &euro;4.7 milli&uacute;n do na hoile&aacute;in, a major portion of which was allocated to Galway.  Seo airgead m&oacute;r d'aon &aacute;it n&oacute; aon chuid den t&iacute;r.  Maidir leis na Gaeltacht areas, t&aacute; laghd&uacute; freisin sa mh&eacute;id airgid at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il d&oacute;ibh.  When MFG (Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta) went into liquidation in 2011, bh&iacute;  &euro;3. 371 milli&uacute;n caite aige ar an programme bun&uacute;sach a bh&iacute; aige.  In May 2013, &euro;6 million for the Gaeltacht areas was awarded to the contiguous local development companies. Of this, fuair Gaillimh &euro;2.1 de.   Due consideration will of course be given to all areas, including the Gaeltacht, m&aacute;s rud &eacute; go mbeidh aon airgid breise le caitheamh.</p><p>Leader programme spending is subject to continual monitoring.  T&aacute; an Roinn ag faire ar seo i gc&oacute;na&iacute; agus beidh s&eacute; ag d&eacute;anamh formal review of the commitments and expenditure levels ag deireadh na bliana seo.  Ina dhiaidh sin, beidh an Aire in ann f&eacute;achaint ar&iacute;s an bhfuil aon airgead breise le tabhairt amach.   Sa chomhth&eacute;acs sin, t&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach a thuiscint it is a matter for each individual comhlacht forbartha &aacute;iti&uacute;il to decide c&eacute; acu project a theasta&iacute;onn uaidh airgead a chaitheamh air, m&aacute; bh&iacute;onn an t-airgead breise sin aige.</p></speech>

This matter relates to the junior doctor issue, a matter I have dealing with over the past two years.  I am very concerned about the issue because of the 4,900 doctors employed in the health service, some 2,000 are on six-month only contracts.  I eventually extracted this information from the HSE after approximately 18 months of seeking it.</p><p>Let me explain my concern.  Junior doctors will start their job on 7 January and by 7 February they will start sitting interviews for jobs starting on 7 July.   This is an unsatisfactory situation.  There is no other employment system with a structure like this.  This system causes uncertainty.  We have a large number of qualified doctors leaving this country.  The cost of producing 600 medical graduates per annum is approximately &euro;90 million, because they are trained over a five year programme.  Based on my figures and analysis, up to two-thirds of these graduates leave the country within 12 months of finishing.  Many junior doctors are leaving once they have completed their intern year.  In other words, &euro;60 million of the investment made by taxpayers was spent on these doctors who have left.  </p><p>I suggest we need to restructure the system.  Will the Minister of State provide the up to date position in regard to the restructuring that was to occur?  I understand the president of DCU was appointed to head up the group on this.  What progress has been made and when are we likely to see an initial report and when are we likely to see changes in the contracts being offered to the junior doctors we are employing in our hospitals?</p></speech>

Non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, play a fundamental role in the provision of services in our hospitals.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, is committed to improving their working conditions and to ensuring they can have suitable career pathways and job security within the Irish health system.</p> <p>Approximately 80% of the 4,900 NCHDs working in the public system hold structured training posts while 20% hold service posts.  At present the duration of the NCHDs' employment contracts are determined by the nature of their training arrangements, the location of their employment, whether they rotate between various sites and who their employers are.</p><p>The Minister wishes to see arrangements developed which will ensure NCHDs in training programmes are provided with certainty at the beginning of training schemes regarding the location of rotations over the course of a scheme and that those in non-training posts are given contracts of a duration that make their employment sustainable and attractive in the longer term.  The establishment of the hospital groups framework will facilitate the development of these contracts.  The fact that a significant proportion of our NCHDs are on six-month contracts brings a level of uncertainty to the filling of posts each January and July when the cyclical rotations occur.  The Minister wants to end this uncertainty by ensuring our NCHDs want to work and develop their careers here and he is satisfied that the range of initiatives in train will achieve this.</p><p>In July this year the Minister set up a working group chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith, president of DCU, to carry out a strategic review of the medical training and career structure of NCHDs.  The terms of reference of the review include making recommendations aimed at improving graduate retention in the public health system, planning for future service needs, and realising maximum benefit from investment in medical education and training.  The Minister wishes to acknowledge the focus that Professor MacCraith and the members of this group have brought to their work within a tight timeframe.</p><p>During October and November the working group met a number of key stakeholders, including trainee doctors, the Medical Council, postgraduate training bodies and clinicians in senior management in the HSE.  The group submitted its interim report to the Minister last week and he is very pleased with the findings, which include a number of practical recommendations that can be progressed quite quickly.  The interim report will be published shortly.  The group is now moving to stage two of its work with a view to submitting its final report to the Minister by June 2014.</p><p>The agreement reached between the HSE and the Irish Medical Organisation at the Labour Relations Court in October on addressing working hours and achieving compliance with the European working time directive specifically encompassed NCHD recruitment and retention.  It reaffirms the commitment in the Haddington Road agreement to reviewing the NCHD career structure with the aim of further developing career and training pathways for all grades of NCHD to consultant and specialist level.  It also identifies successful graduate recruitment and retention as key to achieving compliance with the working time directive.  The Minister has identified the attainment of compliance as a key priority for HSE management.  Reducing the hours many NCHDs are required to work will make working here more attractive.  The Minister is determined that as part of the overall health reform programme we build a public health system that values the contribution and commitment of trainee doctors and we want to ensure this very talented workforce are offered a rewarding and satisfying career here in Ireland.</p></speech>

I am a little concerned the final report will not be published until June 2014 and that an interim report will be published.</p><p>Nothing really seems to have changed for 2014.  While I accept that implementing the working time directive is necessary and fundamental for the health service, we are running into a problem whereby we will not have junior doctors coming from abroad over the next 12 months to two years.  There is clear evidence that the number is decreasing.  By the end of the year the cost of those employed under agency contracts as opposed to HSE contracts will be approximately &euro;50 million.  Waiting until June for a final report will not deal with the issues for 2014.  The information I have received is that there are concerns about posts being filled in January.  I ask the Minister of State to convey this to the Department.  I suggest the final report be brought forward from June.  It will be too late then because it will not have dealt with those starting in July 2014 who will be offered contracts in April or May.  The report should be published not later than 31 March.  I am genuinely concerned that we will run into major problems.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-11a.465" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1158" speakername="Martin Conway" time="18:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121100056#GGG00400"><p>I have tabled this Adjournment matter as a result of the public highlighting of the fact that relatives of deceased people are receiving correspondence from the Department of Social Protection.  I have had several telephone conversations and items of electronic correspondence with the Department since tabling the matter to establish why I did so.  The reason is quite simple.  I have been contacted by a number of concerned citizens who have received correspondence from the Department of Social Protection about the qualification for entitlements of deceased relatives one or two years after they had passed away.  Several days ago on Clare FM, the local radio station, I heard a person whose son, who had Down's syndrome, had passed away 11 years ago.  The Department sent correspondence addressed to the deceased person seeking the return of a free travel pass because disability payments had ceased.  It upset many people in the constituency and highlighted the fact that computer-generated correspondence is being sent to people who have been deceased for many years.</p><p>I seek the introduction of protocols in the Department of Social Protection to ensure no correspondence will issue to somebody who has passed away.  I suggest that this can be achieved if those responsible for issuing death certificates collect PPS numbers and are responsible for notifying all relevant Departments, the HSE and the Revenue Commissioners so that deceased persons do not receive any further correspondence from the State.  This is a moral responsibility, because it causes significant distress to the families when they receive such correspondence.  I picked the Department of Social Protection because hundreds of thousands of people are in receipt of payments from the Department and it was the Department highlighted in the recent Clare FM expos&eacute;.</p></speech>

However, there is always a risk that, inadvertently, correspondence will issue to a deceased person, given the very large numbers of customers and complex payment systems needed to service their requirements.   Where this arises and where it is brought to the Department's attention and there is sufficient detail, the Department will immediately apologise.  Indeed, the Minister for Social Protection has also written personally to the deceased person's relatives to explain the circumstances and apologise for any distress which might have been caused.</p><p>Given the scale of the Department's operations it is impossible to safeguard fully against this type of occurrence.  In 2012 for instance, 2.3 million people benefited from payments from the Department through 70 separate income support schemes.  There were 2 million applications for benefits processed, with 87 million payments being made.  The Department also undertook 1 million control reviews of entitlement.  All of this work involves direct communication with customers.  There is a risk that in some instances, the Department is not fully up to date with an individual's status and the customer will be deceased.  For example, some of the routine review and control work which is undertaken, particularly on schemes for older people, actually requires that customers are written to in order to ensure that they have all their entitlements.  Such exercises are also designed to establish that the customer is still alive and to try to prevent situations of continuing encashment of payments after the customer, who had legitimate entitlement, is deceased.</p><p>I understand that the particular project to which the Senator refers was being carried out in preparation for the transition to the new free travel variant of the public services card.  It entailed reviewing around 8,500 cases where it appeared from the Department's systems that the free travel entitlement for certain clients had ceased.  That is to say, on checking all available Department payment systems, the customer was not on a qualifying scheme and had not an underlying entitlement to free travel.  In this specific exercise, it appears that correspondence was sent in error in respect of a very small number of deceased persons.</p><p>The Department of Social Protection now relies heavily on the register of deaths in the General Register Office.  However, the computerised register of deaths only came into existence in 2003.  The data is downloaded every night from the GRO and then runs against their systems.  Where the system finds a direct match the payment systems are updated accordingly.  Partial matches are referred to the data quality management unit in the Department for further follow up.  I know the Senator will appreciate that this follow up work, of its nature, is difficult and can also be very sensitive.</p><p>However, it is important to note that in the following circumstances, and while accessing the GRO information, the Department might still not be aware that a customer is deceased if the death occurred prior to computerisation of the register in 2003, or had not been registered, or had occurred abroad, including in Northern Ireland.  In addition, the system would not pick up that death had occurred if incorrect information was provided at the time of registration of the death, or if forenames or surnames were different in format to that used by the customer when applying to the Department under a particular scheme.</p><p>Finally, the Minister wants me to assure the Senator that the Department does all that is reasonably possible to try to minimise such occurrences and it is regrettable when they do occur. Protocols are continually being reviewed to ensure that such unfortunate instances are minimised.  Again, the Minister apologises most sincerely for any distress which such occurrences have caused to the relatives.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that the Minister is sincere in her endeavours in this area.  The point of this matter on the Adjournment is that decisive action is required at the time of the issue of a death certificate.  There needs to be very strict protocols so that as soon as a death certificate is issued, the Department of Social Protection is informed immediately and all sections are made aware of the deceased person's name, address and PPS, in order that no further correspondence be issued to the person.</p><p>I do not think anybody has a problem with correspondence that would issue within a week of somebody passing away, or even a month.  However, it is understandable that people would be distressed to receive correspondence 11 years after somebody's death from a Department about an entitlement.  I know that the Minister is not directly responsible for this, but there is a moral requirement on everybody, particularly those in Departments who issue correspondence, such as the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Justice and Equality and the Revenue Commissioners, to ensure that we are not writing to people who are deceased.  I again thank the Minister of State for his reply and I know he is genuine about this and understands why I tabled this Adjournment matter.</p></speech>

I appreciate everything he said and I will bring his comments directly to the attention of the Minister.  I apologise once again on behalf of the Minister and the Department for what happened.  We will ensure that every effort will be made so that it never happens again.</p></speech>
