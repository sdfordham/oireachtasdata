    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-12-06a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1382" speakername="Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016120600002#B00300"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House to discuss this Commencement matter, which relates to the Irish greyhound industry.  I wish to question the <i>modus operandi</i>of the Irish Greyhound Board, which is in receipt of a taxpayer subsidy of &euro;285,000 per week this year.  However, its level of communication with and flow of information to the Irish Greyhound Owners And Breeders Federation, which represents the owners and breeders of greyhounds in this country, is abysmal and shocking to say the least.</p><p>This is an ongoing issue.  I could talk about the greyhound industry until midnight.  It is a highly-funded industry that has had many shortcomings, some of which were addressed by the previous Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine under the Minister of State's stewardship as Chairman.  An excellent report on the greyhound industry was produced and is available in the Oireachtas Library for all Members to read.  The report highlights the significant shortcomings of the industry, particularly regarding corporate governance of the Irish Greyhound Board, the drugs issue and the need for new legislation to be brought forward to deal with transparency in the sector.</p><p>The most recent report, which was commissioned by the Irish Greyhound Board, was on anti-doping and the medication review, the findings of which are alarming.  The report was published last summer and it highlights the shortcomings of the Irish Greyhound Board in dealing with the drugs issue in Irish greyhound racing.</p><p>This is a sector of huge significance to many people throughout the country.  The greyhound is often referred to as the poor man's horse.  This is a wonderful industry and it deserves to be supported by the State.  The industry is being significantly supported by the State but, unfortunately, it appears that it continues to lose money.  The State agency involved refuses to engage with the breeders and owners of greyhounds.  That is shocking, alarming and unacceptable.</p><p>The Minister of State was probably given the line today by the Irish Greyhound Board that a forum has been established to deal with all of these concerns but, unfortunately, the breeders and the owners have no confidence in that forum.  They have made a decision not to be part of it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2261"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2261&amp;amp;pid=BrianODomhnaill&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There may be questions around that.  I believe the reason the breeder and owners have done that is because they want to keep their own integrity.  Given the fact the chairman of the Irish Greyhound Board, IGB, is also the chairman of the forum, it would appear the forum is dining <i>&agrave; la carte</i>as to who is on it and who comes before it.<br/><br/>If questions have been raised by the industry - they have not been made up by me here today - then they have to be addressed.  The only way to address them is through proper and meaningful legislation.  To be fair, this was dealt with by the then Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, with the Horse Racing Ireland legislation in the previous Oireachtas.  The Minister of State, Deputy Andrew Doyle, has written to me recently about his own efforts to bring in legislation for the greyhound industry.  I cannot emphasise enough, however, the need to do this quickly to save this great industry from its near collapse and to secure its future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-12-06a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1356" speakername="Andrew Doyle" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016120600002#C00200"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  I agree it is critically important that Bord na gCon seeks to interface with representative bodies for the sector.  With that in mind, Bord na gCon recently established the national greyhound consultative forum, bringing all stakeholders together on a wide variety of greyhound related matters, including anti-doping and medication control.</p> <p>The first meeting of the forum was hosted by the board and the executive of Bord na gCon on 15 March 2016 with representatives from a cross-section of groups.  I understand from Bord na gCon that representative groups are invited to the forum on the basis that they are mandated to represent their members.  Several matters were discussed, including proposals for the allocation of additional funding, the SIS TV contract, the breeder incentive scheme and public trainer funding.</p> <p>The second meeting of the national greyhound forum took place on 14 July 2016.  I was in attendance at the most recent meeting of the forum on 10 November 2016, together with a cross-section of stakeholders and members of the board and executive of Bord na gCon.  The meeting lasted three and a half hours and a legal representative from the Department was with to me to discuss the heads of the proposed Bill for the greyhound sector.  The meeting was informative with a frank and interesting exchange of views.  For my part, I provided an outline of the proposed measures in the new Bill, the chief executive officer provided a brief update on progress on the implementation of the Indecon and Morris reports while other attendees contributed to discussions on a range of topics, including welfare, the Harold's Cross stadium and Brexit.</p> <p>As the controlling body of several greyhound owners and breeders associations, the Irish Greyhound Owners and Breeders Federation, IGOBF, has been invited to the forum to represent those affiliations.  Other groups, including but not limited to greyhound owners and breeders associations which are no longer affiliated to the IGOBF, have also been included on the same basis.  The other groups invited included Greyhound Racing Integrity Ireland, the Greyhound Group, the Trainers Association, Limerick and Clare Greyhound Owners and Breeders Association, stud keepers and private stadia general managers.</p> <p>We are about to embark on the publication of the heads of a new Bill for the greyhound sector.  The new Bill presents an opportunity for all stakeholders to act as a collective group and move forwards in the interests of the greyhound industry.  There are common goals shared by all stakeholders such as to improve welfare, to tackle the use of prohibited substances and invigorate greyhound racing.  There will be an opportunity for representatives from various interested parties to make presentations to the Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine when the pre-legislative scrutiny phase of the legislation begins, like what happened with the Horse Racing Ireland legislation.  This will be an opportune time to contribute to the creation of the best and most enduring legislation possible which will empower and future-proof the industry.  I sincerely hope the various representative groups can come together and cohere their efforts in the context of that exercise.</p> <p>In broad terms, the new Bill seeks to address the deficiencies in the existing legislation, which dates back to 1958, as identified in the Indecon report, by the Joint Committee on Agriculture. Food and the Marine and the Morris report.  It addresses the governance of Bord na gCon, strengthens regulatory controls in the industry, modernises sanctions and improves integrity with a view to building a reputation for exceptional regulation in the sector.  An improved reputation will instil confidence in the industry and attract larger sponsorship which will, in turn, revitalise the industry.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Andrew Doyle:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2170"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2170&amp;amp;pid=AndrewDoyle&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> The heads of the new Bill have been drafted and will shortly be presented to Government - I am hoping to get them in to the Government before the Christmas break - and then to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine for pre-legislative scrutiny.  I look forward to the continued joint efforts to modernise the Greyhound Industry Act 1958 so as to provide the strongest possible statutory regulatory response, in particular, to medication control and anti-doping.</p><p>I believe that the new Bill will strengthen the Irish greyhound industry, enable it to deal with the existing challenges and maximise its future potential.</p><p>In spite of recent difficulties in the sector, I am, nonetheless, confident that the greyhound sector has tremendous growth potential, with sporting, leisure, tourism and cultural appeal across a wide national demographic.  However, in order for the sector to realise its full potential, it is imperative that all stakeholders work together towards this common goal and maximise the contribution of the sector to the Irish economy and to the social and cultural fabric of this country.  For its part, Bord na gCon has assured me that it will continue to prioritise relationships with its key regulatory partners and the wider greyhound bodies in the pursuit of policies to benefit the sector at large.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-12-06a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1373" speakername="Keith Swanick" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016120600002#D00700"><p>I thank the Cathaoirleach and welcome the Minister.</p> <p>In this morning's headlines, there is an unfortunate and heart-breaking story of an elderly man in County Armagh who has passed away as a result of suspected carbon monoxide poisoning.  This devastation has been made all the more tragic by the fact that this was another utterly preventable death.</p> <p>At the end of September, during carbon monoxide awareness week, I raised the issue of local authorities' obligation to play a role in this silent killer.  In Ireland, six people on average die unnecessarily from carbon monoxide poisoning each year.  A 2015 study found that 1.2 million are currently living in houses without carbon monoxide alarms, including 100,000 people over the age of 65 who live alone.  Furthermore, almost half of these people do not even know where to purchase a carbon monoxide alarm.</p> <p>After I raised this matter here in the Seanad, I wrote to the chief executive of each county and city council asking them to provide, in tabular form, the number of local authority houses they have and the number of those the boilers of which they have serviced in 2014 and 2015.  The responses varied greatly.  Some local authorities did not reply at all, some simply provided the figures of the number of boilers they serviced and others stated that it was not their responsibility.  As the largest landlord in the State, I strongly believe clarification is needed in regard to local authority housing and I would ask the Minister, Deputy Naughten, whether he is in agreement with the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, that there is no requirement to carry out an annual service on home heating boilers.</p> <p>Today, I also want to highlight radon, a radioactive colourless odourless tasteless gas occurring naturally as a decay product of radium.  Radon is the leading cause of lung cancer after smoking and it is responsible for up to 250 lung cancer cases in Ireland every year.  My party colleague, Councillor David Costello of Dublin City Council, brought this serious concern to my attention, and while almost every household in Ireland is familiar with carbon monoxide and its effects, not too many are familiar with or respect the harmfulness of radon gas.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Keith Swanick:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2459"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2459&amp;amp;pid=KeithSwanick&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Last week, the EPA reported radon levels 24 times the accepted level in a house in County Wicklow.  That is the equivalent of 17 chest X-rays every day.  Currently, the agency provides a testing service for radon gas in the home, which costs &euro;50, a not insignificant cost for low-income families given the financial constraints of the past decade.  However, the real cost kicks in when a house is determined to have high levels of radon following testing.  If it is found to have a high level for radon, which is a cancer-causing gas, the EPA will advise the carrying out of remediation works, which can cost between &euro;500 and &euro;12,000 and can achieve a reduction of up to 98%, depending on how much is spent.  There is no grant available to alleviate the cost of remediation.  The Government is ignoring the International Atomic Energy Agency report by not providing remediation grants.</p><p>The home renovation incentive scheme allows homeowners and landlords to qualify for tax credits equal to 13.5% of the cost of renovation, repair or improvement works.  The scheme covers work needed to reduce radon levels in the home but the household needs to spend at least &euro;5,000 to qualify for the scheme, which rules out most remediation works below this threshold.  The over-65s may be eligible for a grant to have the work carried out under the housing aid for older people scheme but this is at the discretion of individual local authorities.  There is no consistency and there is no rhyme or reason to provision.  Some of the most vulnerable members of society are eligible for funds to carry out remedial works while others are not.</p><p>We need to address these silent killers, ensure compliance with boiler servicing to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning and demand a remediation incentive for dealing with radon gas with consistency in its allocation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-12-06a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016120600002#E00200"><p>I thank Senator Swanick for the opportunity to address this issue.</p><p>Carbon monoxide is a poisonous gas which is produced when fossil fuels such as coal, wood, petrol, oil or gas do not have enough oxygen to burn completely.  Unlike radon gas, carbon monoxide is produced when fuels are burned and can be produced in homes with poor ventilation, blocked chimneys or damaged appliances.  It was brought home to us by the tragedy on the Mayo-Sligo border a number of years ago.  Raising public awareness of this domestic threat is a key element in dealing with the issue and my Department, together with a range of industry partners led by Gas Networks Ireland, has initiated a range of public awareness campaigns over the past several years.  These are centred on an annual carbon monoxide awareness week, which I was happy to launch on 28 September this year.  The campaign is vital to inform and educate all of us in order that we can make changes in our everyday lives and minimise risk before it is too late.  The impact and effect of carbon monoxide awareness week in previous years has shown that people take more notice when there is a sustained campaign of broad scope.  Home ownership of carbon monoxide alarms increased from 25% in July 2014 to 53% in October 2016.  My Department and the regulator are sponsors, as are members of the energy industry, which do great work in getting safety information out to their customers.  The National Standards Authority of Ireland, alarm manufacturers and suppliers, together with registered gas installers and oil technicians, are all involved as well.  The awareness campaign takes place at the end of September when most of us are increasing fuel use and this is supported with a dedicated website,<i>www.carbonmonoxide.ie</i>, which provides safety precautions advice on appliances and contact details.</p><p>The Senator commented on local authorities carrying out annual services on boilers and I am happy to engage further with him on the survey he has completed and the response he received from local authorities.  Taking off my energy hat and putting on my climate change hat, it is important that all boilers are serviced on an annual basis because that improves their efficiency, reduces the fuel burned and, as a consequence, reduces the bill for consumers.  We should make sure that the boilers of people living in low-income households and in local authority housing are operating as efficiently as possible.</p><p>Radon is a lung carcinogen and is linked to five cancer diagnoses per week.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Denis Naughten:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=809"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=809&amp;amp;pid=DenisNaughten&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is a serious public health hazard.  It can only be measured with special detectors and produces radioactive particles when inhaled.  These particles are deposited on the airwaves and result in a radiation dose on a person's lungs.  It is the second biggest causer of lung cancer after smoking and is the leading cause of lung cancer in non-smokers.<br/><br/>We have a national radon control strategy that is targeting the improvement in standards in building regulations, which have been revised since 1998 and which have had a direct impact on improving the standards of homes across the country.  Some of the key measures set out in the national radon control strategy are: the installation of passive preventative measures in new buildings; the use of property transactions - sales and rentals - to drive action on radon; raising radon awareness and encouraging individual action on radon; provision of advice and guidance for individual householders and employers in high radon areas; promoting confidence in radon services; and addressing radon in workplaces and public buildings.  This is a matter of which I am very conscious, particularly in the context of places such as Ballintober, County Roscommon, and Fohanagh-Ahascragh in east Galway that have been listed as &quot;red&quot; by the Environmental Protection Agency, which means there is potential for high radon gas levels.  The Senator's part of the country, Ballina, is a hot spot for radon gas.  We need to raise awareness, particularly in those communities, and we need to do more to encourage people to test for radon gas and put supports in place to carry out remedial action.<br/><br/>To date, of the homes that have been tested, 700  have shown raised radon levels and 80 of those have extremely high radon levels.  Based on the national radon survey, it is estimated that approximately 110,000 homes across Ireland have radon concentrations above Ireland's threshold limit of 200 Bq/m<sup>3</sup>.  That means we have identified less than 1% of the total number of households.  There is a European radon awareness day and a website, <i>radon.ie</i>.  We use the conveyancing mechanism of the legal profession to try to identify radon when properties are being transferred.  We are now working with the Department of Education and Skills to determine what actions can be taken under the scheme to support schools on the maintenance and remedial systems that can be put in place.  The EPA has also engaged bilaterally with Tusla on how best to increase awareness and promote action amongst relevant agencies and cr&egrave;che owners.  Next year there will be a roll-out of a campaign with Tusla inspectors and voluntary organisations.  There has been a programme of radon testing, particularly with older people.  The Senator touched on the housing aid for older people scheme, which can be used for that.  There is also the home renovation incentive scheme which is of benefit to some families.  We are actively looking at other incentives to facilitate and encourage radon testing.  There are proposals before me at the moment to consider the introduction of financial incentives.  If the Senator or the industry have any thoughts or suggestions on this matter, I would be very happy to hear from them.</p></speech>

As he is aware, in September the Brazilian tax authorities issued normative instruction 1658/2016, adding Ireland to its list of designated tax havens also known as the blacklist.  The change came into effect on 1 October.  Ireland joins the illustrious company of states such as Panama, Monaco and the Isle of Man on the blacklist and, needless to say, such classification is damaging to our international reputation.  The category that includes Ireland has countries that have no tax, that hide banking or trade information or that have a corporate income tax rate of less than 20%.  This is unwelcome news, considering the increased international scrutiny this year already as a result of the Apple tax ruling and the startling GDP results.  With Brazil being one of the top ten economies in the world, this is seriously problematic for the Ireland-Brazil trading relationship and poses significant challenges to Irish exporters, particularly in the post-Brexit world.</p> <p>Any transactions involving entities resident in Ireland are now subject to greater Brazilian tax regulation, including mandatory transfer pricing rules for any transaction involving goods, services and rights, even if between non-related parties; stricter thin capitalisation rules; stricter tax deductibility rules that require detailed identification of the effective beneficiary of payments made; and the fact that transactions with entities resident in countries on the blacklist are subject to increased holding taxes of 25% instead of the regular level of 15%.  The ruling has particular effect on three key areas where Ireland and Irish companies in particular have a strong strategic interest, namely aircraft leasing, agriculture and insurance.</p> <p>Over 60% of commercial aircraft in Brazil are leased through Ireland and the country has, rightly, developed a reputation as the international hub for aircraft leasing.  This decision, if it is not reversed, will likely have a negative effect on this area.  The European Union is currently preparing details of a trade deal with Brazil and the wider Mercosur region.  While offering potential benefits, this deal is of particular concern to the Irish beef industry.  This recent ruling will greatly undermine Ireland's negotiation stance entering these talks.  The ruling is also having major effects on the insurance sector, where there are a number of Irish companies active in Brazil.  They are unable to enter any new business while contracts with an automatic renewal clause can only be renewed for one more year as of the suspension date.</p> <p>I am aware that the Irish ambassador to Brazil met representatives of the Brazilian revenue service to refute these allegations and seek Ireland's removal from the blacklist.  A formal request for Ireland to be removed from the Brazilian list was submitted on 27 September.  However, it appears there has been no official response as of yet from the Brazilian authorities to our request to be removed from this blacklist.  For the reasons outlined, it is imperative this is changed as soon as possible.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Noonan, and I were surprised and disappointed to learn in September that the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service had, without warning, added Ireland to Brazil's tax blacklist.  The operation of the listing was initially backdated to 1 August but it was subsequently suspended until 1 October.  No notice of this decision was given to the Irish Government by the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service and no explanation was received as to why Ireland has been included on the list.</p> <p>Being included on the list has a number of negative consequences, including greater Brazilian taxation on flows of income from Brazil to Ireland.  Since the listing was published, we have sought to engage with Brazilian revenue to seek Ireland's removal from the list.  The Irish ambassador to Brazil is leading our engagement with the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service, doing a fantastic job on behalf of the Government.  Officials from the Department of Finance and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade are in close contact with the ambassador and supporting these efforts.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Eoghan Murphy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2288"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2288&amp;amp;pid=EoghanMurphy&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Senior officials from both Departments have also held meetings with the Brazilian ambassador to Ireland to express our concern with being included on the Brazilian list.</p><p>A formal request for Ireland to be removed from the Brazilian list was submitted to the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service on 27 September.  The request also sought for the listing to be suspended to allow technical discussions to take place between officials.  The request remained under consideration by the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service until we received a response on 17 November. </p><p>While the request was still under consideration, the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service made some changes to the operation of the listing.  These changes were designed to remove the aviation sector from the scope of taxes imposed as a result of the listing.  The change means that withholding tax is not included on the payment of aircraft lease rentals from Brazilian airlines to Irish aircraft leasing companies.</p><p>Unfortunately, the reply from the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service on 17 November rejected our request for the listing to be suspended.  Following follow-up discussions, the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service has agreed to meet a technical delegation from the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners to discuss the issue further.  The Irish ambassador in Brazil is now working on scheduling a meeting as soon as possible.  I was in contact with him on Friday of last week on two separate occasions discussing this issue to see what kind of timeline we can have for those meetings to go forward as quickly as possible.</p><p>The response received from the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service makes it clear that Ireland was included on the list because our statutory rate of corporation tax is below 17%, which is the benchmark set under Brazilian law.  In our formal submission to Brazil we highlighted that Ireland has a 25% corporation tax rate on passive income and a 33% rate on chargeable gains.  We also stressed that the 12.5% rate has been settled policy in Ireland since 2003 and that Ireland's corporation tax take has typically been very close to the EU and OECD averages, both in terms of corporate tax as a percentage of GDP and in terms of corporation tax as a percentage of total tax revenue.  We believe it is inappropriate to include Ireland on a blacklist simply because we apply a low tax rate to a wide tax base, which is fully in line with recommended OECD best practice.  We remain hopeful that discussions between the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service and Irish officials will enable us to fully explain our corporate tax system and, hopefully, see Ireland removed from the Brazilian list. </p><p>I should add that the response received from Brazil on 17 November makes it clear that Brazil does not consider Ireland to be a tax haven.  I strongly reject allegations that we are a tax haven.  Ireland does not meet any of the international standards for being considered a tax haven.  Ireland is fully compliant with all international best practice in the areas of tax transparency and exchange of information.  Ireland's corporate tax policies are designed to attract real and substantive operations to Ireland.  Ireland has not been and will never be a brassplate location.  Ireland only has and wants real substantive foreign direct investment, the kind that brings real jobs and investment.    </p><p>Ireland is an active participant in global work to reform the international corporate tax system.  We have implemented country-by-country reporting, agreed the anti-tax avoidance directive and are working towards the implementation of the remaining OECD base erosion and profit sharing, BEPS, recommendations both domestically and internationally.  On budget day the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, published an update on Ireland's international tax strategy that highlights our continuing efforts in this regard.</p></speech>

Public libraries have been the focal point for many communities in Ireland for more than 100 years and have been used as a safe haven for schoolgoers, college students, the elderly, the homeless and active retired people.  The friendly and professional staff in our libraries have formed part of the social fabric of many communities with many movements and community organisations having started life in the public library setting.  The move towards staffless libraries is a bad one for the country.  The schemes have been rolled out in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Offaly and Sligo have been rightfully met with discontent by members of the community and staff.  It is understood that 12 and possibly more counties plan to introduce staffless libraries.  This move should be blocked and discouraged.</p> <p>Statistics for the staffless libraries in Offaly and Sligo show that the use of the library is down when no staff are present.  Many vulnerable members of our community may be less willing to use a staffless library because of safety concerns.  Having friendly and experienced staff in a library tends to create a non-threatening community space that all can enjoy without fear or anguish.  Any savings that may be created will be diminished by the decreased use of public libraries and the loss of the innumerable hidden gains that staffed libraries provide.</p> <p>In a move towards less face-to-face contact in libraries, banks and other front-line services, it is understood that the area office in Crumlin village will also be closing.  This is a very distressing move for members of the community who rely on many of the services provided by Dublin City Council, with other area offices around the city closing also.  Less face-to-face contact with service users will make this a more insular society and create even more social problems at a higher cost to the Exchequer.</p></speech>

In the last couple of days, I received correspondence from a Ms Emma Kennedy, suggesting that the State is making what she considers to be a major mistake in commissioning the Dublin-Shannon pipeline.  Her thesis, which is an elaborate one, is that Dublin aquifers and underground water sources would be quite adequate to serve the city of Dublin.  The point she is making in her report, which she has sent to some Members of the House and to the Taoiseach, is that the total expenditure on this Shannon-Dublin pipe system would be of the order of &euro;1.2 billion.  Her thesis is that there is plenty of subterranean water in Dublin and plenty of sources in Dublin to make the pipeline redundant and to service Dublin's projected needs for water much closer to the city.</p> <p>As far as she is concerned, the data on which the Shannon-Dublin water project was decided are faulty and the analysis underlying it is faulty as well.  I am fully in favour of getting ahead with infrastructure if it is the right option.  However, the Houses have not debated whether or not this thesis of there being plenty of water available in the Dublin region through using different technology to extract it from the earth has been adequately examined.  I ask the Leader to ask the Minister with responsibility for this to make himself available to discuss this issue with the House.  That is not the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, but it is the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, because the water issue was given to his Department.</p> <p>It is a huge piece of infrastructure.  It will cost &euro;1.2 billion.  If it has to be done, I am fully in favour of it.  However, if there is a significantly cheaper alternative, I believe that somebody in this House or the other House should raise the issue of whether we are making a mistake here, bearing in mind the information that has been furnished to Members of this House.  I ask the Leader to ask the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to come to this House to brief us on whether it is the case that the Shannon-Dublin water main idea has been fully considered in light of alternatives, including aquifers closer to the city of Dublin.</p></speech>

I want to recognise that there has been a temporary reprieve in the Inis M&oacute;r ferry service scenario, but there really needs to be a knuckling down now to make sure that it is settled on a longer-term basis.</p> <p>I concur with the sentiments of Senator Ardagh on staffless libraries.  We had a presentation in the AV room on that issue two weeks ago.  I concur completely with the Senator that we do need a debate, and I think I called for it at the time, on the role of our library services and how they are going to be impacted by the staffless library system.</p> <p>I cautiously welcome the announcement by the Minister, Deputy Naughten, on bin charges.  This House can take credit for the bin charges being kicked to touch for six months, due to issues that we raised here in a number of debates with the Minister, Deputy Coveney.  I do not believe that kicking it into touch for six months is the best scenario, however.  Going into the summer period, we will have issues with bags and dumping, particularly in tourist areas where bags cannot be bought and tourists will not know where to dispose of their refuse.  There are also still issues in some areas with monopoly scenarios being run by some companies.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2363"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2363&amp;amp;pid=TrevorOClochartaigh&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is a lack of consistency in pricing policy throughout the country.

However, it would be a good idea for this House to have another debate on bin charges, with the Minister, Deputy Naughten, as opposed to waiting another six months to see how this issue can be resolved and to put forward positive proposals.</p><p>At this time of year, many of us will go to Christmas parties and restaurants but I have been contacted by a number of workers in the hospitality sector, particularly in Galway, who are being abused within that sector.  I am hearing of cases of verbal abuse and payment and tips being withheld.  I am also hearing of cases of sexual harassment and sexual abuse that go unreported.  People are afraid to report them in case they get sacked.  Those in temporary employment arrangements certainly find it difficult to do that.  There are two sides to the hospitality sector.  It is positive to see the improvements in the sector but we need to examine the workers' rights issues relating to it.  I am of the view that it would be useful to have a debate on the abuse of workers in the hospitality sector in which we could examine all the issues.  I would look to raise more such issues during that debate.</p></speech>

The event was called Tallaght Talks and the emphasis was on mental health issues.  There were a number of great speakers present on the day but what had the greatest impact on me was the response from the people attending the event, which was very emotional.  One man shared his experience of depression.  He spoke about how difficult life is for him and how he might not make it to Christmas because he felt so low and that he might end up taking his own life.  His story was one of many.  Another woman pleaded for help because so many of her family have died by suicide.  One young lad asked how he could support a friend who had lost a loved one to suicide.  There were numerous stories like that on the day.</p> <p>The overwhelming feeling in the room was one of abandonment and lack of support services.  People felt unrepresented by the Government.  In recent years, communities were being commended on their contribution to the country by suffering the austerity measures imposed on them.  The advice at that time was that everybody had to tighten their belts in order that we might get over this crisis.  The old saying "No pain, no gain" was put forward.  The people in the room on Saturday had felt the pain of austerity and had not benefited from any gain.  They were not looking for gain in any selfish way but in the form of proper support for the less well off in the community.  They felt totally abandoned.</p> <p>Suicide is one of the major problems facing society.  The reports that 16 people died by suicide in Cork county in a two-week period should ensure that all party-political concerns are put aside and that a concerted effort is made to tackle this issue by means of the provision of all the necessary supports.  I ask the Leader why a state of emergency has not been declared in order to support the thousands of people who are struggling with mental health issues and who believe they have nowhere to turn to for support, the families who have lost loved ones to suicide and the large number of children who will be homeless this Christmas.  People do not see any urgency in tackling the problem of suicide and they are disillusioned with a system which continually refers to tackling the homelessness issue but which will not introduce rent certainty.  The less well off in society need to be a priority.  It should be a case of looking after those people first and putting their needs before those of any vested interests.  Our society should be judged on how we look after our poorest, not on how the rich are getting even richer.</p></speech>

I am pleased to see that Fine Gael is not engaging expensive media monitoring firms because when I was on "The Pat Kenny Show" this morning, Senator Buttimer engaged by tweeting a very welcome comment.  I acknowledge his role in terms of making Ireland a more equal society.  I congratulate him on that and I hope we will have Government support for the legislation when it is introduced and debated here in January.</p> <p>On more mundane matters, last Friday morning, staff at the SuperValu store in Drogheda showed up for work as normal but they were locked out of the premises and the doors were closed for good.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerald Nash:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2281"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2281&amp;amp;pid=GeraldNash&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Out of the blue, the company, which ran this particular store for more than 20 years, ceased trading.  Almost 30 staff, some of whom worked there for almost 20 years, have been left without work this side of Christmas.</p><p>We know businesses fail every day.  We all feel a sense of sorrow when businesses do fail and people are let go.  Nobody puts more work into a business than the business owners themselves.  However, this is a tragedy for everyone involved.  When a firm is careering towards insolvency, is in difficult trading circumstances and ends up being liquidated, everyone will agree there are better ways to treat staff than to merely shut the door in their faces and leave them depending on statutory redundancy at the expense of the taxpayer.  In a normal collective redundancy scenario where a business fails, there is a requirement on the employer to engage in a 30-day consultation process with employees to discuss enhanced redundancy packages and so on.  No such requirement falls on a business owner where his or her business ceases trading and goes into liquidation.  When the Drogheda SuperValus of this world decide they are going to close their doors, it is the State which is on the hook for the payments.</p><p>There is a solution to this.  After the Clerys scandal, I worked closely to engage with experts to understand how the law could be changed to better protect workers in insolvency situations like that.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has an expert report, the Duffy-Cahill review, on this.  It was initiated by me and developed by Kevin Duffy, former chair of the Labour Court, and an expert company lawyer, Nessa Cahill, to identify ways in which workers could be better protected in scenarios like this.  The Minister has been sitting on this report, however.  The public consultation on the report has concluded, yet we see staff in SuperValu in Drogheda and Pumpkin Patch in Blanchardstown and Liffey Valley shopping centres experience the loss of their jobs last Friday as the doors of their companies were closed in their faces.</p><p>There is a better and fairer way of doing this.  It is high time the Minister introduced legislation to give effect to the proposals in the Duffy-Cahill report to better protect workers in insolvency scenarios.</p></speech>

This motion pertains to the investment by the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, and the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund in equity holdings in three separate tobacco companies.</p> <p>Smoking is the leading cause of preventable deaths in this country.  As Professor Luke Clancy said, it is unconscionable to think that the State would invest taxpayers' money in the tobacco industry and contribute to its commercial viability.  I formally wrote to the Minister for Finance over six weeks ago about this issue.  Since then, 500 people have died from smoking-related illnesses.  I also have had constructive dialogue with non-governmental organisations such as the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, the Irish Heart Foundation, the Irish Cancer Society and ASH Ireland.</p> <p>Smoking-related illnesses cost over &euro;500 million a year to the health care system with up to 6,000 people dying because of them.  It is estimated there are 31,000 hospital admissions due to smoking-related diseases every year.  Each admission costs &euro;5,400, which comes to an approximate cost of &euro;170 million per year.  It is an important issue.  I had prepared legislation in this regard.  Unfortunately, because of the constitutional constraints of the House, I was unable to push that legislation.  My colleague, Deputy Sean Fleming, will be taking this up in the Lower House.</p></speech>

Following the tragic preventable deaths of infant babies in this hospital over the past number of years, HIQA produced a report setting out hundreds of recommendations to restore safe and quality services.  An updated report, published in the past few days, stated that some progress had been made but there remain serious concerns in relation to the provision of services there.  The hospital is dangerously understaffed and there is a distinct problem recruiting non-consultant doctors and midwives.  Given the tragedies that occurred in this hospital, it is shocking that there are still only 32 midwives working in the maternity area where there should be 52.  This is indefensible and the Government, along with the Department of Health, has to take full responsibility for it.</p> <p>Listening to the response of the CEO of the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group was alarming to say the least.  Stating the updated report contained no surprises and was balanced and fair, while making comparisons to other hospitals nationally which face similar challenges, simply does not cut it.  This attitude is almost accepting defeat and will also accept the inevitable tragedies that occur into the future at this troubled hospital unless determined leadership is shown and a clear long-term strategy is put in place.  The uncertain future of Portlaoise hospital is compounding the problems with rumours and counter-rumours leading to recruitment issues and low morale among existing staff.  I am calling on the Minister, Deputy Harris, to publish the action plan for the hospital which has been submitted to his Department to ensure that the services in the hospital are sufficiently staffed to prevent further tragedies and to make a statement to this House confirming how and when the problems in the hospital will be rectified for the safety of mothers and babies.</p></speech>

Pardon me.  Dare I say, it was a senior moment.</p> <p>Senator McDowell raised an interesting point about aquifers.  I would like to see that report and consider its accuracy.  We have had a lot of discussion about that in north County Dublin where there is a large aquifer but the information I had at the time was that it certainly would not be sufficient on its own to supply the requirements.  Nonetheless, the Senator's point is well made.</p> <p>I endorse and support Senator Swanick's request for a motion.  This is an area that I have been very interested in for quite some time.  I raised it with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, when I was Minister for Health and subsequently again, if memory serves, as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  I have written to the Minister more recently to find out what is the up-to-date position.  In fairness to the Minister, at that time the moneys concerned were quite small and he certainly intimated to me that there would be an orderly wind down of any investments in the tobacco industry.  I believe it is questionable to have investments, as such, with an industry that has caused so much misery, hardship, hurt, harm and death right across the globe.</p></speech>

It goes on to state that if they do not co-operate, the Minister will extend the boundary into Roscommon.  That is the threat in this report and I want to see that threat withdrawn.  I want the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government to come to this House and state categorically that Bellanamullia-Monksland will remain an integral part of County Roscommon.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Terry Leyden:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=636"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=636&amp;amp;pid=TerryLeyden&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is a case to be made for naming the area as Monkstown or another suitable name and to turn the area into a town as opposed to a townland, which would give it more authority.

It would be more practical to extend the Roscommon boundary to the River Shannon, which is the natural boundary between the west and the east.  Part of Athlone on the western side of the river is in Connacht whereas the other side is in Leinster.  I am happy to retain what we have and not to make any grab for Westmeath but I would like a debate on this.  If the Minister will not come to the House, I will seek a Commencement matter debate in this regard.  The fight continues.

It was UN International Day of Persons with Disabilities.  The Minister of State with responsibilities for disabilities, Deputy Finian McGrath, said the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities will not be ratified by the end of the year.  Every party and political entity that took part in the general election was insistent that the convention would be ratified by the end of the year or as quickly as possible.  In November of last year, the outgoing Administration committed to having it done by the end of this year.  The commitment is in the programme for Government.  Last June, the Minister of State, in reply to a Commencement matter I tabled, confirmed that it would be ratified by the end of the year, which would be important to trigger the road to progressive implementation.  It is a serious matter for 600,000 people with disabilities, 200,000 carers and their families.  I expect the Taoiseach to come to the House as soon as possible to explain what is the position.  We are told there are backlogs with regard to legislation.</p> <p>At the end of 2016, 100 years from a particular event, are those people not valued children in this nation?  Surely, ratification should have been undertaken.  Priorities continue to slip and change.

A detailed report of at least one alleged instance where a red deer stag was shot by a hunter tourist who paid thousands of euro to a commercial company for the experience has been made to the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  The stag was shot out of season under a permit issued to a landowner under strict conditions, which was allegedly obtained by a commercial company.  That is a serious matter, if it is true.  If any culling is to be done, it should only be of the non-indigenous sika species and not red deer.  Only aged or infirm red deer should be culled.

The Killarney red is a subset of the red deer and, as the Senator said, is an internationally protected species.  It appears one can now get a licence to shoot them for the sum of &euro;5,000.  I do not know how exactly this developed.  It seems that the only people who are entitled to shoot deer are the forestry and wildlife people for appropriate reasons.  This is a new departure altogether.  It is an offence to hunt, stalk and shoot these deer.  It is reprehensible that wealthy Americans - in this case - can come over and shoot these deer to stuff them or, even worse, to cut their heads off and mount them on the walls of their dens, drawing rooms or clubhouses.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, should come to the House and speak to us about this issue, tell us how this occurred and reassure us about what she will do to make sure it does not happen again.  She should assure us that if these people are breaking the law, no matter how wealthy they are, they will be subject to the rigours of the law.</p> <p>I have not had a chance to digest the statement that issued from Cabinet this morning on the pay-per-weight bin charges but I am somewhat concerned about what I have picked up on.  I want the Leader to know that in Kerry we have been operating a pay-by-weight system for refuse collection for quite some time.  It is very successful.  My gut instinct is that Government is stepping back because of the debacle over water charges.  No party has come out of it with any kudos.  All the main political parties have succeeded in making a bunch of extreme Trotskyites look good.  People who think it is good politics to lock two defenceless women into a car for four hours are looking good now because of the way we have handled water charges.  I presume the Minister is afraid the bin charges will go the same way.  I say this as a taxpayer on behalf of middle Ireland and the coping classes.  I do not mind those who cannot pay but we will be paying for those who will not pay.  Will we now be paying the bin charges and the refuge charges again for those who will not pay?  Undergraduate politicians with megaphones are going around shouting down the people and it is very worrying.</p></speech>

There appears to be a resolution to that protest and the permission to finish the pipelines has not been granted.  There are, however, many concerns among the Native American tribe because of the President-elect and his associations with the company responsible, and the resolution may be short-lived.</p><p>In this country we know the importance of environmental indigenous heritage sites and the danger that a capitalist agenda partnered with a compliant government can pose to such sites.  Through the Leader I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, when he is engaged with colleagues in the United States, to ensure that Ireland's voice is very clearly heard in support of those people standing in defence of Standing Rock.  He should ensure a message of solidarity and support for the Sioux tribe there goes from this Chamber.</p></speech>

The Minister has asked the Cabinet to remove the price cap in order that An Post can continue to carry out its five-day postal service.  Last week I sent a letter to another European country that had to go overnight and it cost me &euro;33.  An Post is under pressure but it should not be subsidised in such a way.</p> <p>I have raised the issue before at the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission of how Deputies and Senators used to get an allocation, with Deputies getting 1,200 or 1,300 pre-paid envelopes every month five or six years ago, and Senators getting much less.  I worked it out that this was less than &euro;2 million per year.  Whoever did the deal on behalf of this Parliament ten or 15 years ago got a discount of 1 cent per envelope.  In effect, we paid 54 cent in advance and got postage of 55 cent.  All the envelopes, even those which people write on, are prepaid.  They were paid for three or four years ago.</p> <p>On the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission we reduced the cost by nearly 50%.  We helped save this Parliament and taxpayers more than &euro;1 million per year.  More can be done.</p></speech>

However, I think that what has happened in Independent Newspapers is an utter and absolute disgrace.  Yesterday, I attended a protest at the O'Callaghan Alexander Hotel.  There are people who have spent decades in service of the Independent Newspaper and are within six months of receiving their pension but who have been cut off with virtually nothing.  Their pensions have been absolutely savaged.  I refer to a company that is in profit.  We have seen the case of Clerys where there was absolutely disgraceful behaviour.  Somebody had the cheek to erect a Happy Christmas sign in the window of Clerys and I felt like throwing a stone through it the other day.</p></speech>

I ask the Leader to contact the Government and ask it to produce legislation to deal with this matter.  In England, a company that is in profit is not allowed by law to walk away from its obligations to pensioners and this is what should happen in this country.</p> <p>I ask for a debate on transport, particularly in respect of the city of Dublin.  The city manager of Dublin has made the moronic suggestion that cars throughout the city should only be allowed to travel at 18.5 mph.  If that were the case, cyclists could pass cars.  The call has been made because the people in charge of Dublin City Council, formerly known as Dublin Corporation, hate motor cars.  They do everything they can to create danger all over the city and are a liability in Dublin.  I refer in particular to the spikes at the back gate of Trinity College and having two bus lanes but only one for cars on Pearse Street.  Everything is done to stop people using their cars.  Also, due to work on the Luas, the streets have been dug up all over the place.  The new Luas system was an idiotic proposal.  In the beginning, there were two separate lines that were totally unconnected and there was no spur to the airport.  I tried many times and we nearly got the powers that be to create an underground.</p> <p>I listened to Paddy Cosgrave from the Web Summit.  He was asked how the summit in Lisbon had gone and his first reply was that it was absolutely brilliant because there was an underground at the airport.  He said that the underground made the difference between Dublin and Lisbon.  Can we debate the need for an underground?  The matter has been masked.  People have placed a veil across the matter and claimed there can be no underground due to safety concerns.  That is absolute rubbish.  It is the hatred of the two principal officials of Dublin City Council for the motor car.  The real cause should be exposed as such.  Citizens have a democratic right to their motor cars, particularly people who live in the inner city like myself.  I can scarcely use my car because of so many one-way streets, areas blocked off and having bicycle this and that.  It is absolute rubbish - here's to the motor car.</p></speech>

The medals are in recognition of the role played by soldiers, sailors and Air Corps personnel in the 1916 commemorative events this year.  This presentation is very welcome and is a fitting tribute to the role played by the Defence Forces this year, one of the most important years in our history.  Throughout the year members of the Defence Forces played a vital part in many large and small events in every part of the country.  One function that stands out for most people is their involvement with the primary schools.  Teachers and parents have told me how much the students enjoyed the presence and involvement of the Defence Forces when they visited their schools.  It brought an important and serious ceremonial dimension to events.  Children, many of whom had never met Defence Forces personnel previously, were enthralled and impressed by their visitors.  We should also recall the vital and necessary functions carried out by the Defence Forces each year, including their peacekeeping activities across the globe.  Their work in humanitarian peacekeeping is a matter of global citizenship and enhances the reputation of our country.  They do their duty without the right to take industrial action and they do it willingly and without rancour or complaint.  It is fair to say that the credit they received last weekend is long overdue.  It is great to see them finally being recognised.</p><p>In addition, I welcome that the Garda Representative Association, GRA, voted yesterday to accept the Labour Court recommendation.  I understand the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, AGSI, is meeting today and I hope it follows suit.  The lesson to be learned from this sad debacle is that the closely connected Ministers should stay in touch with these unions to ensure that situations such as this do not arise in future.</p></speech>

For over a week, Fianna F&aacute;il led us to believe that its Senators would support a Sinn F&eacute;in motion urging the Government to fulfil the call of the Constitutional Convention to hold a referendum to change the Constitution and allow people from the North and the Irish diaspora to vote in the next presidential election, which is due to 2018.  I thank the Senators who supported the motion, particularly Senator Lawless who explicitly supported it.  There was great expectation that this nationally, and indeed internationally, important issue would be supported and that the motion would be carried, but at the 11th hour the leadership of Fianna F&aacute;il dramatically changed its position and supported Fine Gael's amendment which, at best, delays the constitutional referendum and, at worst, buries it until after 2018.  The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, said on the one hand that it is a priority for the Government but, on the other, that he could not foresee any movement until 2019, three years from now.  That would be five years after the recommendation being made by the Constitutional Convention.  What is the delay?  The Government could sort out this matter in the morning.  However, there is a lack of will to do so, and this must change.</p> <p>Tens of thousands of people across the North and similar numbers across the world are keen to vote for the President in 2018.  What does the Government say to these people?  What does Fianna F&aacute;il say to them?  What has Fianna F&aacute;il to say to its supporters after doing a U-turn on supporting this?  I spoke to many Fianna F&aacute;il activists over the weekend and they could not believe what the party had done in not supporting the motion.  Why has Fianna F&aacute;il ditched its party policy on this crucial issue?  Last week was a missed opportunity.  However, all is not lost.  I call on the Government to change course on this matter and I call on Fianna F&aacute;il to revert to supporting the right of people in the North and in the diaspora to vote in presidential elections.  I call on the people to organise in support of the campaign to have voting rights in presidential elections extended to people in the North and in the Irish diaspora.  The relevance of this House to Irish citizens in the North and abroad will be judged on how sincere Members are about prioritising presidential voting rights for Irish citizens, regardless of where they live.  Make no mistake - the battle for equalisation of Irish citizenship will continue.</p></speech>

Why is it always the working class that pays?  Why do we see the same fat cats always win?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2402"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2402&amp;amp;pid=GerardPCraughwell&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am raising the issue of Independent News and Media, but I may well be talking about Aer Lingus, decent public servants who have seen the abatement of their pension schemes.  Was it a property right when they got it?  It seems other people can claim property rights are untouchable.  But the property rights of the working classes are never untouchable.  I hear today of people who are taking a 70% cut in their pension.  Surely, the Oireachtas can do something, send in some inspector to see why shareholders are about to get a dividend after so many years when the poor old guy who built the company with his sweat and blood, the journalists who went out and tracked down the criminals of this country are being cut to the bone and are being left in their old age desolate and with nothing.  Why can they do it?  They can do it because they know the State will pick up the allowance if they are broke.  They know the State will have to fund them in hospital if they are broke.  This has gone beyond a joke.  Since 2008, workers have been crucified and yet the same God-damned names keep appearing and they are making millions.  They are making millions on the backs of the people.  It has to stop.  We have to do something about it.  For the life of me I do not know what to do about it, other than to run them all out of the country.  I do not suppose we can do that but we must do something.  Perhaps we should have the Minister for Finance come to the House and have a debate on this matter.  A pension right is a pension right and should not be touchable by anybody.</p></speech>

I think he is to be lauded for his efforts in this regard in the past number of months.  I think it is unfortunate that the National Treasury Management Agency and the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund have been investing taxpayer's money in three tobacco companies while at the same time, tobacco companies have been threatening to sue this State as a result of the efforts it is making to stop young people from taking up this deadly habit.</p> <p>I support the call by my colleague, Senator Leyden, that the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment be called to the House, to discuss both the particular issue he raised in regard to the potential breach of the boundaries in County Roscommon and the urgent need for a constitutional referendum on the Lower House in order that there can be positive discrimination towards rural Ireland.  The sooner that is done, the better.  If the population growth continues to occur on the east coast and in the major urban areas, rural Ireland will end up with very few Members of the D&aacute;il or Seanad.  I urge that we debate this as soon as possible when we come back in the new year.</p> <p>I wish to clarify an issue raised by Senator Conway-Walsh for the benefit of the House.  She is indeed, correct and I have already apologised to the Sinn F&eacute;in Whip, Senator Paul Gavan, on Wednesday last.  I indicated to Senator Gavan that the Fianna F&aacute;il Party would support his motion, not a Bill.  However, on closer examination, it was indicated to a colleague of mine - unfortunately I was not available due to personal reasons that afternoon - that we would prefer to examine in more detail a definition of what exactly the diaspora is and set the cut-off point.  Does everybody who has an Irish passport and who may never have been on the island of Ireland have a vote for the presidential election?  There were concerns.  </p> <p>I apologised to the Chief Whip of the Sinn F&eacute;in Party and I am doing so again in this House.  He is not to blame.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Diarmuid Wilson:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2017"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2017&amp;amp;pid=DiarmuidWilson&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There was a concern that we should look at the motion, rather than the Bill, in more detail.  That is why it was decided that we should vote with the amendment.  That is the situation as far as I am concerned.  There is no hidden agenda.  As a party, we are still totally committed to giving votes to our diaspora.  It is important that we identify exactly what the diaspora is before we go any further.</p></speech>

As someone who served as chairperson of Cork City Council's library subcommittee when I was a member of the local authority, I am aware that it is a matter for local authorities to fund their own services.  The staff of libraries certainly play an integral and strong part in our experience in libraries.  I might have the Minister come to the House to discuss the matter.</p><p>Senator McDowell spoke about the water pipeline between the River Shannon and Dublin.  I will be very happy to invite the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to come to the House.  There have been issues with water supply, and particularly water pressure, in Dublin.  Those of us who stay in hotels when we are in Dublin will have seen water conservation notices in the lifts and public areas of hotels.  It is important that we have a debate about how to ensure there is continuity and safety of supply in the Dublin area.  Senator McDowell mentioned that he has received a paper from Emma Kennedy on this issue.  Perhaps he might circulate it to Members as a means of reference.  It is important that we learn and broaden our horizons.  I will get the Minister to come to the House in this regard.</p><p>I join Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh, who also referred to libraries, in recognising the excellent work of the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, in bridging a solution to the ferry issue last weekend.  I thank the Minister of State for intervening and thereby showing his power and his ability to bring people together.  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh is right when he says that a long-term solution is needed.  We have got a reprieve until 4 January, but we cannot have <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>or Groundhog Day on that date again.  The point the Senator made about bin charges is to be welcomed.  I will come back to that again.</p><p>The fundamental point made this afternoon by Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh is that all Members of the House should play a part in helping to eradicate the mistreatment of men and women who work in the entertainment and hospitality sector, including waiters, waitresses, bar people, glass collectors, doormen and doorwomen, taxi drivers, nightclub DJs and band members.  We enter their workplaces when we go into restaurants and public houses.  They deserve to be treated properly and with respect and decorum.  I hope that as public officials, we lead the way by ensuring people in our parties and groups treat these people with respect and courtesy as they do their day's work or night's work.  Senator Lawless, who is present, plays a strong role in the hospitality sector in Chicago.  It is important for us to stand up for and stand with those who work in the sector.</p><p>Senator Black raised the issue of mental health.  Everyone in this House has a role to play in promoting positive mental health, wellness and well-being.  The Government has committed funding to this area.  It has become a popular cant to blame the Government or public bodies for difficulties in the mental health sector.  The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, like her predecessors, Kathleen Lynch and John Moloney, has demonstrated her willingness to prioritise mental health.  An additional &euro;115 million has been invested in mental health this year.  This represents an increase of 20% since 2012.  There has been a recruitment and advertising campaign.  I was in Cork City Hall yesterday when the Lord Mayor of Cork, Councillor Des Cahill, held an informative and important briefing on the issue of mental health and suicide in the city of Cork.  We all have a role to play in this regard.  It behoves all of us to ensure mental health is prioritised.  I join the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, in trying to do that.</p><p>I am happy to accept the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by Senator Nash.  Many Members of the House, including Senator Norris, who has left the Chamber, are playing a role in making our society more equal and more progressive.  While it might not be as simple as Senator Nash thinks to achieve the aims of the Bill to which his amendment relates, we should collectively sign up to support it as a means of ensuring we can send a message to those who were persecuted and treated badly by the State, and their families.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I join the Senator in condemning the treatment of workers in Drogheda.  They have been locked out, in some cases, without any recompense or by-the-by after 20 or 30 years of service.  Certainly, the issue of the Duffy Cahill review is one to which we can come back if we happen to have the Minister in the House.</p><p>Senator Richmond raised the matter of the EU Council meeting on the future of Europe.  He is right.  There is a need to have dialogue on the future of Europe, not least in the context of what we have seen with the Brexit vote, the vote in Italy at the weekend and the implications for the European Union, in particular, for fiscal stability.  The issue of the growth of certain populist trends throughout the European Union is important as well.</p><p>Senator Swanick proposed an amendment regarding No. 29, motion 9, on the Order Paper.  I am happy to accept it and join and commend him on his strong words and action around the tobacco industry.  I commend the former Minister, Senator Reilly, on the role he played as Minister for Health in this regard.  All Members can send a collective message to the effect that we do not want to see people dying of smoking or smoking-related diseases.  If we can progress the health and well-being of our nation, then any stepping stone in that direction should be approached with acclamation by all.</p><p>Senator Devine raised the matter of Portlaoise.  It is an important matter and one with which we should not be playing politics.  I chaired the previous Joint Committee on Health and Children.  We dealt with the HIQA report and we had some of the families affected before the committee.  It is important to recognise that steps have been taken on foot of the events.  It should be put on the record that it was the bravery of women and their families which has allowed us to come to this day, when we can have another report on the services in the hospital.</p><p>I must have listened to a different radio programme this morning, because I thought the chairperson of the group was clear and strong on the need to have a strategic plan.  The plan is with the Minister to be implemented.  He emphasised that we need to protect and ensure the safety of women and their babies and that this concern is paramount at all times.  I fully agree with the Senator's point that we must see a strategic plan put in place.  We must safeguard the lives of women and children and protect staff as well.  That is why there has been an increase of 18% in Government funding to the hospital, something to which Senator Devine did not refer.  That is why we have seen an additional 16 midwifery posts put in place as well as two additional midwifery management posts and an arrangement with the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital.</p></speech>

No one wants to see anyone being treated badly or dying in our hospitals.  It is important to put on record our thanks to the women and families who have come forward and to acknowledge their bravery.  However, we must also give recognition to the Minister and the Government as well as the previous Government for putting in place increases in staffing and funding.  That is not something Senator Devine referred to in her contribution.</p> <p>Senator James Reilly reinforced the messages of Senator Swanick and Senator McDowell.</p> <p>Senator Leyden raised the contentious issue of the Athlone boundary.

Last Saturday was International Day of Persons with Disabilities.  The Minister of State with responsibility for disability, Deputy McGrath, will issue a statement later today about the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  I understand from the Senator's remarks and the Minister of State's remarks that it will not be ratified by Christmas because the enactment of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 has an impact on it.  We must aspire to having it signed into law.  All sides aspire to that.  I hope we will do that before the end of the first quarter of 2017.  I will be happy to invite the Taoiseach to the House at a later date.</p> <p>Senators Coghlan and Ned O'Sullivan mentioned the red deer in Killarney National Park.  This is a very serious matter.  Many of us would have a very uneasy feeling about hunter tourists.  The matter is being investigated by the National Parks and Wildlife Service which is meeting with the Wild Deer Association of Ireland which has made the allegation.  The licensing period is 1 September to 28 February.  I am told, however, that permission is only granted where there is evidence of danger and a person can get a licence only on a case-by-case basis and must outline why the culling is taking place.  The Senator might submit a Commencement matter on this issue or we can invite the Minister to the House, whichever the Cathaoirleach decrees.</p> <p>Senators Ned O'Sullivan and &Oacute; Clochartaigh raised the matter of pay-per-weight waste collection.  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, has announced that it will not happen at the start of next year but in the middle of 2017.  There will be no dual pricing system in that period.  There is an opportunity for us to have a debate on the matter in the new year.  I would be happy to invite the Minister to the House to discuss that.  As Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh said, it shows the importance of this House that we could have the debate at an early stage and inform the Minister of our shared experience.</p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill raised the issue of the North Dakota pipeline.  I would be happy to have the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade raise the matter with his relevant counterparts in the United States.  Senator Feighan raised the matter of postage stamps.  I would be happy to invite the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment to the House to discuss the matter. </p> <p>Senator O'Donnell raised the question of a particular gentleman whom I cannot name coming to the House.  That is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, CPP.  The Cathaoirleach has given a ruling on that and I will be happy to have the matter debated at the CPP.</p> <p>Senators Norris and Craughwell spoke about the funding of pensions at Independent News and Media, INM.  It is disappointing and upsetting for people who have paid into a pension scheme to be suddenly faced with a payment cut of 70% or whatever it is.</p></speech>

Senator Norris also raised the matter of Dublin transport.  I would be happy to have the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, come to the House.  It is important that we promote an alternative to the car within cities, whether bicycles through the shared bike scheme or public transport.  I do not necessarily share Senator Norris's view that bikes are here and there.</p></speech>

I had the pleasure and privilege of attending the flag-raising ceremony yesterday in City Hall in Cork, in which the flag was flown to end the year of commemorative activity.  I thank the men and women of our Defence Forces who brought great colour, dignity, decorum and pageantry to the ceremonies.  One of the highlights of the 1916 commemoration for the students in schools was the member of the Defence Forces coming to the school with the flag and the ceremony around that.  I thought it was a tremendous idea.</p></speech>

I believe he is right.  There is a need to have a debate about the growth of rural Ireland.  I know that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, might take the approach of a second national spacial strategy along with the Minister, Deputy Humphreys.  It is one we need to consider.  One particular area in which Senator Wilson is right is in the context of the local election boundaries, which positively discriminate against rural Ireland, as well as the D&aacute;il constituency boundaries.

In this House last week, the Minister spoke about his concern to ensure that contributions are being made, that he wants to encourage the making of contributions, and that he wants to increase the fund that is available.  I do not believe that our pay related insurance fund will ever be adequate in terms of our pension and other needs, especially given that we have one of the lowest rates of employer PRSI in Europe.  We will always look to other parts of taxation to intervene constructively in our pension and pay related social insurance systems to supplement that.  However, taking in good faith the Minister's comments on the importance of contributions, an anomaly has arisen whereby it has become harder for people to make contributions and to increase their contributory record.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have the situation whereby, in the past few years, even as the number of contributions required has risen and pushed many women to a lower income, the barriers to making voluntary contributions have also gone up.  Previously, up to a few years ago, one would have had to make 260 contribution weeks before being allowed to make a voluntary contribution.  That has now increased to 520 contribution weeks before one is allowed to make a voluntary contribution.  In effect, that means people need to have paid in ten years of previous contributions before they are allowed to make a voluntary contribution.</p><p>There is also the particularly needless obstacle, namely, one has to apply to make those voluntary contributions within 12 months of the last completed tax year during which one paid compulsory insurance.  In many cases, particularly those forced out of work at 60 or 65, people only realise the shortfall they have in their contributions at a later stage.  This provision makes it difficult for them.</p><p>There are also several issues which affect the self-employed.  Many of them may go for a gap of longer than a year between making contributions because they may be hoping to restart a new business or start new employment.  They then find themselves coming back into the PAYE sector.  Many people who ran a business for 40 or 50 years may have found themselves as a PAYE worker in their last five or ten years of employment.  They are very much blocked by this obstacle from making supplementary contributions.</p><p>There is a significant gender dimension for women who are returning to the workplace.  There is also a dimension for those who are moving from being self-employed to becoming PAYE workers and then facing a gap which they cannot bridge.  There is also very much an issue for returned emigrants who try to make up the gap.  Will the Minister consider, either in this Bill or elsewhere, making it easier for people who want to contribute to our system?  Will he facilitate rather than block those who want to pay PRSI stamps?  I would appreciate the Minister's thoughts on this.  I understand we will not be able to press the amendment today.  However, I would like to know what the thinking is in his Department about this anomaly.</p></speech>

Is the number of weeks' payment required, which has gone up quite considerably, retrospective?  The reason I ask this is because I was in a scheme in Trinity College Dublin.  About halfway through my period of employment there, the terms were changed and we stopped buying PRSI stamps.  I inquired into it and I was entitled to a kind of truncated pension.  I never took it up.</p> <p>Partly on behalf of other members of the staff of Trinity College Dublin who were in the same position at the time, as well as people in other companies, I am curious to know if the number of weeks being increased affects people who historically had established rights.  Will they now lose them because of the increase in the number of weeks?</p> <p>As an aside, I gave up that pension because I thought there were enough people dragging out of the State and I had more than enough money to live on.  It turned up in the bloody newspapers that I was a pension fraud and a social welfare cheat, swindling Trinity College Dublin out of a pension for years.</p></speech>

As it stands, we do not need to increase employee's or employer's PRSI or have recourse to the general taxpayer.  It is important, however, that we keep it that way.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Leo Varadkar:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2192"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2192&amp;amp;pid=LeoVaradkar&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We all know the consequences of underfunded pension schemes and an underfunded Social Insurance Fund are that people do not get the benefits or pensions that they had expected to get on their retirement which is why it is important that we, as law makers, always have regard to the fact that anything we propose that may increase liabilities and costs has to be met by contributions on the other side. Having got the Social Insurance Fund back into surplus, I am determined that it should not go back into deficit because we need some headroom to prepare for the next time unemployment goes up, and all the other developments with an ageing population.</p><p>The amendment put down by Senator Higgins deals with two aspects of the voluntary contribution system.  First, it is proposed that the deadline for applying to become a voluntary contributor should be increased from the current 12 months after the contribution year in which the individual had paid or credited a PRSI contribution to five years from the end of his or her last paid or credited contribution.  On a technical point, the amendment refers only to extending the period of five years from the last credited contribution, whereas current arrangements relate to the period from the last paid or credited contribution.  It is essential that access to voluntary contributions continues for those who leave employment or self-employment and is not confined, as proposed in the amendment, to those who had a credited contribution.</p><p>However, the appropriate time period for application to become a voluntary contribution is something that has been under examination by my Department for some time.  We agree with the Senator's contention that the current period is too tight and that there should be more flexibility for all those who cease employment or self-employment.  As the Senator rightly pointed out, this is a particular difficulty for those who are self-employed and who make their final returns for the year after each year of assessment etc.</p><p>Accordingly, while this amendment has been ruled out of order, I have decided to extend the period available for application to five years from the date of the last paid or credited contribution in line with the Senator's proposal.  I can do this by way of regulation at the earliest possible date.  This will enable those who give up work for one reason or another in the last five years to now decide whether they wish to become a voluntary contributor.</p><p>The second aspect of the voluntary contribution scheme which this amendment addresses is the reduction in the minimum paid contribution threshold for access to the scheme from 520 paid contributions or ten years in a working life of 40 or 50 years to 260 paid contributions, which would be five years in a working life.  It has always been a condition of the voluntary contribution scheme that people can only become voluntary contributors if they satisfy the essential first condition for the receipt of a contributory State pension, namely, to have paid 520 contributions in either employment or self-employment or a combination of same.  This is a condition for access to the voluntary contribution scheme and has changed in line with the minimum contribution conditions of the State pension scheme.  The State pension condition increased the number of paid contributions to 520 in 2012, in line with the original legislation from 1997, and the voluntary contributions increased in line with that.</p><p>To answer Senator Norris's question, it is not retrospective.  It only applies to those who are applying for their pension now and those who had already received their pension do not have it reassessed and reduced.  I do not know how that relates to Trinity, however, as Trinity would be a different pension scheme.  It is not the State contributory pension; it is a private or public sector one.</p></speech>

That would have a significant impact on the Social Insurance Fund and would negate the basic requirement for the State pension of having paid contributions when working for a minimum of ten years.</p> <p>It is important that we have in place a sustainable State pension system that is well funded in the years ahead.  Accordingly, it is not considered reasonable that we would expect somebody to have ten years of contributions paid at a minimum to access the pension and that underlying rule applies to voluntary contributions as well.</p> <p>However, I am prepared to accept the Senator's proposal to allow people to make voluntary contributions for up to five years after they finish work and I will make regulations to put that into effect.</p></speech>

It is constructive and it will make a difference to people.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I understand that the Minister indicated at the Oireachtas joint committee that he intends to look at a wider level at the contributions and the contribution system.  I encourage the Minister to take this issue on board and to look to it.  While 520 is the desired contribution level for a full pension, the fact is that many people are on reduced pension rates.  It would be significant to allow this for people.</p><p>No doubt the point will come up in later amendments, but we know that at the moment two thirds of those on the full pension are men while one third are women.  Moreover, we know that women are twice as likely to be on the two lowest tiers of the reduced rate contributory pension.  If this measure were changed, there could be a route forward.  There could be an information campaign to encourage people.  I am looking to allow women in particular to be able to move from the lowest two tiers of the contributory pension.  This is an interest of mine in terms of pensions.  Women are twice as likely as men to be on those lowest two reduced rate tiers.  This is important in terms of economic independence.  We are not simply discussing income.  It is a key concern in the sense of economic independence of women.  Later we will come to the question of the gender pension gap.  This issue may merit further review.  I thank the Minister for taking on the point about five years.</p><p>I do not have an amendment relating to employers PRSI but it will come through.  This should be examined.  Last week the Minister spoke about other peoples' money.  At the moment we have the family income supplement, the back-to-work family dividend and many other in-work payments as well as the housing assistance payment.  The many payments we have currently going to the working poor effectively amount to other people's money.  Those in work but also in poverty are being supported, rightly, by the Department.  I believe those payments are right.  A greater demand is being placed on people.  There is a question for employers in this regard.  I know the Minister has spoken about raising wages as part of that, and rightly so.  As part of the review we might also consider the question of whether employer's PRSI should be examined again and strengthened.</p></speech>

That shows a flexible and positive approach in allowing the Seanad to contribute in this important way to the development of legislation.</p> <p>I referred to a pension relating to Trinity.  I thank the Minister for his response, which adequately answered all my questions.  The pension I was referring to was one whereby in addition to our contribution to the pension fund administered by Mercer, a commercial company, we also paid stamps for a contributory pension.  Therefore, it was the State pension.</p> <p>I want to wander a little because the Minister referred to the question of pensions.  This may not be directly within the Minister's remit.  If it is not, I would like him to take it back to Government.  There is an appalling situation involving Independent Newspapers.  People are losing vast amounts of their pensions.  This company is in profit.  I am asking the Minister to take this back to Government specifically because this situation could not obtain in England.  In the United Kingdom a company that is in profit cannot walk away from its pension obligations.  There is a defect or lacuna in the legislation here.  I am asking the Minister, as a matter of urgency, to take this back to Government to ensure that after the debacles of Aer Lingus, Clerys and so on we do not have yet another case of where a company that is in profit is allowed to run away from its obligations to people who have pensions with them.</p> <p>I am unsure whether this is within the Minister's brief.  I know that when I raised the question of the Trinity French lecturer who had a difficulty regarding a pension and the same-sex thing and so on, the Minister said it was not his brief.  I understand that.  I am asking him to take this business back to Government and resolve it as a matter of urgency.  A simple tranche of legislation could close this loophole which is so disgracefully used by bosses against their workers.</p></speech>

Perhaps we will have them another day.  There are arguments in favour and arguments against as well.</p> <p>The difficulty we have with the 520 week rule or the 260 week rule is that it is simply not the solution in the medium term.  Few people get any other pension by contributing to this extent.  A person can get a full pension by contributing for 520 weeks for ten years.  In any other line of work, to get a full pension a person has to contribute for 20 or 30 or 40 years.  The way it works at the moment is that it has to be the right ten years.  If the ten years are spread out over the wrong period, a person in that situation ends up getting less.  That is why the solution is to move away from a 260 or a 520 week rule to the total contributions approach.  We have discussed that before and I know we will discuss it again.</p> <p>Reference was made to the Independent News and Media defined benefit pension schemes.  I have no wish to open up another debate on a different issue.  I will be speaking on the issue later tonight in a different forum.  There are different types of pensions and we have discussed this before.  Any defined benefit pension is a private trust managed by trustees and it has its own deed of trust.</p></speech>

However, they are neither guaranteed by the employer nor by the State.  What Independent News and Media has done will have to be subject to the approval of the High Court.  I have spoken to the Pensions Authority and the Attorney General about what could be done in that case.  I know that in a different case the High Court adjudged that Aer Lingus would have to consult the trustees of its pension fund before it restructured its capital.  The matter needs to be heard in the High Court.  I am consulting the Pensions Authority and the Attorney General over what role the State might be able to play in the public interest in that regard.</p> <p>Some of the things that have been said about the rules being different in the United Kingdom are not quite the case.  The rules in the United Kingdom are better and they protect defined benefit pensioners in a better way, but the pension protection fund in the United Kingdom only works where the company is insolvent.  This company is not insolvent.  That protection fund was built up through levies on those pension funds for years.  We have not had such levies.  We had a levy for a brief period but we have not had 30 or 40 years of levies on pension funds to build up such a fund.  Even if we were to set it up now, it would be empty and of course it could not apply retrospectively.  In the United Kingdom, it is the case that employers can withdraw from defined benefit pension funds, but they have to clear the deficit before doing so.  They can and do withdraw.  It happens regularly.  Again, any law that we would apply in that regard in Ireland could not be retroactive.  It could only apply to future deficits and liabilities.</p></speech>

For example, the Department of Education and Skills recognises that a person not involved in teaching between the period of June and September does not have a break in service.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2402"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2402&amp;amp;pid=GerardPCraughwell&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, the Department of Social Protection recognises the period as a break in service when considering entitlement to class D PRSI.  As a result, a number of people in the education sector have been ruled ineligible for class D and have been forced to pay class A PRSI.  What difference does it make?  The difference is very simple.  I have always believed there was a problem with the change introduced in 1995 where half of the public service pension was paid from the Department of Social Protection.  That problem has raised its ugly head in the not so distant past where a person living in the North of Ireland retired from a public service job in the South, was under the age of 65, and was not being given their supplementary pension because they were not domiciled in the State.  The move in 1995 to change the public service pension had a significant impact on the entitlements of public servants, which is far more than we were led to believe at the time.  There is a serious problem with it.  When we talk about backdating and looking at things, we need to try to iron out some of the anomalies that exist and ensure that everybody is treated the same.  The Minister is trying to do that and I thank him.  I may have bounced this matter on him so he may not be fully up to speed on what I am talking about, but we can discuss it further if necessary.</p></speech>

My understanding is that if somebody is a local authority member and went full-time as a councillor in the last five years but prior to that was paying PRSI as part of their farm income, self-employment or as an employee, they are able to make voluntary contributions.  I will have to double check that.  By putting Senator Higgins's proposal into regulation, anyone who had not made a credited contribution within the past five years would be able to make voluntary contributions.  Let me check that before the Senator writes out to councillors telling them in case I am mistaken.</p></speech>

The amendment proposes that the class K contribution of 4% made by a range of public officeholders, including the President, Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas and members of the Judiciary, be abolished.  Class K contributions were introduced at a time when the State was experiencing an unprecedented financial crisis.  Payment of class K contributions was one of the measures that ensured public officeholders made their contribution to the resolution of that crisis.  In particular, the introduction of these contributions meant that officeholders, in general, pay the same marginal rate of all statutory deductions from their salaries as most employees.  The Bill before the House provides for the abolition of class K contributions for local authority members from 2017.</p></speech>

For that reason, they are being brought into social insurance cover, particularly for pensions.  This amendment will provide for the abolition of class K for all officeholders with the exception of members of the European Parliament.  If adopted, it would mean that officeholders such as Deputies and Senators would no longer pay PRSI at the 4% contribution rate.  In other words, Deputies and Senators would have a 4% net rise in their take home pay.</p></speech>

It is not clear if the Senators submitting this amendment envisage any other changes in PRSI liabilities and associated cover for relevant officeholders being made.  The amendment does not provide for this.  It is simply not sustainable or desirable that public officeholders should gain access to the State pension contributory on top of their occupational pension.  I understand that the value of public service pensions, including fast accrual schemes such as ours, is something that the Public Service Pay Commission has been asked to take into account in its work.  It is not an opportune moment to start recalibrating the take-home pay of politicians or enhancing their benefits.</p></speech>

That is the long and the short of it.  One pays 4% and gets nothing for it.  The Minister is on record as saying that nobody should pay for social insurance unless there is a benefit from it.  It is a farce to say that Deputies, Senators and other people covered by class K PRSI cannot avail of a contributory old age pension.  In my case I can make a voluntary contribution of &euro;660 to maintain my contributory old age pension entitlement.  The only thing covered is the old age pension, if I am not mistaken.  The Minister is taxing public servants at 4%.  If he wants to tax me for being a Senator, he should get the Minister for Finance to put a tax of 4% on the salaries of Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad into a Bill and I will pay it.  I do not want a 4% rise.  I do not want the social insurance system used as a tax so we can be saved blushes when we walk out the door and say we are paying PRSI too.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

We should scrap class K PRSI and if the Government wants to charge a tax on Senators, Deputies, members of the Judiciary and the President, it should be honest about it and do it.  The social insurance scheme should not be used to make a fool of the rest of us.  It is not right in any way.  It was a cheap shot in 2008 or 2011 to satisfy the blushes of Deputies and Senators, so they could look at the public and say they were paying their share into the Social Insurance Fund.  Let us be honest that it is a nonsense.  I know the Minister did not bring in this measure but he has the opportunity to get rid of it.</p></speech>

My understanding is that class K was always there, but it was there at 0%.  Class K existed, but one paid nothing and got nothing.  I raised this back in 2011 at a Local Authorities Members Association, LAMA, conference when Deputy Joan Burton was the then Minister for Social Protection.  The issue is that people are paying into a scheme that is called PRSI, social insurance, but there is nothing for it.  Whether it is councillors, officeholders or anybody else, class K should be addressed.  If the Minister wants to reduce it to 0%, change it to 0%, which would effectively give a 4% increase.  I am not looking for a 4%, but why are officeholders-----</p></speech>

The only people in the entire public service who do not get some form of cover for their PRSI payment are these officeholders, local authority members, members of the Judiciary, Deputies and Senators.  I raise this issue on behalf of the councillors.  What is the idea of one paying 4% of one's entire salary into a PRSI fund with no single benefit for a class K contribution?  Let us not call it pay related social insurance.  As I have said before, it should be called income related social insurance because one is paying PRSI on dividend and other income.  It is not about me.  I do not care if there is a 4% supertax on public sector officeholders, including the Judiciary and the President - so be it - but let us not pretend we are giving social insurance to people to whom we are not giving it because they are paying 4% and there is nothing for it.  If one wants to get the money out of officeholders a different way, so be it, but let us not pretend it is social insurance when it blatantly is not.</p></speech>

Has the Minister examined the possible unintentional consequences of a future claim in respect of K class PRSI?  Senator Norris states he is quite happy to take the 4%.  Using this as an example, if Senator Norris took a case against the State, saying that he is being disadvantaged and the Minister is resolving the problem for one set of officeholders yet penalising another, is there a danger of an unintentional consequence?  There is case law on designing a tax or a payment that only affects one group of citizens.  Has the Minister taken advice on it?  I am not looking for a 4% increase.  I am happy to pay the 4%, but should we be paying the 4% under class K or should it be a levy on a public officeholder?</p></speech>

It was added as a recession measure to pre-1995 public servants earning above a certain limit.  I am sympathetic to the case the Senators are making, that people should not pay 4% PRSI and get no benefits.  That should apply to everyone, even Deputies, Senators and judges, but if we were to make any change to this, we would have to look at it in the round.  Unlike local authority members, public officeholders, Deputies, Senators and judges have good arrangements for pensions and get a lump sum when they retire.  Severance arrangements are available to elected Members to tide them over should they lose their seats.  It  is a very different situation not just when compared with local authority members, but with other normal employees.  The effect of amendment No. 2 would be a 4% increase in take home pay or more for Deputies and Senators.  I do not think that is a good idea, given that we are preaching pay restraint and other things for other groups of people.</p> <p>On the question of local authority members being able to make voluntary contributions for the past five years, that will not be of particular value to those who are currently serving on a local authority because they will be moving to class S.  It may, however, be of use to those who retired from a council in the past couple of years.</p></speech>

The point I was making was that they had been paying class K contributions for the past five or six years.</p> <p>I appreciate there is a problem with class K contributions.  In 2013, class K was extended to all unearned income, which included things such as rental income, income from shareholdings, dividends and so on.  The point is that if we look at it in the round, it is a tax.  It is a tax on unearned income, a tax on public service.  </p> <p>In fairness, the Minister has shown that he understands that concept.  It would be far better to deal with it now and get it out of the way.  Let the Minister for Finance bring in a levy on public service.  I will pay it.  I have no difficulty whatsoever paying it, but it should be done honestly and straight.  The people who have significant income from shares or rent should be hit with a levy as well.  They will probably pass it on to the poor unfortunate tenant, but let us not use the social insurance system to collect a tax.  The Minister has an opportunity to do that now.</p></speech>

I cannot deal with that now because it would require a finance Bill to make the change.  I am obviously not in a position to do that, but the point the Senator makes is valid.  If it is really social insurance, it should have some social insurance benefit linked to it, which it does not.  I will certainly discuss it and take it in the round with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe.  It could be regularised in the years to come.</p></speech>

In preparing the report on the financial and social effects of the amendments, reference is made to taking into account the effect on welfare dependency and the poverty rates of those in receipt.  I would like to be clear that in looking at the financial and social effects, the Minister is not limiting them to the questions of welfare dependency and the poverty rates.  He should also consider outcomes such as the number of lone parents entering education, which is an important financial and social effect, and the quality of work lone parents are taking up.  Many of the financial and social effects are not simply measurable by poverty rates or whether people are on the live register or in employment.  There is an issue about the quality of outcome for lone parents.  This issue has been coming up because people have found that longer-term options that they might have been interested in have become more difficult for them to pursue, but I will look to see what the report finds.</p><p>The joint committee is also looking into this area and we will publish a report and recommendations.  Will the Minister indicate that he is interested in a dialogue between these two documents?  I am sure that will be the case.</p></speech>

We discussed this issue previously but there is no mention of it in the Bill.  This ties in with welfare dependency and poverty rates when women are means tested against child maintenance payments ordered by the court that they do not receive.  Has the Minister considered how that could be addressed in the legislation?  If not, I might look to work with him to see if there is something we can do to insert a provision on a later Stage.</p></speech>

We are interested to know what impact the changes have had on their participation in education and what type of work they have taken up.  All this cannot be ascribed to the reforms that have been introduced because the economy has changed as well, but we are genuinely interested to gather this information for ourselves.  The report will not be limited to welfare dependency and poverty rates.</p> <p>We did not give detailed considered to the maintenance issue for this legislation.  People should not be means tested against maintenance they do not receive.  I acknowledge we discussed this previously and I would be concerned if that was happening.  When people are means tested, they are tested against their actual income and not against income they do not receive.  I would be happy to consider any proposals in this regard.  I will have to check with my officials because it should not be the case that people are means tested against income they do not receive.</p></speech>

The Department has figures on this and it is an important financial and social effect, which has had an economic impact.  It would be important to capture that.  Perhaps it is a corollary effect but it will feed into an understanding of the impact of the measures.  We can come back to it when the Minister is developing the terms of reference and offer a submission then.</p></speech>

The Principal Act is amended by the insertion of the following section after section 178F:<blockquote>&quot;<b>178G</b>.(1)The Minister shall, not later than 9 months of the passing after the<i>Social Welfare Act 2016</i>, cause to be produced a report in respect of the gender pension gap in the first tier and second tier of the pension system, including consideration of the causes and contributing factors, financial and social impacts, international best practice and proposals and targets in respect of narrowing the gender pension gap in Ireland.<br /><br />(2) The Minister shall, not later than 10 months after the passing of the <i>Social Welfare Act 2016</i>, cause a copy of the report under <i>subsection (1) </i>to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.&quot;.&quot;.</blockquote></blockquote> <p>We touched on this issue earlier.  It has come up and it will continue to come up.  I understand there is legislation before the D&aacute;il in this regard as well.  It is an area of considerable concern.  The amendment asks the Minister and the Department to address the gender pension gap, which has widened from 35% to 37%.  I have mentioned the first and second tiers of the pension system.  Given I am unlikely to press the amendment, it would be worth examining the first, second and third tiers of our pension system in this respect.  There is a deeply embedded inequality in the system.  Last week, the Minister referred to winners and losers.  That is not constructive language but if we use it, women have been systematically the losers in our pension system for a long time.  The origins of that inequality lie directly in measures such as the marriage bar, which was explicitly recognised as an unequal measure that forced women to leave the workplace and which the State had to cease due to European pressure.  We have asked about legal advice and legal concerns and I would encourage the Minister to look into this.  There are concerns that under the EU equal treatment directive, the impact of the marriage bar is still being felt by women in Ireland in a reduced rate pension entitlement.  This unequal measure is still having a knock-on effect.</p><p>On Second Stage, the Minister referred to extending the cost of extending a homemaker's credit retrospectively.  The figures previously quoted by the Department relate to 1994 going back to 1953.  It is much more difficult to make the case against going back to 1973.  Ireland has been clearly ruled out of order since that year in respect of the marriage bar.  There was an onus on the State from 1973 to rectify the inequalities between women and men.  This is a significant legacy issue which continues to have an impact on women.  It is not an academic exercise.  It affects women every week and it affects not only their incomes but their economic independence.</p><p>The State has moved backwards in respect of pension inequality for women.  Women predominate in the education and health sectors of the public sector, for example, and they have suffered due to a loss in pension and a lack of career progress.  This was recognised by the ESRI as having a hugely disproportionate impact on women in terms of their income and long-term pensions.  Research by Age Action Ireland and many other organisations demonstrates that only one third of those in receipt of the full contributory State pension are women while women are twice as likely as men to be on the lowest rates of pension.  Means testing of the non-contributory pension is an issue for many women.  They feel they cannot take a means test because it will affect their partner's means.  This again raises the issue of economic independence.  Many women, therefore, tend to exist as qualified adults within the system, relying on a supplementary payment paid directly to their spouse.  There is provision whereby it can be requested to be paid separately, but in the majority of cases, it is an additional payment to the spouse.  There are deep holes in the system, and when putting forward roadmaps for the future, we need to establish trust with the half of the population who have been mistreated and who have witnessed their mothers and grandmothers being mistreated by the system.</p><p>A universal supplementary retirement savings scheme or whatever form it may take was being considered for the second tier of the system by the previous Administration.  However, we need to examine how other forms of contribution will be recognised, for example, the contribution made in terms of care.  Care has a clear cost.  As the Government tries to put child care systems in place, the cost has become clear.  We are also aware of the cost of home care.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Every hour of care given by an individual is an hour and a considerable cost saved to the State.  The cost of care is being entirely carried by those who are caring, predominantly women.  They carry it during their working life and into retirement.  The Minister spoke about women living longer and that upset a couple of older women who spoke to me about it.  That is not an adequate response to be giving in respect of the pension age because every week people have to eat and pay for their heating.  To live longer on a basic or minimal income is not to accrue some long-term benefit or nest egg.  This is the money they survive on and they have a very strong sense of its inadequacy.  Moreover, insult is added to injury because people aged over 80 in receipt of the contributory pension get &euro;10 extra, which is positive and right because those who have lived to that age deserve something for their work in establishing our State but qualified adults, predominantly women, do not get that &euro;10 increase when they are in their 80s.  The pension and income gap between men and women through the system increases when women are in their 80s.</p><p>This is a very serious legacy issue of lack of equal treatment.  If we want to credibly move forward with the pension system in Ireland, we need to reform and fix the gaps in the first tier.  I am urging the Minister to produce a report on this.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social Protection will issue a report on pension policy, most likely to include issues of the gender pension gap.  I urge the Minister to take on this proposal and to perhaps indicate that he will be willing to take on some of the committee's recommendations.  I specify the first and second tiers because the question of how we recognise other forms of contribution will be complex for the second tier.</p><p>The third tier is the private pension industry.  While I know this is not within the Minister&rsquo;s remit, it is crucial because this is what gives the Minister the leverage and funding he needs to deliver the kind of repair work that is required.  I have sent a proposal separately to the Minister for Finance asking him to examine the current system of private pension tax relief at the marginal rate which greatly and disproportionately benefits high earners and is a subsidy from those in the bottom third of incomes, the half of the population earning &euro;28,500, very few of whom have any form of private pension but who are paying tax.  This money is then given as a subsidy in the form of tax relief to those on the highest incomes who can, in some cases, write off up to &euro;40,000 a year in tax relief through pension schemes which are not delivering a dividend or interest but serve as a holder for money.  That is part of the wider issue that was raised about some of the failures we have seen in the private pension schemes, which also get additional tax revenue from the State in that they are exempt from capital gains tax on their property portfolios.  This is a private pension tax system which is being deeply subsidised and which has let down its members and those who were relying on it at the cost of funds which I believe should be directed into our first and second-tier system.  I am not asking for extra money to come from the sky but I am asking the Minister to engage constructively with the Minister for Finance and to demand the moneys that I believe should be directed through the Department of Social Protection and I will press for that.</p></speech>

I greatly admire her erudite and deep knowledge of this topic.  The pension gender equality movement is very lucky to have her as an advocate and I would like to see myself as part of that movement.</p> <p>There needs to be a full review of the contributory pension entitlements for women.  There is a real and present inequality.  Lip service is given to this issue in committees, the D&aacute;il and the Seanad but nothing has been done.  I will address it later with my amendments.  There will be a cost in ensuring that this inequality is fixed.  It is, however, an acceptable cost and as Senator Higgins pointed out, there is a legacy of mistreatment of women in Ireland, not just physical and emotional but also financial.  This needs to be addressed urgently.</p></speech>

The tax treatment of pension contributions is primarily a matter for the Minister of Finance.  The thinking behind it of course is the people do not pay tax on the money they put into their pension fund because they pay tax on the income when the pension is paid.  Many people would have great difficulty with having their income taxed twice, before they put it into the pension fund and again when they take it out.</p></speech>

When it comes to the marriage bar, most of the women affected by that where public servants before 1995 who, even had they remained in work, would not qualify for the State contributory pension.  Even men would not have qualified for it because pre-1995 public servants do not.  They may potentially have qualified for a public service pension but that is a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Pre-1995 public servants, male or female, married or not, do not qualify for the State contributory pension with the exception of a small number who left the public service and then rejoined it post-1995.</p><p>The amendment calls for the drafting of a report to be laid before the Oireachtas, regarding gender gaps in the pensions paid by my Department and occupational pensions paid by public and private sector employees.  I am very happy to discuss it in the course of this debate and on other occasions, particularly at the committee, insofar as the matters are covered by my brief.  The matter has been discussed before in the Oireachtas and is regularly considered by the entire pensions policy community.  We do already know the main reasons women generally receive a lower age contributory pension than men and why the same applies to a much greater extent in the context of occupational pensions.  The reason in both cases is that men generally will have paid more for longer to fund their pensions, either through pay-related social insurance, PRSI, contributions into the Social Insurance Fund or through deductions from their salaries for occupational pensions.  It is evident that we have areas in the pension system where people pay a contribution to fund an increase in their eventual pension and those who contribute less will receive a lower pension under a particular scheme and those, for example, who make additional voluntary contributions receive more.  What matters is there are other elements in the system that result in fairer outcomes.  Some of these elements mitigate against this effect while others counteract it and together these result in men and women having different social outcomes.</p><p>On the State pension side, reductions in the rate of contributory pension are very much minimised by the banding structures.  Someone with a yearly average of between 48 and 52 weekly contributions per year qualifies for a full rate pension.  Those with lower yearly averages get a reduced race but those reduced rates are not <i>pro rata</i>or even close to it.  Someone with a yearly average of just 20 contributions receives 85% of the full rate that goes to somebody who has made the maximum average contribution of 52.  Somebody who has made only 20 contributions gets much better value for those contributions than somebody who made an average of 52 contributions.</p><p>It is also the case that the cheaper contributions paid by less well-paid and part-time workers are as valuable as the more expensive contributions paid by higher paid full-time employees.  This is very different from the case with occupational pensions.  The same also applies to credited contributions provided the person has paid the ten years of PRSI required for a contributory pension.  These are the factors that disproportionately benefit women over men.  The most recent actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund found that female employees receive significantly better value for their contributions than their male counterparts.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Leo Varadkar:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2192"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2192&amp;amp;pid=LeoVaradkar&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> A person over 66 with few or no contributions may also be supported under the contributory pension system if he or she had been dependent on his or her spouse who is a contributory pensioner.  In such cases, they can receive an increase for a qualified adult of up to 90% of a full-rate pension.  This payment is based on the person's means, not those of his or her spouse.  Over 80% of those to whom I refer are in payment of a full rate.  If the person is a widow, the social protection system will, in the large majority of cases, provide a full-rate contributory pension, usually with an additional living alone allowance.  In addition to this, however, there is the non-contributory State pension.  If somebody does not qualify for the full-rate contributory pension, he or she may claim the non-contributory pension.  The latter is payable at up to 95% of the full rate of contributory pension.  While this is subject to a household means test, there are significant disregards that result in over 90% of persons qualifying at the full rate.  Given that approximately half of those over 66 depend solely on the State pension, a reduced rate non-contributory pensioner will generally have more significant means than most of those in his or her age group.</p><p>The net effect of these arrangements is to make the average pension payments made by my Department to both men and women similar.  This is reflected in the poverty statistics produced by the Central Statistics Office.  Today's male and female pensioners experienced different employment histories.  In light of the difference in their lifetime incomes and their contributions into the Social Insurance Fund over the years, the outcomes for them vary.  It is, of course, possible to do more or less, or to mitigate the differences in outcome, and each Government that reforms the system must balance the desirability of any changes with the extra cost that might accrue in respect of the PRSI system.  As a result of changes in work practices, 48% of PRSI contributors are now women and they, of course, would bear a significant proportion of the cost of any changes that might result in such a cost.</p><p>The alternative, which I could not support, would be across-the-board reductions in the rate of pensions for everyone.  This would include the most vulnerable of the elderly, 50% of whom depend solely on the State pension.  It is also worth pointing out that in some countries there is no equivalent to the increase in respect of a qualified adult and that widows receive significantly lower pensions if they have limited insurance records.  In many countries, the basic state pension is much lower than it is here.</p><p>The issue of gender gap is much more significant in the context of second-pillar pensions.  Such pensions are more associated with insuring one's replacement income rather than the avoidance of poverty.  A person on a high salary could find reliance on a State pension a significant income shock.  Clearly, if somebody has not been in employment for most of his or her working life, he or she will not have had the opportunity to build up an occupational pension.  By definition, however, people are unlikely to suffer the same level of income shock on retirement.  There are, of course, workplaces where there are no pensions or no access to them or where their adequacy has become increasingly restricted.  This affects both men and women.</p><p>In broad terms, the public sector is well catered for in this area.  A high proportion of the workforce in the public sector comprises women related to the private sector, but that, of course, is matter relating to the policy remit of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  There are gaps in the private sector and recent developments, both here and abroad, serve to indicate that arrangements are under increasing pressure.  For this reason, the Government is seeking to develop a universal retirement saving scheme.  Work on that project is ongoing.  I do not want to pre-empt the final shape of the scheme but I believe it will be of significant benefit to all middle-income earners.</p><p>The amendment calls for the Government to frame specific proposals and targets regarding the gender gap.  I am not sure if this is the correct approach.  The best way to tackle this gap is by making our systems work better at delivering better and more equal results for women and men.  In that context, finalising the total contributions approach proposal in a way that recognises the value and impact of home-making and which balances the final proposal accordingly will do more than a stand-alone proposal with no funding line to support it.</p><p>The issues raised by the Senator are important and are being discussed on an ongoing basis.  The development of the total contributions approach will provide opportunities for detailed discussion on how we can recognise home-making as a credit in that context.  I expect to have a consultation process regarding the reform of that system by the middle of next year following analysis of data from the crucial upcoming actuarial view of the Social Insurance Fund.  The consultation will involve sharing of such data with stakeholders, including the joint Oireachtas committee, in order to allow them to outline priorities in advance of a final design of proposals.  These will, of course, be subject to Oireachtas scrutiny.  This is probably the best way that we, as politicians, can engage in respect of this matter.</p><p>Of course, all of these issues must be looked at in the round.  I would be interested in any proposals that the joint Oireachtas committee makes once we make the data available to it.  I will certainly consider any recommendations made but we will need to see how the costs will be met and how any changes will impact on individuals, and not only in the context of different genders.</p></speech>

That is a common situation which has arisen whereby people have come back into the system, perhaps after a period of ten or 20 years raising children.  It is also the case that many women, having left, return to work in their late 40s or 50s.  During the recession, a number of women who were not working but who had previously been public servants up to 25 years ago re-entered the workplace.  Such a situation might be more common that one might think.  What we find here is that they are playing catch-up.  The issue we addressed in the context of voluntary contributions and the question of averaging, which will be addressed in a later amendment, are two aspects that come into play in terms of those women who re-entered the workplace post-1995 and might be supported in building up their contributions records or having records which allow them to obtain adequate or appropriate incomes.  I appreciate the detailed and thoughtful response from the Minister and look forward to engaging with him further on the matter.</p> <p>The Minister is correct in respect of the question of the occupational pension gap being wider.  However, the marriage bar also had an impact in the context of occupational pensions.  While it related to public service, the marriage bar also involved the setting of a convention across society.  This convention was mirrored widely in the private sector as well because it represented a strong signal from Government that women who were married should not have been in the workplace or given access to the same routes of progression as men.  A significant number of issues arise, including those relating to progression in the workplace, such as who progresses, who is making contributions, etc.</p> <p>This is a complex issue, it is not simply about gender.  There is a requirement in the programme for Government on gender proofing and while the Minister wants to look at the issues in the round and seek a general outcome, a gender analysis is essential.  Such an analysis would be useful and would make the Department's systems work for all the population.  In broad terms, half of the members of the population feel strongly that they have been ill served by the system.  I suggest that the Minister ensure that a gender analysis is carried out and that we do not merely focus on outcomes for men and women.  He should consider teasing out some of the issues to which I refer.  There is good research that will assist in this regard.</p> <p>I will not deal with of the other points.  There is a 37% gender pension gap.  I understand that is across the second tier - and even the third tier, as well as the first tier - but it is significant.  It is an anomalous gap which, if it was in any other area of society, would be of concern.</p> <p>I appreciate that the Minister indicated that he is interested in examining the issue relating to home-makers.  That matter is dealt with in the context of a later amendment.</p> <p>I thank the Minister.  I will not press the amendment at this point.  I look forward to further engagement on the matter instead and I reserve the right to resubmit the amendment on Report Stage.</p></speech>

I have only half come to terms with it in the past couple of months.  There are so many different issues at play and I want to consider it in the round.  The Senator and I both agree that the latter will have to involve a gender analysis because we need to see how these policies and changes impact on gender.  It needs to be broader than that as well and consider the impact on individuals, on poverty and on income replacement, and also what would be the cost involved and how would that cost be borne.

Child benefit is a very important payment and it should be protected.  The universality of child benefit is its most important feature because regardless of people's family situation, their employment status or where they are from, the State provides support to them as a parent.  It is a payment I really believe in.  It may not appear to be the case yet but I believe it is the universality principle of this Part of the Bill that is being challenged, so I read the Official Report of the Minister's contributions in the D&aacute;il and the briefing notes he sent to the members of the Joint Committee on Social Protection and identified the exact reasons the Minister provided for requesting these additional powers.  As a result, my amendments were deliberately designed to give the Minister the ability to make the regulations to allow him contact employers regarding entitlement to child benefit for the reasons he outlined, some of which I will now outline.<br/><br/>On Committee Stage the Minister stated: &quot;While it is absolutely correct to say that the employment status of an Irish parent is immaterial to a child benefit claim, all child benefit customers claiming under domestic legislation must satisfy the habitual residence condition.&quot;  That is a fair enough reason for wishing to contact employers and that is why I have included a provision in paragraph (a) of my amendment allowing the Minister to issue regulations when &quot;... the Minister can demonstrate that it is required in order to verify the habitual residence condition in relation to entitlement to child benefit&quot;.<br/><br/>Regarding paragraph (b) of my amendment, on Committee Stage the Minister stated: </p><blockquote>[...] difficulties can arise in the case of child benefit when information on employment is required and where the information does not refer to the customer but to the spouse or partner of the customer.  This is particularly difficult in separation or divorce cases where the customer may not have the co-operation of the spouse, partner or former partner in terms of supplying the required information.  This can lead to a situation where there is an entitlement to child benefit but where the processing of the claim can be impeded.  Contacting employers directly removes this difficulty for customers in that situation.</blockquote><p>Based on what the Minister said on Committee Stage, and this seems to be a strong, customer-focused change, I have allowed for it in paragraph (b) of the amendment which reads: &quot;[when] the Minister can demonstrate, in cases of a parental separation or divorce, that the employment information of the spouse of a child benefit customer is required in order to prevent delays in the processing of a child benefit claim&quot;.<br/><br/>With regard to paragraph (c) of my amendment, on Committee Stage the Minister stated: </p><blockquote>My Department has access to social insurance contribution records.  However, these records only become available at the end of the tax year and are not available to the Department in real time.  This means that they can only be updated in arrears but while my Department routinely requires employment information for benefit purposes in real time, to await updated social insurance records would delay payment to customers.  The practical thing to do, and the most customer-focused solution, is to contact employers directly where the customer is not in a position to easily provide the necessary information him or herself.</blockquote><p>Again, that seems fair and that is the reason for paragraph (c) of the amendment which reads: &quot;the Minister can demonstrate that it is required in cases where a significant and onerous delay in the payment of child benefit would occur if the Department waited until a child benefit customer's social insurance contribution records became available at the end of the particular tax year&quot;.  That seems fair and rather than opposing the entire section, I have taken on board the reasons for which the Minister said he would need the powers to make his role more effective and improve the experiences of those in receipt of child benefit.  I am happy to work with him on that and offer a compromise with the amendments I have put forward.  However, the Minister should not be given a blank cheque that would allow him to be able to access all employer data on everyone receiving child benefit, which is what effectively his original amendment allows the Department to do.  I hope the Minister can accept those amendments, and I thank the Minister.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-12-06a.336" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1405" speakername="Alice Mary Higgins" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016120600002#MM00200"><p>My colleague is being reasonable, more reasonable than I would be regarding this amendment.  She has brought forward an amendment that looks to the various circumstances as outlined by the Minister regarding accessing the information.</p> <p>From my perspective, I have to oppose this section of the Bill because opening that dialogue regarding child benefit is an issue of serious concern.  A couple of issues arise, the first of which is about family status.  The briefing from the Department on that refers to a concern about the relationship between the employer and the employee being impacted.  It states that the Department of Social Protection is aware of its obligations as a data controller and makes every effort to avoid breaching these obligations.  That is not enough.</p> <p>We have legislation that relates to family status so from the employer's perspective, an employer is not meant to inquire into or in any way treat an employee or a prospective employee differently in respect of his or her family status.  In allowing an employer to open a conversation with employees on child benefit, a spouse, a partner or their children, the Minister is putting employers in an inappropriate situation whereby they are looking into to the family status of their employees and are in a dialogue with a Department in respect of the family status of one of their employees.  That is dubious, and it is one of the grounds in our equality legislation.  It is a serious concern.</p> <p>There is a debate on whether child benefit should be tied to the question of the habitual residency condition or the status of parents.  We have had debates on that at various times and the issue has not been resolved.  Strong cases were made to the effect that child benefit is a payment in respect of the welfare of children.  It is not a bonus for parents but rather a recognition of children.  Since the children's rights referendum we have placed children's well-being and their rights at the centre of the debate and looked to practical means by which to vindicate those rights and ensure that the well-being of children is delivered as a State.  Child benefit is one of the ways in which the State delivers its duty to children.  Parents are the facilitators of that in that they are entrusted to effectively deliver that well-being, but the case could be made that their well-being is very different from the family income supplement and the back to work family dividend.  It is a specific payment for children from the State that is entrusted to parents for them to administer to children.  Bringing the employment status and so on into the mix is a serious concern.</p> <p>I become concerned, and with due respect to my colleague, when I hear delays being given as an excuse.  The way to get this done quickly is to sign the waiver that allows us to access the information we need.  We do not want those who do not give permission for this to face a longer delay.  It is a question of whether to expedite or not.  We saw the case recently about car insurance, which was withdrawn, in which those seeking car insurance were told that if they signed a waiver to allow all their social media feed be accessed by the car insurance company, they would get a faster decision and a preferable rate.  However, it was rightly recognised at the time that what people were actually being told was that if they did not sign those waivers the decision on their application will be slower and they will get a less preferable rate.</p> <p>I do not believe it is the Department's intention but there is a danger that people will feel that if they do not give information or support access to their employers, the Department could somehow delay or make it more difficult for someone to get child benefit.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Of course, there is also the option of trusting people and checking in with them at the end of the year.  We do it in taxation areas and that trust is seen in some schemes.  There is a huge range of areas in society in which we trust people.  Then we check at the end of the year when we have the figures and if there is an anomaly it is addressed at that point.</p><p>My colleague has been very reasonable and has put forward small and constructive amendments.  However, I have a deeper concern about this overall amendment.</p></speech>

I agree with my colleague's sentiment that we should be narrowing the criteria for the State to be able to have access to employers' and employees' information, payslips and so forth.  What plans would the Department have for such information?  We should not go down the slippery slope of using it for the purpose of statistics for means testing child benefit.  One might think that is a big jump but I can envisage the possibility of the information that is collected being used in an argument for means testing child benefit, whereby one could say that so many people earning X amount of money are also receiving child benefit.  It should never be used for that purpose.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-12-06a.339" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016120600002#NN00300"><p>I assure Senator Ardagh that our policy is that child benefit will remain universal.  There are no plans to means test or tax it.  However, if we were of that mind, we would have access to that information through people's PPS numbers in any case.  However, that is certainly not the purpose for which we would use this information and we collect this information already.</p> <p>I emphasise that the key point of this provision is to facilitate the most effective means of ensuring prompt payment of child benefit to our customers.  The purpose of the section is to underpin the process whereby the Department contacts employers to verify continuing employment specifically for child benefit purposes.  The provision is modelled on existing provisions for other social welfare schemes, such as FIS, back-to-work family dividend and maternity, paternity and carer's benefit.  The Department is already empowered by these provisions to contact employers to verify employment details to establish entitlement, new or ongoing, to benefits.</p> <p>In general, the onus is on customers to prove to the Department that they qualify for the social welfare payment for which they are applying.  This includes child benefit, whether payable in accordance with EU regulations or under domestic legislation.  EU and EEA citizens and Swiss nationals working in Ireland qualify for child benefit under EU regulations.  Their children may be resident either here or in their home countries.  Where children are resident abroad, customers are required to confirm their continued entitlement to child benefit every six months.  This includes a statement from the customer or their spouse or partner's employer confirming that the employment is expected to continue.</p> <p>While it is correct that the employment status of an Irish parent is immaterial to a child benefit claim, all child benefit customers claiming under domestic legislation must satisfy the habitual residency condition.  One of the factors being taken into account in determining habitual residence is the nature and pattern of the person's employment.  A person is exempt from satisfying the habitual residence condition if they or their spouse or partner is currently employed.  For these reasons it is sometimes necessary for the Department to have access to information on the employment of the customer or his or her spouse or partner for child benefit purposes.</p> <p>In a small number of cases, situations arise where it is less problematic and more convenient for the customer if the Department can contact their employer directly to confirm their employment.  The volume of these inquiries is very small.  Currently, it averages approximately ten cases per week, and almost all of these relate to claims under EU regulations.  As I explained during the debate in the D&aacute;il, there are instances when the employment details required are not those of the customer but relate to the spouse, partner, ex-spouse or ex-partner.  In such instances, the co-operation of that person is not always forthcoming.  This can lead to situations where a customer does have an entitlement to payment, but where that entitlement cannot be established or where establishing that entitlement could be delayed.  The most efficient and customer-focused way in which entitlement can be determined in such circumstances is for the Department to seek the required information directly from the employer.  Having this provision in place will ensure that the Department has a robust legislative basis to make these inquiries where the need arises.  We do this already, but we wish to ensure we have a solid legislative basis for doing so.</p> <p>The Department has records of social insurance contributions.  However, as was mentioned earlier, these only become available at the end of the year and can only be updated in arrears.  That could lead to a delay.  Employers are only ever contacted on an individual, case-by-case basis and never on a bulk basis.  We are keenly aware of our data protection obligations.  Any personal data collected by the Department are collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and are not further processed in any way that is incompatible with those obligations.</p> <p>I appreciate what Senator Ruane's amendment seeks to do and the safeguards it seeks to put in place.  It refers to examples I gave during the D&aacute;il debate, which would be encompassed by this provision and the regulations that would be made on foot of the provision.  However, it is the practice that the detail is set out in the regulations rather than in the primary legislation.  As I said previously, if this section is enacted I will make regulations which will set out the information that will be sought from employers for child benefit purposes and the circumstances in which it will be sought.  As part of the drafting process, the Department will liaise with the Office of the Attorney General to ensure that the regulations are appropriate and proportionate.  When made, the regulations will be supplemented by the operational guidelines to which deciding officers must have regard.  The guidelines, as always, will be published on the Department&rsquo;s website.</p> <p>I appreciate there are some genuine concerns that this provision could be abused or that there might be an alternative agenda here.  I am not asking anybody to give me a blank cheque.  To further allay concerns Senators may have, I am happy to bring the draft regulations before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social Protection in order that its members will have an opportunity to fully examine them and make their views known.  I give a commitment that I will not sign the regulations unless the joint committee is happy with them.</p></speech>

I will go a little further and discuss the homemaker scheme and the homemaker disregard.  Fianna F&aacute;il Members of the Oireachtas have heard from many people, particularly women, who were shocked to learn upon retirement that they were not eligible for the full State contributory pension.  The gap is 37%, as has been outlined already.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Catherine Ardagh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2473"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2473&amp;amp;pid=CatherineArdagh&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Fianna F&aacute;il believes the eligibility criteria for the contributory pension need to be reviewed.  In particular, the operation of the homemaker scheme needs to be reconsidered to address the anomaly in calculating the contributory pension.  At present, people who took time out of the workforce prior to 1994 to care for children or elderly relatives are disadvantaged.  In many instances, their entitlement to the State pension is greatly reduced.  Although Fianna F&aacute;il recognises that amending the homemaker scheme would have significant costs and administrative implications, we believe consideration should be given to examining the feasibility of amending the method of calculating contributory pensions.  The system already disregards time spent in the home since 1994 for the purposes of calculating the yearly average contributions.  We should explore the feasibility of backdating this further, perhaps to 1973 or 1953.</p><p>This amendment also contains a proposal with regard to the family income supplement, FIS, scheme.  Fianna F&aacute;il acknowledges that FIS is a vital payment for low-income families.  We believe the Minister should consider reviewing this payment to make it more effective than it already is.  A number of suggestions are worth examining in this context, including a reduction in the number of hours of work required to qualify for this payment in the case of one-parent households.  This should be done to recognise that those who are parenting alone need more flexible arrangements and that almost 59% of lone-parent households experience deprivation.  We have to examine how the social welfare system is operating and how it can be reformed to make it more effective and responsive to the needs of those who rely on it.  The method of calculating FIS payments is quite complex.  There is no single rate.  A rather complex method of calculation is used.  It can be difficult for prospective applicants who are considering taking up employment to know what their FIS payments might be.  Therefore, it is important to examine how FIS is calculated and how it can be simplified so that prospective applicants are more readily able to ascertain what their income from FIS and paid employment might be.</p><p>I ask the Minister to consider commissioning reports on both of these issues.  I will probably not press this amendment today.  No Senator has pursued the question of the gender pension gap today, but it is something we will have to pursue some day.  I hope the Minister notes that.</p></speech>

The discussion on amendment No. 4, in my name, reflected the need for the first, second and third tiers of our pension system to be repaired in the long term.  This amendment relates to a more urgent issue.  The Minister has acknowledged that the current position is unequal.  Everybody knows it is unfair that a person who has worked for a greater number of years can be entitled to less, but that is basically where we are.</p> <p>I am aware that the policy for some years now has been to move towards a total contributions approach by 2020, but problems have arisen while we have been waiting for that to happen.  I might be wrong, but I understand this has been an issue since 2004 or 2006.  I know the National Women's Council Of Ireland made a submission at that time.  We have been waiting for the total contributions approach for some time.  We cannot simply wait this issue out for another four years.</p> <p>This urgent and direct issue of clear inequality can be repaired.  It is not appropriate that we would expect people to wait for the next four years for the total contributions approach, or some other system like a supplementary retirement savings scheme, to be put in place and for systematic repairs to be made to the first tier.  As a result of the ridiculous anomaly that exists at present, people are not allowed to average the actual contributions they have made over their lives in a way that would be appropriate.  Under the situation we are leaving in place, just a small number of years can be disregarded.  The wider question of moving from a disregard to a credit is part of the bigger picture that is the total contribution debate.</p> <p>I urge the Minister to tell us whether he expects that by the time he comes before us in the aftermath of budget 2018, he will have looked into the anomaly in the homemaker scheme that has been highlighted by Senator Ardagh.  I know he has indicated he wants to look at this anomaly, but does he expect to be in a position to bring forward proposals to address it in budget 2018, rather than waiting until 2020?  I think the shorter timeframe of three months suggested by Senator Ardagh is appropriate because this specific issue cannot wait and needs to be addressed promptly.</p> <p>I know Deputy Shortall has highlighted issues with defined benefit schemes in light of the ongoing INM scandal.  I reserve the right to return to this issue on Report Stage.  I strongly support the amendment before the House.</p></speech>

I am always happy to discuss these issues in the course of these debates and on other occasions inside and outside the Oireachtas.</p> <p>The homemaker scheme has been discussed previously in the Oireachtas.  This Government and previous Governments have outlined the background to the scheme and explained why it has not been backdated.  The contributory State pension is based on contributions paid into the Social Insurance Fund, which in turn finances contributory benefits on a pay-as-you-go basis.  The State pension, the widow's and widower's contributory pension and the State contributory pension are the three main pensions paid by the Department of Social Protection to people over the age of 66.  Prior to the introduction of the homemaker scheme in 1994, there was no provision for the recognition of periods of homemaking.  It is estimated that the net cost to the Exchequer of applying the homemaker scheme to periods of homemaking prior to 1994 would be &euro;290 million in 2017.  This would increase annually.  It is clear that the introduction of such a change would not have left any room for increases in the basic State pension this year and very little room for measures to support other groups.  The increase we announced in the recent budget will benefit all pensioners over the age of 66, regardless of their PRSI records.</p> <p>The current yearly average system is due to be replaced by the total contributions approach from around 2020.  I would certainly like to do it sooner than 2020 if that is at all possible.  The position of homemaker credits will be considered carefully in the context of that reform and will have to feature in it.  While the Department of Social Protection will keep the homemaker scheme under review, any improvements to the current system which could result in further costs for the Exchequer will have to be considered in a budgetary context.  I want to consider such improvements in the context of budget 2018.  I do not think it would be possible to make all of the changes, or address all of the anomalies, in one budget.  I would like to show form in 2018 by doing something to show some progress in this area.</p> <p>This amendment also calls for a review of the operation of FIS to see how it could be improved to encourage and facilitate people in re-entering the workforce.  As part of A Programme for a Partnership Government, the Department is examining the effectiveness of FIS and a range of other supports that are provided to jobseekers and people in employment with a view to developing a new working family payment.  This payment will seek to ensure working families have an incentive to make the transition from welfare to employment.  The overall aim of FIS is to encourage employment among low-income workers with children.  More specifically, FIS seeks to minimise labour market disincentives for parents who take up work, to prevent in-work poverty among households with children and to tackle child poverty through income support to children in low-income working households.  The objectives of FIS have remained intact since it was introduced in 1984.  Like all Department of Social Protection schemes, it has been consistently reviewed and has been the subject of some significant changes over the years.  The eligibility criteria relating to the number of hours worked have been amended, the basis for assessing income increases and thresholds has been changed and there has been a reduction in the FIS multiplier.</p> <p>The number of families receiving FIS doubled between 2008 and 2015 from approximately 28,000 to approximately 56,000.  A number of factors, including demographic and labour market trends, income reductions, increases in the thresholds, information improvements and changes in the tax and welfare systems, have led to the increase in the takeup of FIS.  One of the main benefits of FIS is the security of the payment.  When the level of FIS is determined, it continues to be payable at that level for a year, regardless of any change in family circumstances, such as an increase or decrease in earnings, as long as the person continues to be employed.  This aspect of the scheme ensures income stability and minimises administrative effort.  One of the best ways to tackle child poverty is to enable parents to get into work.  The family income supplement and back-to-work family dividend payments will continue to support parents in taking up and remaining in employment, especially those furthest from the labour market.  The Department is currently examining the effectiveness of FIS and a range of other supports for jobseekers and people in employment in the context of the development of the new working family payment.  I hope this payment will be a centrepiece of the 2018 budget.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Leo Varadkar:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2192"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2192&amp;amp;pid=LeoVaradkar&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Considerable work and analysis needs to be done to develop the payment.  Work undertaken to develop the new payment will be guided by two principles.  First, it should ensure that work pays and that no family is better off on welfare than at work, and, second, though equally important, it should have a positive effect on child poverty.</p><p>Making work pay cannot just be about welfare payments and top-ups; it must also be about higher pay.  The Government also commits to supporting an increase in the national minimum wage, including a modest increase from 1 January 2017.  The Government will also strengthen the role of the Low Pay Commission to examine the gender pay gap and strengthen regulations on precarious work.  Once the analysis and the design of the working family payment has been completed, I will bring it to the joint committee for a detailed discussion.</p></speech>

Sinn F&eacute;in has tabled a motion on the gender gap, which will be debated in the D&aacute;il tomorrow.  We will learn a little more and I seek cross-party support, particularly from Fianna F&aacute;il given Senator Ardagh has eloquently defended women and referred to the gender gap that has been in place over our lifetimes.</p></speech>

We are all keen to get this legislation through before the recess not so we can go on holiday, but so the measures that are due to kick in on 1 January do so, including an improvement in the disregards for lone parents.  I appreciate the fact that the Senator will withdraw the amendment.  I intend to feature the WFP and the changes to the home-maker's scheme in the 2018 budget and I commit to publishing reports on both issues within six months, well before the next budget, because it is clear from the debates in both Houses that Members want the WFP or something more for children than was provided in the next year's budget, and a measure to close the gap in pension provision for women and men.  I will have those reports for the joint committee in the next six months and I will get something done on both issues in the next budget.</p></speech>
