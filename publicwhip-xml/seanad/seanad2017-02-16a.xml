It requested that Clare County Council have a representative on the board of Shannon Airport and the Shannon Group.  This is a reasonable request given there is an indelible link, which I am sure the Minister appreciates, between Shannon Airport and the people of County Clare.  For many decades, people from County Clare emigrated to the United States and other countries due to economic circumstances and the last port of call for them to see their loved ones was Shannon Airport.  Many of those people returned on holidays to Ireland and passed through Shannon Airport.  The people of County Clare have a significant emotional attachment to the airport.  Separate from its extremely important role as the economic driver of the region, it also plays a role in terms of connectivity with other parts of the world.  It also plays an important role in terms of generating income and jobs and facilitating the many businesses that are located not just in Shannon but in Limerick and the mid-west.  It plays a crucial role in terms of tourism but not just for people from the mid-west travelling abroad.  Much more importantly, many hundreds of thousands of visitors come to the west of Ireland and they do not all come from Dublin.  The Minister is cognisant of the importance of regional diversity.  Many of these people come through Shannon Airport.  There is a very strong traditional link between America and Shannon.  The councillors on Clare County Council, who represent 106,000 citizens of County Clare at local level, believe their voices and opinions and ability to promote and counsel are not being taken on board by the Shannon Group simply because they do not have a position at the table.</p> <p> I have huge regard for this Minister and what he is doing in terms of State appointments, of ensuring there is accountability and credibility and of ensuring people with integrity and ability serve on State boards.  He will appreciate, more than anyone, the importance of including a representative from the local authorities.  We must bear in mind that it is not just a question of the 26 elected members of the local authority but also the executive, the senior management team and the nearly 1,000 people who work there, as well as the expertise, the local knowledge, the driving of enterprise and the marketing of the region that the local authority does internationally.  When representatives of Clare County Council travel abroad, for example, to the Milwaukee Irish Fest and other events, it is always Shannon Airport they are promoting.  It is as if the airport and the local authority are joined at the hip.  As such, I am of the view that it would be an appropriate step to create a position on the board of directors for a representative from the local authority in Clare.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-02-16a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017021600003#B00200"><p>I thank Senator Conway for raising what is a very important and topical matter and for putting such a strong case for what he believes in.  I know he is a very consistent advocate for the people of Clare and for Shannon Airport, and in particular for the links between Shannon Airport and the people.  The case he has made here today is one which they will appreciate and one which could be considered when we are setting out criteria for airports, namely, that boards should at least coincide with regional policy, as the Government spells it out.</p><p>As the Senator may be aware, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform issued new guidelines in November 2014 on appointments to State boards with a view to introducing a more structured approach to such appointments.  In accordance with those guidelines, all appointments to vacancies on State boards must satisfy the following criteria: they must be advertised openly on the State boards website operated by the Public Appointments Service, PAS; they must meet specific and detailed criteria determined by the relevant Minister necessary for the effective performance of the relevant role; and they must be processed by way of a transparent assessment system, designed and implemented by the independent Public Appointments Service to support the relevant Minister in making appointments to State boards under his remit.</p><p>It is no longer open to Ministers to populate boards on a purely <i>ad hoc</i>basis.  It is my objective in my Department to remove, as far as possible, political influence or political patronage in the appointments to State boards because I believe political patronage has been one of the great curses of Irish political life.  In accordance with this new model of appointments, it is open to anyone to register an interest in an appointment to a State board.  They simply have to go online on the PAS website and they will receive an alert when vacancies on a particular board are advertised.</p><p>Since coming to office as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have, however, come to the conclusion that these guidelines do not go far enough.  There are too many gaps and there are still huge opportunities under those guidelines for ministerial choice and political patronage.  It would be far better for the boards, the individuals and the State if they were reduced or removed.  For this reason, I reviewed the guidelines with a view to putting in place an additional internal process that would allow me to make appointments with greater confidence in the ability of the selected person to contribute effectively to a State board.  I subsequently approved new internal principles to be implemented by my Department for all appointments.  In essence, these new procedures provide a more thorough and professional and less political process.  The Government-agreed guidelines for appointments to State boards will continue to be applied but, in my Department, an additional internal selection process will be undertaken following the receipt of a list of candidates from PAS.  I have notified PAS and written to the chairs of all the boards under the aegis of my Department setting out details of this additional process.</p><p>My preference is for a more broadly-based PAS assessment panel that would include one or more representative from outside the public sector and also for a minimal number of candidates who met the specified criteria to be submitted to me for consideration.  Interviews, which were inexplicably missing from the 2014 process, are an essential part of the new process in my Department.  As far as possible, I wish to remove my own discretion from the appointments process.</p><p>In regard to Shannon Group specifically, I acknowledge the importance of the local authorities in the region - that is, Clare County Council, Limerick County Council, Tipperary County Council, Galway County Council and Galway City Council - working with the company to ensure its success and that of the region.  The success of Shannon Group will be enhanced by the support and commitment of all stakeholders in the region working together for their mutual benefit.  It is open to representatives of Clare County Council or, indeed, any of the local authorities in the region, to register their interest with PAS.  There is currently one vacancy on the board of Shannon Group and I hope this will be advertised on the PAS website shortly.</p></speech>

Given that it has not been an easy week, I am sure he is extremely busy so I want to thank him for coming to the House to address this matter.  I will advise all members of Clare County Council that they should nominate somebody through that process.  I sincerely hope the gap in local representation on the board can be addressed through the public appointments system.  Of course, what I would like to see is a more formalised structure whereby a nominee is accommodated on the board, but we will take it one step at a time.  I thank the Minister for his contribution and for coming to the House personally to deal with this.</p></speech>

Cuirim c&eacute;ad f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  T&aacute;im an-bhu&iacute;och d&oacute; as teacht isteach. T&aacute;im an-bhu&iacute;och don Chathaoirleach, a roghnaigh an cheist seo.  Is ceist iontach pr&aacute;inneach &iacute; at&aacute; ag teacht chun cinn.</p>  <p>I have been given documentation which suggests a senior management official with Galway City Council was allocated a house by another council official under the affordable housing scheme and that he was not eligible for this.  It is claimed the income limit for the scheme was &euro;36,500 and that the income for the position he was known to be in would have been at least double that, which should have deemed him ineligible for the scheme.  It is asserted that the official in question has since retired and received a pension lump sum.  It is claimed that he already had a primary residence prior to purchasing this house and that this new house is now being rented out.</p>  <p>I am told a number of other senior officials also acquired houses, which are essentially assets of the taxpayer, and they would appear to have profited financially in that the houses have risen dramatically in value, with a significant dividend accruing to them at a cost to the taxpayer.  The documentation also indicates that other officials were awarded houses in excess of their need; for example, some were given three-bedroom houses when their need was only justified as a one-bedroom or two-bedroom house.  It is alleged that officials were allocating the better houses to their colleagues and that they were getting priority over other people on the waiting lists.  If these allegations are true, it is a very serious situation.  Questions need to be asked as to how the Minister of State, Deputy English, and the Department will ensure that such irregularities cannot happen.  If the Minister of State has any knowledge of the case I have mentioned, I would be interested to know.  If so, what does he intend to do about it?  I would also like him to clarify whether his Department is aware of similar cases happening in other local authorities.</p> <p>If this is happening, it is grossly unfair to the thousands of people with a legitimate housing need who are being pushed down the waiting lists due to these irregular allocations.  I have sought this debate because we need to investigate these serious allegations.</p> <p>I note, from media reports dating back to May 2014, that an investigation was begun by the former city manager, Joe O'Neill, and was being continued by the current manager, Brendan McGrath.  It did not, however, become public until media sources submitted lists of questions to city hall in the previous week regarding the fact that an internal investigation was taking place and that the alleged improper allocation of dwellings involved a number of staff members understood to be in the Galway City Council housing department.</p> <p>That internal investigation was ongoing at the time and we were told that there was going to be a report issuing soon after.  My understanding is that report has not been made available.  I do not know whether the public representatives on Galway City Council have seen it.  I understand they have not.  Has either the Minister of State or the Department been made aware that this investigation was happening?  If so, has the report been received.  If it has, could the Minister of State furnish us with a copy of that report in order that we might see what were the findings?  In a time of huge crisis in housing, when people are under massive pressure on very long housing lists, to even think that officials within a housing department were allocating and cherry-picking houses that were available to the local authority beggars belief.  It would also be extremely serious.  I look forward to the Minister of State's response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-02-16a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017021600004#C00200"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue.  I will highlight the statutory basis for the provision of social housing support.  Under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the associated regulations made thereunder, the assessment of households for social housing support - and the allocation of that support - is a matter for individual housing authorities in accordance with the prescribed criteria.  Households that qualify for social housing support on assessment are entered onto the housing authority's waiting list and are considered for the allocation of suitable tenancies in accordance with the authority's allocation scheme made by the elected members under section 22 of the 2009 Act.</p>  <p>As indicated, the assessment of individual housing applications and the allocation of accommodation to qualified households are matters solely for housing authorities.  In the context of housing matters generally, the Minister has limited powers to give directions and guidelines to housing authorities under sections 4 and 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  However, section 6 of that Act specifically provides that these powers do not permit the Minister to exercise any power or control in the context of any particular case with which a housing authority is or may be concerned.  I must also highlight the independence of local authorities in performing their functions, as provided for under section 63 of the Local Government Act 2001.  The Minister has no role in the normal day-to-day operations of individual local authorities.  The Minister's role in respect of local government is primarily to provide the policy, financial and legislative framework within which local authorities perform their functions.</p>  <p>In that context, it is important to note that the Local Government Act 2001, Part 15, includes important provisions in relation to the ethical framework applicable to the local government sector, including providing a statutory basis for a code of conduct that has been issued for all local authority employees.  In the ordinary course of events, it would be a matter for the relevant local authority, in the first instance, to investigate any allegations of malpractice regarding the operation of its housing allocation system.  Subject to the outcome of any such investigation, it would then be for the local authority to consider what further action, either internally or by way of referring the matter to other relevant appropriate authorities, may be required.  Matters concerning the allocation of social housing in one local authority have been referred to in correspondence received by my Department and this is the subject of ongoing engagement with the local authority concerned.</p>  <p>If the Senator is aware of any cases which he considers require investigation, he should forward details to the appropriate authorities, be that the chief executive of the relevant local authority or, in the event that criminal conduct is alleged, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, or through such other channels as may be appropriate.</p></speech>

It does not answer the question I asked about this specific case in Galway City Council, whether the Minister of State is aware of it and has received the report.  That report was to have been done in 2014.  Surely by now the Minister of State should have got a copy of that report if it has been done.  If so will he correspond with me to let me know whether it has been received.  I will contact Galway City Council on the issue and if I feel it necessary I will contact An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and any other channels.</p>  <p>The Minister of State does not indicate whether there are similar issues in any other local authorities.  If it is widespread, that would be a matter of great public concern.  To say that the Minister has no responsibility is not good enough.  We need the Minister to take control of the situation in order to ensure that we have a fair, transparent and open allocation system that cannot be abused by officials, particularly those within the housing department who deal with people that are under huge pressure to find homes.  Will the Minister of State indicate whether he has received that report from Galway City Council.  If he has received it, will he supply a copy to me?  Will he also indicate whether any other local authorities are undergoing investigations of this type?</p></speech>

The Senator asked were there other examples.  I said very clearly one local authority has been referred to in correspondence with us.  That is being dealt with.  I cannot be any clearer than that.  One has been referred to us and we are investigating it.</p>  <p>The Senator raised a few different issues.  They are all very serious and should be dealt with.  Any information the Senator possesses should be handed over through the appropriate channels.  It is up to the Senator to judge which are appropriate.  I have outlined the various options.  If the Senator has such information, that is very serious.  He is absolutely right to say this is taxpayers' money and we have to ensure that housing policy and allocation of houses is managed correctly throughout the system.  It is a combination of local and national government.  The Senator should pass along any information in his possession.</p></speech>

Only yesterday, the ninth case was confirmed.  I compliment the Minister of State , the Minister, Deputy Creed, and the Department officials for the swift and appropriate action they took to minimise the effect of this bird flu within the Irish poultry business by introducing a compulsory housing order whereby all commercial poultry are kept indoors.  I also compliment the poultry farmers who, by complying with that compulsory order, have to date kept this disease out of the commercial flock.</p>  <p>There are, however, many members of the industry who trade solely in the free range category, particularly free range eggs.  Under EU and Irish legislation, if free range hens are continually housed for a period exceeding 12 weeks they lose their free range status.  Can any action be taken to help the people involved to overcome this problem?  They are in this position because they are doing what they were asked to do in good faith.  I commend the Department and the farmers for their action but they will be victims of their own vigilance.  The Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development was asked about this matter but he is not for lifting the derogation.  Can we think outside the box?  Is there a plan B to help these people get over the potential loss of their free range status which would put many of them out of business?  They will lose their contractual markets.  If they want to sell their eggs into the standard market, they will have to rebrand and remarket.  This will have potentially serious consequences for these people.  Rather than try to compensate and rebuild the industry after it has been lost, can we come up with some solution before that happens?</p></speech>

Following my opening comments I will be happy to further develop the points with the Senator in a subsequent conversation.</p>  <p>Avian influenza refers to the disease caused by infection with avian influenza or bird flu type A viruses.  These viruses occur naturally among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other bird and animal species.  The current events are caused by a H5N8 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, which is present in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Middle East.</p>  <p>The epizootic started at the end of October.  The virus has been confirmed in 37 countries in poultry, captive birds or wild birds.  Over 300 outbreaks have occurred in poultry or captive birds and a further 300 cases in wild birds in Europe since the beginning of January.  Some member states have been particularly badly affected, especially Hungary and France.  Over 70 wild bird species have been affected, mainly water birds, such as ducks, geese and swans, as well as birds of prey.  As the Senator has said, in Ireland there have been only nine confirmed cases in wild birds since 30 December.  These have occurred mainly in migratory swans and ducks.  However, this week, on 10 February, we confirmed cases in a mute swan and a grey heron.  These are resident species.  Thankfully, to date, there have been no cases confirmed in commercial poultry flocks.</p>  <p>As a result of an increased risk of highly pathogenic avian influenza affecting commercial poultry flocks in Ireland, my Department introduced regulations on 23 December 2016 under the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 requiring flock keepers to confine all poultry and captive birds in their possession or under their control in a secure building to which wild birds or other animals do not have access and to apply particular bio-security measures.  The Avian Influenza (Precautionary Confinement of Birds) Regulations 2016 provide for these precautionary measures against bird flu.  These regulations have particular effects on free range poultry flocks.</p>  <p>EU regulations lay down detailed rules regarding marketing standards for eggs and poultry meat.  These regulations set down minimum requirements that must be met to use the term "free range", including rules around access to the range.  The regulations also provide for situations in which veterinary restrictions are imposed to protect public and animal health, as is the case in Ireland, and whereby eggs and poultry meat may continue to be marketed as "free range" for the duration of the restriction but not for more than 12 weeks.</p>  <p>In Ireland's case, the 12-week period expires on 17 March 2017.  Several member states currently have housing restrictions in place.  The issue of what to do after the 12-week period expires was raised at an EU Agriculture and Fisheries Council in January.</p>  <p>Since the meeting in January, the Commission confirmed its intention not to table a proposal to extend the 12-week period during which the eggs or meat from birds subject to a confinement order can continue to be marketed as "free range".  The Commission stated concerns about the integrity and credibility of marketing standards that were introduced for the protection of consumers.  The Commission acknowledged that the 12-week period is a balance between the interests of the producer and the consumer and that it was regarded as a reasonable period to cover an avian flu epidemic.  It is acknowledged that this outbreak or epidemic is prolonged in nature and the possibility that prolonged epidemics of this duration may become a more regular event.  In these circumstances, the Commission has agreed to undertake a review of the marketing standards with a view to a possible modification of the current rule in light of the prolonged epidemic such as the epidemic we are experiencing.</p>  <p>Free range egg production represents approximately 40% of total egg production in Ireland.  Free range meat production represents approximately 5% of total poultry meat production.  The importance of these free range enterprises, which are based in rural Ireland and provide jobs to the local economy, is foremost in our considerations.</p>  <p>Staff in the Permanent Representation of Ireland to the EU in Brussels have engaged directly with agriculture officials in the European Commission on this matter and are liaising closely with officials in the Department.  They have been considering practical solutions in the event that the Avian Influenza (Precautionary Confinement of Birds) Regulations 2016 remain in force on 17 March and beyond.</p>  <p>I am mindful of the Senator's concerns and I share them.  Producers and consumers have concerns too and I believe it is necessary to work to strike a balance between these competing needs.</p>  <p>Yesterday, I was briefed further on this matter.  Key stakeholders representing free range eggs and poultry meat producers, packers, processors and retailers attended a meeting at the invitation of officials in my Department to consider practical solutions to the labelling of product from free range poultry after 17 March should the restriction remain.  Industry representatives are considering the proposals and further engagement is planned.</p>  <p>The decision to maintain the Avian Influenza (Precautionary Confinement of Birds) Regulations 2016 is subject to regular review by officials in my Department.  It has been decided that the requirement to keep poultry and captive birds confined in Ireland will remain in place due to the continued findings of the virus in wild birds in Ireland.  Moreover, it is considered necessary to protect the high health status of the larger national commercial poultry flock.</p>  <p>The most important actions that flock owners can take to protect their birds include, unfortunately, keeping them indoors and applying strict bio-security measures.  Many outbreaks throughout Europe have been identified in housed poultry.  Housing alone does not eliminate the risk but it certainly reduces it.  The Department has produced material on the website for the various sectors to assist bird keepers.</p></speech>

I appreciate that this situation is unprecedented.  As the Minister of State rightly pointed out, those of us who have an interest in the sector are all living in hope by virtue of the fact that until the last two confirmations, the birds affected were migratory birds.  It might have been a question of living in hope somewhat and the expectation that they would migrate earlier than mid-March and in that way alleviate the problem.  However, as the Minister of State has rightly pointed out, the most recent cases have involved native Irish birds.  This leaves open the probability that we will not lift the compulsory housing order by 17 March.</p>  <p>The Minister of State will appreciate from what I have said already that poultry farmers with free range status are between the proverbial rock and hard place.  Do they abide by the compulsory housing order and lose free range status?  Will there be a temptation on 16 or 17 March to undertake some supervised net covered release of the hens to enable them to tick one box?  Ultimately, I believe there will be a reversal of that and that they should not have to release them.  If the Minister of State was in that situation and his livelihood was at stake, he would have a sleepless night on 16 March.  God knows, what decisions will be made off the cuff.</p>  <p>We have a little more than a month to the date.  I have raised the matter today rather than coming to the House on 18, 19 or 20 March when the horse has bolted.  I am delighted to hear about the negotiations with the stakeholders and that the European Union authorities will review the matter.  When will that review take place?  I doubt it will have come to fruition by 17 March.</p>  <p>I hope the Minister of State keeps his finger on the pulse on this matter.  He referred to 40% of the eggs being free range.  That is a lot.  For the people concerned, it is everything; it is their livelihood.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-02-16a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1356" speakername="Andrew Doyle" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017021600005#D00300"><p>I was surprised to learn the figure was as high as 40%.  I knew it was significant but I had not realised that it was that high.  The feedback from yesterday's meeting is that all sides were engaged.  The relevant parties include the food and drink industry, IBEC, the IFA and all the various stakeholders referred to earlier.  Those involved are trying to think outside the box.  One option is an over-lay label that explains the context.  In reality, if poultry has to stay inside, the produce will be deemed to be barn produced meat or eggs.  An over-lay for free range stock temporarily confined could explain the position to the consumer.  That option is being looked at.</p> <p>There have been a number of suggestions and these have been left for consideration and comment from all sectors, so it is an ongoing consultation.  The officials in my Department tell me they expect to have fairly active engagement.  As Senator Daly says, we have about four or five weeks before this becomes a live issue.  There was significant hope that the migratory season would end and that would take it away.  The concern is that the latest two outbreaks have been in resident species which, wild though they are, will not be going anywhere.  It is important that we contain it.</p> <p>The problem with letting them out before we know we are safe is that if there is an outbreak in the flock, one is wiped out for a period of production time.  That is nearly a bigger consequence than loss of free range status.  If this were to go on, it would be important that the industry and retailers would work together in order that consumers would know exactly what they were buying and that they were produced from free range animals.  We are not going to have competitors from outside the country coming in and taking the market, because they have had to confront this problem before us.  That is the reason they have already been to the Commission, because their 12 weeks is due to expire or maybe has expired in some cases.  As I said, it is affecting other countries in Europe worse than it is affecting us.</p></speech>

This is one of the biggest matters that has been before the House.  It is important that the inquiry commences and that its terms of reference cover all the allegations.  The information needs to come out into the public domain.  It is important that the truth comes out for the families involved and that they get the justice they ultimately deserve.  How they have been treated is appalling.  The garda&iacute; involved also deserve to have the truth come out because their reputations have been stained.  There are many hardworking garda&iacute; who need to be protected.  The truth will come out from this tribunal of inquiry and everyone will be protected.</p><p>October last year was the first occasion on which I voiced my concerns about the first-time buyer's grant.  At the time, I stated it would not help people get on to the property market and would only increase the prices of new builds.  In 2016, house prices rose by over 8% nationwide and by over 5% in Dublin.  Today, a report from the ratings agency Standard &amp;amp; Poor's indicates that house prices are set to rise by a further 7% this year, with the Government's help-to-buy scheme playing a massive part in boosting demand.</p><p>Boosting demand will not solve the problem.  The problem is supply.  The severe lack of housing supply is one of many issues the Government has ignored for way too long.  There are many actions the Government can take to increase supply, such as looking at construction standards, architect approvals and building regulations for new builds, as well as the vacant sit levies and getting rid of the development levy.  The Government needs to be more proactive in getting new homes built in Dublin city and at other locations throughout the country.</p><p>According to the Standard &amp;amp; Poor's report, the severe lack of supply could see houses prices grow more than expected as the number of new homes for sale has dropped to the lowest figure in ten years.  Last month, <i>daft.ie</i>and <i>myhome.ie</i>reported that just over 42,000 properties nationwide were for sale on their websites in December 2016, the lowest since January 2007.  These figures indicate that only around 1% of housing stock is currently listed for sale.  A normal functioning market would typically boast a turnover of 4% of housing stock.  I was shocked to discover there are only 3,619 properties listed for sale in Dublin.  Trinity College Dublin economist Ronan Lyons believes that we need to build 50,000 new homes every year to deal with ever-increasing demand.  In 2016, only 14,000 new homes were built.  Although we are talking about this matter all the time, I have not seen evidence of any massive impetus or incentives for to builders to increase supply.  This matter is the elephant in the room and we have failed to take it seriously.  I will keep raising it until it is properly addressed.</p></speech>

I remain in that position.  Those duties, however, do not prevent me from fulfilling my constitutional and statutory functions as a Member of the Oireachtas regarding the proposal to establish a tribunal of inquiry under the 1921 Act, to examine and report on those matters and on the terms of reference which this House will debate this evening.  In that context, I am looking forward to the debate.</p>  <p>It would be wrong for me to refrain from stating in this House that the fairness and appropriateness of establishing such an inquiry, while the Garda Commissioner, N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan, continues to exercise her authority and discharge her functions as Commissioner, is very much an issue.</p></speech>

The relationship between the Government and the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must be based on confidence.  In anyone's language, confidence includes a solid belief and a working assumption that the person in question is truthful, reliable and appropriate to be in the position in every respect.</p> <p>Confidence cannot be said to exist if sufficient doubt exists in the mind of the Government in respect of the gravest allegations to warrant the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry.  Moreover, confidence involves an assumption of the truthfulness of a person.  When we come to a situation where there is a direct conflict between that person's position as publicly stated and that of Superintendent David Taylor, and if we are operating on the assumption that the Commissioner is being truthful, that necessarily suggests that we are operating on the assumption that the allegations against her are false.  That is not the position of members of the public or Members of this House.</p> <p>It is inconceivable that officers, including senior officers, of a disciplined force should be asked in their evidence to accuse, on oath and in public, of grave misbehaviour the person who is in charge of them day to day or that they be permitted to instruct counsel to cross-examine that person as to her honesty, reliability and suitability for office.  It is also wrong in principle that the Garda force in its entirety, which will have a duty to co-operate in finding, presenting and making discovery of all records and evidence in its possession relating to the issues under consideration, should be under the day-to-day control of a person whose suitability for office is necessarily a central issue in that tribunal of inquiry.</p> <p>Accordingly, I want to state in the strongest possible terms that there is no reason at all for the Government to permit the Commissioner to remain in office and she must step aside either temporarily for the three month duration of the tribunal and until it has reported or else permanently.  People in this House have said, and rightly so, that we should not be judge and jury in this matter.  The rights of all persons to fairness comes first, including the rights of the public and everybody whose interests are at stake in this tribunal.  The determination of the Commissioner to remain in office during the tribunal is neither fair, appropriate nor defensible.</p></speech>

It is disturbing that the Garda Commissioner is refusing to step aside for the duration of the public tribunal of inquiry.  It is even more disturbing that the Government, the Cabinet and their partners in government, Fianna F&aacute;il, feel that this is okay.  It is wrong and I would ask all involved to reflect on that and to understand the predicament they put some witnesses in.  The mere fact the Commissioner will not step aside and will be left in her position will do a disservice to Sergeant Maurice McCabe and his family.  I hope that by the time Senators return to the House next Tuesday the situation will have been resolved and the Commissioner will have stepped aside to allow the tribunal to do the work required to get to the truth.</p><p>The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, did not answer one question last night in this House.  I understand the Minister ran out of time but I and other mothers and citizens of the State need to know that there are not files held by Tusla on our children or on ourselves.  We need to be given confidence that this does not happen.  The Minister needs to put in place some kind of facility whereby we can check if that is the case, especially those of us who have spoken out against the justice system and against the behaviour of some senior members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or who have spoken out against the behaviour of the garda&iacute; in disputes such as at the Corrib gas project and the protests at Shannon Airport and so on.</p><p>I also want to discuss the fact we are in the third week of the ongoing dispute at the Tim Hastings Volkswagen garage in Westport.  This is the third week where workers and their families have had to stand out in inclement weather to try to engage with management to bring about a resolution.  Last week the Leader of the House said it was a matter for the mechanisms of the State, specifically the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and that it was important the mechanisms of the State were used to reach a solution.  I absolutely agree with the Leader, but SIPTU members in the Tim Hastings garage have utilised all the industrial relations machinery of the State available to them.  This was the third time that SIPTU members had to ballot for strike action in an attempt to get management to engage.  In the first instance Tim Hastings Limited refused to attend the WRC to discuss the dispute.  The company relented and attended the WRC eventually but no agreement was reached.  The management side would not even sit in the same room as the union.  The entire conciliation process was held in a side session.  As no agreement was reached at the WRC, the next logical step was to refer the issue to the Labour Court, a highly reputable organisation for resolving disputes.  Again, management only agreed to attend the Labour Court under the threat of strike action and a hearing was held on 4 November 2016.  The Labour Court issued a recommendation on 20 December which said that for the positions genuinely made redundant, the staff affected should be paid an <i>ex gratia</i>redundancy payment of two weeks' salary per year of service in addition to the statutory redundancy and that the parts manger would be given the option of retaining the job or accepting the redundancy.</p><p>I ask that the Taoiseach would get involved in this matter to ensure the company, which is in the Taoiseach's constituency, takes heed of the very institutions and mechanisms of the State that he asked people to recognise.  I ask that Volkswagen Ireland also gets involved to resolve this dispute in order that the workers who want to can return to work and that the Labour Court recommendations are fully implemented.</p></speech>

The construction of 566 new settlement units in occupied east Jerusalem must be condemned.  These settlements are illegal and a violation of international law.  It is imperative that the Government expresses its condemnation of these settlements and makes it known to the Israeli Government that it will lobby its fellow members of the European Union to bring whatever pressure is necessary to force Israel to abide by Security Council Resolution 2334, which condemns the expansion of settlements and the confiscation of Palestinian land.  We know, unfortunately, from previous attempts to halt the expansion of settlements that mere condemnation and resolutions will not deter Israel from its policy of taking over Palestinian land.  The treatment of Palestinian people by the Israeli Government is comparable to the actions of the apartheid regime in South Africa and, as such, must be condemned.  There must also be the imposition of some penalties if the Israelis insist on ignoring their obligations under international law.  I ask the Leader to bring the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, before the House to outline the measures the Government will take to ensure Israel will abide by Security Council Resolution 2334.</p></speech>

They removed the traps, took furniture out from the restaurant and put security on the gates.  The 12 staff who work there were locked out.  These are the actions of the Irish Greyhound Board, which says it wants to save the greyhound industry.  The board held a meeting at the Harold's Cross stadium on the same day they closed it down.  The problem within the greyhound industry stems back to a &euro;20 million debt incurred when the new track was built in Limerick.  The patrons, dog owners, breeders and trainers who use the Harold's Cross stadium are being made to suffer.  There has been an attempt to isolate the patrons and the supporters of the Harold's Cross stadium by saying they are a contrarian group.</p> <p>This week the Irish Greyhound Owners and Breeders Federation had a meeting in the Horse &amp;amp; Jockey Hotel outside Thurles at which Harold's Cross track got the support of federations across the country from Tipperary to Waterford, Kerry, Cork, the north west, the midlands and Northern Ireland.  A protest will be held next Saturday night at Shelbourne Park.  No dogs that have run in the Harold's Cross Greyhound Stadium will run in Shelbourne Park.  Blocking out staff from work, pulling up traps, dismantling furniture and putting padlocks on gates is no way to deal with a problem.  The problem was exacerbated by a statement made by the interim chief executive officer.  He stated:</p><blockquote>We are committed to making Shelbourne Park perform excellently for all Trainers, Owners, Patrons and Staff, especially for those for whom Harold's Cross was their greyhound home.  This will be challenging for all of us but there is a need for all stakeholders to leave aside disagreement and work together through a process of change and opportunity from which improved performance can be extracted.</blockquote><p>This is the same person who gave the go-ahead to put the lock on the gate of Harold's Cross stadium.  It is like pulling a person down a lane, beating the living daylights out of him and then saying, &quot;Come on, we will be friends, we will have a drink together.&quot; <br/><br/>Much reference has been made in this process to the Indecon report, a copy of which I have with me, which is now four years old.  It was published in 2014.  Reference is made to the need to find ways of saving money through the sale of assets, but the only asset that has been mentioned and acted on is the Harold's Cross track.  However, the report states, &quot;Potential asset disposals that should be considered include the site at Meelick, the old Henry Street Head office in Limerick, land in Cork, and the sale of [...] Harold's Cross&quot;.  Just one has been acted on.  The board, including the chair and the interim CEO, have lost the support of the patrons and of the owners and breeders and those involved in the industry want all of them to go.</p></speech>

I agree that we need to have a debate about the greyhound industry in this country, what the board is doing to sustain it and what changes need to be made to assist that industry.</p>  <p>Despite the recent controversies, it is important that we in this House understand and recognise that every citizen in this country has a fundamental right, under our Constitution, to a presumption of innocence unless otherwise proven.  I want to put on the record that I, too, welcome the holding of a public inquiry into the recent controversies around the McCabe case.  The reputation and integrity of our agencies such as Tusla and, indeed, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which has stood by this country since its foundation, are under question until this matter is finally dealt with.  I welcome the move by Government to have a public, transparent inquiry under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Charleton and we will be debating its terms of reference later on.</p>  <p>I wish to raise an issue that has been of interest to me for quite some time, namely, the pyrite issue and the damage that it has done to many homes throughout the country but more especially in the Meath and north Dublin areas.  The previous Government increased funding for the pyrite remediation scheme for the carrying out of remediation works to many of the houses that were affected, and strong and solid progress is being made.  However, there is another similar problem concerning mica in Donegal and north Mayo.  The Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, brought it to my attention a number of years ago and an expert committee was established to closely examine the problems being experienced by the householders affected by mica.  I understand this expert committee is due to report soon.  It has visited the houses affected which are literally crumbling around the families living in them due to concrete work that was insufficient and not of proper integrity.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the pyrite and mica issues and to invite the Minister with responsibility for housing to come into the House in order that we can debate these issues in detail to establish what assistance is being made available and what is planned to assist those families who have been let down by poor regulation in the construction industry.</p></speech>

I welcome that seizure and I am delighted we can send a positive message back to the garda&iacute; in light of what has been happening in the last few days.  I am delighted that they have a positive approach to it being business as usual out on the streets while we are having our shenanigans in here.</p><p>A major issue that seizure highlights is that while this involved an organised criminal gang there is an element of unorganised, two-bit, petty criminals with a monkey see, monkey do attitude at work.  This will raise in their minds that they can harass elderly couples, in particular, in rural areas a little bit more who will not even be familiar with what a Taser gun is.  I would like an issue addressed, and it is not only related to this area, that of the purchasing of materials on the Internet.  While Taser guns are illegal under the Firearms Act in Ireland they can quite easily be purchased on legitimate websites for a mere &euro;50.  We need to address the issue of products which are illegal in this State, especially an item such as a Taser gun which would be used for all the wrong reasons, which can be purchased online for as little as &euro;50 and brought into the country by a courier.  That issue needs to be seriously addressed.</p></speech>

It is a very serious issue which has gone on for far too long.  We have in front of us the terms of reference of the tribunal of inquiry, which I hope can be agreed in this House without politicising the issue.</p>  <p>The issue of the presumption of innocence has been brought forward as a reason that the Garda Commissioner should be left in her position.  There is absolutely no question from anybody here about the presumption of innocence.  Everybody is presumed innocent until they are proven guilty, but the Commissioner must take a neutral position as we enter into this tribunal and the only neutral position she can take its to step down and step aside while the tribunal takes place.  One of her most senior officers will appear before the tribunal in uniform and will tell a story directly opposing the story she will tell.  We cannot have two of the most senior officers in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and I have said this several times-----</p></speech>

In light of the significant issues that have arisen in recent weeks in companies like Tesco, Kerry Foods and Bus &Eacute;ireann, it is about time for all of us to decide whether we believe in the right of trade unions to represent their members.  If we do, can we stand against a Bill that simply provides that trade union officials have the right to access their members in the workplace?  Deputy Cullinane's fine Bill has been copied from similar enactments in New Zealand and Australia.  If Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il do not support a basic Bill that seeks to give trade union rights to trade union members, we will see where they actually stand on workers' rights.

In addition, there was a notable increase in the number of reported sexual offences in the same period, from 1,801 in 2005 to 2,348 in 2015.  Of course there are multiple reasons for these increases, including the increase in the population.  A review of the news from recent months supports these statistics and reveals that numerous assaults occur during the early hours of the morning or evening when people are commuting to and from work.  I suggest that a safety awareness campaign should be rolled out immediately to provide advice on removing earphones at more vulnerable times, staying alert and walking in lit areas.  Notices to that effect could be displayed at DART and Luas stations and on local bus services nationwide.  The prevention of sexual offences is a serious matter that must be investigated.  It must underlie the prosecution of sexual assaults.  If people who tend to be in their own world as they go to and from work each day were to be given small reminders of the dangers that exist, it could have a very good effect.</p>  <p>I would like to return to the issue of the abuse of synthetic and prescription drugs, which I raised on Tuesday.  I do not think we realise the full seriousness of this situation.  I heard some stories in this regard being reported on "Today with Sean O'Rourke" this morning.  I have been in contact with the Minister for Education and Skills since Tuesday to discuss what we are doing to raise awareness of the use of these drugs by children.  Some people start to take these drugs when they are as young as ten years of age.  I suggest that as part of the new well-being educational programme that is being rolled out by the Minister for Education and Skills, children should be specifically educated about this problem.  This may involve bringing children to drug rehabilitation centres or getting somebody who has experience of these drugs to come to schools to speak to young children about the detrimental effects that these drugs, which are so freely available, can have on their lives in the long term.</p></speech>

One of them was a commitment to hire 65 educational psychologists in the first quarter of 2017.  The Leader will agree that the version of this commitment in the updated version of the action plan, as published last week, represents a significant and severe drop because it refers merely to the hiring of ten educational psychologists in the second quarter of 2017.  No explanation has been given for this downgrade.  Members will acknowledge that additional educational psychologists are very much needed in the education system to assist all students who have special needs.  I found it quite startling to learn recently that 199 schools, with approximately 34,575 pupils, do not have access to educational psychologists.  It is a shameful statistic.  Needless to say, the schools that do not have access to educational psychologists are put at a severe disadvantage.  Children with special needs in those schools are being forgotten about.  As we know, teachers are not qualified to diagnose children.  They need experts to assess children in order that recommendations can be made on work programmes for those children in their schools.  I ask the Leader to impress on the Minister for Education and Skills the need to address this issue so that the most needy children can be catered for within our school system.</p></speech>

They were very interested in the Good Friday Agreement, which brought peace to this country, in effect.  I reminded them that the Anglo-Irish Agreement was the forerunner of the Good Friday Agreement.  It did not lead to peace between the two parties, but it set up the institutions that gave the Republic of Ireland a role in Northern Ireland and helped to pave the way for the Good Friday Agreement.  I mention this because the Israeli delegation was very interested in the peace process.  I reminded them that the term "peace process" was coined by the United States in the context of the Israeli-Egyptian negotiations of the 1970s.  We have come an awful long way on the island of Ireland.  I think we have done extremely well.  It is ironic that the term "peace process" is still being used in the Israeli context even though they are still so far away from peace.  The security of the Israeli State was mentioned, as were the illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank and the Palestinian diaspora.  I said that this country is very well placed to act as an independent arbiter in the attempt to help to resolve those issues.  These issues are never black and white.  There are many grey areas.  Our job is not to stand and wave one flag or the other.  We need to see that there are two sides to every story and try to come to some conclusion.  I think this country is well placed to step up to the plate again by helping to negotiating peace settlements in Israel and many other countries.</p></speech>

Ba mhaith liom a fh&aacute;il amach c&eacute;ard at&aacute; ag tarl&uacute; faoi sin.</p> <p>The well-known playwright, actor and activist, Mr. Donal O'Kelly, brought attention back in November and December 2016 to a situation which should be of concern to us all.  Many asylum seekers suddenly found their scheduled asylum interviews cancelled without explanation until further notice.  On 31 December, the International Protection Act 2015 came into effect.  On 5 January 2017, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, website was updated with new content.</p> <p>On 3 February 2017, many asylum seekers in Ireland received newly published 60 page questionnaires, to be completed and returned to INIS within three weeks.  It was 60 pages long, and there was a 30 page guidance booklet, ostensibly to help fill out the 60 page form.  There is a shameful pall of stress and tension hanging over every direct provision reception centre at the moment, Mr. O'Kelly tells us.  People try to find a place to study the monumental tome they have been sent.  People try to make themselves tackle three or four pages a day.  People try to fill in what they can, and leave the hard bits until they are in better form.  People try to find quiet time in the tiny bedroom that they share with two others to read it through from beginning to end.  People who have already been through an interview process must re-enter their data and much new material that is demanded into this new 60 page form.  People ring their appointed solicitors for help with the form like every other applicant and their calls are not returned.</p> <p>There is a huge issue and it is concerning and alarming that asylum seekers should be put into this position.  We were promised that the International Protection Act 2015 would make things easier with a single procedure.  This three week deadline is unfair to those people and they probably do not have the supports that they need.  I call on the Minister for Justice and Equality, who I know is busy with issues this week, to come into this House in order that we can have another debate around people in and seeking asylum, particularly in the direct provision system.  I call for this deadline to be extended and for the proper supports to be given to those people who are going to find it very difficult to fill in a 60 page form without the requisite support.  Perhaps the Leader can bring that to the Minister's attention as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

The Irish Greyhound Board, which is in receipt of a subsidy of &euro;285,000 every week, is grossly unaccountable to the stakeholders operating within the industry, including greyhound owners and breeders.  That was brought to everyone's attention at the weekend when the Harold's Cross stadium was put up for sale in dubious circumstances surrounding the manner in which the gates were closed.</p>  <p>There is a lack of accountability and transparency within the organisation.  There is no stakeholder engagement with the owners and the breeders and that is not right.  In light of all that is transpiring, including the resignation of the CEO of the organisation just before Christmas, there is an urgent need to fast-track the legislation and bring transparency to the greyhound industry, as has been done with Horse Racing Ireland with huge success.  While the Leader may not have the information today, perhaps he would update the House on that.</p></speech>

I do not disagree with what he proposed or suggested on the role the Government can play in supporting and helping to develop other peace processes around the world.  However, I would contest that it should probably focus more of its attention on our indigenous peace process and the outstanding commitments before it starts to focus on processes elsewhere.  These include a public inquiry into the murder of Mr. Pat Finucane, the introduction of legislation on human rights and legislation on the Irish language.</p>  <p>RTE's report this morning that the Department of Foreign Affairs has employed an additional 230 staff in the Passport Office is quite good news.  This is probably the only example where Brexit is creating jobs on this island as opposed to doing damage to our jobs.  The figures for me were quite stark and impressive.  I commend the staff in the Passport Office who, it is clear, have been dealing with a huge amount of additional work as a result of this.  Looking at some of the figures, there was a 74% increase in passport applications from Britain compared with January last year.  In the North, 7,000 people in January alone applied for passports.  That is a huge percentage increase on January of last year.  In Britain, there was a jump of 71% in January of this year compared with last year.  Overall, in 2016, there were 67,972 passport applications from the North, while there were 64,996 passport applications from Britain as well.  We have spoken numerous times about Brexit and its huge economic, political and social implications.  I hope the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, and indeed the Taoiseach, will come back before us soon, and indeed regularly, to discuss that with Senators.  This would allow for a very practical debate with the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade on the issue of citizenship post-Brexit.  What will citizenship look like and mean?  What will it do for people in the North who want to avail of their Irish and therefore EU citizenship?</p>  <p>This is an example of where the Government could take a positive unilateral initiative by opening a passport office in the North, which would not just be symbolic for Irish citizens there.  The figures indicate it would be a practical strategic advantage for the Government to do that.  Perhaps the Leader will consider us discussing that and raising it with the Minister.</p></speech>

We in the D&aacute;il and Seanad recently brought in new legislation for rent caps for certain areas, including Dublin, Cork, Galway and Kildare.  This seems unfair to me when one looks at this market because the lack of supply in housing is driving rents higher.  When there are certain areas with this new rent cap and neighbours without it, it causes confusion.  It is unfair.  I ask the Minister to re-examine this new rent cap system.  Everywhere in the country should be allowed to be part of it.  At least it then gives fairness and justice to those counties that are suffering because the Government is not building houses.  There is a lack of supply and the biggest issue going forward is that rents are still going up.  In 2017, this new <i>daft.ie</i>report says housing is at its highest peaks for rents.</p></speech>

This is a Bill "to provide for the effects in civil law of persons who are missing, including arrangements for interim management of the missing person's property, and to provide for the civil status of the missing person where the circumstances of their absence leads to a presumption of death; and to provide for related matters".  It stems from a Law Reform Commission report of 2013 which contained a very detailed examination of the existing law in this area.  The number of families directly affected is quite small but it is important that we consider the issue, which the Law Reform Commission deemed important.  The membership of the Law Reform Commission at the time of the publication of the report comprised Mr. Justice John Quirke, who had by then retired from his position as a High Court judge, Finola Flanagan, barrister-at-law, Donncha O'Connell, Tom O'Malley, who is from the Minister of State's area, and Marie Baker, who was a senior counsel at the time and who has since been appointed to the High Court.  These people had much experience and a very long number of years of legal background.  They examined this area quite extensively and produced a report which runs to more than 100 pages.  They considered all the legal issues involved in cases of missing persons.</p>  <p>The problem at present is that if a person goes missing and everyone knows that he or she has died but a body has not been located, an inquest cannot proceed.  There is a procedure under the Coroners Act, I believe, whereby the Minister for Justice and Equality can give a direction for the coroner to hold an inquest.  There have been a number of such cases but they have been very rare.  The problem is that when someone disappears and no body is found, a death certificate cannot be obtained and there are, therefore, many matters one cannot deal with, such as the person's bank accounts and property.  Mortgages, for example, present difficulties.  I was looking at the figures in this regard.  There were 62,426 cases of people reported as missing over a ten-year period, and after extensive searches and so on, 385 still could not be located.  In the region of 7,000 people per year - approximately 20 each day - go missing or are reported as such.  One might say the number is quite high.  Many people are located and identified but, as I said, more than 385 people were still not accounted for.</p></speech>
