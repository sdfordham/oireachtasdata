Balbriggan is the fastest growing town in Ireland and it has the youngest population in the State.  Since 2000, the school has been accommodated in 16 prefabricated buildings because of its growing population.  They were to have been a temporary solution, but 17 years later they are still there.  Three extra classrooms are needed now, plus special education rooms.  The drop in the pupil-teacher ratio as announced in the budget means that extra classrooms will be needed next year and in the following years.  The projected enrolment will increase the need for more classrooms year on year.  The feeder school is Sts. Peter and Paul junior school.  The pupils there will go to St. Molaga's.  They are not just names on a waiting list.</p> <p>A total of 52% of the pupils are educated in prefabs, and 56% of the teaching staff work in prefabs.  Those students and staff are isolated from the main building.  They are too cold in the winter and too hot in the summer.  They walk to the main school building in all kinds of weather, which is not satisfactory.  They cannot engage in interactive learning because the prefabs are too small for the kids to spread out on the ground.  The windows in the prefabs are leaking which creates a fire hazard because there are electrical items plugged in there.  It is very unsatisfactory.  This school has been on the Department of Education and Skills major building works list for 2019-21 but it has not received any correspondence from the Department.  At what stage is the planning process?  Where will the building be and when will the first sod be turned?  This is needed urgently in St. Molaga's.  I would appreciate an update on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-10-26a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1421" speakername="James Reilly" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017102600002#A00600"><p>I thank Senator Clifford-Lee for sharing her time.  I raised this issue on the Order of Business yesterday.  This situation is intolerable for the children and the teachers.  I will not reiterate Senator Clifford-Lee's words which so clearly outlined the problems.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator James Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2180"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Yesterday, I visited the school after I left here.  The portacabins or prefabs are in a desperate state.  They have been repaired, patched up and repainted numerous times.  As Senator Clifford-Lee has pointed out, we know exactly how many people will come from Sts. Peter and Paul junior national school as it is a feeder school for St. Molaga's senior national school.  On top of that, there is already a waiting list.  Balbriggan is an area that will grow further so we need this school.  The building project has been left on the long finger since 2000.  The portacabins were erected as temporary structures in anticipation of a new school.</p><p>I had a discussion with the school principal, Ms Pauline Costello, yesterday.  I learned that the school has contacted the Department of Education and Skills and been informed that despite the fact that the school is on the building list for 2019-21, no imminent action is anticipated.  Therefore, no design team will be put in place and there no possibility that planning permission will be sought.  I hope that the project will be addressed in a speedy and aggressive fashion.</p><p>Yesterday, I stood at the entrance of the school.  In one corner of the entrance, which is a drafty area every time the door is opened, two special needs children were being taught by a teacher.  The location is utterly unsatisfactory.  The other corner of the entrance is supposed to house the quiet area and sensory room.  That cannot be provided in such circumstances.  There is also an open site with no security.  </p><p>We welcome the reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio and new changes in terms of special needs.  All of that is to nought in St. Molaga's national school as it cannot cope with what it has.  The school has not got the facilities to deliver the excellence that the teachers are capable of delivering and want to deliver.  The teachers want to give our children who are our future the best possible start in life.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-10-26a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1351" speakername="John Halligan" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017102600002#B00200"><p>The Minister sends his apologies for not being here this morning.</p> <p>I thank Senators Clifford-Lee and Reilly for raising this matter as it provides me with an opportunity to outline the current position in terms of the accommodation needs of St. Molaga's national school, Balbriggan, County. Dublin.  As both Senators will be aware, St. Molaga's is a co-educational national school that caters for pupils from third to sixth class.  The  school has a current enrolment complement of 462 pupils and a mainstream staffing complement of 17 mainstream teachers.  In addition, the school has seven special education support posts and two special classes approved by the National Council for Special Education that cater for pupils with specific learning disabilities.</p> <p>As the Senators may be aware, in order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, the Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas.  The Department regularly carries out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post-primary levels to determine where additional school accommodation is needed.</p> <p>St. Molaga's national school is located in the Balbriggan school planning area.  The area is comprised of 11 primary schools with ten catering for junior infant intake.  St. Molaga's national school is a senior school that caters for boys and girls from third to sixth class.</p> <p>The demographic data for the Balbriggan school planning area, as with other school planning areas nationwide, is constantly kept under ongoing review by the Department that takes into account updated child benefit and enrolment data.  It is anticipated that decisions based on these exercises will be announced before year end.</p> <p>In that regard, the Department's six-year construction programme 2016-21 aims to prioritise new building projects and major extensions, including special schools, in areas where demographic need has been established by the Department.  In addition, the construction programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms for schools, including special schools, where an immediate accommodation requirement has been identified, or where an additional teacher has been appointed.  In this regard, a project for St. Molaga's national school is included in the Department's construction programme to primarily replace existing temporary accommodation with permanent accommodation.  In that regard I understand that the Department is currently preparing a project brief.  This process will include consultation with the relevant stakeholders, which includes the school authorities and the school patron, regarding the extent of the accommodation required to meet the needs of the school.   The completion of the project will facilitate the project to be progressed into the architectural planning stage, which now includes the appointment of a design team.</p> <p>I thank both Senators for giving me an opportunity to outline the current position regarding the proposed major school project at St. Molaga's national school.  I also confirm the Department's commitment to progressing the project for the school.</p></speech>

Before I start, I wish to acknowledge the presence of Debbie Lynch and Sine&aacute;d Creamer who are seated in the Gallery.  They are parents who have children attending the school and are very involved in this project.</p> <p>St. Molaga's school has educated generations of children in Balbriggan.  The school has built up a great history and culture.  It has an excellent reputation and excellent school results.  We acknowledge that there have been a lot of new schools built in Balbriggan.  However, it is essential that St. Molaga's, which has existed for a long time, is not forgotten in the mix.</p> <p>The Minister of State has stated that a consultation will begin but did not stipulate a timeline, which is the problem.  The people in St. Molaga's need a definite timeline so they can plan and structure activities.  His response is unsatisfactory and I would like him to address the actual timeline. </p></speech>

I also welcome our guests in the Gallery from St. Molaga's who are parents.</p> <p>I wish to say three things.  One line in the presentation stuck out.  It reads: "In that regard I understand that the Department is currently preparing a project brief."  That information has not seeped through to the school, which has been given a flat nothing and as recently as a few days ago. </p> <p>I call on the Minister of State and his Minister to get the building section in the Department to immediately engage with St. Molaga's on the timelines, design and consultation for the project, and to proceed as quickly as possible to the appointment of architects. </p> <p>Finally, I will bring the following issue up with the Minister at a meeting that I anticipate will happen shortly in the context of other schools in Fingal.  St. Molaga's requires urgent action to be taken.  We are supposed to be living in a republic of equal opportunity.  The children at St. Molaga's are not getting the same opportunity as other children in Balbriggan and elsewhere where new schools have been completed.  I congratulate the Government on the school completions.  St. Molaga's has been left for far too long.  The children and their parents deserve better.</p></speech>

To be quite frank, I do not know when the brief will be completed but I have been told that it will be put in place by the year's end.</p> <p>I can say that officials from the Department contacted the school's principal during the summer months about the project brief for the school, the school's long-term project and projected staffing requirements.  I am not sure why that information did not filter through to the Senators.</p></speech>

The Department has said that the school is included in its construction programme to primarily replace existing classrooms.  The Department is in contact with the school.  If the Senators need a further update either the Minister or myself will be delighted to do so in the next couple of weeks.  My information, having spoken to the officials, is that the school is seen as a priority and the officials have been in contact with the school to deal with such a priority.  </p></speech>

At the time I was told by a certain Minister that the provision of portacabins and temporary accommodation would never be seen again and they would be done away with.  In one situation, a cost-benefit analysis showed that renting 14 portacabins over 12 years almost cost the same as building a new school.</p></speech>

Sir David Attenborough has called for the world to cut back on its use of plastics in order to protect the oceans.  A recent investigation carried out by <i>The Guardian</i>established that consumers around the world bought 1 million plastic bottles every minute.  Plastic production is set to double in the next 20 years and quadruple by 2050.  Around the world more than 8 million tonnes of plastic leaks into the oceans.  A recent study found that billions of people around the globe were drinking water contaminated by plastic.</p><p>A year ago this week I introduced a Bill, the Micro-plastics and Micro-bead Pollution Prevention Bill 2016, with the support of the Civic Engagement Group in the Seanad.  The aim of the legislation was to address the growing problem of micro-plastic pollution in the oceans, rivers and seas.  In spite of warm statements of support for the principles of the Bill from the then Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, the Government, together with Fianna F&aacute;il, voted it down.  In speaking against it the then Minister promised action on micro-beads within one year, together with a new regime to establish a number of much needed marine protected areas.  At a seminar hosted by Sustainable Water Action Network in April this year he once again gave assurances that the Government was working on and would soon publish an oceans Bill to finally create a coherent network of marine protected areas, MPAs, to protect the oceans and bring us into compliance with the EU marine strategy framework directive.  One year on there is no sign of either.  Micro-plastics pollution is a serious problem and since this time last year we have seen a large number of new reports on the negative impact of micro-plastics on the marine environment, filling much of the previous data gap.  In June the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, published a report that found that exposure to micro-plastics in drinking water and food prepared with contaminated water posed a risk to human health and wildlife.  </p><p>The Green Party's Bill would have introduced the concept of micro-plastic pollution into Irish law for the first time and allowed us to show some leadership.  It would have banished all products containing micro-beads from the shelves and obliged the EPA to perform and publish annual tests for micro-plastic pollution.  The Minister would have been obliged to present the EPA's findings to the Oireachtas, together with solutions.  </p><p>The Government claimed that a ban would be contrary to EU Single Market rules, but during the debate it highlighted exceptions to the rules.  The then Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, illustrated this by writing to Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Commissioner Vella to say Ireland would act on the issue.  It seemed that the Government was genuine in its commitment to tackle plastic and micro-plastic pollution and, to its credit, it engaged in a public consultation process on the issue early this year.  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, even told his colleagues at the Council of Ministers that Ireland would not wait for EU measures on micro-plastics but would press ahead with its own legislation to tackle the problem.  The subsequent Labour Party Bill tabled by Deputy Sean Sherlock to ban micro-beads was allowed to pass the first hurdle in the D&aacute;il and is still being considered, yet progress has since stalled.  </p><p>What is most serious is that there is absolutely no sign in the Government's autumn legislative agenda of the oceans Bill, something the Green Party would greatly welcome.  We have seen the Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten, recently oppose the joint Green Party-Labour Party effort to introduce a deposit recycling system and a ban on non-recyclable or non-compostable single use plastics.  What is the status of the oceans Bill?  Is the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government working on it and what will be its scope?  Will efforts be made by the Government to begin the process of tackling plastic marine waste and protecting key habitats?  Clearly, Government statements that protection of the environment from plastic pollution was a priority have not been reflected in the actions taken to date.  The European Union has been informed; the public consultation process has been concluded and many promises have been made.  Therefore, I ask the Minister of State to tell where the oceans Bill is.</p></speech>

I know that she is passionate about the marine environment and all of the issues connected with it, as was evidenced by the debate on the Private Members' Bill she introduced in this House in November 2016 to prohibit micro-beads.  </p> <p>On the proposed legislation on micro-beads, work has been ongoing on the matter in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government which has responsibility for it.  In February it launched an online public consultation process on a proposed legislative ban on certain products containing plastic micro-beads.  It received just over 3,000 responses.  The volume and diversity of the responses received suggest civil society and relevant stakeholders are extremely interested in these matters and, more broadly, show an awareness of marine environmental matters.  The Department is in the process of assessing the very large volume of submissions received and this exercise will inform the subsequent process of legislative development.  As highlighted in previous debates on this issue, any proposed national prohibition on products containing micro-beads which might have implications for the principle of the free movement of goods in the European Union would require the approval of the European Commission and be required to be compatible with EU Single Market rules.  The Department will forward the required notifications to the European Commission and the World Trade Organization, WTO, as soon as the relevant draft legislation has been developed to a sufficient point.</p> <p>The Government is committed to development of primary legislation to provide for the creation of a network of marine protected areas, MPAs, in accordance with the requirements of the marine strategy framework directive.  Of course, as the Senator will be aware, with regard to special spatial protection measures for the marine environment, we are not starting with a blank canvas.  There is already a significant number of protected areas under the EU birds and habitats directives which are regulated by my colleague, the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  They include a significant number of special areas of conservation and special protected areas.  The intention is to add new types of marine spatial protection measure to the existing measures and, over time, provide for the designation of a coherent and representative network of marine protected areas.  The intention is to allow for the designation of various types of marine protected area by regulation, including their geographical delineation and the provision of the necessary special protection measures required for the marine protected area in question.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Michael D'Arcy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2208"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2208&amp;amp;pid=MichaelWDArcy&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->These regulations will identify what human activities, if any, need to be managed, or limited, in each potential marine protected area, MPA, and will identify the time periods where such restrictions apply.</p><p>In terms of legislation, the approach is to include the provisions regarding marine protected areas in the forthcoming maritime area and foreshore (amendment) Bill which is being developed by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  That Department is awaiting further advice from the Attorney General on this legislation.  As the process of implementation of any legislation is of paramount importance, it is envisaged that this legislation will also provide for enforcement powers and create penalties for offences where they do not currently exist in law.</p><p>Leaving aside the current work on microbeads and marine protected areas, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government develops marine environment policy, principally through the implementation of the marine strategy framework directive, MSFD.  The MSFD forms the basis of our sustainable interaction with our marine environment.  The purpose of the MSFD is to integrate environmental considerations into all aspects of marine policy and activity in order that we maintain or reach a point of good environmental status, or GES, in our seas and oceans and, thereafter, that we ensure that this status is maintained through sustainable use of our seas.  The directive requires that we assess our marine environment, develop GES targets and indicators, monitor our environment in light of these, and, where necessary, introduce a  programme of measures to address issues affecting GES being achieved.</p><p>I am pleased to inform the House that the Department has started preparation for the second cycle of the multi-cycle, multi-phase marine strategy framework directive.  A good deal of knowledge has been gained in the initial cycle of the process, and it is intended to build on this experience for the second cycle.  This will see improved descriptions of all aspects of the marine environment and the environmental targets associated with them.  The second cycle will also see the development of a more effective monitoring programme and programme of measures.  The Department also intends to address gaps identified subject to financial  constraints, science-knowledge advances and technological developments.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State for that reply, which I appreciate.  With regard to the marine strategy framework directive, the Minister talked about the environment.  With marine plastics, and particularly microplastics and microbeads, we are now talking about human health.  These plastics are being found in the crustacea, the little shrimp and different foods we eat here in Ireland.  They were found in studies by the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT, and by the National University of Ireland, Galway, NUIG.  This is an issue not just of the global environment but of human health.  That is why it is vital that we address it as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

I raise the announcement by F&aacute;ilte Ireland that a funding agreement has been reached with local authorities.  The new funding arrangement will replace F&aacute;ilte Ireland's annual regional festivals and participative events programme next year.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has informed applicants and promoters seeking that funding that they should now apply directly to the local authority.</p> <p>I want to talk about diverse funding streams for the arts.  It is important that we maintain those funding streams.  Doing so protects creativity, ensures transparency and provides greater safeguards for artists in the event of Government cuts.  This unique funding stream from F&aacute;ilte Ireland supports countless medium and small-sized festivals across the State that enrich communities, and it is a core part of existing structures.  As it stands, F&aacute;ilte Ireland funds festivals it sees as strategic in nature.  The size of the local authority has no bearing.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland invested &euro;2.3 million in 33 festivals and events this year.  Those festivals were not spread across the 31 local authorities, so I wonder how the funding will now be distributed.</p> <p>I have some questions for the Minister of State.  Will he clarify if he has been briefed by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and if has met the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys?  Will he give us assurances that the current programme will stay true to its objectives?  Will he guarantee that funding allocations will be free from political decision-making and that the arm's length principle will be upheld?  If a given local authority becomes a guarantor for administering this programme, will it take the opportunity to reduce its own arts budget in light of what may be seen as a surplus amount on its books?</p></speech>

It is much appreciated.</p> <p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter, which is of huge interest to a large number of groups throughout the country whose members are currently recipients of F&aacute;ilte Ireland funding as well as their local authority funding.  As Ministers, I and my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, set national tourism policy to grow a competitive and sustainable tourism industry.  While our Department provides the funding for investment in tourism, it is not directly involved in the administration of funding programmes or in the development of tourism experiences.  In that context, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has operational responsibility for these matters.</p> <p>Senator Warfield will be aware that the Government&rsquo;s tourism policy, People, Place and Policy, Growing Tourism to 2025, was published in 2015.  It recognises the important role that local authorities play in tourism.  That encompasses many elements, including infrastructural development, the provision of amenities and attractions, and the funding of events.  Focusing on local government, People, Place and Policy, Growing Tourism to 2025 commits to an enhanced role for local authorities and recognition of the contribution of communities to tourism.  Subsequently, the Department published the Tourism Action Plan 2016-2018.  The local government sector is a key partner in regard to the action plan.</p> <p>Arising from the action plan, F&aacute;ilte Ireland reviewed its regional festivals and participative events programme with a view to identifying a role for local authorities in the administration of regional festival funding in line with an enhanced tourism role for local authorities.  The review has now been completed and F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the local authorities have established a funding agreement to bring greater focus to the development of regional festivals and participative events.  This new funding arrangement will replace F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s existing annual regional festivals and participative events programme for 2018.  Accordingly, F&aacute;ilte Ireland is transferring funding currently provided under its competitive regional festivals and participative events programme directly to local authorities, based on the equivalent 2017 funding awarded to individual regional festivals.</p> <p>This new funding arrangement aims to simplify the application process for applicants.  Organisations seeking funding for a local festival will now only have to apply to one State body rather than to two.  All applicants and promoters seeking funding for 2018 should now apply directly to their local city or county council.  Furthermore, local authorities' knowledge and experience of local assets, strengths and history at city and county level means they are best placed to target funding to those festivals and participative events which have the potential to attract additional visitors to local communities within their area.  The local government sector already makes a significant contribution to the development of the tourist experience in each local area in numerous ways, including through supporting festivals and events.  This new funding arrangement between F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the local authorities will strengthen that role.</p> <p>At the heart of this is trying to cut out the duplication for who are in many cases volunteers making the applications.  Given that F&aacute;ilte Ireland, relatively speaking, is administering smaller grants, the actual cost of administering the grants in many cases is higher than the grants being paid out.  The local authorities, which have an enhanced role, have very good mechanisms and the local knowledge to administer the grants.  That system is working well at local authority level.</p> <p>I take on board what the Senator said in regard to the arts.  I will discuss that with the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys.  I have met F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  I meet it regularly, as does the Minister, Deputy Ross.  I believe this is the way forward in terms of how we administer grants, but I will liaise closely with the Minister, Deputy Humphreys.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Brendan Griffin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2333"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2333&amp;amp;pid=BrendanGriffinFG&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I will relay to her the Senator's observations and concerns as to how funding will be administered to recipients in future.</p></speech>

Will the Minister undertake to prioritise funding for the Bandon southern relief road when his Department makes its submission on the next national investment plan?  I raised the same issue in December last year when I asked that this project be brought forward for priority funding.</p> <p>Bandon town has seen major upheaval in recent years.  Having been flooded on several occasions, we are currently halfway through a major flood relief scheme.  In addition, a public realm project, implementation of which is to commence in 2019, will increase and enhance the town centre as a public realm.  Notwithstanding these welcome developments, the key problem for the town remains the volume of traffic passing through it, with anything from 9,000 to 14,000 vehicle movements per day.  This level of through traffic is choking the town, with a significant proportion of movements comprising heavy goods vehicles whose size and capacity are unsuited to a town centre.  We need an overall plan to ensure traffic is moved out of the centre so that the town can develop in accordance with its potential.  Some 6,500 people live in Bandon and the county development plan envisages an increase in population of 1,000 over the next ten years.  We must have a plan in place to ensure traffic is diverted from the town centre.</p> <p>The proposal for an extension of the Bandon southern relief road involves constructing a bridge over the R63 road, which would override the existing steep terrain, after which a 2.5 km single carriageway would be built connecting on to the western part of the town.  The approximate cost of the project is some &euro;7.5 million, which is a small investment in the greater scheme of things.  It would, however, represent a major investment in facilitating the development of the area.  Bandon is the gateway to west Cork, with anyone wishing to go west having to go through it.  If we can increase the potential for traffic to flow more easily through the town, there will be a broader economic benefit to the whole of west Cork.  This key infrastructural project will allow Bandon and the surrounding towns to flourish.  It involves an extension to the bypass, something that has been mooted for many years, as the Cathaoirleach knows.  Will the Minister prioritise the necessary funding for the benefit of Bandon and the entire west Cork area?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-10-26a.45" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017102600002#E00600"><p>I thank Senator Lombard for raising this important issue and commend him on making such a strong case for the Bandon southern relief road.  I agree with his comments regarding the volumes of through traffic and his observation that the town serves as a gateway to west Cork, which I visited recently.  The argument he makes has a great deal of merit but I dispute his claim that the projected cost of &euro;7.5 million is very little in the greater scheme of things.  Whenever people look at what is apparently the large budget for roads, they conclude that the allocation they are seeking for their particular project is relatively small.  However, it must be borne in mind that we do not have enough money not just for capital projects but also for current expenditure.  Senator Lombard's project will be competing with many other proposals, which is not to say it is ruled out.  My Department and I will take into consideration the arguments he has made previously and the very strong case he has made today in the context of submissions regarding the ten-year national investment plan.</p> <p>As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in respect of the national roads programme. The planning, design and implementation of individual national road projects is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2015, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual projects is a matter in the first instance for TII in accordance with section 19 of the Roads Act.  Ireland has just under 100,000 km of road in its network, and the maintenance and improvement of national, regional and local roads places a substantial financial burden on local authorities and on the Exchequer.  The national financial position following the financial crisis necessitated very large reductions in the Exchequer funding available for roads expenditure.  For this reason, the focus had to be on maintenance and renewal rather than major new improvements in recent years.  I envisage this emphasis on maintaining existing assets will continue into the next capital plan programme.</p> <p>The Building on Recovery Capital Plan 2016-2021 and the capital plan review allocations mark a significant step forward in terms of restoring funding to the levels needed to maintain the road network in a "steady state" condition and allowing for some investment in road improvement schemes.  The allocations and planned projects for the first years of the proposed ten-year plan will align with the existing capital plan as supplemented under the capital plan review.  As part of that review, additional funding is being made available to allow Transport Infrastructure Ireland to develop a pipeline for future projects.  As all capital projects are subject to appraisal in line with the requirements of the public spending code and my Department's capital appraisal framework, I do not envisage a list of projects being put forward for consideration as part of the ten-year plan but rather a budget requested which would allow TIl to advance suitable major and minor national road projects, once project appraisal and planning work is satisfactorily completed.  It would, therefore, be premature to take a view on the prioritisation of individual projects, including the Bandon southern relief road.  As I am sure the Senator appreciates, there continues to be many competing demands for available resources both within the transport sector and across other economic sectors.  However, I assure him that in the light of his presentations today, I will ensure the Bandon project is considered on its merits.</p></speech>

It is important that a roadmap and timeline should be in place for these projects because people need to have some idea as to when development will commence.

The first concerns a report from the European Committee of Social Rights, a European watchdog, which found there to be inadequate standards of living accommodation in certain housing estates in Ireland and shows that there has been a serious deterioration in the standard of accommodation since the financial crisis.  The report names housing estates in Dublin South Central, including: Dolphin House, where residents have been living with sewage invasions; St. Teresa's Gardens; and Bridgefoot Street.</p> <p>Many of these estates are in fact now being rejuvenated.  The report, however, notes that the Government lacks a national timeframe for the refurbishment of local authority stock.  As the House knows, we have a huge housing crisis and this report points to a further aspect of that crisis that needs to be addressed.  I call on the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to come before us and discuss how he intends to keep on top of the standards of our local authority accommodation stock.  I have met many of the residents living in local authority housing around the city.  One can often see black mould growing on the walls and children suffering from various health and lung difficulties.  This is a serious matter that needs to be debated in this House.</p> <p>The second issue concerns a new report by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, on projections for massive population increases which will put serious strains on health care by 2020.  The figures in question were taken from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, and the last census and show that there will be more than 1.1 million extra people living in this country by 2030.  This will obviously put a huge stress on the health system which is, as we know, already under pressure with more people on waiting lists, longer chemotherapy waiting times, failures to get patients the right scans, and so forth.  Our health system would currently seem to be in a crisis and more people relying on it further down the line will obviously deepen this crisis.  I call on the Minister for Health to come to the House and discuss this report with us.  We have not seen him here for a while so I would be delighted if he could come here to address the current health care situation.</p></speech>

The truth of the matter is that being 1,000 technicians short amounts to a crisis.  Stepping away from the defence role of the Defence Forces, let us consider for a moment their frequently overlooked role in the security of the State.  We have an Army Ranger Wing, for example, in the event of a terrorist attack or a hijacking.  We have the bomb disposal team which is called out, on average, twice a week.  Our forces are depleted, however, to the point that there are very few qualified officers available to that bomb disposal team.</p> <p>Cyber security is also a function of the Defence Forces.  The Engineering Corps, meanwhile, deals with ordnance and explosives and it too is greatly depleted.  We can pretend that there is no crisis as much as we want.   The Leader was right when he pointed out recently that a conference is coming up on this matter.  There will indeed be a conference and I would say that things will get hot and heavy at it.  The bottom line here is that we are in dire straits.  I recently called for the Minister of State with responsibility for defence to resign and step aside in favour of somebody who is prepared to drive the Defence Forces forward.</p></speech>

I spoke here yesterday on the issue of mortgages.  Based on Article 30 of the Constitution, the Attorney General has a duel role in this country.  One is as advisor to the Government on matters of law and the second is as defender of the public interest.  What is currently going on with the banks is a matter of public interest and I wonder if the Attorney General has considered what role he might have in bringing these matters to a resolution.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

The HSE and the dementia groups in Ireland have got together to make television and radio advertisements starring brilliantly those suffering and experiencing dementia.  These advertisements will go live today, on RT&Eacute; television and radio.  I want everybody to follow and promote it.  It is about understanding together the difficulties that those experiencing dementia suffer.  Every day 11 people develop dementia and 500,000 of us have a family member with dementia.  They are a good, active group.  They seek an understanding from us that we all have a part to play, no matter how small, even if it is only understanding, reading about and supporting it.  This is an attempt to kick-to-touch the stigma that dementia sufferers feel they have been under.  They have been locked behind doors for generations.  We need to make our communities and society much more dementia friendly.  I would ask everybody to get clued into it.</p></speech>

I want to raise the issue of the necessity for a second Sexual Abuse and Violence in Ireland, SAVI, survey.  This survey would cost in the region of &euro;1 million.  Given the various different court cases that have come to public attention over the recent weeks and the issue of sexual assault and sexual violence in Ireland has been heavily debated, it is appalling that the Government can find &euro;5 million for a communications unit but cannot find &euro;1 million to undertake this study.  I would ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Justice and Equality in here to discuss the issue of sexual violence and assault in Ireland and to justify to this House why &euro;5 million on getting the Government's message out is worthwhile but &euro;1 million to discover ways that we can tackle sexual assault and violence in Ireland is not.</p> <p>I also want to raise the issue of the tracker mortgage situation.  I want the Leader and this House to understand how serious this issue is for social cohesion in Ireland.  There are young people and not so young people in disadvantaged communities around this country who are always on the wrong end of the law for minor infractions, be it shoplifting or public order offences.  The book is thrown at them, left, right and centre if they get on the wrong side of the law, and they are looking at this situation in terms of the tracker mortgage scenario.  I am sure they are wondering to themselves why bankers always seem to get more time and understanding, and that fundamentally, when it comes down to it we as a political collective do not seem to come to the conclusion that we are basically dealing with a mafia type mindset, an amoral group with no conscience who treat everything and everybody as secondary to their fundamental motive of screwing people until they can get enough money out of them.  All they care about is profit and money, and they will say the right things and they will do the right things in committees and come to meetings with Ministers.  How can one look a young person in the face who is facing a court hearing or interacting with a juvenile liaison officer over some shoplifting or some public order offence?  Everything is thrown at that young person, basically because he or she is poor, but this shower of bastards are getting away with murder, year in, year out, in this democracy.</p></speech>

There are 12,500 people employed there directly and it is estimated another nine jobs are created indirectly for each job at Dublin Airport.  In 2010, there were 18 million visitors through that airport and this year we expect 30 million.  That is a reflection on the management of the economy and the great work by Tourism Ireland, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland in attracting people, companies and tourists to this country.  A lot of this was very much supported by the Fine Gael-led Government that was shared with the Labour Party.</p> <p>My question to the Leader is the following.  Could he please get the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport into the House so that he can outline his plans for the future transport and international transport arrangements in this country?  We had been told that the civil aviation authority was the appropriate authority to deal with noise levels and adjudicate on them.  We are now told that is no longer the case.  The people of north Dublin, the local residents, need clarity on how this will be adjudicated on and the airport and the DAA need clarity because there is a huge ongoing programme there in the building of a new runway which is essential to the well-being of the airport and future development and jobs in the area and for the country.  The current planning permission which is under appeal would reduce the number of passengers by 3 million if it were to be adhered to.  This is an urgent matter, and one which the Minister needs to come into the House and address.</p></speech>

I ask the Members of this House to go and look at Ballymun after its so-called regeneration.  It is a bleak place.  It is no more a community now than it ever was in the past.</p> <p>If one wants to regenerate cities, one must build to a greater density.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If we are to build to a greater density, attacking public open spaces is the wrong thing to do.  Private enterprise and local authorities cannot regenerate Dublin adequately.  There must be a specific agency tasked with that function and it must have powers to compulsorily acquire private property and regenerate precincts, streets and the like according to plans.  This is not novel.  It was done in the 18th and 19th centuries by the Wide Streets Commission.  It is time we returned to decent urban planning in Dublin and abandoned the low hanging fruit of soft options that are irrelevant in the context of what Dublin needs.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach talks regularly and aptly about the need to create a republic of opportunity.  No schemes are more beneficial to children and creating a level playing pitch for young people than the school meals programme and homework clubs, the after-school support service.  These interventions support children who are the victims of various levels of poverty and lack of opportunity, perhaps where overcrowding can prevent a child from doing his or her homework and in situations where diet is inadequate or meals are not provided.  Teachers and people who understand education say the main requisites for academic success are that children sleep properly and food and support be provided after school.  For that reason there should be a review.  This year an extra &euro;1.7 million was provided and 245 new schools were included, bringing the number of children benefiting from the programme to 247,000 nationally.  That is good, but there is more potential when we have more resources.  Rather than directly increasing the universal payment, we should consider increasing and widening the extent of the school meals programme and, second, seek to provide support for homework clubs after school.  I realise there are subsidised after-school care places for a certain cohort of the population.  We must examine how that support service is working and consider its expansion.  I wish to see every school in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan and throughout the country benefiting from an enhanced programme.</p></speech>

Ba ch&oacute;ir deireadh a chur leis an gcl&aacute;r scannalach amach is amach seo.  We have raised the issue of JobPath on many occasions, but I commend my colleagues, Deputies John Brady and Denise Mitchell, for issuing a report which required much research.  It is an issue that is increasingly being brought to our attention.  I receive many telephone calls from individuals who are very unhappy with the service provided.  I consider it to be something of a scam.  It is interesting to read some of the notes from people who have worked for the JobPath programme on what it was like to work with it.  They tell us the pressure on staff is immense and that a greated focus is placed on administration work than on dealing with clients.  With the best will in the world, not much can be done in a half-hour appointment, especially when one is busy taking notes.  Many believe there was no value in clients attending.  They said some in senior management appeared to have no managerial experience or qualifications, were deeply insulting to staff and jobseekers alike and that clients were not treated with any sense of dignity.  We are aware of the knock-on effect of JobPath on community employment schemes.  It is hugely detrimental.  When people go on the live register and supervisors ring to get the latest list, they suddenly find that everyone has moved to the JobPath programme and are not available.  As a result of being unable to get people, there is huge pressure on local community employment schemes which are doing fantastic work.  There is also huge frustration for jobseekers who are not receiving any support in seeking employment under the scheme which is privatised  Two companies are running it and making a fortune.  As shown in the report, they are paid by the number of clients they have and the number of times they see them.  It is time we ended this scam.  We should invite the Minister to come to the House to discuss what can be done instead of availing of the JobPath programme.  It is not a question of whether it is should be scrapped but when it will be scrapped.  From my point of view, that should happen sooner rather than later.</p></speech>

They were in place at the time of the financial crash and did nothing.  They seem to be there still, sitting on their hands and collecting &euro;100,000 every time they pass "Go".  They are absolutely useless and doing virtually nothing.  I also heard somebody calling for the introduction of the European Central Bank, ECB.  Are they mad?  It would be like putting Jack the Ripper in the Supreme Court.  The people in the ECB are the ones who bankrupted Ireland by forcing us to discharge the gambling debts of the French and German banks to the tune of &euro;60 billion.</p> <p>Some time ago there were very good Irish language lessons for Members of the Oireachtas.  I attended one or two and they were good.  I understand one Member of the D&aacute;il, Deputy Mattie McGrath, comes from the Tipperary Gaeltacht and has little familiarity with the English language.

The prediction that there would be an inflow into the country resulting in 1 million more people is welcome.  It is due to positive economic development by the Government in the past six years.  I am delighted that Senator Catherine Ardagh is being positive this morning.  However, we face major challenges, particularly in the health service.  The good news is that three hospitals are being built, but now we must move the emphasis to areas outside Dublin and, in particular, the Munster region.  In the past few there there has been an increase of over 250,000 in the population of Munster where  a centre of excellence is required to serve Cork, Limerick, Tipperary, Waterford, Kerry and Clare, even though there would be a natural flow from Clare towards Galway.  A centre of excellence in the provision of health care in Munster should be part of the overall plan.  There are two voluntary hospitals in Cork, but they do not have sufficient space to deal with current numbers.  As there has been an increase of 130,000 in the population of Cork, we must work on developing and fast-tracking that development which should be part of the national development plan.  Will the Leader bring this matter to the attention of his Cabinet colleagues?  In particular, will he invite the Minister for Health to come to the House to set out the programme for the development of hospital facilities in the next ten to 15 years?  The last new hospital in the country was opened in 1998.  I am delighted that three new hospitals are being built.</p> <p>I wish to respond to my colleague on the JobPath programme.  We have experienced the biggest decrease in the level of long-term unemployment in the past 12 to 18 months; therefore, something must be working.  Furthermore, there are more than 230,000 additional people at work.  I do not consider it to be a valid criticism of a scheme that was established to ensure people would be given the opportunity to return to education or find a job.  That is the positive outcome of the JobPath programme.</p></speech>

I look forward to that debate and I hope it happens sooner rather than later.</p><p>A word that I know this week which I did not know last week is &quot;admonish&quot;.  Now we know what admonish means thanks to the Minister for Finance.  I have followed this as a member of the finance committee, where we have worked together on the matter.  We now know that admonish means to smack on the wrist, or a wag of the finger, and it also means to maintain the <i>status quo</i>.  It means that one will not be given any more sweets until one has tidied up the house a bit.</p><p>As a member of the finance committee, I am greatly disappointed in the Minister for Finance's response to the banks.  The banks were already scheduled to be here, these were not special appointments and while the tracker mortgage issue was the most serious matter to be discussed, I cannot see where anything has shifted from the presentations which the banks made to the finance committee and those made yesterday.  That concerns me a great deal in relation to the banks' intentions to clean up their act and compensate people in the manner necessary for what was done to them.  </p><p>The finance committee will continue that work and I look forward to the banks coming in again in early January and to the Minister of Finance coming into this House to explain what he means by &quot;admonish&quot;.  Hopefully that will happen sooner rather than later.</p></speech>

Regeneron, a world leader in the manufacture of cutting-edge life saving drugs, announced a further 300 jobs in addition to the 500 which it already has there.  It has scaled up over a three-year period to have 800 jobs in place by the end of 2018.  It has already invested &euro;650 million and will invest another &euro;100 million in building a new facility of 100,000 sq. ft. alongside the existing facility of 400,000 sq. ft.</p> <p>To put it in context, some years ago Dell discontinued its manufacturing facility in Limerick.  It continued to be a great employer there but many thousands lost their jobs.  Regeneron went in there just over three years ago in a 400,000 sq. ft. ghost factory facility and refitted it, spending &euro;650 million.  Some 500 people work there today and there are another 290 ancillary and temporary workers, bringing the total to 800.  By the end of 2018, there will be over 1,000 working on site.  They will have 250 people involved in construction of the 100,000 sq. ft. facility.  It is to be commended and I congratulate Regeneron and the workforce.</p> <p>With everyone's indulgence, on the tracker mortgage issue, everyone has lost sight of the primary reason for the Minister's meeting with the banks.  I am also a member of the finance committee.  We had four witnesses before us with Mr. Padraic Kissane.  They were credible, honest and encapsulated in a short period, what people had been put through by the banks over tracker mortgages.  They wanted their money and they are entitled to get it back.  The banks are withholding the tracker mortgage victims' money; it is not the banks' money, it is their money.  It brings to mind the old saying "resting in the account".  The banks had the money resting in their account.  For those 13,000 people, their main focus is having their money repaid.  </p></speech>

One of the specific objectives envisaged in the draft renewable electricity support scheme is that favour will be given to projects where communities are asked to get involved.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michelle Mulherin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It must be explained to communities what that pathway might be in order that they can get involved because it is not clear.

I got a note from the local school on Wednesday telling me that our two children would be spending the following day at mass.  There are two big religions in my household, Limerick hurling and Tottenham Hotspur, although not necessarily in that order, but we do not practise any other religion.  In fairness to the school when I wrote to it, our children were allowed not to have to spend the day in the church, and I was pleased with that.</p> <p>However, it brings to mind the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, is currently pursuing.  It does purport to end the baptism barrier, which I welcome, but I must ask the question, given the diverse nature of our country in 2017, because even by Fine Gael standards the Bill is particularly conservative.</p></speech>

What I am seeking is a debate on the issue.  We need to define, for example, what is meant by a non-denominational school and a multidenominational school.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has asked for that.  In 2017, it is not appropriate for almost 96% of national schools to be under the control of the Catholic Church.  We need to move to a democratic model of education.  As a republican party, that is our policy and our position.  I ask the Leader to bring the Minister to the House in order that we can debate his admissions Bill and, it is hoped, make it a lot more progressive than it is currently.</p></speech>

We have a service at the moment from Norwegian Air, which is a very positive step for the region.  We have three flights a week which are 90% full.  That has meant a lot for the tourism industry in the southern region.  Unfortunately, on 7 October, Aer Lingus stated it has no plans at the moment to launch a transatlantic service from Cork Airport.  We have seen the increased visitor numbers in the southern region, in particular from the US, due to transatlantic flights.  We need to promote the region in the north American market in particular, and it is unfortunate for the national airline, Aer Lingus, to state it has no plans to step into this market.  Currently, 90% of the flights leaving Cork are full.  Norwegian Air has tapped into the potential that exists, but we need to promote the area more and ensure that Aer Lingus comes on board.</p> <p>In many ways the low-hanging fruit of Dublin Airport has been the major driver for Aer Lingus.  The airline is using Shannon Airport to a degree, but it is all about Dublin.  We must expand and look at other regions, especially the southern region.  Aer Lingus has a remit to look at that.  It is providing a limited service at the moment to Europe, which can be enhanced.  Senator Colm Burke has done great work in showing how out of step the fares Aer Lingus is offering from Cork are with its fares from Dublin.  We must redress the balance and get transatlantic flights into Cork.  We need Aer Lingus to come on board.  It is important that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport would come to the House to have a debate about aviation and how we can promote all regions in the country.</p></speech>

A total of 4% of houses in Westmeath are valued at more than &euro;200,000 but I do not think 4% of houses in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown are worth less than &euro;200,000, and that generally means not that people are rich but that they have much bigger mortgages and far more debt.  We saw figures yesterday showing that 55% of people's income in Dublin is going on rent or mortgages.  The cost per head is much higher but it does not mean that everyone living in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown is necessarily wealthy.  The 15% discount on the property charge of &euro;1,000 brings it back to &euro;850.  Of that &euro;850, the sum of &euro;200, which is 20% of the original figure, goes to the equalisation fund to fund the 19 of the 31 local authorities that get money from the equalisation charge.  The amount of &euro;600 replaces grants that used to exist so-----</p></speech>

For every &euro;1,000 levied, even allowing for the 15% discount, which is sometimes derided, although as a councillor I gave such a discount, in the most expensive county in the country, &euro;50 is all that the local authority is left with as extra funding for libraries, swimming pools, traffic lights, footpaths and everything else.</p></speech>

I live in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown and I still have a Fianna F&aacute;il leaflet on my desk which came in my door.  At that stage the party was unequivocal as it did not know what it was talking about in relation to property tax.  The leaflet said it was the wrong tax at the wrong time.  Members will recall that leaflet.  I have copies, which I kept because I thought they were interesting.  They said it was the wrong tax at the wrong time, but I say it is the wrong tax at any time.  It is an outrage, it is an unjust tax, it takes no account of people's ability to pay and it should be reformed.  I put a marker down here today to Members of all parties and none that this will be the hottest political issue on the agenda in the next general election.  I and many others in this House and the other House will make it the hottest political topic on the agenda because people are fuming.  They are enraged.  They pay their taxes and stamp duty.  As the Taoiseach said, they get up early in the morning.  We want to get up early to do a hard day's work, be paid for it and keep the profits of our toil.  Let us not be afraid of hard work or of the word "profit".</p> <p>I bring to the attention of the House that the public consultation on the national planning framework ends next week.  I wish to be positive.  It is an excellent plan.  It is a major master plan for the economy and for the strategic development of this country.  The plan is important and is to be welcomed.  I made a plea this morning at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government, and I make a similar plea to the Leader.  Will he would consider speaking to the Minister with a view to extending the public consultation for one further month?  I do so not to obstruct the national planning framework but in order that we can engage as widely as possible with the citizens of this country and get them to buy into the plan so that it becomes a successful plan.  The public consultation will close next week and the notice period needs to be extended for one more month.</p></speech>

We do a lot of talking about fiscal space and I do not know whether anyone fully understands what they are talking about in that context, but the reality is that we would have a lot more fiscal space in the economy if we took a much more preventative approach to health care.  I apologise if reference has already been made to it, but with that in mind, the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill is due before the House soon and I wanted to give the Leader the opportunity to let us know when that is, because we have to stand up as legislators on this point.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Catherine Noone:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2354"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2354&amp;amp;pid=CatherineNoone&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have to be brave on it.

A parent of a senior infant child in Firhouse Educate Together contacted me.  I do not usually raise things based in Tallaght.  I usually try to steer away from that, but I believe it is important in this case.</p> <p>On budget day, it was announced that schools would look to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio.  However, the situation in Firhouse at the moment is such that the school, which has seven classes, has now been reduced to six classroom teachers, and one of those is the principal.  Some 44% of the pupils, 171 pupils in total, have special educational needs.  There has been a reduction of two teachers in the school, which has only been open for five years.  It is a relatively new and developing school.  The situation will result in one junior infant class with a size of 30 pupils, and 13 of those children have special needs.  One senior infant class has 32 children, 14 of whom have special educational needs.  Given the goals set by the Government to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio, perhaps the Minister for Education and Skills could come before the House to discuss this and update us on his plans and how he plans to support schools, especially those with a high proportion of children with special needs.</p></speech>

Senator Ardagh made reference to the European Committee of Social Rights versus Ireland.  Senator Devine raised this matter on Tuesday on the Order of Business as well.  I remind the House that the committee did not find against Ireland in respect of any violation of the many provisions of the human rights charter.</p> <p>The issue of social housing and the associated conditions referenced by Senator Ardagh arise from the condition of Dolphin House and St. Teresa's Gardens in Dublin city.  Regeneration of Dolphin House has commenced since the complaint was made to the ECSR.  The first phase of the Dolphin House regeneration project is currently under way and on-site.  This phase consists of a &euro;25.5 million refurbishment plan.  It is hoped this work will be expedited such that we can get residents back into their homes and into the area.  The regeneration of St. Teresa's Gardens is under way.  Again, significant funding has been given by Government to Dublin City Council for a variety of works, including moving tenants out, enabling works and demolition with a building element of 50 units in 2018 to commence as part of phase 1.</p> <p>Rebuilding Ireland is happening.  The work has commenced.  The importance of community and of people living in their areas is very much to the fore in the policy of Government.

It is about people being able to stay and live in the communities where they grew up.  Let us be fair about it rather than coming in here every day to try to denigrate Government and say nothing is happening.  Action is happening.</p> <p>Senator Ardagh made reference to the ESRI and the Department of Health.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, is prioritising the whole issue of health through the Sl&aacute;intecare report and the long-term strategy for health.  Senator Burke referenced the matter earlier as well.</p> <p>I agree with Senator Ardagh.  It is absolutely important to plan for the future, invest in primary care, in taking people off trolleys and allowing for them to be treated in their communities.  Senator Burke referenced the issue of building.  The Government has a capital investment project in the area of health.  We also have significant investment in the health budget.  Government will take the lead in some cases in determining how and where the money is spent.</p> <p>Senator Craughwell again raised the issue of the Defence Forces.  I am sorry he is not here for the reply.</p></speech>

Whether he chooses to recognise it, the fact of the matter is clear: recruitment is under way and investment is ongoing, including in new naval ships, capital projects and equipment.  There has been an increase in budget 2018 to reverse the pay cuts and restore pay levels of members of the Defence Forces.</p> <p>If Senator Craughwell wants to be Commander-in-Chief, then he must be aware of all the facts.  He cannot simply cherry-pick as Uachtar&aacute;n of our country.  He should be aware of all the issues.  Despite the fact that he might be getting bad advice, the buck stops with him.  I realise that he is going to the PDFORRA conference this week and next week and that the association is his nominating body.  That is his prerogative.  However, we should be aware of three things.  The issue of cyber security is, first of all, a sensitive matter that we cannot have in the public domain such that everyone knows what we are doing to counteract it.  Second, it is an all-of-government approach.  It is not only a matter for the Defence Forces; it is across every Department.</p> <p>Third, if Senator Craughwell is not aware, he should be aware that the Defence Forces have an issue that they are addressing in terms of working collaboratively on defence networks.  That is happening.  Equally, he should be aware of the question of pay of members of the Defence Forces.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, has established a pay commission that is looking at the issue of public pay.  As Senator Craughwell knows well, there has been a reversal of the FEMPI cut.  I wish to put on record that the Army bomb disposal unit has responded to 85 cases this year, plus hoaxes.  The explosive ordnance disposal unit has responded to all call-outs.  Let us put that on the record as well rather than some of the issues we hear from Senator Craughwell.</p> <p>I join Senator Devine in raising an issue that is to the fore in many of our homes and communities.  Many of us have family members and friends who are affected by dementia.  The need for a national dementia strategy has never been more apparent.  I join the Senator in welcoming the establishment of Understand Together.  I know the launch was today and I am sorry that I could not get to it.  I thank Senator Devine for giving me the badge in the rain.  It is an important issue that we need to see highlighted collaboratively on a cross-party basis.  It is about ensuring that we put in place proper funding and a proper strategy.  It is important that people, not only senior citizens but people of all ages, who are affected by dementia are treated and get the quality of support, care and understanding they deserve.  I will work with Senator Devine in that regard.  I thank her for her comments this morning.</p> <p>Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in raised the issue of the Sexual Abuse and Violence in Ireland report.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is about ensuring we understand what the Government is doing.  Through legislation and investment, it is investing in tackling sexual and domestic violence.  The Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, said in the D&aacute;il on Tuesday that if the experts tell the Government that the &euro;1 million for a new study is needed it will be provided.  The Taoiseach has asked the Ministers, Deputies Zappone, Flanagan and Harris, to examine the statistics.  We are constantly receiving statistics from different agencies.  The question is whether we need to commission another report.  The Taoiseach has made it quite clear that if we need to update the research on sexual violence the money will be found and we will examine the issue.</p><p>The Garda and CSO have the figures.  I am a member of the policing forum in Cork.  There has been an increase in reporting there, which is to be welcomed.  People have the courage and bravery to come forward so we can shine the country's glare on the atrocities people experienced inside and outside their homes.</p><p>As Senator Noone said, there has been an increase in minor public assaults in Cork linked to the night time economy and alcohol.  I will return to the alcohol Bill later.</p><p>Tusla has had &euro;22 million made available to it.  Let us join together on the issue and have value-for-money so we can eradicate and highlight the issue.</p><p>Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in referred to the tracker mortgage situation.  The Government is committed to tackling the issue.  Senators O'Donnell and Conway-Walsh also referred to the issue.  Senator Conway-Walsh used the word "admonish".  Banks have been called to task.  They will be forced to account for themselves.  As Senator O'Donnell said, the fundamental goal of Government is to ensure justice and recompense for those who have been so badly treated.  It is a disgrace and we cannot condone what happened or allow it to continue.  That is why the Government has acted and the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has brought the banks in.  They will be held to account.  Whether they are admonished, scolded or held to account, the wording is irrelevant.  The outcome is what we will be judged on.  That is what the Government will do.</p><p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh raised the issue of JobPath and activation measures.  Sometimes I wonder whether we should come in here with bad news every day.  Is it not a great sign for our country that unemployment is down to its lowest level in over a decade and a half, that more people are back at work and that the JobPath programme has been a success?  Activation measures have worked.  There is silence.  There is no welcome.  There are no congratulations for those who are back at work.  They are the citizens, in our republic, who want to go out and contribute.</p></speech>

Inequalities are being reduced.  The best way to eradicate poverty and a two-tier country is to have people at work earning a just and fair wage.</p></speech>

That is a most fundamental point.</p> <p>The Cathaoirleach has ruled on Senator Norris, therefore I will not address his admonishment of a Member of the Lower House.  I will leave it at that.</p> <p>Senator Colm Burke raised the need for the national development plan to include investment in our hospital system.  Like the Cathaoirleach, I come from the city of Cork.  I ask that, as part of the national development plan, we have a commitment to the development of a new hospital for Cork.  We are well served by our existing hospital, but there is overcrowding in Cork University Hospital and the two voluntary hospitals, the South Infirmary and the Mercy, are in need of refurbishment. </p> <p>We need to ensure a new centre of excellence is created not just for the Cork region but also beyond.  As Senator Burke said, it is about ensuring we have investment and can tackle significant health issues and ensure people access treatment and care.  A new hospital for Cork would serve the community in the Munster area well.  As Senator Burke said, there has been an increase in its population.  That should be developed as part of the hospital infrastructure facility framework.  I join with Senator Burke in stating that there is a need and demand for the hospital to be built.</p> <p>Senator O'Donnell also welcomed the Regeneron jobs for Limerick announced yesterday.  I am sure Senator Gavan would join in that welcome.  </p> <p>Senators Marie-Louise O'Donnell, Horkan and Boyhan raised the issue of property tax.  I would be happy for a debate in the House on the issue.  As Senator Horkan knows quite well, it was part of the deal signed by Fianna F&aacute;il and the troika.  We need a debate on taxation because we cannot go back to a model where we expect a few to pay for everything.  Whether we change how we impose taxes, let us have that debate.  We cannot have an expectation that the Government provides everything and no one pays for anything.  I know people are not saying that, but let us have that debate.</p> <p>Senator McDowell made reference to the need for what I would call a quango for Dublin.  I would be somewhat worried about creating a new structure.  We already have a city council-----</p></speech>

I would be happy to have a debate in the context of the discussion and planning.  I hope to have a debate on the national planning framework after the mid-term break.</p> <p>I join with Senator Mulherin in welcoming the appointment of Caitriona Perry and Keelin Shanley, who will be the first all-female panel to host "Six-One News".  It is a wonderful innovative announcement by RT&Eacute;.  They are very fine journalists and broadcasters and I wish them well.  I thank Brian Dobson for being a safe, steady pair of hands during his tenure on "Six-One News".  Those who had the pleasure or displeasure of being interviewed by him know he was always very courteous and fair.  We wish him well in his new appointment.  We also wish Sharon N&iacute; Bheol&aacute;in well as she moves on to a different career in RT&Eacute;.  </p> <p>Senator Mulherin also asked for the issue of climate change to be discussed, and I would be happy to have the Minister come to the House in that regard.</p> <p>Senator Gavan raised the issue of education and the Education (Admissions to Schools) Bill.  I would be happy for the Minister to come to the house.  I hope his children were not at mass for the entire school day, because it would be a long mass if it they were.  We live in a republic and we are democratic.  I welcome the fact that the Senator was able to make a decision and that his children were not penalised for that.  The Minister will return to the House to deal with the Education (Admissions to Schools) Bill.</p> <p>Senator Lombard referred to transatlantic flights out of Cork.  I join with him in congratulating Cork Airport on its strategic vision.  It attracted Norwegian Air to Cork.  It means passengers not just in Cork but also Limerick, Tipperary, Waterford, Clare and other parts of the country can use Cork Airport from a transatlantic point of view.  The flight to Providence, Rhode Island, is a very positive departure for Cork and has brought another dimension to the airport. </p> <p>It is a very good flight, and I have been on it.  A strategic marketing fund needs to be made available.  There is a duty on all stakeholders, including F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland, the city and county councils, the Department, the Irish Hotels Federation and tourism bodies, to work with Cork Airport to promote the flights and the airport.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Last week, Senator Colm Burke referred to the flights out of Cork.  Aer Lingus must use Cork Airport as a hub for its transatlantic flights and for travel to European and non-European destinations thus offering customers greater choice.  The more people who fly out of Cork Airport the greater opportunity to reduce the price of flights.  </p><p>Senator Noone has been a very strong champion of preventive health measures.  I am pleased to announce to the House that the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015 will be back with us when we resume after the mid-term break, provided the House votes to adjourn for the break at the end of the day.  It is important that the Bill is passed.  It is important that the ambiguity by some parties in this House about the public sale of alcohol is brought to a head and they make their decisions known.  I agree with the Senator that it is time the legislation was enacted because we, as legislators, and as a society must address the misuse of alcohol.</p><p>Senator Ruane raised an issue about the Firhouse Educate Together school.  I am unfamiliar with the issue.  My advice, if I can use that term, to her is to table a Commencement matter or she can contact the Minister.  From my own experience of schools, the pupil-teacher ratio is based on the number of pupils in the school.  Unfortunately, I have not got the information for her regarding same. </p><p>Senator Feighan made reference to the 'flu vaccination.  It is important that we all lead on this matter.  We must show our support for the vaccination through social media, and in our constituency advice offices and clinics.  We must ask people to engage with the HSE to avail of the 'flu vaccination, which is the best way to prevent the 'flu.  </p><p>Senator Boyhan made a good point when he called for the deadline to lodge submissions for the national planning framework to be extended.  I know the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government is anxious for the process to conclude.  I believe extending the deadline by a fortnight is appropriate.  Therefore, I join with the Senator in his call for an extension.  I understand from talking to officials in the Department that they are anxious for the process to conclude but it is important that people contribute.  Last week on the Order of Business, Senator Murnane O'Connor asked people to make submissions.  I reiterate that it is important that people make submissions.  I shall convey Senator Boyhan's request to the Department.</p></speech>

The debate was very useful.  Training is fundamental to the delivery of rights and supports to the victims of crime, which is what this Bill is all about.</p> <p>The Government is in complete agreement that training and information on same must be publicly available, which is already happening.  As I said previously, training is being provided by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Courts Service.  Details of this training are published on the respective websites of those organisations.  It is the Government's view that the amendment is unnecessary and training is better addressed on an administrative rather than legislative basis.</p> <p>I could go on with other points that I have previously made.

I am somewhat initially disappointed that we did not succeed in having our only amendment put forward here.  It rarely happens.  It did happen in this case but the D&aacute;il rejected our amendment, which we must accept.</p> <p>I want to be fair to the Minister of State and thank him for the enormous work that he and his officials have put into this important legislation.  It is a good Bill.  Our amendment would have only delayed the legislation for 90 days but possibly longer.  Even if it were to get through the process eventually, the Minister would not have to enact all parts of the legislation if he did not so wish, which is his prerogative.  In politics one must be pragmatic and realistic.  Therefore, to delay the legislation would not have been the right thing to do.  Having spoken to a number of groups involved, particularly the Victims Rights Alliance, the view was that, on the whole, is was better for the legislation to proceed.    </p> <p>I want to acknowledge the good work that has been done on the legislation.  It was important to exercise our functions and powers in the Seanad.  They may be limited but it is always nice to test them and learn in the process.  I am happy to support the motion for the Seanad not to insist on the amendment.  </p> <p>I want to raise two issues with the Minister of State.  I ask that he bears in mind what we were trying to do.  There is a requirement that people are trained in ways to deal with sensitive matters related to crime, be they members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or whatever.  A judicial council Bill is coming and it would be important to include a requirement to provide legal training on the area of sexual assault be it the Judiciary or the legal training of people.  There is an issue of sensitivity that is gender neutral in terms of what it is talking about and deals with.  There are sensitivities all round.  I ask the Minister to bear that in mind and consider facilitating such training in future legislation.  </p> <p>I would like to discuss an EU directive.  I understand, and I am open to correction, that on 16 November, which is not far away, infringement proceedings against the Irish Government will commence.  The Minister of State or some member of his staff will turn up to contest the case, although some people would argue that it is just another EU infringement or, to be precise, an alleged infringement.  Clearly, the Irish Government will make a robust case against the proceedings.  Can the Minister of State confirm whether infringement proceedings will take place?  I ask him to outline how the Government intends to contest the case. </p> <p>It is important that we address the issue of training for practitioners.  I want to finally acknowledge, which I decided was an important aspect on reflection, the independence of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I respect his independence and function.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is something I may have missed.

I am disappointed this amendment has now been accepted.  However, the Fianna F&aacute;il group is eager that this Bill is enacted and, therefore, we are willing to support it in its current form.  It is definitely a step forward for victims of crime, which all of us would welcome, and I wish the Minister of State the best of luck with it.</p></speech>

I welcome Maria McDonald from the Victims Rights Alliance who is in the public Gallery and acknowledge the great work she has done on this issue.  I echo colleagues in terms of our disappointment that the D&aacute;il has seen fit to reject an amendment from the Seanad.  The Seanad does not often pass amendments to legislation against the Government so it is always disappointing when the D&aacute;il rejects them.</p> <p>Last night, it was great that the Minister of State said he was the Minister who would be tabling amendments in the Seanad on the gender pay gap Bill, which started life as a Private Members' Bill in the Seanad.  I appreciate that it is not his normal practice, nor indeed that of the Minister for Justice and Equality, to reject amendments from the Seanad.</p> <p>I commend Senator Boyhan on his work.  We are all conscious that we need to follow his lead in not pressing the issue further because we do not want to delay the enactment of this important legislation.  We recognise that, and the Victims Rights Alliance and other groups would recognise it also.</p> <p>There may be other ways of dealing with the issue of training.  Senator Boyhan touched on the possibility of amending other legislation.  There is also the concept of codes of practice or, for example, encouraging the relevant professional bodies to engage in their own training protocols and procedures.  Some great work has been done without any need for a statutory basis but through the Judiciary.  Under the former Chief Justice, Susan Denham, there was a real increase in levels of judicial training programmes and so on.  That is the kind of thing we could encourage if we will not see in this amendment.</p> <p>I echo Senator Boyhan's words in terms of the independent function of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  We have to acknowledge that it is important she is independent in her office.</p> <p>I welcome this important Bill in the hope that we will see it enacted in full in a very short time.</p></speech>

I share some of the sentiments expressed by colleagues in terms of their disappointment that this amendment was not achievable.  Nevertheless, I accept Senator Boyhan's position not to push it because the useful exchange we have had over the course of this debate signifies the importance of this legislation.  We can all accept that.  I have found the engagement in the debates on this legislation incredibly useful and fulfilling and I have no doubt that as the legislation evolves, we will come back here and take the opportunity to examine its enactment and implementation beyond this Seanad.</p> <p>I thank the Minister of State again.  It is not very often we see a Minister coming into the House at this time on a Thursday.  It is always good to have him in the Seanad.  This is an important piece of work.  We did our best to engage with the Minister of State where we thought we could improve upon the legislation, but that is the nature of the beast.  I wish the Minister of State, his officials and this legislation well.</p></speech>

It is extremely constructive of colleagues on all sides of the House, including Senators Boyhan, &Oacute; Domhnaill, Clifford-Lee and Bacik, not to delay this Bill, but I would not expect anything else from them because they well understand its importance.  I am sure we will amend the Bill in the future to strengthen even further the rights of victims of crime.  That should always be the case with legislation.  Legislation should always be evolving.  No legislation is cast in stone but is merely a starting point in terms of a parliamentary response to the challenges and difficulties in society.  As parliamentarians, we should never be in a position where we do not continually amend Bills to make them reflect situations in society.</p> <p>This is an extremely important Bill that is long overdue.  I recall speaking in this House in 2011 and 2012 about the need to strengthen victims' rights and put them on a statutory framework.  That has taken too long.  I salute colleagues for not delaying this legislation any longer.  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, and the great work he is doing.</p></speech>

As I said the last time I was here, there were very good reasons the Government was not supporting this particular amendment.  The Law Society of Ireland and the Bar Council are representative bodies and it would have placed a statutory duty on those, and the judicial studies institute no longer exists.  The Government could not support the amendment and the D&aacute;il could not support it either.</p> <p>The Senator has provided a very useful service because he has highlighted the importance of training.  I thank the Senator for that because the debate we had was very important.  Where victims are concerned, this legislation is a beginning, not an end.  We need to continue to improve and evolve our approaches to and supports for victims.  I give a commitment to the Senator that we will look at the importance of training.  The Senator has highlighted that and provided a useful role in this regard.  We will keep in mind the importance of training and consider if there is any way we can improve legislation in the future in terms of including a need for training.</p> <p>Rather than being disappointed, the Senators should congratulate themselves for highlighting and debating this very important matter.  I am very pleased that this Bill is completing its passage through the Oireachtas today.  This is a very good outcome.  It is good for victims of crime.  I thank the Senators for their support and I thank all the organisations that have contributed to this legislation.  I know that everyone who supports this Bill will be eager to see it brought into force very quickly, and that is the intention of Government.</p> <p>I am glad to report that the majority of the provisions in the Bill should be enforced within a matter of weeks and all of them by the end of the year or very early next year.  I also thank my officials for the enormous amount of work they have done on the Bill, literally burning the midnight oil to ensure we have got to where we are today.  I thank my colleagues and ask them please to continue to challenge, debate and raise issues because that is the reason all of us are here.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for his support.</p></speech>

It is a learning process for all of us.  I hope the legislation will come into operation at a very early date.</p> <p>Two or three weeks ago, I raised with the Minister of State an issue relating to victims of crime.
