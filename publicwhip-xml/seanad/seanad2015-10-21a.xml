T&aacute; a l&aacute;n moill ag baint leis an rud seo agus ba cheart don Aire St&aacute;it an sc&eacute;al a thabairt d&uacute;inn faoin m&eacute;id at&aacute; ag tarl&uacute;.</p>  <p>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this matter in respect of the submission of the town of Kells and its monastic sites, among others, as part of a tentative list of properties for future nomination to the world heritage list.  The Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne site, comprising Newgrange, Knowth and Dowth in County Meath, is a world heritage site.  Under the previous Government, work was done in 2008 to nominate other properties for submission to UNESCO, the international body that classifies places as world heritage sites.  The monastic site at Kells was included as part of a list of early medieval monastic sites in Ireland.  There are a number of such sites, including Clonmacnoise, Durrow, Glendalough, Inis Cealtra, Kells and Monasterboice.  Kells, or Ceanannas M&oacute;r, is where St. Colmcille established a religious settlement in 550 AD  It is one of the most important monastic sites in Ireland.  There are a number of buildings and places of interest in Kells, including St. Colmcille's house, the Kells monastic site, the Market Cross and the round tower.</p> <p>All of these symbols are synonymous with the town of Kells.  Will the Minister of State give an update on what has happened since 2010 when the application for world heritage status for the town and its archaeological site was made?  When the application was made in 2010, we were told by the then Minister, John Gormley, that the site would have to be on a tentative list for at least one year before it could be inscribed as world heritage site.  We were also told that it would take at least two years for this process.</p> <p>I know from those who have raised questions about other sites, which have been put forward for tentative status, that it appears precious little has been done by the Minister responsible for it.  Talking to some of the local councillors in Kells, it has not appeared on any local authority agenda since the last local elections.  I would have thought the local authority would have been a key partner with the Department Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in ensuring the Kells monastic site receives world heritage status.</p> <p>A significant amount of work has been done in the town of Kells over the past five years by voluntary and community groups, including the Tourism Forum, the Local Heroes programme and many others, to promote the town.  They should not be left in a vacuum.  The ultimate responsibility lies with the Minister and the local authority.  I would be grateful for an update on this position.</p></speech>

Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Seanad&oacute;ir Byrne as ucht na ceiste seo a ard&uacute;.  T&aacute; suim mh&oacute;r agam san &aacute;bhar seo &oacute;s rud &eacute; go bhfuil ceangal dearfach idir mo chontae f&eacute;in agus Contae na M&iacute;, mar shampla i gcomhth&eacute;acs Naomh Colm Cille.  D&aacute; bhr&iacute; sin, t&aacute; m&eacute; s&aacute;sta labhairt f&aacute; dtaobh den &aacute;bhar seo inniu.</p>  <p>Having a site progressed from being on a national tentative list to its inscription by UNESCO on the world heritage list is a long and involved process which requires comprehensive management plans for the site, full agreement with local interests, significant local authority actions and support and the production of highly detailed nomination documents that require significant financial investment.  Each stage of the process has to be quality controlled and checked by experts to ensure the nomination documentation reaches the high standards laid down by UNESCO.  We are working at all times to UNESCO standards and requirements and not to any local framework.</p>  <p>Ireland's current world heritage tentative list has come about from a comprehensive, thorough and detailed process undertaken by a panel of Irish and international heritage experts specifically appointed for that purpose.  The tentative list produced by the expert group contains a list of seven potential nominations, including early medieval monastic sites of which Kells forms part, along with Clonmacnoise, Durrow, Glendalough, Inis Cealtra and Monasterboice.  The expert group felt these six sites were exemplars of the early Irish Church's rich cultural and historical past which played a crucial role in Europe's educational and artistic development.</p>  <p>In September 2013, my Department held a seminar to explain the next steps in the process to the local authorities and local groups from the areas with proposals which had successfully made it on to the tentative list.  The objective was to gauge the extent of the support which would be available to advance these proposals, as well as to set out the work that would be involved and the associated costs.  The seminar was followed by a series of working group meetings related to each of the sites.  My Department, together with world heritage experts, was there to facilitate discussion.</p>  <p>My Department's view is that without strong local enthusiasm and backing there is little prospect of success for any nomination.  This bottom-up approach is also UNESCO's favoured policy.  As Kells is in a serial nomination with other sites and is part of a representative sample of Irish monuments, unless all the component parts enjoy local support, there is much less scope for a nomination to proceed any further.  The representatives who are now most actively engaged with my Department in pushing on with their proposals on that basis are those from The Burren and the Royal Sites of Ireland.</p>  <p>Although other nominations may not be moving ahead as quickly, this does not mean that they are removed from the tentative list.  My Department would be delighted to engage again with representatives of the areas in the early medieval monastic sites nomination, if the local communities, and especially the local authorities which must generally take the lead, are interested.  However, without all involved firmly on board, the rationale for the nomination does not have the necessary standing or completeness.</p>  <p>My Department has sought, and continues, to work with local interests to bring forward the nominations of the internationally important archaeological sites on our tentative list.  This will continue to be the approach.</p></speech>

I have never seen a town so committed to its heritage tourism than Kells.  The people are working tirelessly and are engaging with the Department.  One group met with the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, last June about protecting some of these sites but it has heard nothing back.  Perhaps the Minister could deal with that.  That was a complaint I heard two nights ago.  The town of Kells and the groups there are doing tremendous work.  The idea they are to be blamed for this not progressing is outrageous.  To blame the local authority is also outrageous because it is the Minister who takes the lead under the UNESCO proposals.</p>  <p>The Minister is passing the buck.  It is about time the Minister got the groups and local authorities from all the monastic sites, Clonmacnoise, Durrow, Glendalough, Inis Cealtra and Monasterboice, together to get this going.  The truth is this has been going nowhere.  It is the Minister who needs to take the lead.  It is surprising to see The Burren as one of those sites actively pushing on.  I know Deputy Michael McNamara from County Clare was complaining in the same vein as me about this issue only a few months ago.  I have certainly heard nothing about the Royal Sites of Ireland being pushed.  The Minister needs to re-engage urgently with all of the communities and local authorities in the areas to push this on.  It is her responsibility, no one else's.</p></speech>

I am raising this issue as a result of a family coming to me about their 52 year old daughter who has an intellectual disability.  The family is the main carer for their daughter.  Every morning, for the past 35 years, the family has been driving her to a Cope Foundation facility in Cork, and collecting her every evening.  The family applied for the disabled driver&rsquo;s tax concession grant but was turned down.  The family appealed but were advised it would take six to seven months.  I find this unhelpful and unsatisfactory, particularly when the parents, who have moved on in age themselves, have been caring for their daughter for that length of time.</p>  <p>SI No. 353/1994, Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994, only applies to where a person has a physical disability.  Where a person has an intellectual disability, no tax concessions are available.  I have examined the regulations and the Act.  In my view, it is only a matter of time before someone decides to call for a judicial review of this matter because there is discrimination involved.</p> <p>These parents are providing and caring for their daughter and while they are doing everything possible for her, they are being denied a simple concession they have sought, whereas if the child had a physical disability, they would qualify for each of these concessions.  I acknowledge the main issue pertains to the delay I have raised this morning but the other issue, in respect of SI 353 of 1994 and the section of the Finance Act 1989 with which one is dealing and under which the regulations were introduced, also must be addressed.  However, the issue is the current delay in dealing with the appeal process.  Moreover, my understanding is the appeals must be dealt with in Dublin and even though these people are from Cork, they must travel to Dublin to deal with those appeals.  However, the delay is unsatisfactory and I raise this matter in that context.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-10-21a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1078" speakername="Damien English" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015102100004#C00200"><p>I thank Senator Colm Burke for raising this matter.  I am speaking on behalf of the Minister for Finance who regrets he is unable to be present due to other business.  He apologises and would have preferred to have been present himself, had that been possible.</p>  <p>The Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal is a body under the aegis of the Department of Finance and it is for that reason I am responding to the Senator on behalf of the Minister for Finance today.  The medical board of appeal acts as an appeals body for those applicants refused a primary medical certificate by a senior medical officer of the Health Service Executive.  The primary medical certificate is required to access the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme, which provides relief from VAT and vehicle registration tax, up to certain limits, on the purchase of an adapted car for transport of a person with specific severe and permanent physical disabilities, assistance with fuel costs and an exemption from motor tax.  Accordingly, the medical board of appeal provides an important function in providing citizens with an appeals process, ensuring a greater degree of consistency and fairness in the award of primary medical certificates.</p>  <p>Perhaps I can first outline the recent history of the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal to provide some background on the function and remit of this body to the Seanad.  Prior to 1989, there was only one medical criterion for eligibility for the disabled drivers (tax concessions) scheme.  An applicant's general practitioner certified whether an individual met that criterion.  This gave rise to inconsistencies across the State and in 1989, it was decided to extend the number of medical criteria to five.  At the same time, it was decided that medical officers at an applicant's local health board should determine whether an applicant met the criteria for eligibility for the scheme.  This both extended the scheme and ensured a consistency of approach.  In that context it was necessary to establish the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal to provide an appeal process.  The board was initially composed of three part-time members, one of whom was appointed as chairperson.  Following the enactment of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994, the scheme was extended to passengers for the first time, which increased the workload of the board substantially.  As the board was essentially working on a part-time basis, prospective delays grew rapidly through to 2004 to a point where people were waiting for more than a year for an appeal.  As a first step to tackling these delays, provision was made through secondary legislation for the independence of the board, as well as an expansion of the number of members of the board to five.</p>  <p>In June 2005, the Department of Finance reached an agreement with the National Rehabilitation Hospital to provide two permanent staff to the board, one a full-time administrator and one a medical consultant who also would act as chairperson of the board.  At that time, &euro;300,000 was provided in the Estimates to staff and resource the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal.  On 29 June 2005, officials from the Department of Finance appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service to inform the committee of the steps taken to tackle the delays on the board, including the new moneys allocated to the board.  Additional legislative action was also taken which allowed the Minister to appoint more members to the board of appeal, if required.  These actions bore fruit and the number of applicants awaiting an appeal fell from a high of 824 in May 2005 to 406 in June 2006.  At the end of last month, there were 110 applicants awaiting an appeal, which equates to a waiting period of approximately four to five months.</p>  <p>At present, the board meets for 24 sessions per year, one of which is held at Mercy University Hospital in Cork city, and assesses on average 15 appeals per session.  The Minister for Finance does not agree there are undue delays in processing these applications.  First, one must remember the board relies on the membership of medical professionals who have full-time practices and must absent themselves from these to present at these sessions.  In light of this, the Minister believes 24 sessions per year is a reasonable number.  Second, I have stated the board averages 15 appeals per session.  Given the independence of the board in the exercise of its functions, the Minister for Finance cannot and would not wish to suggest an increase in the number of appeals per session, as this may not give the board an adequate amount of time to assess each appeal properly.  The Department of Finance keeps the operation of the board and the number of applicants awaiting appeal under constant review.</p>  <p>The Senator also raised a second issue, which I will bring directly to the Minister for Finance on his behalf, if that is all right.</p></speech>

I am not sure whether I agree with its contents fully.  However, on the issue I have raised about intellectual disability, where there is huge discrimination, I referred to a case in which the parents are elderly but still are on the road each day to look after their daughter and were the State to provide full-time care, there would be a huge cost to it.  In this case, all the parents seek is the concession in respect of car tax on the car, which they are being refused at present.  They live in a rural area without public transport and even if public transport was available, the person concerned must be accompanied by an adult at all times.  It is in this context that I ask that the current regulations be considered to ascertain whether this type of family can be catered for because they have done everything possible to care for their child and as I stated, that child is now 52 years of age.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-10-21a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1078" speakername="Damien English" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015102100004#C00500"><p>I again thank the Senator.  While I do not have to hand the exact details of the case, as the Department has stated, it keeps all these issues under review on a regular basis and I certainly will feed in the example raised by the Senator regarding the situation faced by that family.  On the point raised by the Senator, I note they do not seek access to the whole lot but this probably deals with many more issues than simply motor tax on the car.  However, I certainly will revert to the Department and raise this matter with it.  In addition, the Senator has raised a second issue, which I will bring to the Minister's attention directly.</p></speech>

I have raised this Commencement matter on foot of a serious and urgent representation I received over the summer, which I have attempted to resolve both at local level and with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Before making this representation, I have raised repeatedly the lack of suitable disability housing for those in need in County Louth.  I am dealing with a few serious cases that I intend to highlight today as a representative sample, in which the quality of life for the individuals concerned is being impeded due to the lack of suitable housing in the area to which to transfer these individuals and their families.  In some cases, the medical issue or disability has been exacerbated due to the living situation or accidents have occurred due to stairs.  I do not raise these matters lightly or without approaching them from numerous angles with Louth County Council and various council members.  There simply is no suitable housing to be found for those with a disability on the housing list or the transfer list.</p>  <p>I have made hundreds of calls, attended meetings and have written letters and e-mails in respect of specific cases over the past two years.  In one case, the person concerned has provided an abundance of medical evidence proving the current living situation is unsuitable for her condition but yet, she still remains in a two-storey home.  Two years later, I continue to be informed that there is no accommodation suitable for this family.  The representation I mentioned earlier which I received over the summer is also of extreme urgency.  It involves a young family with four young children that received the devastating news that due to his diagnosis of bone cancer, their four-year-old son must have his leg amputated on 4 November.  This young child's mother was also delivered of a new baby last Friday.  When this little boy comes home from hospital in a wheelchair with his family, he will be returning to a two-storey house that does not have a downstairs toilet or any facilities for wheelchairs downstairs.  I understand the child's condition is extremely painful and his parents must carry him up and down the stairs several times during the day for toileting and bedtime.  I visited the house myself and completely agree it is not suitable for a wheelchair.  I raised this issue in July in the hope that by November, something would be in place, namely, either the house would be adapted or the family would be accepted onto the transfer list to move.</p> <p>Unfortunately, nothing has happened since July.  I have been most disappointed with the response to the case.  Once the housing transfer form was submitted, it took a number of weeks, and several phone calls, for this family to be contacted.  When the family was initially contacted they were told the matter would be dealt with in due course.  That is okay if somebody is seeking assistance, as I understand there are priorities, but this case is a major priority.  At the very least, an occupational therapist should have attended the home at the earliest opportunity, as far back as last July, to get the necessary assessment out of the way so that when a house became available, those matters would already have been addressed.  What this family is going through is life changing and very stressful.  This young boy will have to use a wheelchair after his surgery and he will come home to a house that is not wheelchair accessible.  There are not enough bedrooms, and there is not sufficient space, in the house.  I am disappointed with the response in each of the cases I have raised here and I am disappointed with the provision of disability medical housing in County Louth.</p> <p>In May of this year, &euro;10 million was allocated in funding for supports for people with disability.  I would not raise the cases if they were not so urgent.  I ask the Minister to examine such situations and to improve disability housing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-10-21a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1078" speakername="Damien English" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015102100005#D00200"><p>I thank Senator Moran for raising the issue.  I am sorry neither of my colleagues could be present to respond to the matter.  They wished to be present but something came up.  Social housing is a key priority for me and the Government, especially the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, and the Minister of State at that Department, Deputy Paudie Coffey.  Under the Social Housing Strategy 2020, the total targeted provision of more than 110,000 social housing units will address the needs of the approximately 90,000 households on the housing waiting lists while also providing scope to address further emerging needs, as in the example Senator Moran raised today.  Social housing targets have been set for each local authority, including Louth County Council, up to 2017.  The targets set and the funding allocated are being invested by local authorities in a combination of building, buying and leasing schemes designed to accommodate 25% of those currently on the housing waiting lists.  The target for Louth is 778 units, the delivery of which is supported by an allocation of &euro;57 million.</p>  <p>In line with the targets set for social housing delivery, the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, announced a major social housing construction programmes in May and July this year, with &euro;492 million of investment covering all 31 local authorities, involving more than 2,800 housing units.  That included more than &euro;150 million in approvals under the capital assistance scheme, which supports approved housing bodies in the provision of housing for homeless persons, the elderly and people with disabilities.  The announcements included 75 new social housing units specifically for County Louth.  Further details of targets, allocations and projects are available on the Department's website.</p>  <p>The assessment and allocation process for social housing support takes into account situations where a member of a household has a disability, such as in the case outlined by Senator Moran, and allows local authorities to prioritise the allocation of accommodation in those circumstances.  Under section 63 of the Local Government Act 1991, a local authority is, subject to law, independent in the performance of its functions.  Under section 22 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and associated regulations, elected council members set down council policy in relation to the allocation of local authority housing in its allocation scheme, including determining the order of priority for the allocation of dwellings by the authority.  The chief executive of the local authority is required to make allocations, including decisions on transfers for existing local authority tenants, in accordance with this scheme.  I understand Louth County Council's scheme provides that transfer applications will be considered in situations where a transfer would relieve a serious medical condition, including physical or mental disability.</p>  <p>Section 22 of the 2009 Act also provides that the chief executive may disregard the order of priority given to a household under an allocation scheme where the household is being provided with social housing support arising from specified exceptional circumstances, including exceptional medical or compassionate grounds.  Support is also provided to local authorities to meet the needs of tenants with a disability through funding for adaptations and extensions to social housing units.  In May, the Minister, Deputy Kelly, allocated &euro;10 million for these supports for 2015, an increase on recent years, with almost &euro;440,000 being made available to Louth County Council.  In summary, local authorities have a range of options available by means of which they can address cases of specific need, whether through use of the increased funding for adapting existing houses; or by making an alternative social house available where this is more suitable; or acquiring a property if that is considered the most appropriate option in individual circumstances.</p>  <p>Senator Moran will appreciate that the Minister cannot directly tell the council what to do or who to give a house to but a range of options is available to address situations, such as the one outlined by Senator Moran.  One of those measures should be available and I hope the matter will be resolved shortly.</p></speech>

It is one thing to say this scheme or that scheme is available and that &euro;10 million has been allocated but this family sought assistance in July.  It would not have cost anything for somebody to go out and assess the situation.  It is now November and the child's operation is next week and yet an occupational therapist has still not even visited the house.  The Minister of State is talking about what might happen in the future.</p>  <p>The other case I mentioned is two and a half years in progress.  I am told the person concerned is on the list and that she is a priority and yet nothing is happening.  We can have all of that in writing but if the situation is not moving, then the system is not working.  The Minister must intervene and ask about the success rate and where houses have been allocated.  I am in contact with the council every day but we need movement.  There is no point in saying something will be addressed.  I ask when that will happen.  The cases to which I refer cannot wait for another year or two years.</p></speech>

He is aware of the case and I will report back to him also.  The Senator must appreciate the Minister's job is to set out the policy and to provide funding for it.  The funding has been allocated to Louth County Council.  The decisions that are made daily as to who get houses and when occupational therapists visit are matters for the local council.  I will raise the Senator's concerns with the Department, which is in constant liaison with the various councils.  I cannot explain why an occupational therapist has not been able to visit.  That is not a decision for the Minister, Deputy Kelly.  It is a local authority decision.</p></speech>

EAL posts are for children who need extra support for learning English.  The best thing might be for me to read an e-mail I received from the principal of the Mercy primary school in Waterford city as it spells out exactly the problem the school faces.  It will take me less than the allocated four minutes to do so:</p><blockquote>It was with shock and dismay yesterday that I opened an e-mail from the Department's primary allocations informing me that the temporary EAL post sanctioned on 1 September is being suppressed on 23 October.  I don't understand this as we have the children enrolled.  The number returned before 5 October was well over the 20% indicated in Circular 005/2015, part 2, section 4.  We are a DEIS band 2 junior school catering for girls aged four to eight years.  We have always applied for and retained temporary language support staff, as we have always exceeded [the requirement] - I quote again from the circular, '20% of total enrolment of the school is made up of pupils that require EAL support'.  This year we have 30% of children requiring EAL support so I'm struggling to understand why this year is different, considering the numbers for previous years - 31% for 2014, 25% for 2013, 22.5% for 2012, 23% for 2011, 25.5% in 2010 and 29.5% in 2008.</blockquote><p>Each and every year, including this year, the school has well exceeded the 20%.  The question the principal is asking is why this year is different when the school is well above the 20% threshold.</p> <p>The principal goes on to say:</p><blockquote>One teacher cannot be expected to adequately cater for the needs of all 93 children who need EAL support.  I would also like to make you aware the children for whom we have concerns about and who are not reaching milestones as expected have been referred for speech and language assessment.  The constant response we receive back is that children must receive two years English language support before a complete assessment can be made.  Therefore, from now on it will be first class before we can cater or refer an EAL child who has started in junior infants and it could be second class before they are assessed.  Our most recent S&amp;amp;L report states 'it takes the average child between three and five years when exposed to full-time schooling and supports to speak a second language as well.'</blockquote><p>If the Minister of State has the figures, will he outline to us how many EAL temporary posts there are at the moment in this State?  There were 400 in 2008 and I believe there is now fewer than that.  There were cutbacks in a number of budgets.  Is that what this is about?  Are we moving the goalposts of the 20% figure?  Are we now simply looking at how many posts we have and dividing that by the number of schools to come up with a new percentage that schools have to reach?  This was a post for this school.  Schools and principals have these battles every year but when they are planning ahead for the year and are told in September that they have a post and it is pulled from them, it creates a challenge for the school and a worry and concern.  I do not know if the Minister of State has a positive response for me today but if he does not and if it is a response that he got from the Department, which is par for the course with these Commencement matters, I ask him to take this back to the Minister directly and alert her to this issue.  Hopefully it is an issue that can be resolved for the betterment of the children in the school.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-10-21a.41" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1078" speakername="Damien English" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015102100006#E00200"><p>I thank Senator Cullinane for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the position on the support provided to schools with a high concentration of pupils that require language support, such as the one he has raised today.  Teacher allocations are approved annually in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment.  Schools are very well informed about the rules.  Reforms introduced in the 2012-13 school year created a single simplified allocation process for both learning and language support.  At primary level, learning and language support hours are allocated on the basis of mainstream classroom teaching posts in the school.  Schools have autonomy to deploy this resource between learning support and language support depending on the specific needs of the school.  The new arrangements also provided for additional permanent teaching posts to be given to schools with high concentration of pupils that require language support.  Further additional temporary support is also provided, as necessary, on the basis of appeals by any of these schools to the primary staffing appeals board.</p>  <p>The criteria used for the allocation of teaching posts for the 2015-16 school year is set out in primary Circular 0005/2015, which the Senator quoted, and which is available on the Department's website.  In addition, the staffing appeal process at primary level includes the provision whereby schools with a high concentration of pupils requiring English as an additional language can apply for additional temporary language support posts.  These language support, EAL, allocations are made on the basis of appeals by schools to the primary staffing appeals board, using projected enrolment for the following September.</p>  <p>The school referred to by the Senator today currently has one permanent language support post.  The school submitted an appeal under the English as an additional language criterion to the primary staffing appeals board.  The board upheld the appeal at its meeting in March 2015 and allocated one additional temporary language support post to the school, subject to the school achieving its projected enrolments on 30 September 2015.  The school was informed in March.  The Senator said September, but the school knew in March that it had this post.  The school would have been very clearly told that it was subject to enrolments on 30 September 2015.  That is usually very clear but that does not seem to be the case in the situation mentioned by the Senator.</p>  <p>While schools must have at least 20% EAL pupils to apply for a temporary EAL post, not all schools with that percentage of EAL pupils will receive a temporary EAL post.  As stated in Circular 0005/2015, additional post or posts may be approved, "having considered the circumstances outlined by the school and having regard to the high number of pupils requiring EAL support".  As the projected enrolment of pupils requiring language support was not achieved on 30 September 2015, the temporary language support post has been withdrawn.  The school will retain its permanent language support post.  The primary staffing appeals board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.  </p>  <p>I thank the Senator for raising the issue and giving me the opportunity to outline the process and to bring some clarity to it.  If the Senator has additional information that we are missing, I will bring it to the Minister's attention.</p></speech>

In fact, it raises more issues.  In the Minister of State's response, he says that the criterion used for the allocation of teaching posts for the 2015-16 year set out in primary Circular 0005/2015, which I quoted, is that 20% of the total enrolment of the school is made up of pupils that require EAL support.  It then goes on to say that while schools must have at least 20% EAL pupils to apply for a temporary post, not all schools with the percentage of EAL pupils will receive a temporary post.  It goes on to say, in terms of the school I have mentioned, that having considered the circumstances outlined by the school and having regard to the high number of pupils requiring EAL support that the numbers were not achieved.  What is the percentage then?  It seems to be very subjective.  It was very clear in the past - it was 20%.  It now says that it has to be at least 20% but it depends on the high number.  What is a high number?  That is the challenge that these principals face.</p><p>To be fair, it is not clear from the circular that schools have been given, what criteria they must meet and it seems to be <i>ad hoc</i>and made up to suit the number of posts that are there rather than the targets, which are about making sure that children get the best education they deserve.  Will the Minister of State alert the Minister to this particular case and to the general issue of the circular and what that means for schools?</p></speech>

I do not have them but I will get them.  To be clear, on the school raised by the Senator, the projected figures on which it won its appeal in March did not happen in September 2015.  The projected enrolment of pupils requiring language support was not achieved by 30 September.  That is why there was a change.  I will get the other information that the Senator requires.</p></speech>

Can a debate be organised on the situation developing in Northern Ireland?  I acknowledge there was a debate in recent times but the revelations yesterday north of the Border in a number of reports and further revelations on this side of the Border are concerning.  Everybody is committed to the peace process with 98% of the people voting for it.  However, there have been allegations over the past number of years about internal police forces and procedures whereby child abusers were diverted to other locations.  This issue was raised by Ma&iacute;ria Cahill, a candidate in the forthcoming Seanad by-election, which is concerning.  When we hear a claim that an army council directs the operations of a democratic political party, without prejudice to anybody in that party, it is one that requires an explanation and a debate which I am sure, as a political party, it would welcome in its own interest.  This morning's contribution by Deputy Mac Lochlainn on Newstalk in which he described these reports as "nonsense" is not helpful.  A prerequisite to the talks in the North, which we all wish well, should be that Sinn F&eacute;in, the UUP and the DUP accept and welcome the report and commit to addressing issues raised in it.</p> <p>Again without prejudice to anybody, that is the kind of positive and direct approach that needs to be seen rather than a pattern of denial which frankly, without prejudice, adds nothing but suspicion to anybody who is involved in democracy, from whatever party and no party.  </p> <p>I would again like to raise the issue of rural crime.  I am sure that all Members at different times, certainly those based in rural and regional communities, have raised it.  I believe that one reaps what one sows.  The facts are the Government has closed 139 Garda stations and the latest recruitment drive which produced 200 garda&iacute; nationally has resulted in none of them being deployed to Sligo and Leitrim and only five to Donegal.  I refer to the north west region, which is where I live.  This morning a supermarket and pub were the subject of a robbery.  The town has no Garda station and the nearest Garda station is located 30 miles away.  In such situations it is difficult for garda&iacute; to reach a crime scene on time and that is why I say that the Government has reaped what it sowed.</p> <p>Apart from the Government decimating rural Ireland through its closure of community services such as Garda stations, locations like Dromore West in County Sligo, which is where this latest robbery took place, have now become targets for sophisticated criminal gangs.  This morning's robbery was carried out by a gang of five people who used heavy machinery.  The robbers knew what they were doing, seamlessly carried out the crime and did not care about alarms going off.  Sadly, because of under resourced Garda stations and a lack of people on the ground these criminals have not yet been apprehended.  We hope that they will and wish the Garda well in that regard.  I would like the House to debate rural crime and work out what can tangibly be done to restore normality to rural communities throughout the country so that all of the people, including businesspeople and the elderly, can feel safe in their homes or business by having a visible presence of garda&iacute; in the shape of Garda stations and personnel.</p></speech>

The legislation was greeted with a celebratory atmosphere in the House.  The Visitors' Gallery was full and the overflow was accommodated in the nearby AV Room where people could watch the debate.  It was a heartening and welcoming experience to be part of the debate.  I hope the Bill will achieve a speedy final passage through the House tomorrow so that we can see the first marriages take place between same-sex couples without further delay.</p>  <p>I welcome the fact that we will debate Report Stage of the Children First Bill today after the Order of Business.  I also welcome the fact that the Government has accepted two amendments that were tabled by my colleague, Senator Jillian van Turnhout, which relate to the abolition of the defence of reasonable chastisement.  This development is hugely important and is something that is long overdue.  It is great to see the Seanad as a Chamber in which the Government accepts amendments of this kind and I know that we will have a good debate.</p>  <p>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on victims of crime.  Is there a projected date for the introduction in the House of the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill?   This morning the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality dealt with the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill.  During the course of the debate powerful submissions were made by eight NGOs who work with victims of crime.  They included the Victims' Rights Alliance, the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, the Rape Crisis Network Ireland, the Irish Penal Reform Trust, IPRT, and other groups.  In the course of their submissions the NGOs reminded us that this Bill is important because for the first time it provides a statutory framework for the protection of victims' rights in the criminal justice system.  It is also a Bill that will implement an EU directive that must be transposed in Ireland by 16 November.  The legislation has reached the heads of a Bill stage.  The committee is hastening through its pre-legislative scrutiny of the legislation.  I wonder can we get it into the Seanad without any undue delay.  During the submissions we also heard from Safe Ireland, which released its data on domestic violence this morning which contained some frightening figures.  As Safe Ireland pointed out to us, the appalling tragedy where Garda Tony Golden was murdered highlights the serious issue of domestic violence and domestic abuse.</p>  <p>I ask the Leader for a debate on Northern Ireland in light of yesterday's reports of paramilitary activity in the North.  As it happens, I will be in Stormont tomorrow and will speak at a conference in Belfast.  It is good that we have close links with our parliamentary colleagues in the North.  To that end, I ask the Leader to consider at our next meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, CPP, what role the Seanad can play in supporting the peace process and bringing about the restoration of the institutions in Northern Ireland.  When former Senator Martin McAleese was here one of our speakers in the House was the head of the Orange Order.  There may be some other way in which the Seanad could support those who are trying to ensure there is a return to proper structures in the peace process and proper parliamentary structures in Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

We debated the matter in this Chamber a number of weeks ago.  On that occasion the contributions made by most of the Senators were comprised of a long list of political charges against Sinn F&eacute;in.  Nothing constructive was offered on how to solve the problems with the peace process or successfully conclude the talks.</p>  <p>I wish to respond directly to Senator MacSharry who asked about the claims made by MI5 in a report that has been published.  I recommend that people read the report in full and to not take their cue from headlines broadcast by the media or from anywhere else.  I urge people to read what the report actually says.  In the report MI5 shared its view that some members of the IRA believe or believed that the army council had a direction in regard to Sinn F&eacute;in.  I wish to state that is untrue.  I have been an elected member of the Ard Chomhairle of Sinn F&eacute;in for the past three years and I was elected on the floor of the Sinn F&eacute;in Ard-Fheis.  The media comes to my party's Ard-Fheis every year.  I am elected democratically by the membership of my party because that is how my party works.</p>  <p>Senator MacSharry wants to talk about criminality.  I can tell him that the only political party that I am aware of that had, in its ranks, people who were convicted of criminality and for taking brown envelopes of cash and stuffing them into their pockets, is his own party.  These acts went to the very highest level of his party.  If he wants to have that debate then my party will have it with him.  As I said in this Chamber a number of weeks ago when we debated crime, it does not matter to me who is involved in criminality.  If some former members of the IRA are involved in crime then I believe they should be ruthlessly pursued by the authorities in the North and South.  Yesterday in the D&aacute;il, my party's justice spokesperson, of whom the Senator spoke about earlier, supported stronger cross-Border initiatives to bring these people to justice.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants such people brought before the courts and convicted.</p>  <p>Sinn F&eacute;in and its members have put their lives on the line by standing up to such individuals who are involved in criminality in the Border areas and in the North.  I contrast the leadership given by Martin McGuinness on all of these issues with the leadership of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party that has, for political and electoral reasons, taken a harder line than that of the DUP.  Let us contrast all of that with what Peter Robinson, MLA, said and did yesterday.  He is now back in the talks and he wants the DUP back in the Executive.  That is what we should focus on.</p>  <p>I would welcome a constructive debate.  I hope that we look at the real issues and not at contrived crises which happens all of the time for political and electoral purposes.  We must identify the real issues of the peace process in the North that need to be addressed in the same spirit that was applied to the process which was supported by people like Bertie Ahern, Tony Blair, Martin McGuinness, MLA, Deputy Gerry Adams and Albert Reynolds.  All of those people were part of a constructive peace process.  Let us get back to that type of politics.  We must ensure that we make the agreements work, that institutions stay in place and that we have institutions in the North that work in the best interests of all communities.  I would welcome the debate and hope that the Leader can arrange it as soon as possible.</p></speech>

We all wish the talks well in the North.  The two separate reports are in agreement, as regards headlines, that a former paramilitary organisation is still in existence, albeit not for military or terrorist activities.  Unfortunately, in the supposedly democratic society that exists on both sides of the Border, and particularly on the other side of the Border in the south Armagh district, there are some crime families who may have been members of an illegal organisation that run the areas as though they are still their personal fiefdoms.  In the area that I mentioned there is a proliferation of blue metal community alert type notices imbedded in walls here and there which some Members have probably seen.</p> <p>The citizenry are being advised that if they have anything to report in terms of disturbance in the community or otherwise they should ring this number, but it is not the number of the police force.  There should be only one police force.</p></speech>

It appears an unseemly row has broken out between the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, in regard to that appointment.  They should not be washing their dirty linen in public.  It undermines the credibility of the new Governor that the Minister, Deputy Howlin, is not in agreement with his appointment.  It is disturbing, to say the least, particularly in the European context, that there would be any doubt, cloud or shadow cast over this highly reputable appointment, which I think everybody here welcomes.  </p>  <p>I ask that the new Governor investigate the activities of Mars Capital, which acquired the 2,200 loans from Irish Nationwide Building Society.  Mars Capital is a vulture fund which although registered in Ireland, does not appear to be under the control of the Central Bank.  I cannot find any evidence on its website that it is under the control of the Central Bank.  It was brought to my attention this morning that it is regularly in touch with compliant customers and mortgage holders in regard to their accounts.  I would regard this as a form of harassment.  I would like to see Mars Capital brought under the control of the Irish Central Bank, in particular with regard to mortgage loans and interest rates.  I ask the Leader to request the Minister for Finance to come to the House for a debate on that matter, which I may also raise as a Commencement matter.</p></speech>

The scene last Thursday in my local parish church was one of devastation and immense grief that another member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na had been gunned down in cold-blooded murder.  When I visited the family last week Tony Golden's wife and mother-in-law pleaded with me to ensure something is done to ensure that our laws around bail for people who have been convicted of serious crime, as in the case of the person who carried out this murder, are changed.</p>  <p>We must ensure the Border is adequately manned and patrolled.  I welcome the announcement that 27 additional garda&iacute; are to be deployed to the Dundalk district but I hope this will be a permanent resource and not only a token six-week presence, as happened following the murder of Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe.  We need to wake up.  It was devastating, and not only for people in the locality or the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to whom my heart goes out, but people generally that we were faced with the murder of another garda less than two years after the murder of Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe.  I, too, would welcome a debate on activity around the North of Ireland.  While we have previously had such debates there are now more serious allegations to be discussed, as highlighted in the reports published yesterday.  I agree with Senators that we all have a lot more to say on this issue.</p>  <p>I also pay tribute to the people of Blackrock and Haggardstown who came together from last Sunday and showed what true community spirit is.</p></speech>

It was a proud moment, if one could take anything at all from it.  I hope that in the long term it will be a source of comfort to the family.

I support the calls for a debate on issues in the North.  It is important that at this stage we focus on the real issues at hand, including the budgetary issues and their implications, the proper functioning of the institutions in the North and how we can foster North-South relations.  In the aftermath of the visit to this House by Drew Nelson of the Orange Order, an invitation to the House was issued to the First Minister and Deputy First Minister.  It would be timely if the Seanad were to reissue that invitation to the new First Minister, when known, and Deputy First Minister.</p>  <p>Tr&eacute;asla&iacute;m le D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in at&aacute; ceapaithe mar leas-choimisin&eacute;ir an Gharda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

I would like to again call for a debate on direct provision, particularly the implementation of the recommendations of the working group on direct provision.  We have rightly had a lot of discussion about the Syrian refugee crisis and how it is to be handled but I am concerned that the new accommodation to be provided in this regard, as per the advertisements for same, will be direct provision plus.  There are currently 4,000 people here languishing in direct provision, in respect of which there are many recommendations made in the working group report, including an increase in the &euro;19.10 per week benefit provided to people there.  I expected announcement of such an increase in last week's budget but I have not yet been able to get clarification on that matter.  There are huge concerns within the direct provision centres around the manner in which the working group report recommendations are being implemented, how that is being managed, who is in charge and so on.  I understand there have been a number of changes in personnel in the agencies leading the work.  It is important that the Minister of State, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, comes to the House to update us on this matter.</p></speech>

This morning I attended a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications with the chairman designate of Sport Ireland, Mr. Kieran Mulvey, who reiterated at that meeting much of what he said during his interview on television last night.  What has emerged out of all of this is that the Irish Amateur Boxing Association, IABA, has serious questions to answer.  For the benefit of the House, it is funded almost totally by the Irish taxpayer and it is, therefore, accountable to the Irish taxpayer.  Last weekend the President of that organisation assured the Minister of State with responsibility for sport that the matter of Billy Walsh's tenure would be resolved.  Yet, two days later he tendered his letter of resignation.  There was much anger conveyed at the meeting this morning, not only by Mr. Mulvey but by members of the committee, in regard to the details which have emerged in the past week.</p> <p>It was not about money.  Billy Walsh is a true patriot and did not wish to leave Ireland, but he is leaving tomorrow.  He is the best boxing coach in the world, as Mr. Mulvey put it, and from this small nation.  We are ranked fourth among boxing nations because of Mr. Walsh's tenure.  The point made by Mr. Mulvey which I would like to convey to the Minister is that the IABA showed disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring; the Irish Sports Council and the taxpayer.  This has to stop.  The organisation is dysfunctional and must be held to account.  Will the Leader convey this message to the Minister of State?  Perhaps there might be an opportunity for him to come before the House to outline the relationship between sports bodies and the Department in the context of the new sports body being set up.  It is important that we clarify what the relationship is.  Is it fair, right and equitable that all of the taxpayers' money is being given to an organisation that is getting rid of Billy Walsh because that is what it is doing?  The IABA has more or less stated it does not want him and that he can go.  As Mr. Mulvey said, it issued a crocodile tears statement yesterday that it regretted the matter and wished Billy Walsh the best of luck.  That is unacceptable.  To thumb the nose at the democratically elected Government of the country and the Minister of State who is responsible for providing sports governing bodies with taxpayers' money is not acceptable either.  In normal circumstances, I would table an amendment to the Order of Business to have the Minister of State brought before us because the departure of Billy Walsh is imminent, but I will not do so.  However, I strongly urge the Leader to convey these comments which I am sure are supported by all sides of the House to the Minister of State and to have the Minister of State to issue a public statement, possibly later today, outlining his plans for the future governance of the IABA and perhaps to take money off it and give it to the high performance unit as a separate autonomous body, as has been done in the United Kingdom, in order that the boxers will not suffer as a result of this and that the dysfunctional group of dinosaurs in the IABA is brought to account.</p></speech>

There is an awareness campaign running.  There was a successful trial held in Wexford in 2013 and 85% of participants were satisfied.  As I said previously when I called for this to happen, people tend to hoard one cent coins because they do not want to carry them.  Therefore, I welcome the development.  It is not the biggest issue in the world, but it is certainly a cost to the State and I am glad to see the move happening.</p>  <p>I commend Laya Healthcare for an activity programme it has introduced across the country.  It was piloted last year when it received a very positive response.  It is called Super Troopers.  Research involving 379 national school teachers and almost 1,000 parents nationwide indicates that the programme which incorporates activity homework has been a success, with 71% of teachers and 70% of parents confirming that taking part in it resulted in an increase in children's daily activity.  Meanwhile, one in four teachers remarked that children's concentration levels had improved as a result.  Children are also feeling the benefits, with 57% of those aged between four and 12 years admitting to eating more fruit and vegetables and 64% saying they drank more water.  It is vital that children get used to being active at a young age; it is all about preventive health care and the good of the nation.</p></speech>

I certainly support their request.  When we reflect on the difficulties on that part of the island which are profound and serious, we must remember that the starting point is that for the past 21 years or thereabouts we have had relative peace in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  We are, therefore, starting from a positive perspective.  Not too many Members of this or the other House served when we had a daily diet of bombs, bullets, murders, condemnation, hopelessness and despair.  Therefore, let us not forget that we have moved a long way and that people on all sides and none have been responsible for this.  That must be the starting point.  There are very profound troubles to be addressed, but I have often made the point that if we can ensure the current generation, particularly in Northern Ireland, at least stops killing each other, perhaps the next might grow closer and that there will be a stronger community ethos and stronger and more normal politics.  That is what we must aim for.  The reports are significant and perhaps serious, but they are not really surprising because they simply tell us what we know.  We have been walking and dancing on egg shells for the past ten, 12 or 15 years so as not to cause difficulties, but we are reaching a stage where we must be a little more blunt in our analysis and discussions.  We will want to hear much more from Sinn F&eacute;in about its relationship or otherwise with the army council-----</p></speech>

It probably consists of some sad old men who are still meeting and talking about the war which they actually lost; their plans to drive 1 million Unionists out of Northern Ireland which they have failed to do; and their plans to overthrow the Government of the Republic of Ireland which they have failed to do.  We are sometimes afraid to remind them that if they had been fighting a war, they would actually have lost.  Let us move forward and have a constructive debate and appreciate the peace we have enjoyed on the island for the past 20 years, but let us also deal in a mature fashion with the problems that remain.  Let those who want to live in the past be consigned to history because most people on the island, North and South, have moved on.</p></speech>

We can engage in negative or positive politics.  While there are problems that must be addressed, we cannot lose sight of the fact that we have come a long way.  The best way to deal with the situation in the North is to have cool heads and try to be as professional as possible in our dealings on it.  We owe this to future generations.</p>  <p>This is Mediation Awareness Week, as perhaps some Members of the House might be aware, but I suspect many are not.  Many practitioners involved in mediation, be it through professional bodies, the Family Court, company mediation services and NGOs, are giving of their time this week to promote mediation services.  When one thinks of the problems in the North, society is always conflicted.  Individuals, community groups businesses and families become involved in conflict.  Is it not far better to deal with issues through mediation to come up with solutions rather than having to go into four goldmines to make millionaires of barristers and senior counsel?  Mediation services are in their infancy in this country and have to gain huge traction.  I commend all of the professionals who are working voluntarily this week to promote such services.  I also commend Councillor Josepha Madigan, a Fine Gael councillor in Dublin South, who has written extensively and published books on the issue.  Mediation is the way forward.  Perhaps we might organise a debate on the issue at some stage.</p> <p>I have tabled a Private Members' motion on it in the past.  It may now be time to celebrate mediation awareness week by committing to having at least statements with the Minister for Justice and Equality on how she sees the future for mediation in the country.</p></speech>

Having listened to him I believe the IABA has serious questions to answer.  We had the best boxing coach in the world at our disposal.  He has had great success not alone at home but across the world.  In the year before the Olympic Games it is a sad loss for the sport and for the country.  It was not an issue with remuneration.  Apparently all the man wanted was respect.  He was not being respected by the IABA.  It is a sad state of affairs.  To lose a man of his calibre is the United States' gain and Ireland's loss to sport.</p></speech>

However, regardless of the outcome for Sinn F&eacute;in, the nation needs peace above everything else.  The whole situation needs to be stabilised.  I would support having a debate on Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>Two other debates mentioned last week are very important.  I have been out campaigning and the issue of crime is coming up frequently on the doorsteps.  There is a need for urgent revision of the bail laws.  Three houses in an estate in Newcastle were burgled last week.</p>  <p>I am outlining priorities here because this is the Order of Business.  The other issue is the need for an urgent debate on housing, including housing certainty and rental certainty.  People are being made homeless by being given their notice.  They have no place to go and the councils have no homes.</p>  <p>My story for today is that the hospital in Galway is still in trouble.  I have been asking myself what difference the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, has made to the health system since his appointment.  I do not know if he has made any difference.</p></speech>

She is vomiting and spent ten hours in the emergency department the night before last and was sent home at 8 a.m.  She knows what her problem is.  She went to a private hospital and got a diagnosis for the problem; she could afford &euro;220.  She cannot afford the &euro;8,000 to &euro;10,000 for the operation.</p>  <p>This young woman presented herself to the emergency department and was simply told to come back again in three weeks.  There is no guarantee she will even be admitted in three weeks.  It is wrong.  At a fundamental level beds are needed.  The HSE and our system are putting this young mother - and probably many more - through hoops.  She is otherwise a healthy woman and needs a procedure that she has had verified in a private hospital but she cannot afford to have it.  That shows the private-public sector divide that still exists.  There is not universal health care when people need it.  Money is not following the need.  In addition, she could end up being treated by the same consultant in the public hospital as treated her in the private hospital.</p>  <p>What has our great Minister for Health achieved?  He takes one hospital and makes an example of it and says he will tackle this by coming up with a model that works and will then replicate it.  Until he decides to come out of his Department, drills down, asks why it is happening and looks at how to bring it to a solution, I do not believe anybody will solve this problem.  I find this young woman's story very moving.</p></speech>

As has been stated we had a debate on Northern Ireland only a few weeks ago, but I will try to facilitate a further debate given that so many Members have requested it in the aftermath of these reports.</p>  <p>The Senator also spoke about rural crime, which is a major issue.  That is why the Government decided that the Garda training college in Templemore would be reopened after it was closed by the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government.  We have 500 extra garda&iacute; on the streets and 600 more provided for in the budget.  Yesterday we had the announcement of 260 new high-speed vehicles to be purchased and in action by the end of the year in addition to the 370 already in place this year.  The Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill, the bail Bill and the victims of crime Bill will all come to the House before Christmas.</p></speech>

Senator Bacik mentioned that the heads of the victims of crime Bill are being discussed by the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  I will try to ensure the Bill will be published as a Seanad Bill.  We are willing to take it in the House as soon as it can be processed.</p><p>Senator Cullinane spoke about the problems with the peace process.  After so many years one would have thought we would have normality restored in Northern Ireland, but unfortunately that is not the case.  We need greater dialogue and to address the problems that are holding up the situation at the moment.  In doing that we cannot just forget the problems on the policing side and, as Senator Paul Coghlan, mentioned the <i>omerta</i>that seems to be in place - the fear in the community in south Armagh and other areas of people who seem to be policing it but who are not part of the actual police force of the area.</p><p>The matter will need to be addressed by both Governments - on this side of the Border and in particular on the other side of the Border.  There seems to be an absence of a police presence in those areas which is allowing these criminals to act with impunity.  The matter was addressed by the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly in a report last year which called for a task force to eliminate these criminals.  Some of them may have links with the Provisional IRA but there is no doubt that the army council is still in existence, as we all know.  Whether it is organising criminality is another question.</p></speech>

As he knows, we had a number of debates in the House on direct provision.</p> <p> Senators Mooney and Brennan referred to the debates at the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications and Mr. Kieran Mulvey's presence there today.  They are right in saying that the Irish Amateur Boxing Association, IABA, has serious questions to answer.  The IABA showed complete disrespect to the Minister and the taxpayer.  Whatever about funding the IABA, it is important that the high-performance unit should be funded properly and that our boxers should receive the financial support they need to continue their good work in bringing such success to the country.  Perhaps the high-performance unit should be divorced from the IABA.</p> <p>Senator Noone spoke on the proposed abolition of 1 cent and 2 cent coins, a development which has been welcomed by many people.  The Senator also commended Laya Healthcare on its Super Troopers programme, which, as she outlined, is bringing about many benefits.</p> <p>Senator Bradford referred to Northern Ireland.  He is 100% correct in stating that we have moved a long way in respect of Northern Ireland.  We have come a long way from the time when we would come into the House and hear about bombings and killings which had taken place.  As he indicated, the reports relating to the army council and other matters are significant.  However, to many people, they are not surprising.  Even while discussing these problems, there is a need to move on and try to facilitate talks that will ensure the Executive is up and running properly in Northern Ireland.  To jaw-jaw is always better than to war-war and we must ensure that will continue to happen.</p> <p>Senator Conway spoke on mediation awareness week and highlighted the positive benefits of mediation.</p> <p>Senator Healy Eames referred to a number of matters about which she is concerned.  I have addressed the issue of crime and the legislation which will be coming before the House.  We will try to facilitate a debate on housing with the Minister .  I understand there will be further announcements within the next couple of weeks and perhaps we can invite the Minister to come before the House at that stage.  Senator Healy Eames might table a Commencement matter on the specific item she mentioned in the context of health.  Regarding what the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, has done, there will be an extra 400 beds in the system before the end of this year, which is a very positive step in the health service.</p></speech>

As I stated on Committee Stage, the Government is fully committed to the elimination of corporal punishment and to protecting children from violence.  This amendment not only abolishes the defence of reasonable chastisement but will also convey a strong message which, I hope, will lead to a cultural change across society in Ireland that corporal punishment is wrong.</p>  <p>Senator van Turnhout proposed an amendment in this regard on Committee Stage and I requested her to postpone the progressing of it until Report Stage in order that the work already well under way in my Department on this issue could be finalised.  I thank her for her co-operation in that regard.  This is a very important issue and it is one in respect of which we share an objective.  Many Members of the House who spoke on the issue on Committee Stage clearly share the same objective.  The Senator supports the amendment as brought forward by me today.</p>  <p>I take this opportunity to mention the late John Boland, a former Deputy and predecessor of mine, who is survived by his widow, Kay.  On 26 January 1982, when he was Minister for Education, John Boland introduced a regulation banning corporal punishment in schools.  That regulation came into effect in February 1982.  We are joined in the Gallery by the relatives of the late Dr. Cyril Daly, whom I knew very well and who was also a great exponent of banning corporal punishment when it was neither popular nor profitable to do so.  As a result of his stance, Mr. Daly found himself in conflict with those powers that he held in such dear esteem.</p>  <p>The amendment before the House provides for the total abolition of the common law defence of reasonable chastisement.  It does not create a new offence but rather removes something that has its roots in a completely different era and societal context.  The measure asserts: that there is no circumstance in which it may be seen to be in order to hit a vulnerable person, in this case a child; that from a child's perspective there is nothing reasonable about being on the receiving end of corporal punishment; that Irish parents are no less protective of their children, nor less progressive in their parenting practices, than those in the other 19 European countries where a statutory ban on corporal punishment is in place; that the Government, by its laws, will protect and vindicate the rights of children; and that Ireland is diligent as regards meeting its international obligations in the area of human rights.  The measure represents a significant advancement as regards the protection and rights of children.  It reinforces the developing impetus in parenting practices in Ireland to use positive discipline strategies in upbringing of children which reject the use of corporal punishment.</p>  <p>The environment in which this amendment can be taken is one that takes account of the children's referendum.  The referendum marked a milestone in this country in regard to children.  The people voted in favour of children having rights and those rights that must be respected.  The action we take today is a further step in recognising those rights, making that amendment to our Constitution all the more real.</p>  <p>I would also like to say a word about positive parenting where we support our children's self-discipline and behaviour by means of a learning strategy rather than through punishment.  Positive parenting is strongly advocated by many parenting support groups and programmes.  The Child and Family Agency, Tusla, has published a parenting support strategy which was launched in October 2013.  As part of that strategy, the agency has launched its 50 Key Messages document, which is an evidence-informed guide for parents and practitioners of keys messages that are important in the context of raising children.</p> <p>Family resource centres around the country provide positive parenting programmes which people will find beneficial.  In other jurisdictions where similar measures in this area have been introduced, research shows the number of parents who thought it acceptable to use corporal punishment has fallen and continues to fall.</p> <p>I commend the amendment to the House.</p></speech>

He is, however, particularly welcome today.  One of the first objectives I set when I became a Member in 2011 was for Ireland to repeal the defence of reasonable chastisement.  When the Seanad took Committee Stage of the Children First Bill on 23 September, I tabled an amendment, with thanks to the expert help of Dr. Fergus Ryan, to the same purpose as this amendment.  At the time the Minister said, &ldquo;If I have my way, we will have this defence of reasonable chastisement removed from the Statute Book&quot;.  Here we are today.</p><p>I am very aware of and thankful for all the work done by the Minister personally, by officials and advisers across the Government, co-operating and working together to bring about this amendment.  I extend my particular thanks to the officials of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  I also thank my assistant and researcher, Amy McArdle, for all her work and support.  I was heartened on Committee Stage to receive cross-party and Independent support.  I thank my colleagues for that.  On 23 September, I cited several international and national experts.  I do not intend to repeat myself today but ask that my words on Committee Stage be included in any documenting of how Ireland brought about the abolition of the defence of reasonable chastisement.</p><p>Over the years, there have been notable voices to the fore calling for Ireland to take this step.  Of special note, I must thank the Childrens Rights Alliance, in particular Tanya Ward and Maria Corbett, who have been steadfast in their support and in ensuring the support of a wide range of children and youth organisations; the ISPCC, Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, driven by the experience of children calling into its Childline service, has always prioritised ending a culture of violence against children; and the special rapporteur on child protection, Professor Geoffrey Shannon, who has through his reports repeatedly called on us as legislators to repeal the defence of reasonable chastisement.</p><p>For the global leadership they have provided, I thank Marta Santos Pais, Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General on Violence against Children; Peter Newell of the global initiative to end all corporal punishment of children; and Ireland&rsquo;s academics who have shone a light on Ireland&rsquo;s international obligations, in particular Professor Ursula Kilkelly of University College Cork.  I also thank Jenny and Michael Hassett, my mum and dad.  Since 23 September, I have had much time to reflect and probe why I am so passionate about this issue.  It is, of course, rooted in my own childhood.  My memories brought me back to a particular primary school teacher who would, on occasion, whack someone in our class across the ears with a ruler.  I remember telling my mum.  She said that if I was ever hit, I was to stand up calmly, walk out of the class, go to the office of the school secretary and ask for my parents to be called to come and collect me.  I was lucky.  My parents were ahead of their time.  They respected me as an independent rights holder.  I thank my mum for being here today to share this momentous occasion.</p><p>Why do we as a society accept that we even debate if and when it is acceptable to hit someone, let alone when that someone is smaller than us and probably does not understand why they are being hit?  Very often, when we discuss the issue of corporal punishment, violence against children, or so-called &ldquo;slapping&rdquo;, one can almost feel an invisible line appear in people&rsquo;s heads about their tolerance level.  They say, &ldquo;You know I am only talking about a tap, not a thump, a slap, not a belt, a smack, not a whack&rdquo;.  Of course, the issue is wrapped up in how we were raised.  All too often the knee-jerk reaction of &quot;it never did me any harm&quot; is heard.  I would add it never did people any good either.</p><p>This invisible line is very subjective and it leaves children vulnerable.  When someone hits a child, it is not happening from a rational place.  The decision is made in a heightened emotional state, when we are stressed, when we are tired and least able to engage sound and reasoned judgment.  The invisible line gets blurred.  In extreme cases, it gets rubbed out completely.  One way or another, the existence of the invisible line means children are all too often exposed to an escalation of violence.  The excuse, &ldquo;I got a terrible fright when she ran out on the road and so I just hit her to show how wrong it is&rdquo; is used with children.  We all get frights in our life but my first reaction is not to hit someone.  Why do we culturally accept that it is okay when it is a child?  A caller to the &ldquo;Last Word with Matt Cooper&rdquo; on Today FM summed it up by saying, &ldquo;My grandmother has Alzheimer&rsquo;s and she is as likely to walk out into traffic or harm herself.  Should I use that as a reason to slap her?&rdquo;</p><p>Of course, I understand the importance of supporting parents in the vital role they play in their child&rsquo;s life.  We need to ensure parents have access to supports and resources when they need them.  We know the majority of parents already believe we have a ban on corporal punishment.  However, I know some parents are anxious about this change in the law.  I reassure them that we all want the best for their children, for the children of Ireland.  To this end, I would like to take this moment to thank Laura Haugh of <i>mummypages.ie</i>for its unequivocal support of the amendment.  I would also like to point to an excellent book for any parents who are anxious, developed by a leading advocate in this area, Paul Gilligan.  His book, <i>Raising Emotionally Healthy Children</i>, is a great resource which provides much advice and support.</p><p>By abolishing the defence of reasonable chastisement, we are giving life to the children&rsquo;s amendment in our Constitution, Article 42A.1, which states: &quot;The State recognises and affirms the natural and imprescriptible rights of all children and shall, as far as practicable, by its laws protect and vindicate those rights.&quot;  We know that corporal punishment can cause serious harm to children, teaches them that violence is an acceptable way of solving conflicts and is ineffective as a means of discipline.  We know there are positive ways to teach, correct or discipline children which are better for the child&rsquo;s development and health.  Corporal punishment makes it more difficult to protect children from severe abuse if some forms of violence are legitimate.  With this amendment, we are ensuring that all citizens are equal in the eyes of the law.</p><p>This ancient defence of reasonable chastisement is not an Irish invention.  It came to us from English common law.  Through its colonial past, England has been responsible for rooting this legal defence in over 70 countries and territories throughout the world.  In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the reasonable punishment defence still allows parents and some other carers to justify common assault on children.  In Scotland, there is another variation, namely, the defence of justifiable assault.  In this action being taken today, the Government is putting children first and providing leadership, which will hopefully give confidence to the Government at Westminster, the devolved UK Administrations and other countries across the globe to discard these archaic and disreputable defences and give full respect to the dignity of children.</p><p>Ireland will be the 20th EU member state to effectively ban corporal punishment in our jurisdiction.  In doing so, I hope the remaining European governments will follow suit.  Irish law is being brought into step with parents, children&rsquo;s rights advocates and international best practice.  With this amendment we have a way to unite and agree that all citizens are equal.  There must never be a defence for violence against children.  I am honoured to have championed and secured the effective ban on the physical punishment of children in Ireland.</p></speech>

I congratulate Senator van Turnhout on this amendment which I fully support instinctively as a parent and grandparent myself.  Without the support of the Minister, this would not have been possible.  I admire the work and research the Senator has put into it.  As deputy leader of the Irish delegation to the Council of Europe, I am especially pleased to be associated with it because it would have been to the forefront of the council&rsquo;s agenda.</p>  <p>Giving leadership to our neighbouring countries is an interesting development.</p> <p>On foot of the work done by Senator van Turnhout and in light of the support she received, the fact that it is permitted in those jurisdictions will put pressure on their legislatures to consider the situation.  What is happening here certainly proves a point.  If there were no Seanad, this amendment would not have been included because nobody in the Lower House sought to move it.  No Deputy decided to pursue it in the manner in which Senator van Turnhout has done.  Had this House been abolished, the amendment would never have been moved.  There would have been no amendment and the current position would have continued to obtain.  The latter is a worthwhile point and the people recognised.  The Minister is following in the footsteps of his late colleague from north Dublin, John Boland, who brought about the abolition of corporal punishment in schools.  This was a major innovation, particularly as all Members, including the Minister, will recall being in school and the fear and terror we experienced.  I attended a Christian Brothers school and I have a great deal of respect for that order.  I will never attack the Christian Brothers because they gave me a good start in life.  I refer, in particular, to Brother O'Dwyer, who gave me great support at school and who I have always regarded highly.  Nevertheless, the Christian Brothers had leather straps made which allowed members of the order to inflict maximum torture on pupils.  I recall the fear of getting "six of the best", as it was called, and seeing teachers standing on their tiptoes in order to inflict the maximum pain.  That has stayed in my memory.  This fear was not just for myself because I was not punished that much although, like every child in the class, I was given six of the best at some stage.  I wish to recognise the name of John Boland in the Chamber today.  Mr. Boland was a former colleague of the Minister in north Dublin and I presume he knew him well.  John Boland was the Minister who brought about the abolition of corporal punishment at a time when there was a lot of resistance to the proposal.  Looking back, was it not right that it was abolished?</p></speech>

If I look back to my own childhood, it was like that of Senator van Turnhout, who was blessed with her mother and father and the manner in which they gave her support.  That support has built her up and given her the courage to bring forward these amendments.  However, I recall going home to a loving mother - my father was a stonemason and worked away from home a great deal -  who was there to greet me with a cup of tea and some biscuits.  I looked forward to that moment.  There was never fear in my home and I was fortunate in that regard.  Moreover, one continues with the example one receives with one's own family and that was something to which we never needed to resort.  It is nothing about which to boast but I was fortunate this did not arise.</p>  <p>I wish to make one point in respect of which the Minister might respond.  This provision should not lead to overuse or abuse of the resources of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, a reasonable approach should be taken.  One might call it a phasing-in approach whereby people will be aware of the position, will not abuse the law and will not be able to resort to this defence if they are actually challenged or if charges are brought against them.  It is important that from the time the President signs this Bill into law, anyone who sees a child being abused, by a parent or otherwise, will have the right - and will use that right - to inform a member of the Garda that wrongdoing is taking place and that the law is being broken.  I refer to public demonstrations of abuse which will be quite evident, which one can foresee and about which one can do something.  Privately and internally, a child will be able to contact the helpline, which is fine, but the Minister should be aware of this point.  The publicity that will arise from this provision and parents' awareness of it will go a long way toward achieving compliance and ensuring that parents will not use force against, abuse or slap their children .  There are many other ways to do it.  Every family is different but this is an important development and I am delighted to be associated with it.</p>  <p>I again congratulate Senator van Turnhout on her initiative in tabling this amendment.  In particular, I congratulate the Minister and his officials.  I presume this measure was approved by the Cabinet on Tuesday last, so I take this opportunity to compliment the Cabinet as well.  I do so because this may not be as popular in some quarters as it might be in others.  However, popularity does not matter - we are concerned with the rights of children.  As the Senator noted, why pass a referendum without introducing this measure?  In a sense, there was a contradiction in that the people approved a children's rights amendment without something being done to protect children in their homes or otherwise.  I again say "Well done" and offer my congratulations.  I thank the Minister for going along with this amendment in the House.  It shows his independence of thought and his ability as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  I have great faith in the Minister's ability and long may he continue his work.</p></speech>

I also wish to welcome the Minister and thank him, in particular, for accepting the amendment.  He gave Members great heart on Committee Stage when he stated that if he had his way, the amendment would be accepted.  I spoke at length on this amendment on Committee Stage but I reiterate my thanks and appreciation to Senator van Turnhout for the work she put into it.  She has been the driving force behind the amendment.  One sometimes might hear people stating that a Senator was not elected to the Seanad but instead was nominated or whatever.  Senator van Turnhout has proved today why she was nominated to be a Member of this House.  She brought her expertise with her - having worked with the Children's Rights Alliance - and now, having utilised it, she has accomplished what she set out to achieve.  Today, I am proud to be part of the Government which has accepted this amendment.  I speak on behalf of all my Labour Party colleagues, who support fully this amendment and are delighted that it has been accepted.  I am sure our leader, Senator Bacik, will reaffirm this point when she speaks later.</p>  <p>In recent weeks I have discussed this proposal with people and have told them what is happening.  Approximately 99% of them were in agreement with the proposal and stated that it is fantastic and represents a great move on the part of the Senator.  Some others have shown a little reservation about it.  One point that arose continually relates to people's concern with regard to how it will be policed and how we will know if children are being slapped at home.  I recall that when the smoking ban was introduced, people thought it would never be possible to police it.  However, the ban came into force and it worked.  Moreover, because it involved an entire cultural change, it stopped people smoking in private houses.  People who visit my home will go outside for a fag.  I have never stopped them from so doing because I do not really like it in the house.  Although there was no obligation on them to leave a private house to go out and smoke, they did so nevertheless.  The smoking ban appears to have involved a culture change for people and I believe that what is proposed here will also involve a culture change.  That change will focus people's minds on the issue.  They can concentrate and conclude they can no longer slap a child.  Regardless of how gentle one might be in doing so, one cannot slap a child.  I believe that 99% of the people are honourable and will abide by this law.  I thank all those present in the Gallery who have put a lot of work into this measure in conjunction with Senator van Turnhout, the Minister and his officials.  It is a great day on which I am proud to be present in the Seanad.  What we are doing shows that this House was worth keeping.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-10-21a.115" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1133" speakername="David Cullinane" time="12:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015102100015#S00500"><p>First and foremost, I commend the Minister on bringing forward this Bill.  It is a good day for Ireland and the State that the passage of the Bill before us through the Houses is reaching its conclusion.  I sat on the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children for the first two years in which I served in the Seanad and it was an issue the Minister constantly supported and raised.  He received full co-operation in respect of it from my party, as well as cross-party support and support from the Independent groupings and that has helped us reach the position at which we have arrived today.  I also commend Senator van Turnhout on her eloquent contribution.  Her tabling of these amendments, which the Minister has accepted, means this is a good day for the Seanad and for governance in this State.  It is far too often the case that what we are witnessing today does not happen because although reasonable amendments are tabled, they are not accepted as a result of the fact that they are put forward by the Opposition.  I am pleased that on this occasion the amendments before the House are being accepted.</p>  <p>It also is important to state that we have come a long way during the past 30 years in how we deal with issues pertaining to children's rights.  This culminated in the referendum which, again, my party supported.  It was fantastic to see that referendum proposal being passed, even though many people, for all sorts of spurious reasons, did not support it.  I am proud Sinn F&eacute;in supported it.  I am glad that the Opposition and Government parties which supported the referendum proposal on a collective basis managed to get it over the line.</p>  <p>In many respects, this Bill flows from that referendum outcome and strengthens the safeguarding of children.  It puts key elements of the Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children of 2011 on a statutory footing.  It also introduces mandatory reporting of child protection concerns for key groups of people that provide services to children.</p> <p>Many thousands of children in this State and across the island have been abused.  Many of them were failed by organisations and the State.  We have all learned many valuable lessons on how we deal with those issues.  That is for the good of all concerned.</p> <p>I welcome the important amendments to remove the defence of reasonable chastisement from the Statute Book.  It is a good day for the State.  I will not say what year I was in because that might give away who the teacher was but in one of the years when I was in primary school, we had a teacher who had a long stick and who used it occasionally to smack all of the children in the class.  There was only one teacher in the entire school at that time who used the stick.  Fortunately, that does not happen any more.  That shows we are progressing all the time.</p> <p>Reference was made to parents who smack or use a correction to chastise a child.  I have two children, one of whom is aged eight and the other is four.  They can be very trying at times, like anyone else's children.  They try my patience but I have never once raised my hand to either of my children and I never will.  However, I will not demonise people who see it as valid to give a child a slight smack.  I do not agree with it; it is wrong.  What we need to do is to deal with it in legislation to make sure that it is not right and that we send out a message collectively from the Oireachtas that we do not tolerate such behaviour any more.  While a person might consider it to be the right thing for him or her to do, that he or she is not doing anything wrong or that this is the way he or she wishes to chastise his or her child, it does not work, it is not right and it is not fair.  We have all seen parents in pubs or at open air events give a child of two or three years of age a smack.  That is most unfair and it is not the way we should chastise children when they do wrong.</p> <p>I commend the Minister on the significant work he has done.  He should be commended on this personal achievement.  The Government should also be commended, as should all of the Senators who have done their own work on it.  I single out Senator van Turnhout and I commend her on the really good job she has done, given her experience and what she has brought to the Seanad on children's rights issues.</p></speech>

I wholeheartedy welcome these two amendments.  I say well done to Senator Jillian van Turnhout and congratulate her on her tenacity in pursuing this issue.  That has brought us to this day when we see this historic Bill being passed, in particular for the reason that it will abolish the ancient and very much outdated defence of reasonable chastisement.</p>  <p>Senator Moloney rightly spoke about the cultural change that will undoubtedly be consolidated and strengthened by the passage of the Bill.  I am also a parent of young children.  That cultural change has happened.  It is now seen as very much unacceptable to physically chastise a child.  We have come to realise that there is nothing reasonable about physical chastisement, despite that outdated term we still use.  It is really good to see the law catching up with this, the Minister accepting the amendments and the Bill being passed.  I commend the Minister and his officials on their work in taking the amendments and getting Government support for them.</p>  <p>This morning the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality had hearings on the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill.  We heard from children's rights groups on the protection of the rights of child victims of crime.  The Bill is very much in keeping with that overall framework of laws in which we are providing greater protection of children's rights and the rights of child victims of crime.  The laws are within the overarching framework of the children's rights amendment that we passed successfully some years ago, as referred to by other Members.  As leader of the Labour Party group, I wish to add my words of support and commendation.  I congratulate Senator van Turnhout for her work on this Bill.  I thank the Minister, in particular for using the Seanad in this way.  As other speakers have said, it is a good day for the Seanad when we see Private Members' amendments accepted by the Government in the House and for Bills to be strengthened and improved as a result.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister.  He has always been a great servant of children.  The children of Ireland are well served by him.  When he was Minister for Health he took steps to ban smoking by adults where children were present in cars.  He listened most attentively on Committee Stage to what Members said.  I was in his company on that sad occasion last Thursday.  Everybody who was at Garda Golden's funeral was moved by the two year-old, three year-old and five year-old children following their father's hearse.  We knew the Minister's heart was in the right place.  I am delighted he has accepted the amendments.</p><p>Present in the Gallery is Dr. Toddy Daly, a son of Dr. Cyril Daly, and Dr. Daly's wife, Aileen.  Cyril Daly campaigned for this for many years, a point to which the Minister referred on Committee Stage.  His statement on it was that to Cyril Daly the Irish child is a human being with human rights.  Children have those rights from today as they are now enforced in legislation.</p><p>Like the Minister, I remember John Boland, who as Minister for education in the 1980s introduced the measure on corporal punishment, against substantial opposition.  I also mention Owen Skeffington, one of my predecessors as a Trinity Senator.  I gather the Daly family has correspondence from Senator Skeffington.  I mentioned previously during the debate the famous story that someone said he was beaten in school and it never did him any harm and the Senator's response was  &quot;The question is what did do the harm.&quot;  We have moved away from that approach - <i>Tom Brown's School Days</i>, the fag system and the Victorians with the spare the rod and spoil the child attitude.  Since the views of educationalists such as Maria Montessori we now see children are interesting, fascinating, inspiring, stimulating.  Why on earth would we want to impose any form of physical punishment on them?</p><p>Senator Moloney was deeply moving in her contribution on the previous day's debate.  She always is when she speaks in support of Senator van Turnhout on such issues.  Senator Leyden said it would be a suitable way to commemorate the centenary of 1916.  One of the best suggestions in that regard is that children will be cherished, as in the democratic programme of that D&aacute;il.</p><p>This is a significant day for human rights in this country.  We were all children once and therefore the rights of everybody are protected by this measure.  In its way it is as big a celebration as the one we were celebrating last night in the context of the celebrations in Dublin Castle on 23 May.  This one is even bigger when on thinks of the number of people who will benefit in the future from what the Minister is doing here today.  I commend the Minister very strongly for making this change and for remembering reading notes in the <i>Irish Medical Times</i>from Dr. Daly, whom he knew personally as a friend.  He also knew John Boland as a friend.  These friendships do matter.  They make us question whose children should be punished and why was that power given to big people to beat small people.  We have moved away from all of that now.  This is a great day for Seanad &Eacute;ireann and a great day for the children of this country that this Minister, with the unanimous support of the House, is supporting the amendments.</p></speech>

Senator van Turnhout is absolutely committed to the welfare of children in this country.  It is a pleasure to know her.  I sincerely congratulate her on everything she has done so far.

I believe matters will be dealt with in the way they have always been addressed very seriously by Tusla if there are allegations or reports of any breach of the legislation.</p>  <p>It is progressive legislation.  We have had a number of pieces of progressive legislation in recent years, all of which I welcome.</p> <p>Even when we were in the darkest of times financially, we did not forget the things that were important in life and our values as a people.<br/><br/>Like Senator Jillian van Turnhout, I acknowledge the support of the Children's Rights Alliance and Tanya Ward who is with us today and the great work done by Geoffrey Shannon as special rapporteur<i></i>in this area, the ISPCC and my officials in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  I also acknowledge the presence of Kay Boland, John Boland's widow, who was very supportive of him when others said he was up against, let us say, a degree of resistance in 1982.  I thank all Senators but, in particular, Senator Jillian van Turnhout for her persistence and support.  This is not the first Bill in which we have both been involved together.  Both in her time in the NGO sector and in the Seanad, she has done wondrous work for children, on which I congratulate her.  I acknowledge the presence of the widow and children of Dr. Cyril Daly who was also a great champion of this cause.  I thank everyone for his or her support.

With this amendment, the section would provide that a mandated person would include a person employed in a preschool service within the meaning of Part VIIA of the Child Care Act 1991, &quot;including a person taking care of one or more children (other than that person's own such children) in that person's home, but not including any such person who is a relative of the child or children or the spouse of such relative&quot;.  We dealt with this issue on Committee Stage and believed there was reason to bring it forward again on Report Stage as a number of other amendments had been submitted.  The problem for us is that the Bill defines a mandated person as a person &quot;employed in a pre-school service within the meaning of Part VIIA of the Child Care Act 1991&quot;.  Part VIIA of the Child Care Act includes childminders caring for four or more children, other than their own, but exempts childminders caring for three or fewer children.  The aim of the amendment is to ensure inclusion of childminders caring for three or fewer children while still excluding relatives.  We discussed this matter on Committee Stage but felt it was important to resubmit the amendment.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 3 proposes to include a person taking care of one or more children in his or her home who is not a relative of the child.  One of the reasons a person taking care of a child in his or her home is not a mandated person under the Bill is that the categories of persons set out in Schedule 2 were included in the Schedule on the basis of their professional qualifications and ongoing contact with children.  The focus on a small, qualified cadre of mandated reporters will, based on evidence, improve the quality of reports made to the agency.  The receipt by it of better quality reports from persons who, by virtue of their training, qualifications and professional experience, are well equipped to recognise harm to a child is likely to have a positive effect on the process of assessments of the risk for a child.  The list of mandated persons was developed following detailed consideration of both the objectives of the legislation and the reserach paper on how mandatory reporting was dealt with internationally.  As indicated, as the persons included in the list have been selected on the basis of their qualifications, role and professional expertise, it means that they are aware of risks to children and their responsibilities in that regard.  It is anticipated that reports from these persons are likely to be of a high quality, which will assist the agency in carrying out assessments of risk in a more effective and efficient manner.</p>  <p>The reason childminders are not included in the requirement for mandatory reporting is that the childminding sector is not homogenous and a wide variety of arrangements, including personal family arrangements, pertain.  In that context, it was considered overly onerous to impose a mandatory requirement on such a heterogeneous group of providers.  However, it is important to note that, while not required to do so under the legislation, any person can and should report any concern about a child to the agency in accordance with the Children First national guidance which will operate in tandem with the legislation.  This position applies to childminders as well to as any other person who has contact with a specific child or children, whether in the context of service provision or otherwise.  In comparison, the formal childminding sector, namely, cr&egrave;ches, will be covered by requirements relating to child safeguarding statements and mandated reporting.  </p>  <p>The Senator's concern to protect this group of children should be alleviated by the fact that there are many other professionals in contact with this group of children, including nurses who are mandated persons and GPs.  In this regard, the recent extension of GP medical cards to children under six years of age should ensure greater contact between this group of children and their GPs.  This is shortly to be extended further to under-12s next year.  GPs are also mandated persons under the legislation.  For these reasons, I am not accepting the amendment.</p>  <p>On what Senator Terry Leyden had to say about Garda resources and so forth, in other jurisdictions mandated reporting of this nature has led to a massive increase in reporting, with no increase in prosecutions or real cases being identified.  A balance needs to be struck.</p></speech>

While we can say it is long overdue, it is before the House.  The Minister has done the work to put child welfare and protection provisions on a statutory footing.  We are solidifying good intentions, which has to be commended.  This needs to be resourced and the Minister took positive steps in securing these resources in the budget.  I have no doubt that he will continue to do so.  For me, this is an emotional day, given the repeal of the defence of reasonable chastisement.  I commend the Minister for having the courage to bring it forward.  On so many issues, he has proved that he is a children's champion.  He is an outstanding Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  I thank him wholeheartedly for all he has done for the children of Ireland.  He has taken a critical leadership role, for which I thank him.</p></speech>

With the amendment, the Title is absolutely correct, as has been very much proved by the Minister with the support of his officials.  The opinion of the Attorney General was also sought in this regard and I thank the Minister for the clarification.  I was not trying to put a damper on the Bill, but the point is that Garda resources are stretched.  It is important, therefore, that the agency will investigate claims and that the matter may then go further.</p> <p>As the Minister said, that would be a very important issue.</p> <p>I did not realise Mrs. Boland, widow of the late John Boland, was in the Visitors Gallery.  She is very welcome.  I was in the D&aacute;il with the late John Boland when nobody in this House was here.  He was an excellent Minister.  It has taken a long time, from 1982 to 2015, to extend those rights.  With respect to the Minister, the encouragement received from Senator Jillian van Turnhout and the support of everyone in the House certainly made it possible.  We are all very pleased and honoured to be in the House today.  Is it not amazing that it took so long?  When the then Minister, the late John Boland, brought this forward, it was not as widely accepted as we may think.  In fact, there would have been much resistance to it and educationalists felt the classrooms would be chaotic, that there would be no discipline, no power and no control but he proved them all wrong.  That is one of his many legacies as Minister in the Department of Education.  That stands out today because of Senator Jillian van Turnhout's amendment.  It is a wonderful occasion.  As we approach 2016, there is no better recognition of it than, after 100 years, we should give children rights as, I think, was envisaged in the Constitution and in the Declaration of Independence.</p> <p>Senator Sean Barrett also said this was very good and something we should be pleased to say on the eve of the 1916 celebrations.  That it will be enacted for 2016 is a very good day's work.  I am delighted the Minister has taken on the portfolio for children and youth affairs with gusto.  He has such authority in Cabinet that he was in a position to persuade it to accept the amendment tabled by Senator Jillian van Turnhout.</p></speech>

I had not seen her before I spoke earlier.  Schools are so much happier places since the late John Boland banned corporal punishment in them.

They seek to set targets rather than aspirations.  We had some lengthy exchanges on Second Stage when I outlined the major flaws in the Bill, one of which is the fact that while the Bill is high on rhetoric and aspiration it is very low on setting targets.  That makes a mockery of bringing forward a Bill on climate change because the whole point of doing something on climate change is to put in place targets for actions that will reach a conclusion and deliver something.  If we do not do that there is no incentive to design a plan to bring about meaningful reductions.</p><p>It is interesting that other amendments tabled by me and Opposition Members that would embody and set targets within an agreed timeframe have been ruled out of order.  That is a matter for the Cathaoirleach but I find it strange.  When discussing the need for this Bill and in its report on what it should contain, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht set out clearly that this State needs to have targeted reductions in line with the international agreements the State has signed up to.</p><p>I read contributions on this issue in the D&aacute;il even before this Government was elected and in other committees which have discussed the issue, and much of what I am saying about the need to set targets and the flaws in this Bill are precisely what both Government parties were saying was necessary to bring about a strategic, overarching but realistic and deliverable climate change plan.  The Government seems to have turned all that on its head.  Who is really driving this; civil servants, people in the Department or is the Government in the driving seat at all for this Bill? </p><p>The absence of such targets means that this Bill lacks any real power to ensure that meaningful steps are taken to address the issues involved in bringing about a reduction in CO<sub>2</sub>emissions across the main economic sectors.  Some groups and special interests lobby strongly against setting targets and that might have been part of the influence.  It would be interesting if the Minister of State would set out in detail why targets were not set and why a Bill was designed that is high on aspiration but very poor and shallow in respect of tangible targets.  That is a fundamental criticism of the Bill supported by many organisations outside the Seanad which have campaigned and lobbied for climate change action for many years.  They also feel this Bill falls far short of what is necessary.  That is the purpose of these amendments.</p></speech>

We want this to happen.  It has to be quantified so that we can measure the progress.  Senator Bacik introduced a Bill on the environment in 2007 and the last Government introduced one in 2010.  There have been many delays in bringing in this Bill.  We should know what the goal is and whether we are making any progress.</p>  <p>I have spent many hours and days in the dungeon at the banking inquiry.  It is necessary to motivate public administration with quantified targets and the progress we are making.  Many knew what was going wrong in Irish banking but nobody did anything about it.  For example, the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day massacre occurred but by 29 September nothing had been done, then the banks came looking for &euro;64 billion.  We need to galvanise and motivate the environment policy to reach goals.</p>  <p>This has become more urgent.  President Obama is seriously concerned about climate change.  The Irish-Canadian, Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, has said that financing the decarbonisation of our economy is a major opportunity for long-term investors.  We want the progress to be quantified to attract investors and to become less aspirational.  We all share the same aspirations and support the Minister of State in this regard but let us make it so that we will do it and have something positive to report at the Paris conference at the end of November and early December and show that Ireland has moved on from general philosophising about the way the environment is deteriorating and to quantify it, set out the targets and galvanise the public agencies into doing something about it.  The need in Senator Cullinane&rsquo;s amendments is overwhelming.  We will have to do this some time.  Let us make today the starting point.  Even that, many people would say, is too late.</p></speech>

I am a little concerned that we might miss our targets even as far out as 2050.</p> <p>Just this week, the European Union published an audit of European countries' fuel needs and Ireland has one of the highest levels of imported fossil fuels at 89%.  In the context of this amendment and the Bill in general, what moves is the Government making to reduce that very high dependence?  For example, will wind energy, which is very controversial in this country, make much of an impact?  I welcome that today the Government has allocated &euro;3.5 million to a number of pioneers in the area of wave energy.  There are three Irish companies involved in this regard, including one in Galway.</p> <p>I was a member of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly sub-committee that prepared a paper on wave energy.  I believe at the time the Minister of State was a member of that committee and will be familiar with it.  I know it is a long way down the road.  When we were taking evidence, the expert witnesses told us we were at same the stage of wave energy development as the Wright brothers were when they were trying to get a plane off the ground for the first time.  So it is at that very pioneering level.  That was a bit of a shock to the system and somewhat disappointing because I thought that, with the way technology is moving so fast, we would have reached a much higher level of development.  However, that is how matters stand.  The Government is obviously committed to developing wave energy.  Owing to its location, Ireland seems to have the best possible environment for the development of wave energy - primarily off our Atlantic coast.  I think it is the best in the world.</p> <p>Amendment No. 2 refers to "an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land-use sector, including forestry, which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production."  It is often stressed that the herd numbers in the country and the high levels of CO2 those animals discharge, through a variety of sources, are adding to our high levels of carbon emissions.  While I am not an expert in agriculture, am I correct in stating that, with technology and through the mix of foodstuffs, we are having some success in reducing the amount of carbon emissions from our cattle herd?  The Minister of State may have a comment to make on that because it is certainly a contributory factor.</p> <p>Further to Senator Barrett's point about the need to achieve the targets proposed by the Government, I seem to recall that the targets we set ourselves for 2005 or 2010 under the Kyoto agreement, way back in the day, were reached primarily because of the rapid decline in our economic activity rather than any attempts by Government at the time to reduce it.  Now that economic activity is picking up again, is the Minister of State concerned that this may pose a challenge and the Government's ambitious targets might be compromised to a degree?  I appreciate she cannot wave a magic wand on the issue and we need to consider the long term.  In an international context, Ireland would not be the worst offender in this regard.  That is why we all welcome the proposals in the Bill.  I just wanted to raise those points in the context of the amendment and I look forward to the Minister of State's reply.</p></speech>

For example, the Europe 2020 strategy contains a European target for cutting emissions at a European level and so forth.  I do not believe we should enshrine targets in legislation, which is where we should put provisions that are legally binding.  While we can all aspire and targets can be very motivating, at the end of the day we have signed up to a number of international treaties that are binding on the country.  This legislation has been a long time coming and has been welcomed by every organisation in the field.  It is good legislation and it should not be undermined by defining in legislation things that I do not believe can be enshrined in legislation and which are purely targets.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 seek to include a definition of "low-carbon" which has effectively been borrowed from the Government's national policy position on climate action and low-carbon development, as published in April 2014.  It goes without saying that I stand over the vision of low-carbon transition outlined in the national policy position document.  Further to an amendment introduced on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il, section 32B contains an explicit reference to the need to have regard to the Government's policy on climate change.  However, I do not accept that the content of the national policy position should be replicated in statute.  This is because Ireland is already subject to legally binding greenhouse gas mitigation targets up to 2020.  Negotiations at EU level are ongoing to agree mitigation targets for all member states up to 2030.  This process of target setting is likely to continue up to 2050.  Accordingly, putting in place our own statutory mitigation target for 2050 now would be likely to cut across and interfere with the EU's target-setting process.  The result would either be that our target would be below that of the EU, rendering it redundant, or that it would be above the EU target, indicating that it is not a least-cost option thereby putting Ireland at a competitive disadvantage with our EU neighbours.</p>  <p>Amendment No. 3 calls for the insertion of a mitigation target for 2050 in order to secure an aggregate reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of at least 80% by 2050.  As already stated, I am opposed to setting a quantitative target for 2050 separate from that to be set for us as part of an EU target-setting process.  Moreover, I believe that a single economy-wide target for the State is quite inappropriate, giving our unique emissions profile.  This profile is characterised by a large agricultural sector where mitigation potential is low.</p>  <p>Amendment No. 39 calls for the inclusion of a target of close to 100% decarbonisation of transport, construction and energy sectors, and carbon neutrality in agriculture by 2050.  This is a grossly unreasonable expectation in respect of any country.  If it were taken seriously, it would decimate the economy and society.  Although substantive decarbonisation of approximately 80% may be achievable outside the agricultural sector by 2050, the marginal abatement cost of achieving close to 100% decarbonisation by 2050 would be truly enormous, even assuming it would be technically feasible in light of the state of low-carbon technologies currently available.</p>  <p>Accordingly I cannot support these amendments and call for their withdrawal.</p></speech>

In response to the Minister of State' scripted response, I would say that targets are set in many areas.  We had to set targets for how much waste could be sent to landfill.  That obviously led to much more use of recycling and reusing of waste.  Unfortunately, many of those targets were set by Europe and not by the State.  We were dragged, kicking and screaming, to take action in respect of some of those issues.  However, targets were set and met.  A number of local authorities in the State were brought to court for not reaching those targets and being in breach of European legislation.</p>  <p>It is not fair to say that legislation is not a place for setting targets.  It certainly seems to be the norm in Europe.  On issues such as energy and climate change, one of the strengths of the European Union is that it tries to set targets to ensure that countries live up to their obligations.</p> <p>If we do not do so then what do we aspire to and what do we mean by a low carbon economy?  At least my party has tried to define it.  Fianna F&aacute;il has tabled a similar amendment, which I should have acknowledged in my earlier contribution and which Senator Barrett supported.</p> <p>The Government has not defined what such an economy means.  As a result it will not matter what happens in five years' time because it will claim to have achieved its targets.  To claim that reaching at least an 80% reduction by 2050 will destroy the economy is scaremongering of the highest order.  I am not sure who wrote the speech but it probably was civil servants.  I disagree with the claim and think its nonsense.</p></speech>

She has not addressed why clear targets have not been set but spoke about the national policy, which falls short by far.  Ireland has a big problem with climate change but it is not on its own.  I accept that Ireland is not as bad as a lot of other European countries and does a lot better than many other countries but globally we are failing.  We have not arrested the problem, so the current situation is deteriorating.  It will deteriorate even further unless we get our act together.  Many very powerful senior politicians in other areas seem to take climate change more seriously than this State does.  It is for those reasons that I shall press the amendments to a vote.</p></speech>

I draw his attention to the fact that the first national mitigation plan, under this Act, will set out the greenhouse gas mitigation policy measures to be implemented over the following five years and, therefore, it would be premature to itemise them at this stage.</p>  <p>In terms of what mix of mitigation policy measures will be brought into force in the immediate future, sectoral mitigation inputs from both energy and agriculture will be included in developing the national mitigation plan.  They will address issues relating to energy mix and progress with efficiencies in the agricultural sectors.  As I have said, it is up to the Senator whether he accepts my reply but I can confirm that I do not accept these amendments.</p></speech>

In a dispute I could &quot;have regard to&quot; what person X says and then ignore it and decide in favour of person Y.  Are the words &quot;have regard to&quot; strong enough in the promotion of the goal we all share?  The amendment seeks to ensure consistency with the items listed in the Bill, including paragraph (a), the ultimate objective specified in Article 2 of the United Nations Framework on Climate Change done at New York on 9 May 1992 and any mitigation commitment entered into by the European Union in response or otherwise in relation to that objective; paragraph (b) the policy of the Government on climate change; paragraph (c) climate justice; paragraph (d) any existing obligation of the State under the law of the European Union or any international agreement referred to in section 2, and paragraph (e) the most recent national greenhouse gas emissions inventory and projection of future greenhouse gas emissions, prepared by the agency.  It seems that one would have to comply with the obligations in paragraph (d) which refers to the law of the European Union.  </p><p>I do not have legal training, but are the words &quot;have regard to&quot; strong enough?  A person could have regard to something but not doing anything about it.  It would be a pity if that were to happen.  The view of public administration in this country in the context of the banking inquiry was worrying.  It appears that there were a lot of people sitting around doing nothing because the crisis was obvious for some years.  There appeared to be lethargy in public agencies in seeking to correct the malpractices of the banks.  It is for that reason that I am concerned about the use of the phrase &quot;have regard to&quot;.  If the Minister of State has advice to the effect that it is as strong as &quot;be consistent with&quot;, even having it said in the House would be reassuring for people who are concerned.</p></speech>

I appreciate the sentiments behind the Senator's amendment, but as the list of items to be considered in section 3(2) may sometimes compete with one another, it may not always be possible to be fully consistent with them simultaneously when approving either national plan.  Accordingly, the phrase "have regard to" is the most appropriate to use in that it requires a balancing of considerations rather than strict compliance with each.  I am, therefore, unable to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

Many people would say we should have strict compliance and prioritise the climate change goals over some other considerations.  I will withdraw the amendment, but it is important that we comply with the targets set, lest we are faced with the same crisis in the environment sector as occurred in the banking sector, the hearings on which I attended for many days and months.  The phrase "constructive ambiguity" was also used at the banking inquiry.  I do not like the use of this phrase in the context of the environment either; I would prefer to use the word "quantification".

There are many issues we could discuss.  The objective of the amendment is to ensure climate change justice would feature in the Bill such that it would have legislative backup.  As I laboured this point on Second Stage, I do not propose to do so again now, but I would welcome the Minister of State's support for the amendment.</p></speech>

This is not exactly something we must invent ourselves.  Climate change has been around as an area of research and public policy for a long time and it is time the officials in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government speeded up and stopped delaying the process by 18 months.  This should be ready to go now.  The Paris conference will take place in about five or six weeks' time and asking for a further delay of 18 months is unreasonable.  Again, the kind of torpor that was manifest in the Department of Finance with regard to banking appears to apply here with regard to environmental matters.  This is not good enough.</p></speech>

Again, I appreciate there are voices both inside and outside this House which are concerned about the timeframe for the production of the first national mitigation plan, having regard to our pressing mitigation targets up to the year 2020.  The original timeframe in the Bill was set at 24 months after enactment.  However, having regard to concerns in this respect, the Minister, Deputy Kelly, introduced an amendment on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il to reduce the timeframe to 18 months.  I realise a timeframe of 18 months may not be short enough for some.  Nonetheless, I consider it is the bare minimum necessary to allow robust mitigation policy measures to be developed and then made subject to strategic environmental assessment and appropriate assessment pursuant to European Union directives, as well as to statutory public consultation procedures.  As all Members sometimes are pilloried for not consulting sufficiently, the 18-month timeframe is the minimum.  Accordingly, I cannot accept this amendment and again, I call for its withdrawal.</p></speech>

Consequently, there are papers over in the Custom House that presumably have been gathering dust for the past five years.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report in 2014 left one in no doubt as to the precise nature of the challenge.  It concluded the evidence of climate change is unequivocal and showed how man-made emissions of greenhouse gases are driving climate change.  Consequently, I will press the amendment, albeit not to a division.  However, I will try to get across the message from the Parliament to the permanent Government it should get a move on and stop delaying tactics in matters of climate change.</p></speech>

This proposed amendment seeks to replace the phrase "have regard to" with the word "comply" in section 4(7), which deals with matters that must be considered by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Government when performing their functions under section 4.  There necessarily are competing considerations when developing and approving a national mitigation plan, all of which cannot be complied with fully at the same time.

In the first instance, I fully accept that both the management of soil carbon and the protection and re-wetting of wetlands are proven means of maintaining and developing carbon sinks, which are an important option in reducing our overall carbon footprint as a State.  As such, these activities fall under the heading of mitigation policy measures.  The Bill does not make reference to any particular mitigation policy measure for good reason in that the nature and extent of such measures will change over time and up to the year 2050, as successive mitigation measures take effect.  For this reason, I do not consider it appropriate to single out these particular mitigation policy measures for inclusion in this Bill.  Rather, they more properly belong to the content of the iterative national mitigation plans where specific soil carbon and wetland management measures can be specified.  For this reason, I cannot accept this amendment.</p></speech>

The Seanad has a proud record in this session in terms of the acceptance of amendments and only this morning, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs accepted amendments tabled by Senator van Turnhout and received a round of applause.  This could happen in this area in the future and that is the aspiration.  In any event, the Seanad has a strong record going back to the 1920s in being interested in environmental matters and it should be involved in this provision.  I do not know whether this was an oversight or whether somebody thought the referendum to abolish this House had been passed but the Seanad is here and is playing a notable role in respect of environmental matters.  This should be recognised in this Bill.</p></speech>

I have made reference a number of times to the all-party consensus which appeared to be evident at the environment committee, which is good and positive.  On the subject of political reform in the future, I have no doubt but that it will again be a topic of conversation for a while, for whatever Government comes into office after the next election, until we all settle into the old ways of doing business.</p> <p>However, it strikes me that a good way of drafting legislation would be to draw from the reports of committees where there is all-party consensus.  If we had done that on this issue, this legislation would be different.  I agree with Senator Barrett that both the Seanad and the D&aacute;il should sign off on these plans.  They should not be simply presented to, or laid before, us.  As they are so profound, it is important that we have a proper debate and discuss them.  The Oireachtas, the people elected by the people, should be signing off on them.  It seemed on Committee Stage that this had all-party consensus but that seems to have dropped away in the meantime, which is a source of regret.  I, therefore, support the amendment.</p></speech>

I do not see what harm there would be in laying the plans before the Houses of the Oireachtas, if for no other reason than to keep the issue on the agenda.  Senator Barrett is quite right when he speaks of the proud history of this House on environmental issues.  In particular, we think of the former Senator, the  late &Eacute;amon de Buitl&eacute;ar, for example.  Other Senators appointed by previous taoisigh definitely brought an environmental aspect to the House.  Current colleagues to do so include Senator Mac Conghail and Senator van Turnhout, who tabled amendments on another Bill which were accepted this morning.  There is a logic to the amendment and I am interested to know why the Minister of State will not agree to this proposal.  Too much is laid in the Library of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It should come to this House, if only for noting, and perhaps even without debate.  There would be a value in it.</p>  <p>We now have pre-legislative scrutiny in Oireachtas committees.  This morning the pre-legislative process for the criminal justice (sexual offences) Bill took place at the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality where eight or nine different bodies gave their views.  I have no doubt the committee will be influenced by some of the material identified during the course of that process.  In other jurisdictions, such as Germany, this happens all the time.  It moves from an Executive-led politics to, at least, a coexistence between the Executive and Parliament.  We see the role of the Commission in terms of the European Parliament and the ever-increasing number of checks and balances in the past couple of treaties.  There is consensus across the political divide on this issue.</p>  <p>I am filling in today for Senator C&aacute;it Keane, our spokesperson on the environment, who is not in a position to attend.  I know that this is an issue that has been brought to her attention by people interested in the area.  I am interested in hearing why we do not want this to occur and what are the objections.</p></speech>

I strongly take issue with this proposal as the Government, rightly, should be the sole, approving authority and be held accountable for its approved national mitigation plan.  Requiring approval by the Oireachtas as a whole undercuts the role of the Government to the detriment of accountability.  It also exposes the adoption of the critically important integrative national mitigation plans to the vagaries of those who may wish to play politics.  Surely no one would consider this a desirable outcome.  I, therefore, will not be accepting this amendment.</p></speech>

She believes that only the Government should make decisions and not the Oireachtas.  This includes the Minister of State's party colleagues on the backbenches.  She is saying the Cabinet should make decisions and the Oireachtas does not have any role, that we are not clever enough and that we should not have the ability to hold the Government to account.  That is what the Oireachtas is here to do.</p>  <p>The Minister of State's comments are seriously outrageous and I take grave exception to them.  I do not know where they have come from, but it is an absolutely outrageous response to what is a reasonable amendment.  It shows the disrespect some Ministers have for the Oireachtas and elected representatives and demonstrates that sense of hierarchy that the Government and the Cabinet should make all the decisions and everything should be signed off on by them.  So much for the democratic revolution the Taoiseach spoke about if that is the response of the Minister of State.  I cannot not let it go.  It is one of the most bizarre and outrageous responses to an amendment I have heard from any Minister in this House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-10-21a.206" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="13:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015102100025#KK00500"><p>I echo the observations of Senator Cullinane.  We have a parliamentary democracy and citizens have serious concerns about what is happening to our environment but we have a serious non-response from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government which does not want to be called to account.  I am so proud to be a member of this Oireachtas.  We will leave office shortly and have an election and while we stanched the flow of money out of the banking system, for which huge credit is due to the Government, we have not reformed the permanent government.  It will make the same mistakes again in banking and finance and the answer we have just received illustrates how arrogant it has become towards the elected representatives of this Parliament.  It will be a task for the next Government to sort it out.  This is a blatant disregard for Senators elected to this House to represent our constituents.  We are concerned about something which we know has been sitting in the Department since 2010 but the Department is looking to delay it further.  The Department does not want to be responsible to the Oireachtas, which is a shameful approach for any public servant to take towards democracy in this country.</p></speech>

The comment the Minister of State read out is outrageous and I do not believe the Minister of State believes it herself.  It is something that has been handed to her.  I hope she, as a democratically elected member of the Oireachtas, does not believe it.  This House is an important part of the Oireachtas.  To say the Government would be afraid this House would play politics with the issue is totally unacceptable.  I cannot believe the Minister of State read out that reply in this House.  Senator Barrett's amendment that the plans would be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and not just the D&aacute;il is reasonable.</p>  <p>We are all given to understand that the Cabinet has been reduced to a sub-committee comprising the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is quite obvious from the Minister of State's response to this amendment that the Government wants to reduce this House and the D&aacute;il to nothing but talking shops.  As a democratically elected member of this part of our Oireachtas, I will not accept that.  I urge the Minister of State to rethink what she said in this very proud part of our Oireachtas and to evaluate its consequences.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, Ministers are regularly handed scripts.  If Ministers had the time to analyse the content of those scripts, which they do not, the language would probably be quite different.</p> <p>It is a political issue but it certainly is not a political football.  This House can be proud that when it comes to important issues we deal with them and have robust debates on them but we certainly do not turn political issues into political footballs.</p></speech>

The 24 months timeframe refers to the time that can be taken from the passing of the Act for the submission to Government of a plan to be known as the national climate change adaptation framework.  The question that arises in this respect, as arose in respect of section 4 where the delay involved was 18 months, is why would we not do this now. There is such consensus, concern and an urgency about the environment that further delays do not seem to make any sense.  We have known about this problem.  There are papers prepared in the Department and there is plenty of research.  We have the Nicholas Stern's report and his latest book is entitled &quot;Why Are We Waiting?&quot;  He is a noted environmentalist of the highest standing and international repute.  The purpose of my amendment is that we should do this and not delay doing so for another 24 months.</p></speech>

We can have all the documents and legislation in the world but we cannot achieve much if we are not serious about tackling climate change and enacting climate change legislation.  That is the problem I have with this Bill.  I like the spirit of the Bill but if proper targets are not written into the legislation, there is no incentive to fulfil the obligations contained in it.  The biggest challenge facing the human race is climate change.  Every country has to play its part.  Sitting on our hands and leaving this adaptation framework gather dust for longer than it should is not good enough.  It is a reasonable request that the timeframe of 24 months be reduced to six months, and I fully support it.</p></speech>

As with the national mitigation plan, I understand the motivation behind this proposed amendment.  However, the national adaptation framework will be a very complex document, which will prescribe the sectors for which sectoral adaptation plans must be developed.  Therefore, considerable preparatory work will be required.</p>  <p>The draft framework will be subject to statutory public consultation procedures and, as a consequence, I believe that 24 months is the correct timeframe to be allowed for the development of the framework.  I also note that 24 months is the maximum period.  If it were possible to do it sooner, it would be done.  Accordingly, I cannot accept this amendment and call for its withdrawal.</p></speech>

The atmosphere and the ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow [...] have diminished, and [the] sea level has risen.</blockquote><p>It should not come as any surprise to the Department that we want action on this.

I indicated that I wanted to do so before Senator Barrett indicated.  I, too, expressed concern about this issue on Second Stage.  I listened to the Minister of State's response.  This matter has been examined by the Department and we have got a response from it in the form of the reply the Minister of State has given to us.  I would be hopeful that the timeframe involved for this will not be 24 months.</p>  <p>When I raised this issue on Second Stage, the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, was taking the Bill and he stressed that was the outside timeframe for this.  I completely accept what both Senators on the other side of the House have said, that we cannot continue to sit on our hands and allow these matters to go on in the way they are going on.  There must be an urgency about this.</p>  <p>If we got some further indication from the Minister of State that 24 months is the outside timeframe for this and that we would endeavour to expedite what is provided for in this section as quickly as possible, it would provide some comfort that 24 months may not be required for this.  That would certainly make me happy, although I will not speak for people on the other side of the House.  While I note the amendment is being pressed but not being pushed to a vote, the Minister of State might respond further on this point as it is an important one.</p></speech>
