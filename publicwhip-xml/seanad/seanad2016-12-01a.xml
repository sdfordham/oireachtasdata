I congratulate the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, on the Gaeltacht education policy and the great effort he made to speak Irish on that occasion.  It was very much appreciated and I thank him for it.</p> <p>I am raising an immediate and a serious issue affecting a school in County Galway.  I joined hundreds of children, parents and staff at Claddagh national school who were protesting against the cancellation of the bus service to the school last Friday.  Further protests against cancelled city bus services could be on the cards if the Westside to Claddagh school service is not restored.  Services from Westside to Claddagh, Scoil Einde to Seacreast and Claddagh to Westside via Salthill were all cancelled a number of weeks ago.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2363"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2363&amp;amp;pid=TrevorOClochartaigh&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Claddagh national school principal, Mr. Michael Gallagher, has said that the aim of the march was to highlight the hardship of families and parents as a result of Bus &Eacute;ireann's decision to cut the bus route that has existed for almost 30 years.  Support for the restoration of the service is unanimous, both within the community and across the political spectrum.  I joined with colleagues from across both Houses, including those in government who support this campaign, at the protest the other day.  Locally elected representatives came out <i>en masse</i>to support the cause and it seems that everyone is in favour of restoring the bus route except Bus &Eacute;ireann.  The people are calling on us, as politicians, to intervene and to see what can be done to try to reverse this thoughtless and cruel decision.  The school bus has been serving the school for almost 30 years and was cancelled without consultation or proper notification, just as winter began.  Families with very young children are now walking several miles to school at the darkest, coldest and most dangerous time of the year.  They feel it is deeply unfair.  Members have been seeking a meeting with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, on this issue and a petition has been signed by more than 1,000 people.<br/><br/>I had a question put to the Minister but he said it was outside his area of responsibility, which I found quite strange.<br/><br/>I raise the issue today because this is going to have an impact on the children in the school.  It is certainly having a very disruptive effect on the management and running of the school.  I had a question put to the Minister to see if he or the Department of Education and Skills was consulted about the cut to this bus service, which is having an impact.  As the Minister is aware, Galway schools are very full.  There is little capacity and a lack of choice for parents who may want to try to move their children to a different school.  That is not what is envisaged in this scenario.  They would prefer the bus service to be there, but they would not have choice even if they wanted one.  We have children and parents coming from an area where, in the main, they would not have their own transport.  There is transport chaos in Galway anyway, so the more people we can have on the school buses the better to try to avoid that.  <br/><br/>This is having an impact on the children who have to walk to school in the morning and walk home in the evening time.  It also has an impact on parents, some of whom are working also.  Was the Minister consulted and does he have concerns in this regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-12-01a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016120100002#B00200"><p>N&iacute;l an freagra as Gaeilge inniu, but I thank the Senator for his kind words. This issue really does not fall into our area.  This service was not developed as a school transport service so there has been no communication with my Department about it.  As Senators know, we transport some 113,000 children, including some 10,000 children with special educational needs, and the service has more than 4,000 vehicles.  Children are eligible for transport where they reside not less than 3.2 km from the school they are attending.  The school must be the school nearest to their home, as determined by the Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  A minimum number of ten eligible children residing in a district or locality as determined by Bus &Eacute;ireann are required before consideration may be given to the establishment of school transport services, provided this can be done within reasonable cost limits.  Bus &Eacute;ireann operates the school transport scheme and has confirmed there are currently no school transport services operating to the school in question and no transport service has been withdrawn in recent years.  I understand that the service to which the Senator refers is a scheduled service and is outside the remit of this Department.  The information I have received is as the Senator has outlined that from the end of October, these Monday to Friday, term time only services were withdrawn.  I understand that the company took the decision on a commercial basis.  It would not be a decision in which my own Department would have had any involvement, be it the nature of the decision or how the decision was reached.  All I can say with regard to the primary school transport system is that we apply it equitably across the State and treat every school on the same basis.  This issue concerns a particular scheduled service for which we have no responsibility unfortunately.</p></speech>

I implore the Minister to intervene with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, on this issue.  Perhaps the Minister, Deputy Bruton, could contact Bus &Eacute;ireann with regard to the service which has been changed or withdrawn to ask it if it could review the situation in light of the impact it is having on the students, parents and staff in the school in Claddagh.</p></speech>

Bus &Eacute;ireann only run the services we have agreed with it, based on national criteria.  This is one that would not fall into my area.  I understand that Bus &Eacute;ireann has done a lot of restructuring of its services in Galway and has succeeded in building up the patronage by 50% through restructuring and better routes and services and so on.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is an independent body.  It has public subvention but it must deploy the subvention as best it can within Galway.  Unfortunately it is for the Senator to speak to Bus &Eacute;ireann locally to see what the context is for its decision and if there are alternative services on offer that would service these schools.  I must stick to the national scheme which we apply equitably to every school that applies to the Department for a service on the basis of the criteria I have outlined.  I have nothing in my tool box that would resolve this one I am afraid.</p></speech>

We had asked for the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, to come to the House, but I thank the Minister for State, Deputy English, for coming in.  We had asked that the Minister would outline what he is doing, or what he is going to do, to improve the terms and conditions for our local authority members.  The number of local authority areas has gone from 114 to 31.  There are now 678 fewer local authority members, with the loss of town councillors and the reduction in some counties of county councillors.  We now only have 949 local authority members, which is one of the worst voter to local authority member ratios anywhere in Europe.</p> <p>I wish to share time with my colleagues who have come in to support this matter.</p></speech>

As Senator Daly has outlined, this issue has been floating around for a while, and some would say for too long.  I appeal to the Minister of State, and the Minister to grasp the nettle.  We have all recognised that the workload and travel has increased significantly for councillors.  Effectively it has become a full-time job.  Unless we look after these hard-working councillors, who we are very fortunate to have, we will find it very difficult to get anybody to enter local government.  It is time the issue was dealt with.  It is the least they deserve.  I acknowledge the support from councillors and from Senators in this House on this matter.  I also acknowledge the work done by the Association of Irish Local Government and the Local Authority Members Association in trying to push this forward.  I ask the Minster of State that this issue be addressed once and for all.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-12-01a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1411" speakername="Aidan Davitt" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016120100002#B00900"><p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  This insult to councillors, which is the only way I can describe it, has gone on long enough.  There is never a wrong time to do the right thing.  I feel strongly about this.  I call on the Minister of State to see that the Government stops playing with councillors.  We are getting drip feeds in the newspapers every couple of months about expenses and we hear the words, "If I was in power" and "What I would do if I was in charge" said but the time for those games is gone.  Half of the councillors rely on this as their sole wage.  It is below the minimum wage.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Aidan Davitt:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2475"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2475&amp;amp;pid=AidanDavitt&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I implore the Minister of State to draw a line in the sand on this and improve their pay and conditions.  I am delighted to be able to support my fellow Senators.  We have been working hard on this with the AILG and LAMA, no more than the Leas-Chathaoirleach, and we would really appreciate the Minister of State grabbing this nettle.  We want to see some dividends.</p></speech>

It certainly reflects the views of the councillors the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and I have met at various meetings in recent months with regard to Rebuilding Ireland and on other occasions.  Very strong views were expressed.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, had hoped to be here and apologises he could not make it.  He is chairing at a meeting on Ireland 2040 and could not leave it in time to get here.  He wants to be part of this discussion and recognises the importance of dealing with the matter and has made commitments to do so.  It is something which he holds very close to his heart.</p> <p>Effective local government structures are an essential part of our democracy.  In turn, effective local government cannot be achieved without the hard work and commitment of elected members who give of their own time in service to their community.  As has been said this morning, for many it has become a full-time job because it is so busy.  Many people dedicated their lives to it.  A range of financial supports is already in place to assist councillors in their vital work.  These include a representational payment, fixed annual expenses allowances, travel and subsistence allowances, a mobile phone allowance, a retirement gratuity and conference and training provisions.</p> <p>The reforms introduced by the previous Government in 2014 addressed widely acknowledged weaknesses in the previous system, including the problems of divided administration between town and county authorities for key functions.  Under the new municipal district system there is full integration of local authority resources across each county and elimination of duplication both in administrative and electoral terms.</p> <p>As part of an operational review of the local government reforms, the Department conducted a survey last year of elected members, with the support of the Association of Irish Local Government.  More than 500 elected members participated in the survey.  The results indicate the revised structures are generally operating well but will need more time to bed down fully.  Particular concerns were expressed, however, about increased work demands and the increased size of electoral areas.  Apart from the submissions, we have also heard this in conversations with Senators and councillors throughout the country and it is a given at this stage.  In this regard, A Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment to review the supports provided to councillors, in consultation with representative bodies, to enable councillors to continue their important and valued work.</p> <p>Shortly after assuming office, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, met representatives of the Association of Irish Local Government and the Local Authority Members Association.  The Minister has since attended the autumn seminars of both associations and is aware there is a strong view among the membership that positive consideration be given to their proposals for improvement in the range of supports available.  The Minister intends to give further consideration to the issue, in consultation with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and to reach a conclusion as soon as possible in the context of wider public service pay policy and taking all relevant factors into account.</p> <p>I wish to take the opportunity to refer to proposed amendments in the area of social welfare benefits.  Section 10 of the Social Welfare Bill, which is before Seanad &Eacute;ireann, provides that elected members will, in future, be brought into social insurance cover as self-employed people, in so far as entitlement to the wider range of benefits is concerned.  This is an improvement on the current situation whereby elected members pay 4% PRSI but no benefits accrue from these contributions.  I again thank the Senators for raising the matter.  The Minister intends to, and will, give careful consideration to the issues raised by the representative associations and individual councillors and reach a conclusion in this regard in the very near future.</p></speech>

What we did not get is what the Minister, Deputy Coveney, will do, other than that he will look at the matter.  We had a similar response yesterday on votes for the Irish overseas.  The Minister is looking at a lot of things but he does not seem to be getting around to making a decision on anything.  AILG and LAMA have made these proposals.  The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, has acted under the Social Welfare Bill, as is his prerogative and right, but the Minister, Deputy Coveney, has failed to act and apparently has not spoken to and has not sought anything from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, which is the process in the Government.</p> <p>What we are hearing again is the Minister might do something soon, but he has not actually come to any conclusion and has not even spoken to the Minister of Public Expenditure and Reform to ask for anything on behalf of local authority members.  We will lose local authority members throughout the country as they will not seek re-election because the workload has increased.  In some cases, their areas are now as big as what used to be three seat D&aacute;il constituencies.  Their responsibilities have also increased because there are no longer town councillors to share the workload in some areas.</p> <p>What we clearly see here is the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, has done something, which is welcome, on the PRSI issue, but we will be back here next year asking the Minister, Deputy Coveney, whether he has met the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the councillors' groups, AILG and LAMA, and whether he has decided to do anything other than continue to look at the issue.  I heard he might do something in June 2017.  This simply is not good enough.  It is not acceptable.</p></speech>

There is a major problem in Cork at present as the medical consultants and nursing staff on the front line have a difficulty providing gynaecological services.  I understand there is quite a long waiting list of more than 4,000 people for either appointments or surgery.  When all the maternity services in Cork were transferred, and three hospitals providing maternity services, the Bon Secours Hospital, the Eirnville Hospital and St. Finbarr's Hospital, were closed and amalgamated to CUH, two operating theatres were to be provided which would work at least five days a week.  What has occurred is only one has opened and this works three and a half days a week.  As a result, for a day and a half there is no access to the theatre.  What is required for the theatre to be open for the extra day and a half is three more nurses.  This would help to alleviate the list.  What would also help to alleviate it is if the second theatre was opened.  At present, some of the beds are being used with a turnover of three patients per day per bed for day cases.  It is working fully to try to accommodate everyone.  There is also a proposal for a day care unit with six beds, and the costings have been done on this.  It would help to alleviate the problem.</p> <p>When cancer services from the South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital were transferred to CUH it was agreed a gynaecological unit would open there and a building was identified which would have had four beds for day care procedures.  This has not been done.  We now have a huge number of items not provided for although a commitment was given, and as a result the biggest maternity gynaecological unit outside of Dublin is running at half capacity.  I ask that something be done about this.</p></speech>

Women in Cork city are waiting longer for gynaecology services than women in any other part of Ireland.  It is utterly unacceptable.</p><p>There are 4,193 women waiting for an outpatient appointment in Cork, the longest waiting list of all gynaecology units and twice the next longest waiting list.  There are 557 women waiting for gynaecology surgeries, again the longest such waiting list.  As Senator Colm Burke outlined, the gynaecology theatres are functioning at 40% of their capacity.  Although we have two fully commissioned, state-of-the-art gynaecology theatres, they are not operating to full capacity.  As Senator Colm Burke said, a small investment could have them fully operational.  No new consultant gynaecologist posts have been created in Cork in the past decade, despite the fact that 26 posts were filled nationwide.  The waiting lists are having devastating consequences for women.  Women are in pain, bleeding and turning up at accident and emergency units in crisis.  As a woman, the Minister of State knows a delayed diagnosis means cancer that could be treated might be growing.  It is a life and death matter for women in Cork.</p><p>The solutions are clear.  The Government must increase the gynaecology theatre to a five-day service, open the second theatre, develop the proposed gynaecology unit with Cork University Maternity Hospital, CUMH, bring forward the one-stop shop which was in the 2014 service plan and increase the number of gynaecologists.  At the end of September, I raised the matter at the health committee, and the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, asked me to write to him, which I did.  He still has not had the courtesy to respond to me.  It is very similar to what is happening locally.  People have raised these matters and Senator Colm Burke is correct that relationships are very poor locally.  We need the Minister to intervene to get the situation rectified for the women of Cork.</p><p>These unacceptable waiting lists will not go away on their own.  If ignored, they will get worse, creating hardship and ill-health and putting the lives of women in Cork and surrounding areas at risk.  Consultants in the hospital have been forced to say they cannot take responsibility for the adverse health outcomes arising from a well-documented chronic lack of investment which has resulted in the longest waiting lists in the country.  Therefore, I ask the Minister of State to take back a message to the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, namely, will he take responsibility, take action and resolve the issue?</p></speech>

I have been asked to take the Commencement matter on his behalf.  However, I am a woman and given that I have five children and have been obliged many times to go to accident and emergency units for gynaecology, I understand.  I know how important it is to have a service up and running.</p> <p>On behalf of the Minister, I thank Senators Colm Burke and Kelleher for raising the issue.  I fully recognise the need to ensure patients have timely access to health services.  The Department works closely with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, to implement measures to reduce waiting times.  At the Minister's request, the HSE developed an action plan to reduce, by year end, the number of patients waiting 18 months or more for an inpatient or day case procedure.</p> <p>It is important that the number of patients who are waiting to be seen or treated is considered in the context of the total numbers of patients actually seen and treated.  Every year, there are more than 3.2 million outpatient attendances at our hospitals, 94,000 patients have an elective inpatient procedure and 1 million patients have a planned day case procedure.  The budget for 2017 provides evidence of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to a sustained focus on improving waiting times, particularly for those waiting longest.  The Government has allocated &euro;20 million to the NTPF for the treatment of our longest-waiting patients.  This will be increased to &euro;55 million in 2018.</p> <p>I am aware there is a difficulty with waiting times for gynaecology services in Cork University Hospital.  The south-south west hospital group has confirmed its commitment to obstetrics and gynaecology services as demonstrated by the establishment of a group clinical directorate for these services.  The HSE has also advised that Cork University Hospital is undertaking a number of initiatives to address both inpatient and outpatient waiting times for gynaecology services.  This includes additional evening outpatient review clinics, which are led by a member of the consultant gynaecology team.  The hospital has recently appointed a gynaecology sonographer, who will lead an ultrasound service in liaison with the consultant gynaecology team.  With the additional scheduled consultant-led evening sessions, the hospital management anticipates that the gynaecology ultrasound waiting list will be cleared by December 2016.  My Department has been assured that to address the current difficulties, the hospital will maximise the use of existing theatre and other gynaecology resources within the hospital, as well as those in other hospitals across the south-south west hospital group.</p> <p>In line with the national maternity strategy, a national women and infants health programme is being established within the HSE to lead the management, organisation and delivery of maternity, gynaecological and neonatal services.  The programme will drive implementation of the national maternity strategy and ensure the consistent delivery of high-quality care.  Noting that the international trend in gynaecology service provision is moving towards more day-case services and the provision of community one-stop shop type facilities, it is intended that the programme will drive much-needed reform of gynaecology services.  This will include the potential to adopt a multidisciplinary approach and move some service delivery to community settings.  Work to establish the programme is ongoing.</p></speech>

It is like what I get at the health committee.  At the last meeting of the health committee, I raised four questions to which I got answers to only two.  There seems to be a problem with the HSE in the south giving the truth.  The truth is not contained in this answer.  The answer to the problem is to open the operating theatre five days a week, not three and half days a week, and to move towards providing additional day-case beds for patients so the hospital can turn over far bigger numbers.  The response is extremely disappointing.  It does not deal with the issue.  What the Minister of State set out will not do one thing for the waiting list.</p> <p>If something is not done immediately, within six months the waiting list will increase from 4,000 to 5,000 or 6,000.  The list increases every day.  There seems to be a stand off between people in different sections of the hospital, between people at the front line and those in management.  The people in management do not appear to be taking the matter seriously.  The Minister of State's response is inadequate and a clear message should be sent to the manager in Cork University Hospital that it is unacceptable.  I will raise this again and again, next week and the week after, as long as we are sitting up to Christmas.  It is not going to go away.</p></speech>

This matter is not being taken seriously.  I wrote in September and have not had the courtesy of a response.  The local consultants have been tearing their hair out trying to get a response.  Yet, women are waiting, getting more ill and are bleeding and suffering.  The fact that the Minister for Health is not here shows that it is not a priority for him or for the Government.  Senator Colm Burke is right.  It is not going to go away.  There will be a "Prime Time Investigates" programme on the issue.  Will we wait for that before we take action?  We have the facts.  While I thank the Minister of State for coming, there is nothing in her response that gives me any comfort to expect that any action will be taken or that the issue has registered as any kind of priority for the Minister for Health or the Government.</p></speech>

My response did not specifically identify some of the issues they raised.  However, things are happening in Cork University Hospital.  Let us not be in any doubt that the Government is committed to providing a better service for women, particularly in gynaecology.  The money that is being set aside and allocated to the NTPF will alleviate long waiting lists.  Moreover, the new service will continue in some evenings in the hospital.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Catherine Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2186"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2186&amp;amp;pid=CatherineByrne&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->According to this statement form the Minister's office, the gynaecology ultrasound department hopes to clear its waiting list by December.  I have taken note of all the issues both Senators have raised and I will bring them back to the Minister.  As a woman, I believe that delayed diagnosis in any gynaecological area can be fatal.  I will stress that to the Minister.  I will also ask why the Senator has not received a reply to her letter.  Out of courtesy, that should be done straightaway.  I will raise the issue of the theatre only being used for 3.5 days a week.  Apart from that I cannot give any other message on what is happening in Cork until I go back to the Minister and relay the Senators' deep concerns.</p></speech>

I do a lot of work with nutritionists and dieticians.  Recently some people contacted me about low-protein foods, a very specific issue that affects a relatively small sector of the population.  Nonetheless it is very important to those individuals.  The lack of availability of low-protein foods is very serious for those with metabolic illnesses.</p> <p>Approximately one in every 45,000 babies born in Ireland is diagnosed with phenylketonuria, PKU, and approximately one in every 65,000 babies born in Ireland is born with homocystinuria HCU.  Both are very rare genetic disorders causing the body to be incapable of breaking down amino acids, which are present in protein foods.  This is a metabolic disorder and patients must manage their lifelong illnesses with a low-protein diet to prevent neurological damage.</p> <p>Obtaining low-protein food products is proving to be increasingly difficult in Ireland.  I recently received information from an individual two of whose children are suffering from HCU.  Prescribed low-protein foods are crucial to managing their diets.  This individual is becoming increasingly frustrated as not only are low-protein foods not readily available in local shops, but there is also a lack of high-quality low-protein food products in the Irish market in general or on the long-term illness card.</p> <p>Given that prescribed low-protein foods are required to prevent neurological damage and to supplement the diets of adults and children with PKU and HCU, why have no low-protein products been added to the long-term illness card list in more than six years?  I ask the Minister for Health to ensure a full and appropriate list of foods prescribed for PKU and HCU is added to the reimbursement list.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-12-01a.45" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1307" speakername="Catherine Byrne" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016120100002#E00800"><p>I am glad to be here this morning to take this Commencement Matter on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Harris.  I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  PKU and HCU are lifelong conditions, with serious dietary restrictions for people who have them.  Essential clinical nutritional products, specifically for PKU and HCU, as well as some low-protein foodstuffs, are reimbursed under the community drugs schemes.  I am aware that there has been little or no variation in this list for several years.</p> <p>The HSE primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, has just published revised guidelines for manufacturers and distributors on the reimbursement of clinical nutritional products.  These guidelines were last updated four years ago.  The expert group which revised the guidelines was drawn from hospital and community settings, and included procurement support.  Manufacturers and distributors were consulted on the draft guidelines, as was the Food Safety Authority.</p> <p>For a product to be reimbursed, the supplier must apply to the HSE for approval, and products must meet published criteria.  For pricing, the HSE is prepared to consider several factors.  However, there are a number of broadly similar products, and it intends to have a single price mechanism for such products, so that similar patient benefit receives similar reward.  When the HSE receives applications for clinical nutritional products under the new guidelines, it must consider the approval criteria set out in the 2013 Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act.</p> <p>Regarding reimbursement criteria, the Senator may be aware that, as PKU is on the long-term illness scheme, the HSE has, in the past, made exceptional arrangements for essentials such as bread and other like products.  It is prepared do so again, on an individual basis, taking into account the price constraints I have outlined.  For example, where a product is dietician-recommended and is less than an existing reimbursable item, it may continue to be approved on a patient-specific basis.</p> <p>I would like to see expansion of the range of items available for people with PKU and HCU.  Over a decade ago, the situation was similar for gluten-free foods, especially for dietary staples like bread.  Now, quality, choice and availability have vastly improved and people who need these items can get them in a wide range of outlets.</p> <p>However, the State does not commission for reimbursement - suppliers must make their products available.  New products have come to market elsewhere in recent years and suppliers have not sought reimbursement yet in Ireland.  Specialised products for PKU and HCU are unlikely to appear outside pharmacies, but in particular low-protein food staples should follow the path of gluten-free products.  These are not technical products or specific to PKU and HCU, and should be available to anyone who wants them.  I would like to see their range and availability increase, as happened for gluten-free foods, so that people on these extremely restrictive diets can have a much better choice and variety of food, as everyone else does.</p> <p>That is the reply from the Minister.  I have taken some notes and I will take more after the Senator responds.</p></speech>

I am not sure that his indicating he would like to see the range and availability of these items increase is sufficient for me.  Perhaps I might have a conversation with him at some point about this.  I am pleased he has acknowledged the need to address the issue but there does not seem to be any particular strategy.  I welcome that new guidelines have been published.  To make it a reality might take more effort.</p></speech>

The first is the fear felt by residents of Inis M&oacute;r in County Galway over the loss of a ferry link to the mainland.  Island Ferries, which runs the service from the south Connemara town of Rossaveal, has said it will cease sailings until 17 March 2017.  The row between Island Ferries and Galway County Council arises from a by-law passed by the council in 2011 stipulating that a harbour levy must applied in respect of passengers to and from Inis M&oacute;r.  Island Ferries, which is the sole operator, has said it has no choice but to withdraw its winter service due the difficulties in paying this levy, which it says is too high.  I ask the Government to ensure this matter is resolved so that residents of the island are not left without a service this winter.</p> <p>I call on the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to address the question of why he has not filled vacancies on certain State boards.  He admitted on radio that he has been provided with shortlists by his Department yet he is still unable to make these decisions.  There is particular concern about vacancies on the boards of the Road Safety Authority, Dublin Bus, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Bus &Eacute;ireann, daa, the Irish Aviation Authority and Shannon Group, to name a few.  These vacancies are stifling the work of many of these boards in making decisions and planning for our future.  It is particularly important that these State companies are on top of their game given the uncertainty caused by Brexit.  This country must be in a position where we are thinking ahead and operating in a competitive and organised manner as a State.  </p></speech>

We had a debate yesterday evening where it came to light that when people want to abstain without having to press a walk-though vote, no record is kept of the abstentions on such a vote.  This might be something that requires consideration through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  There was a motion here on voting rights in presidential elections yesterday.  An amendment was put forward by the Government, which had a right to do that.  It was our intention as members of the Sinn F&eacute;in group in the House to abstain on that vote and have it recorded but apparently there is no mechanism to have that recorded.  I ask the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to consider that because there is a recording mechanism for it other parliaments.</p> <p>Ba mhaith liom tac&uacute; go huile is go hioml&aacute;n leis an m&eacute;id a d&uacute;irt an Seanad&oacute;ir Ardagh ar maidin maidir le c&aacute;s mhuintir &Aacute;rann.  T&aacute; g&eacute;arch&eacute;im damanta anseo.  T&aacute; s&eacute; ardaithe agam roinnt mhaith uaireanta leis an gCeannaire.  The situation in Inis M&oacute;r this morning is diabolical.  Hundreds of people are protesting on the pier because they have no ferry service.  It is disgraceful that it has not been sorted out.  I have raised the matter again and again in these Houses.  I raised it when we had a meeting with the Minister of State with responsibility for Gaeltacht affairs and natural resources, Deputy Kyne, and the officials from Galway County Council.  I also raised it when we met with officials from the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  I know the matter has been raised with the Minister of State but it is time somebody got all of the players around the table and banged a few heads together.  There will have to be a compromise.  A Senator from the Government side used a very good metaphor in respect of this.  If a bridge had broken somewhere in County Galway and the CEO of the county council was asked to go out there and act, he would be out there first thing in the morning to get it fixed.  For the people of Inis M&oacute;r, this is the same as having a bridge.  It is a lifeline for the islands.  It affects people who need to go to hospital, teachers trying to get in and out to teach in schools, people who are working on the islands and the tourism industry.  It is unacceptable.  I call on the Minister of State or the Taoiseach to intervene and say, "Lads, get around the table.  Let's find the compromise."  There needs to be a compromise between Galway County Council, the ferry operator and the Department to find a resolution.  For more than a month, I have been calling for the Minister of State to tell us what his plan B is.  There appears to be no plan B.  He is depending on some kind of deal being cobbled together today such as the council passing a motion at its budgetary meeting today to edge forward a couple of weeks or days.  That is not acceptable either.  We need to know whether the Department of Defence has been contacted as to the use of a naval vessel to bring people in and out of the island.  Sinn F&eacute;in took it upon itself to ask the Minister of State with responsibility for defence.  I ask the Leader to use his good offices to ask him whether he will intervene and provide an essential transport service on a daily basis for the people of the Aran Islands so that they are not left stranded on Inis M&oacute;r.  </p></speech>

From time to time, we all get our P45s and P60s.  You would need to be Mystic Meg to look into the corner to see the little section that might be lightly glazed over with a piece of ink and marked class K or class S stamp or whatever class of stamp you pay.  However, that piece of paper does not tell someone what their stamp entitles them to.  Down through the years, there has been so much confusion with the self-employed.  When we had the debate on the Social Welfare Bill yesterday, Senator Norris asked about pensions for the self-employed and whether the class S stamp covers that, which it does.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ray Butler:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2303"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2303&amp;amp;pid=RayButler&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is the only thing it did at the time.  There are so many people who really do not know what their stamp entitles them to.  When they lose their job, have a disability or get into difficulty, they fill in forms in their social welfare office but could be waiting 12 to 26 weeks only to hear then that their stamp does not cover what they are looking for.  We need a new system.  Every document sent out by the Department of Social Protection should have written on it the stamp one is paying and what it entitles one to.  This would be very simple and prevent a lot of confusion.</p><p>When I became a Member in 2011, I had paid a class S stamp as a self-employed person for 24 years.  I did not know I was entering a new system in here.  After 12 months, an accountant who was also a Deputy asked me whether I kept paying my class S stamp.  I said I did not in the belief that it was being automatically taken from my wages.  It was not; it was stopped.  I had only six months in which to go to the Department of Social Protection to arrange to keep up the payment so it would not be gone.  Unfortunately, I will lose the years in which I have been a Member when I seek my contributory pension.  I would have had no problem paying the &euro;550 per year had I known.  There is a considerable issue owing to people not knowing what their stamp entitles them to.  A new system has to be brought in through the Department of Social Protection.  It would involve a simple measure.  A P45, P60 or any other document from the Department of Social Protection should state exactly what stamp one is paying and what one is entitled to.</p></speech>

I was dismayed and shocked to hear recently that a pub in Cork has been granted a licence although it is using a loyalty card scheme, despite Garda objections.  We are trying to discourage harmful drinking and reduce the amount people drink with the introduction of the Bill and other such measures.  The licensing decision encourages harmful, excessive drinking.  Such a business model will inevitably cause further harm, with the possibility of public order offences and other problems arising.</p> <p>Section 16 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 permits the making of regulations in the interest of public health and safety but no regulations have been made to date.  This is totally unacceptable.  As has been said in this House on numerous occasions, alcohol consumption has trebled since 1960 although there have been slight reductions in various areas.  Overall, we are drinking in a more harmful way.  A loyalty scheme is completely against everything we are trying to work on at present.  The figures are truly alarming and, as such, we must do all we can to prevent excessive drinking, not encourage it.  Section 16 is due to be repealed and replaced by the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill and, as such, we must do all in our power to ensure this section is enforced by introducing regulations that would prevent such initiatives as the pub loyalty card scheme.  Imagine circumstances in which the Garda is saying a pub should not be given a licence because of what it is proposing but it still gets the licence.  That is completely unacceptable.</p></speech>

Many people are not aware that the Irish Hospice Foundation, Mayo Roscommon Hospice and various other hospices raise money and build vital facilities.  They work very closely with the Department of Health.  Yesterday, I saw at first hand the co-operation between Mayo Roscommon Hospice and the Department of Health and the Minister, Deputy Harris.  Hospices are built around the country but it is the Department of Health that funds the staffing of these facilities.  It is great to see co-operation between the health service and voluntary organisations to provide the best care for patients who are at the end of life.  I saw at first hand yesterday the Department allocating funding to staff the hospice, when built.  A partnership between voluntary groups and the Department of Health is the right model for the country.</p></speech>

The country and public representatives were outraged at the time, and rightly so.  The previous Minister outlined at the time that street homelessness would be ended.  The purpose of my raising this topic this morning is not to score political points.  I acknowledge and am not naive enough to believe that every person sleeping rough in Dublin can be taken off the streets.  The issues some of these people are going through are frighteningly complex.  Sleeping rough is an unfortunate choice for some.</p> <p>A street count on 22 November found 142 rough sleepers in Dublin.  On 9 December, 230 emergency beds will be made available, which is welcome.  It is my worry that the number of rough sleepers located on 22 November does not give a full picture of the number on the streets.  There are people sleeping rough in every single neighbourhood in Dublin.  We have to accept this is an epidemic and that it is getting worse.</p> <p>To be fair to the Minister, he is trying and I wish him the best.  I suggest that, as a collective cross-party Seanad team, we contact one of the homelessness agencies and go out together some night over the next two weeks to talk to the homeless people, gain face-to-face experience of what they are enduring and determine whether there is anything else we can do.  We know how cold it is at present.  The Christmas season really begins today.  Let us try to prevent the death of another poor person on our streets and remember Jonathan Corrie for the troubled yet brave man that he was.</p></speech>

When will I, another compliant taxpayer, get my water charges money back?  This is the question on the lips of every compliant taxpayer this morning, or at least the 1 million people who have paid their water charges.  The idea that has been floated over recent days, that those who have not paid their water charges will be pursued and made pay the money still owed, is a complete nonsense.  Fine Gael knows that.  We all know it is an impossibility.  Of course, nobody likes paying new taxes or charges - that is human nature - but the majority of people paid and are paying for water.  This is evident in rural areas, for example.  Many of those who have paid their water charges have done so through gritted teeth and in difficult circumstances.  They expect that a party that prides itself on its role in founding the State and on supporting compliant taxpayers and those who comply with the law will support them.  That party is Fine Gael.  Given the recent approach of the Government to the idea of water charges, Fine Gael can no longer be relied on to be the party that vindicates the rights of compliant taxpayers and those who abide by the law.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerald Nash:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2281"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2281&amp;amp;pid=GeraldNash&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This morning there were a lot of very worried Fine Gael Deputies and Senators taking calls in their constituency offices and in the House and meeting constituents face to face who are concerned that they have paid their water charges while others have not.  The message being sent now is that it is fine if one does not pay a charge passed by these Houses, albeit in difficult circumstances.  That quick fix is not acceptable to anybody.</p><p>Citizens who have paid their water charges need clarity now.  As a compliant citizen, I want to know when I will be refunded the water charges I have paid and the people I represent want to know too.  The cynical, political time-buying exercise that was the commission which reported this week - a report which has been kicked to a committee of these Houses for further consideration - will not buy sufficient time for the House to come to a conclusion that will be acceptable to anyone.  It cannot be used as an excuse to fudge this issue any longer.  The issue will have to be resolved before March when the committee reports.  The Minister needs to come to the House today to explain what his position is.  It is clear to me that the Fine Gael Party is divided on this issue.  The people who paid their water charges need to know when and how they will be refunded.</p></speech>

Since yesterday morning, it has gone up by 12%.  This arises from the agreement of OPEC countries to restrict the supply of oil on the market.  If anything, it is an international story, but it tells us in Ireland that we are not rich in fossil fuels.  The fortunes of our people and businesses are out of our hands and in the control of OPEC, which can cause misery to suit itself and the oil industry.  OPEC can either let the oil flow or restrict it, which has massive ramifications for us.  If ever a case underpinned the need to diversify from our dependency on fossil fuels, we see it there.  We do not want to be the puppets.</p> <p>Coming closer to home, I note the recent publication of the EPA's Ireland's Environment 2016 document.  While we are talking a lot more about the need for a reduction in carbon emissions and to invest in renewables, the figures published by the EPA are still paltry.  Only 23% of our electricity in 2015 came from renewable energy sources.  I compare that with Scotland where 97% of electricity comes from wind generation.  My mind boggles at that because I know the wind does not blow all the time, but they obviously have a lot of solutions for storing the electricity generated from wind.  Equally, in respect of our binding EU 2020 targets, only 8.5% of our total energy requirement is being met from renewable sources.  We need to be at 20% by 2020.</p> <p>One of the suggestions in the EPA report is that we should stop subsidising fossil fuels.  This means the winter fuel allowance paid to social welfare recipients.  We need the Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten, to come to the House to discuss how we are going to chart our path.  Substantial investment in this area is required and somebody is going to pay the price.  Obviously, we cannot push those who are already hard-pressed into further fuel poverty.  It is an opportune time to have this debate with the Minister and to ensure that all our citizens are on board in the context of a national dialogue on what we need to do to become less dependent on fossil fuels.</p></speech>

I hope that at some stage in the future we will have a dedicated period to pay our tributes to one of the most outstanding Oireachtas officials.  She led the House for nearly 30 years during good times and very difficult times, through debates that lasted all night long and during the period in which there was a referendum on the abolition of the House.  She gave great advice to the House in very difficult circumstances and I hope the Leader will clarify the position in relation to providing some time to pay tribute to an outstanding official.</p></speech>

I would like the Leader to arrange a debate with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, on the funding of all third level institutions with a particular focus on outreach campuses attached to the main colleges.

I join Senators Ardagh and &Oacute; Clochartaigh in appealing from the Chamber to the people who are involved in the dispute around the ferry service to cop on and get together to provide this essential link for the people of the island.  I have been speaking to the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, today and yesterday and he has been in touch with the Minister for Defence and the Secretary General of that Department regarding the matter.  The Minister of State is very much involved and has offered his services to mediate and facilitate the resolution of the matter.  Like Senators Ardagh and &Oacute; Clochartaigh, the Minister of State is deeply concerned regarding the stoppage of the ferry service.  It is fair to say that it is not a departmental issue but one where Galway County Council and the ferry operator should sit down with a third party to thrash this out and arrive at a conclusion.</p> <p>It is unacceptable that people are being deprived of a service.  As Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh said, it is their bridge and their link and it is important that the service resumes and continues.  The Minister of State and the Department are working on the matter and the Minister of State has had a series of meetings and conversations with the local authority CEO and the people involved.  I hope the discussions can resume and that there can be a resolution because it is important that there is.  I would be happy to have the Minister of State come to the House to discuss the matter next week if there is no resolution in the interim.</p> <p>Senator Ardagh referred to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, and board appointments.  It is important to understand that there is a need to fill vacancies on boards.  In some cases, it may be that the Minister is correct that there are too many people on boards and that the size of those boards should be reduced, but we need to have people on boards in general.  In particular, we have a vacancy on the Dublin Airport Authority for a Cork representative and it is important that the position be filled.  It is fair that the Minister is filling vacancies and going about his work.</p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh raised an issue about the abstention button, which is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I hope it is part of the new suite of arrangements in the temporary Chamber and that when we move back in here, we can accommodate, like the D&aacute;il Chamber, an abstention button.  If it is in the D&aacute;il, there is no reason it cannot be here.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Senator Ray Butler raised the very important issue of the classification of social protection stamps.  That is a conversation we need to have and an information campaign is required, to which I expect the Minister for Social Protection will be open.  The Senator has been very proactive on the issue of PRSI and pension entitlements for the self-employed.</p><p>Senator Catherine Noone spoke about a pub in Cork which was introducing a loyalty card scheme.  I am not familiar with it, but the Senator is correct to highlight the fact that we must collectively work to reduce the harmful effects of an over-emphasis on drink in our culture.  That is an issue we will revisit.  I hope we will have the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill back before the House after Christmas to have it passed.</p><p>Senator Frank Feighan paid tribute to the Irish Hospice Foundation.  I join him in praising its work.  The amount of work it does is to be commended, in particular, its Think Ahead campaign, one to which we should all pay attention.  We should get involved with it in our work as politicians and in our communities as volunteers, neighbours, friends and family members because it is a conversation we all need to have.  One thing of which we can all be guaranteed is that we will all pass from this life at some stage.  The Irish Hospice Foundation is doing Trojan work and its Think Ahead campaign is one we should all support and embrace.  We must have that conversation in order that people will be ready for death and that there will be preparedness in terms of finalisation of their affairs.  It is a morbid topic, one about which we do not want to talk, but the Irish Hospice Foundation deserves our support.</p><p>Senators Gerald Nash and Paddy Burke raised the issue of water charges.  I say to Senator Gerald Nash that, thankfully, the Fine Gael Party's position on the issue has been very consistent.  It is that people must pay for water.  That was our clear position in our submission to the commission and in government with the Labour Party.  There is a process in place.  I again commend Senator P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh for taking up the position of cathaoirleach of the committee and wish him well.  He will be busy in the time ahead.  As someone who chaired a contentious committee, I can tell him that he will have a lot more grey hairs and that perhaps he might lose some of his hair.  The grey hairs will be even greyer.</p></speech>

There can be no ambiguity.  Those who paid for water through Irish Water or group water schemes or those with a private well who have been fully tax compliant must not be let down by the State.  I assure Senator Gerald Nash that I am very confident that the Government will not be found wanting in that regard.  We must ensure, as citizens of the State, that we will continue to be compliant with the laws of the land.  Those who paid for water in a variety of ways must not be let down by the Government and if that means that they must be reimbursed or receive a tax credit, so be it.  A process must be put in place.</p> <p>Senator Michelle Mulherin raised the issue of fossil fuels.  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, will be in the House next week to discuss the matter.</p> <p>Senator Paddy Burke referred to the Clerk of the Seanad, Ms Deirdre Lane, who has retired.  I hope we will be able to facilitate tributes to her.  The Senator also raised the matter of third level education in Castlebar.  The Cassells report is being discussed by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills, from where I am sure we will see it progress.</p> <p>I am happy to accept Senator P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh's proposed amendment to the Order of Business.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges has discussed the invitation to the Minister for Finance in the North, Mr. &Oacute; Muilleoir, and the issue is being progressed with a view to having other speakers.

In particular the recovery in the public finances of recent years is testament to our resilience.  I made the point in my Budget Statement that we must get away from, forever, the boom and bust cycles that have caused so much grief in the past.  We must not forget the lessons of a challenging period in our very recent history.  There is a need to manage the public finances effectively and fairly for the benefit of all.  In the programme for Government, and indeed in this budget, we decided to favour investment in public services over tax changes.  As we begin our debate here this afternoon on the Finance Bill I must emphasise that as a consequence of the decision to focus on improved public services there are less resources available for taxation changes, but we have sought to make progress where possible.</p> <p>We are moving into a time of both challenge and opportunity for the State as Britain prepares to leave the EU, so we must ensure that Ireland continues to be an attractive location for investment and job creation.  Indeed, a number of measures were adopted in the budget to commence dealing with the reality of Brexit.  These include changes to the universal social charge, USC, where we continue the progress made over the last two budgets in reducing the USC, with a particular focus on low and middle-income earners.  For the third year in a row, the measures introduced in section 2 of the Finance Bill will reduce the top marginal rate of tax on income up to &euro;70,044 per year.  Subject to the passing of this Finance Bill, this marginal rate will stand at 49% from January 2017.  From 1 January next year, this Bill will reduce the three lowest rates of USC by 0.5% each.  That will decrease the rate of USC applying on all income up to &euro;70,044 in a year.</p> <p>Section 4 provides for an increase in the earned income credit from &euro;550 to &euro;950 per year.  This credit is available to self-employed individuals who do not have access to the PAYE credit, and provides support to entrepreneurs and small business owners generating employment and economic activity across the country including farmers, publicans, retailers and tradesmen.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Michael Noonan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=821"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=821&amp;amp;pid=MichaelNoonan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Section 5 provides for an increase to the home carer tax credit to &euro;1,100 per annum, to support families where one spouse works primarily in the home to care for children or other dependents.  This credit is of benefit to over 80,000 families annually.<br/><br/>Section 6 provides for a new tax credit for fishermen to assist the viability of the fishing sector.  This will allow those who spend at least 80 days fishing at sea in a tax year to claim an additional income tax credit of &euro;1,270 per annum.  The help-to-buy initiative takes the form of a rebate of income tax paid over the previous four tax years as a contribution to the deposit needed to fund the purchase of a new home.  The amount rebated will be up to a maximum of 5% of the purchase price of a new home, with the maximum rebate available being &euro;20,000.  The amount of rebate available to an applicant is calculated based on their total income tax paid over the previous four years.  Section 9 gives effect to this incentive.<br/><br/>Section 10 extends the special assignee relief programme until the end of 2020.  This programme was due to expire at the end of 2017, but its extension is being provided for at this point to remove any uncertainty for the foreign direct investment sector in the context of Brexit.  Also in that context, section 11 provides for the extension of the foreign earnings deduction until the end of 2020.  This incentive is designed to assist businesses to diversify into non-traditional export markets for Irish goods and services.<br/><br/>Section 12 extends the start your own business tax relief for new applicants for an additional two years until the end of 2018.  This scheme assists long-term unemployed individuals to start a business by giving them an exemption from income tax on profits of up to &euro;40,000 for two years and mirrors that available for corporate start-ups.<br/><br/>An increase in the ceiling for tax free income under the rent-a-room scheme from &euro;12,000 to &euro;14,000 is provided for in section 13.  This incentive aims to encourage homeowners to rent out additional vacant rooms, thereby providing extra residential accommodation.<br/><br/>Section 14 relates to personal retirement savings accounts, PRSAs, and retirement annuity contracts, RACs.  Revenue has brought to my attention certain tax-planning opportunities entailing PRSAs and RACs that were not envisaged by the legislation.  This section will close off these opportunities by amending the legislation to ensure that if such pension arrangements do not vest, that is, mature or come into payment, by the date of the owner&rsquo;s 75th birthday, they are deemed to vest on that date, or where the owner is 75 before the date on which Finance Act 2016 is passed, on the date that Act is passed, subject to transitional measures.<br/><br/>Section 15 amends the living city initiative to encourage an increase in the take-up of the scheme.  The changes include the removal of the restriction on the maximum floor size of properties that can qualify, the removal of the requirement for the residential element of the initiative, that the property must have been previously used as a dwelling and changes to the minimum amount of expenditure needed to qualify.  It also extends the availability of the initiative to landlords in respect of the renovation of rental accommodation in the special regeneration areas.<br/><br/>An amendment to the income averaging regime that allows a farmer&rsquo;s taxable profits to be averaged out over a five year period is provided for in section 18.  I announced in budget 2017 that I will gradually reduce the deposit income retention tax, DIRT, rate to 33% over the course of the next four years, starting with a 2% cut in this budget, and further 2% cuts in the following three budgets, these changes are provided for in the Bill.  The first reduction of the rate of DIRT to 39%, will apply from 1 January 2017 and this is set out in section 21.<br/><br/>Concerns were raised about the section 110 regime being used by investors in a manner which was never intended.  I am therefore moving to restrict the use of the regime where transactions involve loans secured on and deriving their value from Irish land.  This measure reinforces our taxing rights and ensures that the Irish tax base is appropriately protected whilst simultaneously ensuring the section 110 regime is maintained for bona fide securitisations.  Accordingly, section 22 makes a number of amendments to exclude businesses with loans which are secured over, or derive their value from, an interest in Irish land from using the provisions of section 110 to avoid payment of Irish tax on profits made on Irish property transactions.  The amendments ensure that certain persons who are already subject to Irish corporation tax can continue to avail of the existing regime and exclude certain bona fide securitisation transactions.  They do not permit the companies to mark to market and they apply to accounting periods beginning on or after 6 September 2016.<br/><br/>In a further move to asserting our taxing rights over Irish property, I am introducing a new tax regime for Irish funds holding Irish real estate.  The proposal will ensure that the Irish tax base will be protected where Irish property transactions are taking place within collective investment vehicles.  We are confident that the legislation strikes the appropriate balance between attracting long-term sustainable capital to the Irish property market whilst ensuring, in so far as possible, that the taxing rights from Irish real estate is retained in the Irish tax base.<br/><br/>Section 23 provides for the introduction of a tax regime for Irish real estate funds, IREFs, by inserting a new Chapter 1 B into Part 27 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  The objective of these provisions is to provide for a taxation regime for investment undertakings, where 25% of the value of that undertaking is made up of Irish real estate assets.  The IREF must deduct a 20% withholding tax on certain property distributions.  The withholding tax will not apply to certain specific categories of investors as set out in the legislation; including pension funds, life assurance companies and other collective investment undertakings.  The section applies to accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2017.<br/><br/>I announced in budget 2017 that the applicable rate of capital gains tax relief, CGT, which applied to gains from business disposals by entrepreneurs is being further reduced to 10% while retaining the &euro;1 million lifetime limit.  This measure, in section 26, is intended to encourage entrepreneurship and to send a message that the State is strongly supportive of entrepreneurs.<br/><br/>The EU Commission requires Ireland to carry out restoration works on raised bog special areas of conservation and raised bog natural heritage areas.  Payments under the protected raised bog restoration scheme will be exempt from CGT in order to encourage co-operation with the scheme and this is covered in section 30.<br/><br/>Section 36 underpins the budget day announcement to increase the excise duty on tobacco products.  The excise duty on a pack of 20 cigarettes has been increased by 50 cent, including VAT, with a <i>pro rata</i>increase for other tobacco products.  This public health measure is estimated to raise &euro;65 million in a full year.  To further assist the development of the micro-brewing industry, the qualifying ceiling is being increased from 30,000 hectolitres to 40,000 hectolitres for export markets and this is set out in section 37.<br/><br/>Section 44 provides for the extension of vehicle registration tax, VRT, reliefs available for electric vehicles to 31 December 2021 and hybrid electric vehicles to 31 December 2018.  Section 47 increases the farmers&rsquo; flat-rate addition from 5.2% to 5.4% with effect from 1 January 2017, as announced in the Budget.  In addition, a new measure is being introduced into the flat-rate farmer scheme to avoid over-compensation.<br/><br/>Section 50 concerns an extension of the bank levy out to 2021, as announced in the Budget Statement.  Between 2017 and 2021 this is expected to raise &euro;750 million.  Senators may recall that I introduced an amendment to the capital acquisitions tax relief known as the dwelling house exemption to this Bill on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.  The purpose of this change, set out in section 52, is to realign the exemption with its original policy objective, that is, to alleviate the hardship of an inheritance tax liability faced by a person who inherits a house which he or she had been sharing as a principal place of residence from the person they had been sharing it with, and to ensure that the person did not have to sell the house to pay the tax liability.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Michael Noonan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=821"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=821&amp;amp;pid=MichaelNoonan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Finally, this year I announced I am further increasing the group A tax free threshold which applies to gifts and inheritance from a parent to his or her son or daughter to &euro;310,000.

He is very welcome to the House.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill.</p> <p>The budget was fair because Fianna F&aacute;il was able to negotiate a confidence and supply agreement with the Government.  This secured a 3:1 ratio in favour of spending on services over tax cuts and outlined areas of focus that would make Ireland a fairer and fundamentally more decent society.  </p> <p>Contrary to previous budgets under the previous Government, budget 2017 focused on the lower paid.  The ESRI stated that budget 2017 is close to distributionally neutral overall, but with some additional resources targeted towards those on the lowest incomes.  This budget represented a unique opportunity to address some of the issues facing us as a result of Brexit.  Regrettably, the budget did not live up to expectations.  Key areas of concern for Fianna F&aacute;il include the lack of urgency around our preparation for Brexit, specifically the fact there is no provision to assist SMEs facing a depreciating sterling, very little provision for trade diversification to other countries and little provision to avail of the opportunities from Brexit where they may arise.</p> <p>While no budget can be fully Brexit proof, and Brexit is very uncertain, this budget was sadly lacking in terms of the impact of Brexit.  Most of the initiatives are extensions of existing programmes.  While welcome, they do not assist companies affected by Brexit.  </p> <p>The decision by the people of the United Kingdom to exit the European Union in June of this year represents the single biggest challenge facing Ireland.  The issue has serious political and economic consequences for the Republic and Northern Ireland.  The UK accounts for 15% of Ireland's goods exports in 2014 and 20% of its services exports in 2014.  It is also a source of imports, with almost 30% of our merchandise imports and 70% of overall imports originating from the United Kingdom.</p> <p>While we do not know what form Brexit will take, a number of economic considerations are already clear and evident, specifically the depreciation of sterling against the euro.  Given that sterling is trading at &pound;0.89 to &euro;1, Irish goods and services are now 16% more expensive than pre-referendum rates.  This is hurting our businesses and costing jobs.  Companies either have to increase their prices in the UK to account for it or take a hit in their cost base.</p> <p>Hedging against currency fluctuation is a costly and tricky business requiring a lot of expertise.  Many SMEs cannot engage in it because they lack the required resources and expertise.  We proposed a national hedging strategy to assist such SMEs.  </p> <p>We do not need Article 50 to be invoked to know that we need to diversify our trade towards other countries.  It is simply insufficient to allocate &euro;3 million to Enterprise Ireland for Brexit-related activity.  In addition, no extra funding has been given to IDA Ireland to attract companies affected by Brexit to Ireland.</p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il believes that home ownership is essential to building and maintaining a prosperous society.  Many dream of building a family around a family-owned home.  However, this dream is being pushed further and further away by the housing crisis.  House prices are continuing to rise due to a shortage of supply.  Mortgage approvals have increased again in quarter 3 of 2016, suggesting there is plenty of demand.  </p> <p>The Government&rsquo;s help to buy scheme is designed to add to this demand by giving first-time buyers of new properties a rebate of income tax from the previous four tax years.  Our issues with this are that there was no impact assessment of the change carried out by the relevant Departments and experts and no consultation with the Central Bank on the potential impacts of this scheme on house prices and the housing market.  We fear it will lead to a further increase in prices as demand is already strong and supply limited.</p> <p>Supply is key to delivering what is needed in the housing market, in particular in the greater Dublin area.  We fear the budget will lead to a further increase in prices.  Fianna F&aacute;il proposes that an independent impact assessment takes place 12 months after the beginning of the operation, and the Government has agreed to undertake such a review that will assess the scheme&rsquo;s impact on house prices, house supply and the housing market in general.  We also propose that the Government carry out a detailed analysis of the cost of delivering a new home in Ireland, and again the Government has agreed to this which we welcome.</p> <p>We have submitted to the Central Bank that second-time buyers should be treated the same as first-time buyers and that first-time buyers should be rewarded for having a strong rental history.  We support the moves to close the loopholes on section 110 companies and other funds regarding Irish property and mortgages, and we also support the tougher stance taken on offshore tax defaulters.</p> <p>Currently, mortgage interest relief on rented residential property is limited to 75%.  This will incrementally increase over the next five years to 100%.  We are in support of this measure as it will encourage people into the rental market, where supply is limited.  </p> <p>With regard to the universal social charge, USC, the confidence and supply agreement stipulated clearly that any cut to USC needs to be directed at lower and middle income earners.  As a result of the confidence and supply agreement, this has now been implemented.  Over the last number of years, we have constantly asked for a reduction in capital gains tax, CGT, and through the confidence and supply agreement, the rate will decrease from 20% to 10% for entrepreneurs.  </p> <p>I want to welcome in particular the increases in capital acquisitions tax in group A from &euro;280,000 to &euro;310,000, in group B from &euro;30,150 to &euro;32,500 and in group C from &euro;15,075 to &euro;16.250.  It is only right that people who have worked hard all their lives are able to pass on their assets to their children, in particular, without incurring penal tax rates.  </p> <p>Though modest, the increase in the home carer tax credit from &euro;1,000 to &euro;1,100 is also welcome.  This assists people who are providing a valuable service to the country by caring for a loved one.</p> <p>The Minister has provided great detail.  We could discuss the Finance Bill for hours, but at this point in the process I want to welcome the Minister and thank him for his summary of the Finance Bill.  I have pointed out some of the issues.  </p> <p>While there are very few houses in many parts of the country worth over &euro;500,000 or &euro;600,000, in parts of south Dublin there are very few houses worth under &euro;500,000.  We need to be aware that the housing market is different in different parts of the country.  I am sure the Minister is aware of that, but one finds that what one gets in parts of Limerick, Mayo, Louth and various other parts of the country compared with what one might get in south County Dublin, where I was a counsellor for 12 and a half years, is very different. </p> <p>At some point in time, consideration should be given to examining the market.  It is what it is.  Supply is limited, demand is high and many ordinary three-bedroom, semi-detached houses are selling for &euro;400,000 and &euro;500,000, and houses that are not much bigger are being sold for close to &euro;1 million.  We need to examine the issue.  In conclusion, Fianna F&aacute;il will honour its side of the agreement in respect of this budget.  It is our intention to facilitate its passage through the House.</p></speech>

It has now been six weeks since the budget announcement and one week since the Finance Bill was passed by the D&aacute;il, and the question of whose budget it was still remains.</p> <p>The twists and turns of Fianna F&aacute;il would have political scientists scratching their heads.  Initially, it claimed credit for a tax spend and cut ratio of 2:1, and then promptly sat back and abstained.  Sinn F&eacute;in, in the weeks leading up to the budget, researched, debated and costed an alternative budget.  There were tough decisions to make.  Fianna F&aacute;il produced a budget document in which, as was said in the House, the only figures were the page numbers.  </p> <p>In order to improve the lives of citizens, alternatives must be put forward.  When we oppose a measure in the Bill we do so because we believe that will help to ease the crisis in our services, begin to solve the housing crisis or help those households that are just about managing.  </p> <p>In the intervening period since the budget was announced, there has been a report from the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council criticising the cut in the solid source of taxation that is the USC.  There has also been an amending of the mortgage rules by the Central Bank which has effectively rendered the help to buy scheme in the Bill even more useless and unnecessary.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The cut to the USC, as outlined in section 2, features only because Fine Gael can claim it fulfilled at least part of its pre-election promise.  The &euro;330 million to be cut from the USC is the start of a process that has been exposed by the Department of Finance itself as regressive and of greatest benefit to the wealthiest.  It narrows the tax base at a time when increased investment in public services will be needed.  Fianna F&aacute;il's manifesto called for the abolition of the USC for 90% of taxpayers.  There was nothing in its document at budget time that indicated a change.  It dodged the question in the D&aacute;il vote.  I welcome the opportunity for Fianna F&aacute;il to clarify its position in the Seanad, where more considered and detailed debate is meant to take place.</p><p>The help-to-buy scheme in section 9 was the stand-out measure of the Finance Bill.  From the outset, it looked dodgy.  The Minister was not able to state unequivocally whether the Central Bank had any issues with the scheme.  The only thing the Governor of the Central Bank was actually consulted about was a technical issue as to whether the tax rebate to be provided could be used as part of the deposit under the mortgage lending rules.  As it stands, this section will benefit only the builders.  The latest rule changes by the Central Bank now mean that a deposit of only 10% is now required for first-time buyers.  The Government's stated aim was to help first-time buyers to reach the deposit required to buy a house.  If the Government proceeds with this measure, it will effectively reduce that rate down to 5%.  This will bring us dangerously close to the 100% mortgages offered on properties that have no guarantee of maintaining their value.  This would be to repeat one of the major mistakes of recent years, ignoring much of what we learned from the banking inquiry around this issue.</p><p>The measure in section 10 is another clear sign that this Bill is another step in a return to the failed policies of boom and bust.  The Taoiseach publicly slapped down a fellow Minister's suggestion of tax breaks for returning exiles.  There is not much different in the extension of the SARP section and there was not enough said in the D&aacute;il to convince my party other than that this is a tax break for wealthy individuals with no link to job creation.  Likewise, the CAT changes are short-sighted and will benefit a small few the most.  When we consider the narrow choices available to us because of the fiscal rules, we note there is no way we should be spending that on reducing CAT thresholds.  Likewise, the cuts in DIRT are just not necessary at this point and mean that schools and hospitals will go with a little less.  That is the type of choice we had to make and the Government made the wrong one.</p><p>I welcome some measures, such as the extension of the home renovation incentive and particularly the progress made on cracking down on loopholes that section 110 companies and property funds have been abusing.  Much progress has been made but, in our view, there is still work to be done.  Take, for example, the capital gains tax loophole.  Fundamentally, there is a need for massive expenditure in public services, not on developer-friendly measures and face-saving tax cuts to fulfil silly and rushed pre-election promises.  That is where this Finance Bill fails miserably.  It harks back to the bad old days of Fianna F&aacute;il and endless reckless indulgence in property tax breaks while promising spending based on volatile sources.  Unlike others, Sinn F&eacute;in is opposed to this Bill.  It is not agnostic about it.  It puts us on a track towards another crash and in no way prepares us for the challenges coming down the track.</p></speech>

I just want to put a theme to the budget.  Normally the budget is about striking a balance and achieving fairness.  Resources are still limited.  I wish to refer to the general increase, albeit limited, across all social welfare classes and to the universal social charge, USC.  I find it strange that Sinn F&eacute;in is seeking to retain the USC.  People on low incomes are paying the USC on their gross income, without deductions.</p></speech>

Sinn F&eacute;in has been speaking about this.  Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin was on Newstalk this morning talking about it.  The bottom line is that we should deal with the facts.  The USC was effectively brought in as an economic wartime tax.  Ordinary people on a relatively low income are paying the charge.  If I earn above &euro;12,012, I must pay the charge.  I do not understand how Sinn F&eacute;in can stand over the retention of the charge.  It hits the family with young children and the young person going out to work.  Everyone in these categories wants to see the universal social charge gone.  It was brought in as an economic wartime measure and we are seeking to phase it out.  I am trying to wrack my brain logically to discover why Sinn F&eacute;in is seeking to retain the universal social charge.</p></speech>

Common sense dictates the United Kingdom should consider a form of referendum because Brexit does not benefit the United Kingdom or anywhere.  The European bloc needs to have strength to deal with the United States, Russia and such countries.  It looks like common sense will not prevail so I believe we need to determine, given that the measures are being planned, precisely what we can do to ensure that mobile businesses, particularly in the financial services area, locate in Ireland rather than Frankfurt and Amsterdam.  They should come not only to Dublin but also to Shannon Airport and Limerick.   There is no reason this could not be considered in terms of balanced regional development.  It is key.  There is uncertainty in this area.  Many SMEs are struggling because of sterling weakening against the euro.  We have to be vigilant about this.</p> <p>The budget dealt with housing, an issue of concern to all Members.  For all of us working at the coalface, housing is probably the number one issue raised by constituents.  I welcome a number of the measures.  I will highlight them and then make a comment.  I welcome the extension of the home renovation scheme for another two years.  I welcome the fact the rental income for the rent-a-room scheme is being increased.  I note that the mortgage interest relief for landlords of rental properties will systematically increase by 5% over the next five years.  The rate is currently 75%.  The key point is that we must be vigilant to ensure this does not give rise to an increase in rent.  This is the underpinning control mechanism we must have in place.</p> <p>I welcome the income tax rebate for first-time buyers.  The Central Bank has referred to this recently.  People are putting it out that a 97% mortgage is required.  That is not correct.  Effectively, banks can now give a 90% mortgage.  If, for instance, there were a &euro;200,000 house, the mortgage would be &euro;180,000 and a deposit of &euro;20,000 would have to be provided.  This deposit can be produced in a number of forms, including the income tax rebate, the 5%.  In some cases, some mortgage companies are giving money back but the loan-to-value ratio is still is 90:100.  The loan-to-income ratio is three and a half times one's earnings.  Many affected couples and single people are in their 30s.  Ten years ago, people in their 20s were buying homes.  Buyers are now in their 30s in some cases because they got caught in the rental market prior to the crash in 2007.  In many cases, they were encouraged to buy apartments to step onto the property ladder.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Kieran O'Donnell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2207"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2207&amp;amp;pid=KieranODonnell&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Many of them have had families and have had to move out of the apartment and rent a house, perhaps for the past four or five years.  The rent received from the apartment is paying the mortgage but in some cases it does not cover the full amount.  They may pay upwards of &euro;1,000 a month for a family home.  If people are able to afford it there should be some flexibility in how mortgages are given, but we must be vigilant to ensure it does not bring about the unintended consequence of increasing house prices.</p><p>The earned income credit for the self-employed is becoming consistent with the PAYE credit and this is to be welcomed.  The start your own business scheme has been extended for a further two years.  CGT relief for entrepreneurs has a limit of &euro;1 million and they can pay 10%.  Perhaps we can look at increasing this limit.  Entrepreneurs to whom I have spoken feel it should probably be higher.</p><p>Many disability organisations have told us they should be able to claim back the VRT and VAT in respect of vehicles purchased for disabled people.  They are not able to qualify for this.  I would be interested to know the cost to the Exchequer.  It should not involve a huge number of vehicles but it could improve the quality of life for people residing with the organisations and service users.</p><p>I welcome the Living City initiative which has been expanded.  It has been extended from Limerick's Georgian quarter to a range of other buildings.  The Living City initiative should be exactly as it reads, namely, about getting people back into the city to live, particularly in the heart of Limerick city.  I welcome the fact that for a building to be let it does not have to have been originally used as a dwelling.  This will yield dividends.  It is a positive measure and will bring people back into our city.  I encourage people to take it up because we want a vibrant city that is working for the people.  I commend the Bill to the House and I thank the Minister.</p></speech>

I will highlight a couple of areas which are very positive.  I recognise the home carer tax credit is a positive move.  I echo the comments on the Living City initiative.  It is important and could with merit be expanded to towns in the country because a number of towns could benefit from a similar initiative.</p> <p>To pull back to the bigger picture, I would appreciate if, in his reply on Second Stage, the Minister would comment on equality and gender proofing of the measures put forward in the Finance Bill because it is a commitment in the programme for Government to have equality and gender proofing.  I feel there is an absence of it.  We spoke about a balance, but in the end there is still an imbalance in the budget.</p> <p>Questions were asked about the USC.  The primary concern about how the USC has been handled in the budget is the way it was done ensures those on higher incomes benefit more.  When we speak about middle incomes, and I have made this point in the House previously and it is important, the middle income in Ireland is &euro;28,500.  Half of the population who are working earn &euro;28,500 or less.  This is the middle income.</p> <p>The way the USC cuts have been designed means somebody on &euro;60,000 gets much more from it than someone on &euro;30,000.  There is a problem in that those on &euro;60,000 get much more than the half of the population on approximately &euro;30,000.  I know the answer will be this is a percentage parity but, as we all know, if we go into the shops to try to buy the stuff of life or pay for rent and food we cannot claim a percentage parity.  It goes nowhere.  In the end, cash is what matters and it matters more and more the lower down the income scale we go.  Somebody on a higher income gets more from the way the USC was designed than somebody on a medium income.  This is a fact.  I say this because I believe it is a priority, and it has been recognised by the OECD that Ireland has extraordinarily high levels of income inequality.  I recognise the work done in the Department of Social Protection to address it, but I do not believe it should entirely rest on the Department of Social Protection to address it.  We need to look to ways in the finance area to address this unusually wide income inequality, rather than simply covering over the gap through social protection.</p> <p>IMF research from 2014, which was conducted in more than 100 countries over a 30-year period, showed income gained for the top decile led to a loss in overall national growth whereas income gains for the lower decile led to a gain in national growth.  It is very important to remember always this IMF research was unequivocal in stating trickle-down economics does not work.  This is now a fact of contemporary economics.  We need to remember it because we can fall back into it because it was prevalent for so long.</p> <p>There are concerns about inequality in some of the tax relief measures.  We discussed the private pension tax relief measure previously in the House.  There is no defence for a marginal rate private pension tax relief which continues to benefit higher earners massively and fills neither of the stated goals of our national pension policy, which are to increase pension protection for women and for lower earners.  It works directly against this and takes hundreds of millions of euro out of our economy.  These hundreds of millions of euro could be used to address either a first or second tier of protection for all of our citizens.  The Minister will be in dialogue with the Department of Social Protection on this, but if we are to address the pension gap, and we have been speaking about it and have had passionate debates about the pension gaps for self-employed people and women, we need to fundamentally look at this anomaly.  It was identified in the memorandum of understanding with the troika as an area where Ireland promised to take action, but meaningful action was not taken.  It was one of the very few provisions in the original memorandum not implemented.</p> <p>With due respect to my colleague, Senator Horkan, I recognise the situation for people who want to pass on family homes but we need to look at cost and benefit.  We were told when we discussed the Social Welfare Bill that this is other people's money.  That point was underscored to us.  In fact it is all of our money.  While I absolutely understand a situation where families may wish to pass on a family home, and it is important, it must be looked at and examined with the same cost benefit scrutiny we would apply to all other measures.  I urge that we look to this.  We speak about those who have worked hard all their lives.  There are people who work hard all their lives and do not have a house or houses to pass to anybody at the end of it.  In fact, there are people who work hard all their lives and can barely survive into their pension years.  This is a reality in Ireland.</p> <p>Another point, which we can address more on Committee Stage, is that a sleight of hand tends to happen at budget time, when we have a huge focus on our pockets, which directs our attention away from portfolios.  It is not in the area of income but in the area of wealth the Finance Bill is most important, and it is the area of wealth we are most in danger of not addressing.  This is not simply to speak about a wealth tax, although it has its merits.  I am concerned about many of the investment portfolios we have seen.  Cerberus paid &euro;1,900 in tax on the &euro;77 million Project Eagle profits.  According to the Comptroller and Auditor General, we know more than &euro;200 million was lost to the taxpayer in the sale.  Again, this is other people's money.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Now we know it is not even paying tax into the system in any meaningful way.  These are huge and systematic loopholes that have developed.  Since 2010, there have been changes to the code relating to those who call themselves investment funds.  We will address this further.  The changes in section 21 are completely inadequate.  When we talk about unintended consequences, they were signalled by groups such as Social Justice Ireland.  This is why we need a respectful economic dialogue.  We cannot name call on either side of this House.  We need to listen when there are alarm bells, even if they come from the Opposition or civil society.  Similarly, there have been alarm bells on the capital gains tax waiver which so inflated our property market.  That was signalled by Social Justice Ireland even at a time when the Irish Tax Institute was cheerleading that measure.  We saw its consequences.  I urge a wider openness to economic ideas which can give us an early alarm system so we do not repeat it.  I have a very technical question that the Minister might address.  I am very concerned about section 26 and the proposals relating to a reduction of 10% for those selling their companies.  I feel it is not supportive of entrepreneurship.  It encourages speculation.  If we are investing in companies and pumping money into research and ideas, as we should be, why are we then encouraging the owners to sell those companies to the only purchasers available, which tend to be large Chinese or US companies?  The companies we have nurtured and put money into then leave.  It is an incentive to owners to sell their companies and start again.  We are sending our innovators back to the starting block again and again and turning them from innovators who could generate strong indigenous businesses that would grow in Ireland into speculators.  That is what is happening in that area.  When we talk about companies, investment and job creation, we need to make the case for job creation.  Job creation comes from companies that get to the next stage here in Ireland.</p></speech>

The annual Finance Bill is the landmark event for Government each year.  I said that at the budget.  This Bill gives effect to the policy and ambition of any Government in any given year.  It enables the Government to give effect to its policies and, in a broader sense, outline its philosophy and principles.  In reality, it is very difficult to discern any central theme in this budget.  In truth, it is fair to say that it scares nobody and excites even fewer.  I suspect that after a few very torrid years, that is something we would probably consider a virtue.</p> <p>The Bill is a product of our political times where this Government is in an arrangement with Fianna F&aacute;il and the Independent Alliance.  There is enough for Fianna F&aacute;il to support broadly at this point and nothing of any real note from the Independent Alliance.  Jobs; sustainable, broad and balanced revenue-raising mechanisms; and the need to extract more from a more transparent and effective corporation tax collecting system should be the threads binding this Bill together.  We are all very satisfied to see the live register tumbling.  Every new job is a life back on track, a family situation improved, a family better off and a community gradually becoming better off.  The biggest threat to this State reaching the Holy Grail of full employment is the threat of Brexit, as was pointed out by Senator Horkan.  I am taken aback by the paucity of any new measures and innovations in the Bill to anticipate and counter the effects of at least the things we already know with some clarity and certainty about the impact of the UK voting to leave the EU.</p> <p>Where lies the commitment of the Government through the programme for Government to progressively increase the national minimum wage to &euro;10.50 over the lifetime of this Oireachtas?  At the rate of increase proposed by the Minister on budget day, having been proposed by the Low Pay Commission, it will take 15 years for the Government to reach its own target of &euro;10.50.  I draw the Minister's attention to a very recent report by the Low Pay Commission in the UK, which made it clear that the Tory Government's ambition to reach a national living wage will not impact in any way on levels of job creation and sustainability.  I have said time and again that all the available research relating to statutory minimum wage rates across the world concludes that small, incremental and predictable increases to national minimum wage rates do no harm to job creation.  We could say with some certainty that any claims to the contrary are simply ideological positions that are dressed up as fears for the functioning of an economy.</p> <p>The Minister knows only too well that one of the key measures of national and international tax systems is the idea of equity and fairness.  Our corporation tax system has been under considerable scrutiny in recent times.  We should never lose sight of the fact that it is up to us as a sovereign nation to set our own rate of corporation tax - a rate that works for us and that can be deployed in terms of our industrial strategy.  I acknowledge that as a State, we have moved very quickly in terms of the base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process, in which I played a role as a member of the previous Government.  However, we need to heed the words of people like Deputy Joan Burton and others when they say that our corporation tax rate of 12.5% must always mean 12.5% so we need to be very clear about minimum effective rates of corporation tax collection if people are to have confidence in the system.  This is why section 54 of the Bill needs to be amended in respect of bringing the date forward for addressing the issues the Minister hopes to address in terms of offshoring and so on.</p></speech>

The Minister and I have had this conversation at a number of fora but now that there has been an expansion of the living city initiative and an apparent renewed confidence in it, I would like to think that he would look at introducing a similar incentive for small market towns, or at least a pilot project.  We need to drive change in rural towns.  It does not appear as if ordinary market forces will encourage people to live in the empty houses in the centre of towns or over shops.  Neither do these forces support the small independent retailer.  We need to rethink our vision for these towns and how they become vibrant again.  I very much welcome the CL&Aacute;R funding for the enhancement of areas deemed to be disadvantaged, particularly in rural ones, but these measures alone will not provide the sort of change we need.  I ask the Minister to look at this again and at least introduce a pilot project for a number of them.  I could come up with a few towns in County Mayo if the Minister is inclined that way.</p> <p>I attended a very interesting seminar yesterday on tackling unfair trading practices organised by the IFA.  It examined the weak position of farmers in the food supply chain, how they are price takers and how it is very difficult for them to get any sort of fair price for their produce when dealing with retailers, particularly multiple retailers and suppliers to multiple retailers.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michelle Mulherin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The power and might that the multiple retailers wield is recognised.  I welcome the grocery goods regulations.  Some of the measures include the requirement that terms of contracts be put in writing so clarity exists and also the minimum terms of payment which specify that people need to be paid within 30 days for perishable goods, which is only right.  There are shortcomings.  Under the legislation not all farmers are deemed to be suppliers.  There is a grocery code adjudicator in the UK.  We need an adjudicator here.  The fundamental issue is that there is no control over the price.  The most significant single issue facing farmers and food suppliers is below-cost selling by the multiple retailers.  It has kicked in since the abolition of the groceries order in 2006.<br/><br/>I ask the Minister to have a serious look at this.  It is a cross-departmental issue, including the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor.  She was at the seminar yesterday and identified the race to the bottom.  Below-cost selling depresses the price of agricultural produce.  We need to do more than take a <i>laissez-faire</i>attitude to the market.  The market is not normal or natural.  It is highly regulated.  However, on the farmers' side there are high costs and an imposition on farmers to come up with quality food to meet the very high standards we have.  Therefore, the market is already artificially interfered with by us, for very good reasons.  However, in many instances, the farmer seems powerless.<br/><br/>We must take a proactive approach.  Multiple retailers are getting more and more powerful, hence the introduction of the adjudicator in the UK to tackle them.  They are listed.  They have such power, and it must be curtailed.  Even from a sustainability point of view, how can we possibly justify that fresh fruit and vegetables grown by our own producers can appear in a supermarket below cost?  Supermarkets are not paying the farmers and producers on time.  The same applies to meat and dairy.  It is unsustainable.  There is a perception that consumers are getting a great bargain.  We all know the bottom line for the big multiple retailers, as for all businesses, is profit.  They are adding on the cost and getting their profits elsewhere.  They are just luring people in.  They are undermining small independent retailers.<br/><br/>The advent of the multiple retailers being able to sell below cost is the core of the problem of cheap alcohol.  Minimum unit pricing is universally welcomed across the floor in this and the Lower House.  I am perplexed as to why we are not, immediately and forthwith, tackling below-cost selling.  Empirical evidence shows that the availability of cheap alcohol is one of the significant contributing factors to alcohol abuse and having a casual approach to it.  Something needs to be done.  I ask the Minister to take a serious look at below-cost selling and rein in the multiple retailers.  I would appreciate the Minister's response on my proposal.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-12-01a.116" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016120100002#Z00200"><p>I thank all my Seanad colleagues for their contributions.  Many of the points made could be elucidated further on Committee Stage.  The Bill comes from a situation in which we negotiated a Government.  We are supported by Independent Members in the Cabinet, principally by the group associated with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, but also by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten.  We are supported across the House by Fianna F&aacute;il, to which the Senator referred.  In negotiating an acceptable budget, it is very easy to negotiate bilaterally.  I have to negotiate bilaterally such that the agreements all line up at the end.  Co-ordinating the negotiations is the difficult part, not just the negotiations themselves.</p> <p>While it is true that Fianna F&aacute;il is very conscious of the fact that public services are in need of extra investment, we are also conscious of it.  What we did during five years in government from 2012 was not a matter of choice, in many respects.  We had no option.  We were more conscious, in government, than many people in opposition about the state of disrepair of many aspects of the health service and across public services.  We did not have to be pushed very hard in this Government and budget to agree to dedicating a greater proportion of the resources available to public services rather than tax reductions.  The proportion we agreed to was 2:1 in favour of public services.  The budget comes out at approximately 3:1.  We have a lot of headroom, which we used.</p> <p>The major effects of the policy positions of the budget are to be seen not in the Finance Bill but in the Revised Estimates, which will be released soon, and which will show very significant increases across the spending Departments and in the numbers of extra people who will be employed to deliver public services.  In this area I claim that the budget is very significant.  We are keeping the fiscal rules.  Regarding the macros, we will probably end the calendar year with a deficit of 0.9% or 0.8%.  Next year, we are provisioning for a deficit of 0.5% and in 2018 we will have a balanced budget.</p> <p>The employment initiatives we have taken, together with the macroeconomic policies, have been very effective in making the recovery job rich.  The latest set of figures from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, put unemployment at 7.3%.  Most economists would agree that 6% is probably full employment.  In the unemployment figures, there are many people between jobs.  Given that there is very big churn in the Irish labour market, there are significant numbers of people between jobs at all times, including people coming back from abroad, changing jobs or changing locations.  If we get down to 6% we are probably at full employment, as most economists agree.</p> <p>Improvements in the numbers at work get sticky when the percentages decrease.  As soon as the economy is successful, it begins to attract emigrants back home and immigrants from other European countries.  Dublin has become a multicultural city where one meets people from every part of Europe, especially among the young working population.  The effect is that many of the jobs created are not filled by people coming from the live register.  However, by mid-summer, unemployment will probably be at approximately 6.9% or 6.8%.  We have come a long way.</p> <p>We are in a pretty good position.  While there are risks, most of them are from abroad.  The biggest domestic risk is debt.  Legacy debt is still very high.  In the budget, I set a new target.  Rather than achieving the European target of 60% of gross domestic product, GDP, we will drive on and try to reach a target of 45% of GDP in the mid-2020s.  This will give us more headroom if there is another crisis.  There are issues regarding spending too much, and public sector pay is an issue that must be contained.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, is talking informally to the trade union movement and we are trying to accommodate the extra costs that may be coming through on the pay side.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Michael Noonan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=821"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=821&amp;amp;pid=MichaelNoonan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As of now, there will be no need to amend the figures included in the 2017 budget to accommodate the pressures that are emerging.<br/><br/>On the specifics of the budget, while there was no really strong specific issue, a number of Members mentioned that they would like to see more money being raised from corporation tax.  A great deal of money is coming in.  We have doubled the tax take from corporation tax in the past two years, as is borne out by a comparison of the figures for 2014 and 2016.  The take from corporation tax this year is significantly above the forecasted figure.  This dates back to the measures we took in the Finances Bills of 2012 and 2013 when we abolished the double Irish, as well as stateless companies for tax purposes.  We have continued by taking action in this Bill on the Panama papers and the section 110 provisions.  We have discussed the section 110 provisions with all interested parties and the best tax lawyers in town and think we have got it right, but if it transpires in the course of the year that some tax avoidance scam has emerge, I will back to the Seanad to deal with it because the intention is to close the tax avoidance schemes.  Section 110 was brought forward to drive the financial services industry in Dublin and it gave certain tax breaks for securitisation, which is key to financial services.  They were subsequently used by property investors for a purpose for which they had never been intended.  With the advice of tax lawyers who had found a gap in the law, they misapplied the section 110 provisions to activities for which they had never been intended.  What are we doing?  We are closing it.  Nobody can have a objection because they did not tell Revenue that they were going to use the section 110 provisions in that way.  Of course, with the way the people concerned file their taxes, Revenue would not have seen it coming through for 18 months.  It is only in the case of the Finance Bill 2016 that we have had a reasonable idea of what has been happening and that we are in a position to move to close the gap.<br/><br/>Senator Michelle Mulherin referred to the living city initiative.  It has not been successful.  It took two years to get sanction from Brussels because it was a project to which state aid rules would apply.  One does not have to revert to Brussels if there is a <i>de minimus</i>change in a provision that has been sanctioned.  The measures which have been brought forward are considered by Brussels to be <i>de</i><i>minimus</i>.  Therefore, we do not have to go back to Brussels again.  If, however, we were to extend the initiative to provincial towns such as Mallow, Tralee, Castlebar, Crossmolina and so, we would have to go back and Brussels would stop the initiative for a further two years.  I am advising that we wait and see if the initiative, as amended, will work.  If it works effectively, there will be an opportunity to extend it to market and provincial towns, but let us test it first.  If I were to do anything else at this time, it would be stopped dead.<br/><br/>All of the arguments made by both sides about the USC, up, down, over and back, were political rather than economic.  Everyone has a view on it and everyone is entitled to his or her view.  Our policy in government is that as resources become available, we will continue on the path followed in the past three budgets towards removing the personal tax burden - PRSI, income tax and USC - from those on low and middle incomes.  Since the USC was the last to be introduced and as Senator Kieran O'Donnell said, it was really like a wartime measure; it was a measure to deal with a particular crisis.  Since it was a crisis measure, we should start to reduce its impact before we get to the core of the income tax code.  That is sensible.  <br/><br/>I do not think there was anything else raised that would not be dealt with subsequently on Committee Stage.  I look forward to having a dialogue on the amendments tabled by Members on Committee Stage.  If I cannot take their advice on board on this occasion, I assure them that I am listening all the time and that I am always amending policies.  If it works, I am agnostic on the source of the advice.  I thank Senators for their contributions.</p></speech>
