I propose that No. 2 be taken after the Private Members' motion for two hours and that all Senators be allocated five minutes to speak.</p><p>Before we commence, I wish to notify Members that the reason for the two-day sitting this week is that it was, naturally, very difficult to predict how this week would work out.  I anticipate that the House will return to the normal three-day sitting next week, provided there is sufficient business to be dealt with.  I hope that following Saturday's result we will receive a great deal more co-operation with regard to the scheduling of business.  I will certainly continue my efforts in that regard, as I have done in the House to date.  While Members are satisfied with the outcome of the referendum, I hope there will not be too much retaliation or recrimination about the campaign or individuals associated with it on the Order of Business today.  It is my strong belief that with the mandate we have received we should now move on to doing the valuable legislative work the people of Ireland expect us to do.  I strongly hope we can do that in the professional, productive and collegiate manner that has been such a positive feature of this 24th Seanad.</p><p>I am not in a position today to answer any questions about reform of the Seanad.  The people have spoken and I believe they want the Seanad to be reformed.  However, that is work for another day rather than today.  The referendum result is only four days old and the best course of action is to allow the Government sufficient time to reflect on the outcome.  We have several reports on Seanad reform and two Bills on that issue have passed Second Stage in the House, to which the Government must fully respond.  I hope we will have that response sooner rather than later.  However, we must remember that the main focus of the Government is on jobs and the economic recovery, and it is my personal belief that our time and energy are best spent focusing on those issues while also dealing with the matter of Seanad reform.</p></speech>

It is good to be back.  It has been a very difficult number of months for every Member.  During that time Senators endeavoured to do their work as best they could, although unquestionably it was under a cloud.  Sometimes when the spotlight is focused on individuals it makes us all think about the job we do, how well we do it and, in some instances, how we do not do it well and where we can improve.  In the last two years, to be fair to the Leader and to the leaders of all the groups in the House, significant changes have been made in how this Seanad operates, such as through the Seanad Public Consultation Committee and various other new ideas and initiatives that have been introduced.  We need to do this in a considered way.</p> <p>It is not just the Government which has that responsibility.  I refer to the Leader's colleagues in the D&aacute;il, and the Taoiseach.  I would not necessarily leave it to them to come up with ideas for reform, and not of this House alone.  What the public called for and want is political reform in all of the structures -  the Oireachtas, both D&aacute;il and Seanad, Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann, and in how local government operates - concerning how politics and politicians serve their constituents and the people.  What the result of the vote showed is that people value their Constitution, Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, and their political structures no matter how imperfect they may be from time to time.  We must recognise that.  When the Taoiseach brought forward the Bill on the abolition of the Seanad in this Chamber, in one of only two occasions he saw fit in almost three years to address this elected House of the Oireachtas, I accused him of performing the greatest act of constitutional vandalism.  He was not allowed away with that because the public made the decision and the people are sovereign.  The Taoiseach has accepted that which is good, and I welcome it.  For us, as parliamentarians and Senators, our job is to move on.  The campaign is over.  People listened to our arguments.</p><p>I commend colleagues from all parties and none for the work they did during the course of this referendum campaign, in particular those who advocated a &quot;No&quot; vote, and forgiving those who advocated a &quot;Yes&quot; vote.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-10-08a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1136" speakername="David Norris" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013100800004#C00200"><p>Not those who did nothing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-10-08a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1139" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013100800004#C00300"><p>I will leave that to Senator Norris to discuss.  During the course of the campaign there was a focus on our political structures, not just the Seanad, which is a good thing.  What is not good, and is a matter we must get into straightaway, is the budget.  Let us have no doubt about the timing of this referendum.  With a week to go to the budget, when we will be discussing old age pensions, social welfare, jobs, medical cards and all the other areas of government expenditure, the past three weeks have been taken up with the Seanad referendum.  I asked, as did many Members across the House, that we change the way we do our budgetary process and try to have proper informed debates well in advance of a budget being produced by a Minister for Finance.  What will happen next week is that the budget will be produced and announced as a <i>fait accompli</i>.  That is not what the public want.  Part of the vote rejecting abolition of the Seanad was very clearly the people saying they want us to act differently, that they want this and any future Government to do that job differently, not to treat them like fools.  One never underestimates the electorate.  It read into this issue.</p><p>  We have to get on with our job of work and I will support the Leader in that.  In a very considered way, as the Leader mentioned, there have been a number of reports and Bills, including two in this House proposed by Senators Crown,  Zappone and Quinn.  Other parties and other Members have also produced documents, not only on reforming this House, which is required, but on political reform in general - of our committee system, the overuse of the parliamentary whip and reform of the D&aacute;il.  It is ironic that this Thursday the Lower House will hear the reform package the Cabinet cobbled together two weeks ago in the middle of the Seanad campaign, adding in a couple of extra hours on a Friday and a sitting at 9 a.m. on a Thursday.  Does the House know that the time being allowed for debate and discussion on D&aacute;il reform on Thursday is 20 minutes?  That is not acceptable.</p><p>  I congratulate, at long last, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, on the passage of the referendum on the court of appeal, which is a very important piece of legislation.  I want to see the court of appeal set up and running by October 2014, the date stated by the Minister.  That is a good thing.  Let us get on with our job and improve how we do it.  Let us look at our structures and work together to improve this House of Parliament.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-10-08a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1148" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013100800005#D00100"><p>Like the Leader and Senator Darragh O'Brien, I very much welcome the result of Saturday's referendum on the abolition of the Seanad.  It shows that the people engaged very closely with the proposal put to them.  They scrutinised the issues and were very keen, particularly in the immediate lead-up to the referendum, to inform themselves.  Their decision speaks for itself.  I also very much welcome the resounding majority in support of the proposal to establish a new court of appeal.</p><p>I commend all of those who were active in the campaign leading up the Seanad referendum.  The result seems to have confounded many commentators.  The Leader has referred to the reason we have a two-day sitting week on this occasion.  It appears that some people might have written off the Seanad in advance in terms of their agreement or otherwise to come into the House.  We will see a return to normal business in future weeks, as the Leader indicated.</p><p>The referendum result gives us a clear imperative for reform - not just Seanad reform but also political reform.  I very much welcome the Leader's announcement that we will have statements on political reform for two hours this evening.  We should work together in a collegiate fashion in this House in considering reform measures.  There are two key ways to do this.  The first is to refer potential constitutional changes to the Constitutional Convention which is the forum in which constitutional changes and political reforms broadly are being debated.  Second, this and the other House can progress legislative reforms in parallel.  We should be working in a collegiate manner to take what is best from the two reform proposals already passed on Second Stage and the cross-party report on Seanad reform adopted two Seanaid ago which included several very sensible suggestions, some of which have been incorporated into the Bills by Senators Katherine Zappone and John Crown.  We must examine what is best in these legislative proposals for reform and seek to progress them in a timely way.  That is the clear imperative arising from the very welcome outcome of the referendum.</p><p>I welcome the clear indications in recent days that next week's budget adjustment will be less than &euro;3.1 billion.  It means that there will be some relief for hard-working families and citizens in that the adjustment will be less than was previously suggested.  </p><p>I also welcome the Government's announcement on Priory Hall.  Everybody is delighted to see a settlement in sight for the residents of that development.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-10-08a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1176" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013100800005#D00200"><p>I express deep gratitude to the people who exercised their civic duty to vote in the recent referendums, regardless of how they voted.  To vote is a patriotic act at the core of an expression of Irish freedom.  It is also an act whereby one enters the territory of collective responsibility for how the country is governed.  It demonstrates a very welcome resistance to the culture of individualism.</p><p>Having strongly campaigned on the need for Seanad reform, I am, of course, delighted with the outcome of the Seanad referendum.  I am grateful for the astute leadership demonstrated by the Leader of the House and the extraordinary commitment and work of the founding members of Democracy Matters and all those who volunteered their precious time or financially contributed to that cross-party civic society group.  I know colleagues will understand why I pay special tribute to Senators Feargal Quinn, David Norris, John Crown and Sean D. Barrett for their tireless and inspiring commitment to Seanad reform.</p><p>My question for the Leader centres on the Taoiseach.  I acknowledge the graceful way in which the Taoiseach accepted the people's verdict.  I welcome wholeheartedly his recent statements of intent to lead the Government in deciding how to make this House more effective.  Seanad &Eacute;ireann in its current format is crying out for reform and the outcome of the referendum provides a strong mandate from the people for the Taoiseach to begin that process.  As others have mentioned, we have two legislative proposals, namely, the Bill put forward by Senator Feargal Quinn and me and the one introduced by Senator John Crown, both of which passed Second Stage in the House and offer a substantive starting point for credible means to effect a radical transformation of how Seanad &Eacute;ireann is elected and how it functions.</p><p>I am strongly of the view that had the panels been used properly and effectively in the past as constituencies of public interest, this House would have commanded greater respect and been more effective in its work.  I am, therefore, in favour of their retention.  I am also strongly of the view that the Taoiseach's lead on Seanad reform should, as colleagues have urged, be conducted in parallel with substantive D&aacute;il reform.  If that is the case, we will not require constitutional change for the present.</p> <p>Rather, we should seek to get the best legislative change for the Seanad and procedural changes for both Houses so that transparency and accountability become hallmarks of Irish democracy.  Will the Leader ask the Taoiseach to come to the Seanad Chamber within a month to outline to us his plans for Seanad and D&aacute;il reform?  I assure the Taoiseach that my colleagues and I want to work in a collaborative manner with the Government and all parliamentary Members to ensure the necessary reform in Seanad &Eacute;ireann is achieved as soon as possible.  There is urgent - the people are waiting and watching and they want change now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-10-08a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1136" speakername="David Norris" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013100800006#E00200"><p>This has been a remarkable week.  It was a remarkable result and it is one I welcome.  It would have been a tragedy had the referendum been passed on the tissue of lies, half-truths and cynicism presented by the Government.  It would have undermined respect for democracy.  It teaches us a lesson.  When it became clear that it was completely wrong that the alleged figure of &euro;20 million would be saved, I wrote to the Standards in Public Office Commission and the Referendum Commission.  Both replied that it was outside their scope and that there was nothing they could do.  It should be within someone's scope to stop deliberate lying during elections.  This illustrates that we need, for that reason and because of the obscure way in which ballots were presented to the people, a permanent electoral commission to examine these matters and oversee such points.  An examination of this referendum should be used as a template.</p><p>  With regard to cynicism, I refer to the immediate <i>volte-face</i> by the Government, which had tried to bully the people by saying there was no alternative, that it was never going to be reformed and that it would not reform.  Within hours of the result, the Government was talking about results.  I am glad of that but it shows cynicism.  The Government then attempted to dump all the blame on Deputy Richard Bruton.  People should not put party before the country.  The saddest thing is that the expensive exercise, costing &euro;15 million, was attempted at a time when we are still in a moment of real economic crisis.  To divide the country and set one House against the other was a grave mistake.</p><p>  In addition to those of us who were visible, there were currents beneath the surface and some brilliant interventions.  We were a small number of groups and individuals who took on a Government machine that was so powerful but that underestimated the intelligence of the Irish people.  This is not a moment to gloat or to say &quot;Well done&quot; to everyone.  We have been given a vote of confidence by those who voted in the referendum.  Our real obligation is to them and to show them the valuable work we can do and have done in the past.  I never once trashed Seanad &Eacute;ireann and never said it was dysfunctional although, through the electoral process, it is.  We have known for 30 years how that can be fixed.  I know the work that is being done.  Recently, there was something on RTE about fluoride.  The debate started in this House, which never gets acknowledged.  New photographic equipment is being introduced to stem the tide of social welfare fraud and to ensure the money goes to people who need it.  One person made &euro;450,000 by cheating.  The Government got the idea of photographic identification from this House.  Let us also make sure we communicate with the public what we have done and what we are doing.  We must sell ourselves.</p><p>  This was a dangerous referendum because it also sought to clip the powers of the Presidency, which was almost entirely overlooked.  It was a power grab.  The legislation, which is extremely valuable, contained elements I do not agree with and I look forward to saying that this evening.</p> <p>I am not going to work for nothing; they must be joking.  The talk about elitism and cutting the numbers by half was just a titbit to throw out to the public and it caught on very well.  Last night, somebody on "Tonight with Vincent Browne" said, "I would agree if they worked for nothing."  I say, "No bloody hope".  Elitism would mean a House peopled by nobody but aristocrats and millionaires.</p></speech>

Should people really be expected to come off the unemployment register and to work for nothing?  If so, people are living in cloud cuckoo land and I do not give a damn if it is unpopular, I am saying it and I will not stop saying it.  I sometimes work a 12 to 14-hour day but I will not do it for nothing.</p></speech>

I welcome what has been said by the Leader and by Senator O'Brien in regard to the question that has been put.  In fairness to the Taoiseach, he made a commitment that he would put this question to the people.  It has been put, they have answered, he has graciously accepted the result.  Therefore, it is time to move on to the next business.</p><p>The budget and the finance and social welfare Bills are coming as well as many other important pieces of legislation which it is the duty of this House to examine thoroughly.  We are bound by the people's Constitution and Members should take care of what it says therein.  I draw the attention of the House to Article 15.  Let us go on in that spirit.  The Leader has said it all from our point of view.  The House has done a lot of good work through the public consultation process and through other initiatives of this Seanad.  We were somewhat stymied on European matters and European scrutiny which is of concern to people on both sides of this Chamber.  Perhaps we can return to that business and something can happen, now that we will be discussing Oireachtas reform because the other House is the primary Chamber and that is perhaps where it needs to start.</p><p>I also welcome the decision on the court of appeal.  That is an important and a significant reform.  It is hoped, as has been said on the opposite side, the court can be in operation speedily.  We are all aware of the delays in the process.</p><p>The Leader has provided time this evening for a discussion on Oireachtas reform.  I have a different view to some Members.  I think it will require a separate group other than the existing public consultation committee to examine Oireachtas reform.  We all have a vested interest so perhaps a fresh look from well-qualified outsiders would be needed and their findings could be material for reflection by both Houses and by the Cabinet.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-10-08a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1128" speakername="Paschal Mooney" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013100800007#F00500"><p>Like everyone in this House I agree that a period of calm and reflection is required rather than any triumphalism as a result of last week's vote.  The vote proved yet again that where there is a lack of consensus on change to the Constitution, it is very difficult to effect that change.  There was most definitely a lack of consensus at this time.  The people gave their choice and they made a decision based on a reflection rather than as a knee-jerk reaction.  However, I share the views from all sides of the House that the emphasis should not be on this House alone.</p><p>I agree with Senator Darragh O'Brien that most people want political reform in the widest possible context.  There is no doubt but that the D&aacute;il is crying out for some sort of effective reform, whatever about this House.  If any reform is to take place in this House, it has to take account of the other House.  We can never be seen, irrespective of what reform policy is adopted, to be in any way competing with the other House.  This House has been and should remain complementary to the other House.  It is a case of how to build that architecture which is the challenge facing the political establishment.  There is no doubt that the Lower House is the principal House and that is where the reform should come from.  It should include, for instance, a revision of the Whip system and a study of other parliamentary systems in use in Europe.</p> <p>The Danish system was used very much as a stick with which to beat us here in the Seanad and it could perhaps be usefully considered as a template to enlarge and extend democracy within this country.  In that example the government is accountable to parliament rather than the other way around, as is the case here, where the Parliament essentially does the will of the Executive.  Whatever is done and whatever discussions are taken, the process must not be followed in isolation; that is the clear message from the events of last weekend.  It is about political reform in the round.</p></speech>

There should be calm reflection, with all Senators thinking about where we go from here.  Personally, I would have felt a little calmer and more inclined to reflect if there was not such a light schedule of business this week.  I have made the point in the past that there has been a deliberate dumbing down of the business this House has conduced in the past few weeks in order to show us as inefficient and ineffective.  I hope there will be no petulance in Government circles because of the outcome of the referendum.  This House should have a full schedule of business every week from now on.</p><p>  I welcome the report that there is, at last, light at the end of the tunnel for the residents of Priory Hall.  It is important to state it has taken far too long for this outcome to be achieved - it is practically two years to the day when Priory Hall was evacuated.  I ask that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, be invited to the Chamber to indicate how similar scenarios which I believe will arise will be dealt with.  A protocol must be put in place in that regard.</p><p>  The most pressing item I would like to bring to the Leader's attention is the report on the 4,600 asylum seekers living in direct provision accommodation, of which almost 1,000 are children.  Inspection reports published today by <i>The Irish Times</i> indicate that these families are living in the most appalling conditions.  The issue has been raised in this House on a number of occasions by many Members, but these official inspection reports bring into the open what we all know to be true, that some of these shelters are no more than protection against the rain, as opposed to homes in which people can live.  It is outrageous to think the State is paying the guts of &euro;70 million per year for what is a national disgrace that is almost comparable to the Magdalen laundries.  As a consequence, I ask that the Minister for Justice and Equality be invited to come to this Chamber as a matter of urgency to set out how he can justify the experiences of asylum seekers.</p></speech>

What are the details surrounding the &euro;405 million we are to get upfront?  Who is repaying what?  What are An Post and Camelot putting in and what are we paying back for the upfront payment?  What is the interest rate on the figure of &euro;405 million and how much of the people's money will be paid to Camelot?  What guarantee do we have that Camelot will not put up lottery ticket prices?  Where are the details?  We have had a whirlwind of reporting in newspapers, but there are no details.  Therefore, I would like the Minister to come here to explain to us where our money is going and what interest we will pay on this "gift" of &euro;405 million.</p></speech>

Over two years ago I flagged that we would have difficulties in how we would man hospitals because of the large number of Irish graduates leaving the country.  Even if the HSE was to decide in the morning to sort out the problem of long hours for junior doctors, we would still have a problem in that there is an insufficient number of junior doctors staying in the country after graduating.  The Irish Medical Organisation, the HSE and Department of Health should return to the table to try to resolve this issue in the short term.  We should engage in more long-term planning to deal with it.</p> <p>Will the Leader to convey to the Minister for Health the concerns of this House about this strike and the need to resolve the issues involved, given that the procedures or operations scheduled for many patients were cancelled today because of it?  It is, therefore, imperative that they be sorted out at the earliest date.</p></speech>

I am glad that colleagues have raised the subject.  Clearly, there is a critical need both to improve the week-to-week living conditions of the people concerned and, much more important, to sort out what is the plan to process them and make an appropriate decision.  They do not want to be slightly more comfortable prisoners not knowing how long is their sentence.  They want to know what their future is and what plans they can make for their lives.</p><p>I am delighted that my good friend and colleague, Senator Colm Burke, has mentioned the plight of junior hospital doctors.  He has been an informed and authoritative champion of all manner of issues in the health service and I hope his party appreciates the expertise and diligence he brings to legislation and other matters relating to the health service.  However, it should be irrelevant if every junior doctor in Ireland stayed at home today because they are trainees and it is a profound indictment of our system of delivering health care that we depend on the indentured servitude of people who should be receiving training to provide a service that should be provided by career level GPs and hospital specialists.  This problem needs to be tackled.  Merely palliating it by reducing them below the 24 hour working threshold or improving their overtime does not fix the problem.  If people were to lose a gold f&aacute;inne down a drainpipe at home, they would not get a plumber's apprentice out to recover it.  They would expect a trained plumber.  However, if their precious son or daughter needed critically important emergency surgery, they would be happy to bring him or her to a hospital where he or she would be looked after by a trainee, which is inappropriate.</p><p>I thank the Taoiseach for putting the referendum to the people.  He promised before the last general election that he would do so and he did.  He deserves our gratitude for being honest and I hope he takes what should be for him a positive message during his period of reflection.  He should acknowledge that the people have given him, our leader, a mandate, which is to reform the political process and begin with reform of the Seanad.  This is not a time for victors to gloat or losers to recriminate; it is a time for all of us to knock our heads together to reform our republic and the way it does its political business.  We should have a two-pronged approach to this matter.  It would be appropriate for the Constitutional Convention to consider big picture issues, but I agree with Senators Katherine Zapppone and Feargal Quinn that we could do things in the next few weeks.  I would love if their Bill or mine or perhaps even a negotiated amalgam of the two was put before the House, passed and then put before the other House for implementation, but, even if that is too controversial, would it not be deadly simple to go back to the Seventh Amendment of the Constitution in 1979 and legislate for the result of the referendum that was passed by 92% of the population to extend the voting franchise for university seats to every third level graduate and in the process give approximately 35% of the population a direct say in the election of the Seanad?</p><p>Two other mandates have been given.  We have been given a mandate by a populous, one half of whom were prepared to judge our performance worthy of capital punishment.  We need to get our act together; we need to refocus on the intent of the House and make sure those often cliched but, sadly, often justifiable criticisms made of this institution as being a prep school for the D&aacute;il or a wind-down on the way out of Leinster House are no longer valid and that Members do the job they are supposed to do.</p><p>I am delighted to see some people in the Press Gallery today because another mandate has been given.  The real problem of absenteeism in this House is absenteeism of the press.  One of the reasons we have never been able to make a case for what we do here-----</p> <p>We have never ever been able to make a case for what we do.</p></speech>

However, I do not share everyone's joy on the basis that all will be well, that there will be reform and it will all be hunky dory, because if the schedule for the Seanad this week is anything to go by that is the level of contempt that would be visited upon us had the vote gone the other way at the weekend.  That is how the Government intends to respect and regard the will of the people.  We have seen already that there is a pattern in this country that if Governments do not get their own way in a referendum they try to re-run it or brush it under the carpet.  As Senator Crown clearly illustrated, there was a referendum in 1979 which extended the voting right for university panels to graduates of all third level institutions.  Each successive Government decided to wilfully ignore the will of the people-----</p></speech>

More than 60% of people did not vote, which is a significant section of the population.  We must reflect on that; not just in terms of the referendum but also in terms of future elections as well because we must mobilise people and encourage them to vote.</p><p>I said as well on the Thursday before the referendum that the vast majority of people outside the four walls of this House were more concerned about the pressing issues of the budget and unemployment.  A couple of hours ago I heard that 65 people have lost their jobs in the Leader&rsquo;s home city of Waterford.  Those are the issues that are exercising people&rsquo;s minds, yet on Monday we still did not have an Order of Business or cl&aacute;r for the Seanad for this week.  When we did get it, as previous speakers said, it was very light.  The first thing we must do while having a debate on political reform is to invite the Taoiseach to the House and to be part of the debate because he was the one who called the referendum and who put the proposition to the people.  The Taoiseach was also the person who did not engage, debate or sell his own argument.</p> <p>It was the Taoiseach who did not engage, debate or sell his own argument.  A great number of the people who voted "No" actually voted for real reform, not just reform of the Seanad but also the D&aacute;il.  They sent the whole matter back to the Government demanding reform.  The Government has a responsibility to ensure there is such reform.  It is incumbent on the Taoiseach, who moved the referendum Bill in the D&aacute;il, to commit to both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad that he will answer for his failings in the campaign.  More important, he should talk about his future plans for reform, not just of the Seanad but also the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

I especially welcomed the type of clarity it has brought.  In fairness to the Government, including the Taoiseach, it put the matter to the people having said it would do so.  I agree with other speakers in that regard.  We are here and have a job to do.  There will be much discussion about reform over the coming weeks but we must get on with the business of the House.  Next week's budget needs to be debated in the House.  I do not see why it could not be debated on Thursday.  Senators will have plenty of suggestions on the budget and, perhaps, they will have objections.</p><p>With regard to the proposed sugar tax, the Royal College of Surgeons, backed by the Irish Heart Foundation, has today suggested a 20% sugar tax on sweetened drinks.  Professor Donal O'Shea believes the tax, in itself, would have a significant impact on childhood obesity.  Obviously, it is not just a question of that tax or of taxing more because I would be in favour of lowering the tax on certain healthy foods to lower the overall cost to already hard-pressed consumers.  Obesity is killing 6,000 people per annum in the country.  While I acknowledge that implementing a sugar tax such as the one proposed will not solve the problem and that education will comprise a considerable part of the solution, it is an example of a measure I would like to discuss in the House in advance of the budget.</p><p>I welcome the measures introduced by the European Parliament today.  Certain measures designed to discourage cigarette smoking have been brought in very conclusively.  Menthol cigarettes will be outlawed and 65% of the service area of cigarette packaging will be covered with health warnings, including imagery.  Fine Gael MEPs have been pushing for a proportion of 75%.  I welcome the measure as it is very significant.</p></speech>

I commend all those who voted, especially those who succeeded in persuading the majority to vote "No".  Many of them are present in this Chamber.  I will not name anybody as we all know who they are.  There are some, but not too many, in the other House.  I commend my leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, on his sterling performance, especially during the famous debate in which he argued against an empty chair.</p></speech>

We have had a hard, bruising bout.  We were under fierce attack for the past six months and terrible things were said about this institution and us.  I am not prepared to rush headlong into any specific talks on the reform of this House on its own.  I do not believe anybody who thinks seriously about the matter would want to do so either.  Let us pause to reflect.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, for whom I have great time in other circumstances, must realise he has made a very serious mistake.  He was gracious.  Somebody said he was very gracious in defeat.  I would say he was gracious like Sonny Liston was after Muhammad Ali knocked him out in the first minute - as gracious as that, he could be.</p><p>If there is to be an overall reappraisal of how politics works in this country, let it start with the primary House, the Lower House, and proceed to the presidency in general - I am not talking about the present incumbent.  Let the Seanad be part of the process.  We have other fish to fry.  There is a budget to come and people are out of work.  There is a lot going on and people are still in negative equity or have mortgage problems.  That is the real world.</p> <p>We have had a fair bashing of the Seanad.  It is time to leave us alone for a while.</p></speech>

The expanding role of the nursing and midwifery profession is taking on a more collaborative aspect.  This week provides an opportunity to showcase a lot of the good work that nurses are doing.  I invite Members to a short presentation by the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, to be held in the Members' restaurant between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m., on the exciting changes and developments in the profession.</p></speech>

I have raised this issue on numerous occasions in this House, as have some of my colleagues, most notably Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh.  We have continually called for clarification on many issues.  I still have a concern about the money that goes from the Department of Social Protection to the Department of Justice and Equality without any legal basis, in my opinion.  I have never been able to get an answer to my question as to the basis under which that money is transferred.  I ask the Leader to organise an urgent debate with the Minister for Justice and Equality on how we can reform the asylum system in Ireland and particularly the reception facilities currently in operation.</p><p>  Earlier today a report was published by HIQA into the children's high support unit in the HSE Dublin north east region.  Unusually, HIQA issued an immediate action plan, which demonstrates the seriousness of the report.  While I welcome the statement from the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs that all operations in the centre will cease, what will happen to the two children currently in the unit?  That was not dealt with in the Minister's press release.  How will children who are in need of high support be accommodated in the future?  At the time of the report, there were four children and young people in that high-support unit.  Most seriously, the report states that staff were instructed to lock the doors of the unit by the national director for child and family services.  The report also highlights serious risks in the context of fire safety.  I ask for clarification on this issue.  Did a directive come from the national director for children and family services to lock doors?  If so, it indicates a cultural problem that is totally unacceptable and which causes alarm bells to ring.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to the House urgently to address these questions, which are directly affecting children today.</p></speech>

It was one of those peculiar, bizarre and typically Irish situations that the Seanad found itself it in, where its very survival was a matter of considerable public discourse.  I believe that reform will happen in due course because the people voted very clearly for reform.  They want us to reform and we will do so.  In recent months I have studied the various reports on reform and the Seanad Bill proposed by Senators Zappone and Quinn.  One of the biggest concerns of the public is the fact that only 2% or 3% of the population has a vote in Seanad elections.  The aforementioned Bill could provide everyone in Ireland with a vote, which is very interesting.  A constitutional referendum would not be required to effect such a change.  There are a lot of possibilities but we need to get it right.  That will take a period of time.</p> <p>Will the Leader facilitate a period of reflection over the next several months to ensure what happens in the future with this House will be correct, reflect what the people want and that this House will support our democracy, which is not even 100 years old?  We still are a very young democracy and this Chamber will play a crucial role in not just getting us out of our present difficulties but ensuring Ireland becomes the best country in the world.</p><p>The Seanad has received an enormous mandate from the people.</p></speech>

The way we reform these Houses and our way of government will ensure, in the long term, that the economic crisis that befell us will not happen again.  Colleagues have spoken about the Constitutional Convention but the issue of the Seanad&rsquo;s place in the Constitution has been settled.  It is not an issue for the Constitutional Convention to look at again.  The two Seanad reform Bills introduced by Senator Crown and Senators Quinn and Zappone should be examined again.  The Seanad Public Consultation Committee, which the Leader and Senator Bacik have championed, is the proper way for the Seanad to examine its own role.</p><p>Many times I have pointed out how the Oireachtas has failed in EU scrutiny.  In the first two years after the Lisbon treaty was passed, 139 items of legislation were sent from Europe to be examined by national parliaments.  Of the 428 submissions made subsequently by national parliaments, Ireland made only one, an appalling record for a democracy.  We must also examine the Seanad&rsquo;s role in Government appointments and get an outside examination of our government system such as one by the Harvard Kennedy School of Government.  The role of the permanent government in our democracy has never been analysed.  It calls itself the permanent government and is always there.  This week there will not be a debate on the forthcoming budget.  It is the permanent government that frames the budget and decides the line items but the Ministers themselves do not even know what is in it before it is announced in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  That is not a way for a democracy to do business.</p><p>A reformed Seanad also needs to have a role and a vote for the Irish overseas, our emigrants and those in the North.</p></speech>

Senator Crown pointed out the 1979 referendum which gave graduates from other third level institutions the vote in Seanad university elections.  When I asked the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, as to why this referendum was never enacted, he could not answer.  He did not bother coming back to me on it either.</p><p>To paraphrase Shakespeare, &ldquo;I have come to bury the Seanad, not to praise it&rdquo;.  That is what Ministers and Deputies did.  It is time they came back and said, &ldquo;We have come to praise the Seanad, not to bury it.&rdquo;</p></speech>

When we debated the referendum, I stated I had no problem with the people making a choice on the Seanad.  Strictly speaking, the vote was not about reforming the Seanad but retaining it as it stands.  It is up to us as Senators, with the help of others who would give us advice, to reform it in a way that is for the betterment of society.</p> <p>We still have people this week saying it is dysfunctional, it is an affront to democracy and it is undemocratic.  Those people have no respect for their own Constitution.  In the last few months, like the hounds after the hares, people could smell blood and they went after us, but it backfired on them.  The Irish people are not stupid.  I ask all Deputies and some Senators who say this is an affront to democracy to step back and examine themselves.  They are saying they are part of an affront to democracy and part of an undemocratic institution.  We got a reprieve, but it is up to us to prove the importance of the Seanad for the next Seanad, whatever form it takes.  People should stop kicking us around as they have been doing.  We are an easy target.  The press and the political boot boys will move to another target.</p></speech>

We have all heard about the 90-day delaying power, which is one of the main functions and powers of the Seanad, but we have a whole range of other powers not just in the Constitution but also in statute.  We have to approve much European legislation in the area of justice and home affairs.  As individual Members we have the same rights as Deputies in the Oireachtas committees.  There is a range of other issues in legislation and it is important we set them out and assert ourselves as a Chamber.  Only with that full knowledge of what we can and should do can we operate as a full Chamber.  I do not know if the Leader has discussed today's extra business with my party leadership, and I will go with their view on it, but my view is that it is way too early and we have a perfect opportunity on Thursday to do this.  I will be here on Thursday.  The Seanad should sit on Thursday and that is the view of most Members.</p></speech>

Only during the summer did I discover that this requires legislation to establish.  I see no sign of the legislation and would like to know where it is.  The Seanad would be willing to play its part and initiate that legislation to get it going.  Announcements were made in March and during the summer about this issue and people were delighted.  We welcomed this and did not begrudge it in any way.  We want it to happen as soon as possible.  I thought things would be moving by now and so did others because these houses are in such a bad state and they keep getting worse and worse.

For me, this was brought to a head in recent days when an 83 year old man whom I was helping and representing contacted me to state he was to have surgery this week but still had no medical card.  This is an absolute disgrace.  He has a low income and there is no reason his card should have been withdrawn.  He returned the review forms to be told his card was being withdrawn.  I ask the Leader to request that the HSE come to the House and explain what is happening with medical cards.

A number of Senators have bemoaned the difficult number of months we have had, but I contend that this pales to insignificance compared with the conditions that many people who find themselves in direct provision have gone through.  I recommend all Senators read Carl O'Brien's articles in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  He raises issues that have been raised many times in the House and also echoes the sentiments of the Ombudsman, Emily O'Reilly, and Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness.  I also recommend people check out the Irish Refugee Council's website and read a number of the reports it has published.  Even if one does not want to argue about the conditions and the human rights issues, one could look at it from a purely economic perspective.  In the past month Senator Martin Conway and I were on a delegation that went to see the operation of the Portuguese system.  Portugal is also a troika country in a bailout system.  It has signed up to the EU reception conditions directive and provides a process which is much more humane and takes on board people's human rights and the need for integration.  More importantly for the mandarins in the Department of Finance, it costs much less.  The Portuguese refugee council, which deals with most of the people seeking refugee status, works on a budget of approximately &euro;1 million per year.  We spend &euro;73 million on the direct provision system, &euro;63 million of which goes to the companies running the direct provision system.  This system is a gravy train for people and companies running a very inhumane system.  The State has abdicated its responsibility in this case and we need a debate as soon as possible on what has been brought to light.  I call for this debate to happen on Thursday.  Let us ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to come to the House on Thursday and debate this as a very urgent issue.</p></speech>

I am sure whatever Minister is standing by will not mind under the circumstances.</p><p>As a matter of utmost urgency I call on the relevant Minister to come to the House to discuss the junior doctors.  It is incredible that these people are expected to work such hours if one considers that truck drivers would be jailed for working the same hours and pilots would surely be arrested for doing the same.  Today 13,000 operations have been cancelled and a skeleton Sunday-type service is being run throughout the country.  It is very worrying and is foremost in all of our minds.  We should press ahead immediately with a debate.</p><p>We all welcome the result of recent days.  While we are reflecting and having a period of calmness we might get on with a little bit of work.  With respect, I do not know that we must wait for the Government to order the business in this House.  Nothing in the Constitution states this.  If a Minister is not available I suggest that the secretary to the Government come to take notes and pass them directly to his masters in Cabinet.</p><p>Senator Daly rightly pointed out that EU scrutiny effectively does not take place in this country.  Civil servants in this country, with their counterparts in Brussels, formulate policy and both Houses of the Oireachtas rubber-stamp it.  The committee system is a second rubber-stamp.  The legislative programme for the European Commission from July to December this year has 67 pages of proposed directives that probably will not get a minute's debate in this House before they have passed the point of no return.  They will come here as primary legislation when the Minister of the day will tell us they must be transposed by a particular date because we have signed up to them.</p> <p>I suggest that, with or without the Minister, with or without the Secretary to the Government of the day to sit there, we give them a copy of the recordings and begin to take the 67 pages of proposed legislation before it passes the point of no return in these Houses.</p><p>Because I have been one of those who have been most critical, I wholeheartedly welcome to the House Lise Hand and her colleagues.

I welcome Miriam Lord from <i>The Irish Times</i>, Lise Hand from the <i>Irish</i><i>Independent</i> and Shaun Connolly from the <i>Irish Examiner</i>.  I am disappointed RTE and TV3 are not represented also because I believe the coverage of last week's events influenced the outcome of the vote on Friday, given the 27-23 vote last Wednesday on Senator Feargal Quinn's Bill on upward-only rent reviews, which was very useful.  At this stage, I also pay tribute to the retired journalist Jimmy Walsh who covered this House for a very long time.</p><p>  An interesting point is that on 1 July 1937 the plebiscite was held on the Constitution.  Some 685,105 voted for, while 526,945 voted against.  The number who voted on Friday to get rid of the Seanad was 591,937, while 634,437 voted against.  Therefore, the numbers are quite close in the two events.  However, we have to move on.  I have presented to the Leader of the House, Senator Maurice Cummins, an open letter from the former Leader Mrs. Mary O'Rourke, which is very worthwhile and should be considered in the light of his discussions on reform.  I believe the letter will be published in the <i>Irish Independent</i> tomorrow.</p><p>  The Leader played a very decisive role by way of his calm approach to the future of the House.  The Leader of Fianna F&aacute;il, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, also played a very important role, as did Senators David Norris, Sean D. Barrett, Katherine Zappone, John Crown, Feargal Quinn, R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen and others, not excluding Members of both Houses, including Labour Party, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il Members who played a very decisive role.  As someone who attended this House as a Minister, I can say that when all is said and done, I respected it so much.  I found it to be the most incisive and responsive House of Parliament.  I got and took the best advice here.  I amended Bills, as the record of the House will show.  We should never diminish its role, rather we should respect it.  I wish all of my colleagues continued success and the respect that this House was shown by the people last Friday.</p></speech>

It is a very good motion and exceptionally comprehensive.  It deals with the real issues in the real Ireland.  We are talking about towns in which small businesses have their doors padlocked and there are shutters on the windows.  Even those that have survived are wondering whether they can pay the commercial rates charged and insurance premiums.  What we are seeing is a haemorrhaging of young people from these towns to the four corners of the earth looking for work.  Some 140 Garda stations have been closed down.  The greatest insult is that these towns are to have their statutory voice removed by having the local council abolished.  I was wondering on Sunday morning, after the referendum, whether people were reflecting on what way their lives had changed as a result of the referendum.</p> <p>Will democracy have been improved in some way?  Reform is in the air; it is like a mandate.  It is like a sedative, but it does not change anything outside this House.  People will not be jumping up and down, unless we do our work.  </p><p> I was listening to Michael O'Regan, political correspondent of <i>The Irish Times</i>, who made a lot of good sense in one sentence.  He said what we needed was more policies and less politics.  The greatest reform we could have is to loosen the strings of control and put the Whip aside on occasions.  We should not force people to press buttons and fill seats when they have a different view of what is being put before them.  The people will be looking for this.  They will not be looking for gloating or grandiose grandstanding.  What they want is for us to do our job.  In fairness to the Seanad, there is less personality politics in this House than in the D&aacute;il.  There is greater scrutiny of legislation.  One statistic I came across is that in 2009, 1,201 amendments to legislation were accepted.  If that had not happened, that legislation would be law with all of the flaws contained in it.  We should, therefore, forget about patting ourselves on the back.  We should do one thing, namely, keep an eye on the real ball, an ear to the ground and, above all else, give the service - pay or no pay - that we want to give and promised to give to the people.</p></speech>

People sometimes take for granted the views of the public, but we should never under-estimate its views or knowledge of our political institutions.  The public indicated in its vote on Friday that it relished democracy, that it wanted more, not less, and that it wanted the Government and all institutions, including the Civil Service, to be held accountable.</p><p>The word &quot;reflection&quot; was mentioned.  It might not be the right word.  The word &quot;reform&quot; is also being used extensively, but we need to bring about change, not just to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  There must not just be a knee-jerk reaction but change to the way in which politics is done in this country, from local council level through to Government level.  That can only be done in a uniform manner.  It must not be a knee-jerk reaction or amount to political populism, the course of action taken by the Taoiseach and certain elements of Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  Sinn F&eacute;in then jumped on the bandwagon because the opinion polls were suggesting it was popular to do so.</p></speech>

I am a full-time Senator; I am on the job seven days a week helping people around the country.  I felt very diminished by what had happened in recent months, but I have been re-energised and I am moving forward.</p><p>  I raise a very important issue.  On the front page of the <i>Irish Independent</i> today there is a picture of Gay Byrne with his friend, Bertie Ahern.  Underneath the picture it states: &quot;Gay: I'll quit day job at 80.&quot;  Some months ago I introduced a Bill in the Seanad to end compulsory retirement at 65 years.</p> <p>With all due respect, if Mr. Gay Byrne can continue his job until he decides to go and Mr. Pat Kenny can also decide when he wishes to go, why are we depriving our older Irish citizens of the opportunity to remain in their jobs after 65 years of age if they wish to do so or to work part time?  In addition, this is an issue on which the Whip system should be withdrawn.  We want to improve society and equality for Irish people.  I will push this Bill.</p></speech>

The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, said that while he did not normally agree with Fianna F&aacute;il policy, he was glad this one was put forward.  It had the support of practically all Senators but due to the Whip system, the Government Senators had to vote against it.</p><p>I am calling for a new way of doing business here.  I will push this issue forward.  I am here to improve society and to help Irish people.  We should abolish mandatory retirement at 65 years of age.</p></speech>

In that regard, there should be an in-depth debate in the House with the Minister for Health on the HSE.  The HSE has been dysfunctional, and recognised as such, for a number of years.  It must be overhauled and, in my opinion, totally restructured.  The fact that we find ourselves in a position where people who are in need of medical attention are being deprived of it because doctors have decided to go on strike, is highly regrettable and should have been avoidable.  To expect people these days to work over 100 hours per week, apart from the effects on themselves and the fact that it breaches any sort of employment law, is obviously a risk factor for patients.  I seek a full debate on this issue.</p><p>We must also examine the payment structure within the health service.  Since I became a Member of this House I have been a long-time critic of the failure of successive Administrations to tackle both legal and medical fees, which are nothing short of a scandal.  However, there appears to be no appetite or courage on the part of politicians to do that.  The time has now come.  Members of this House have a significant mandate from the people, for the second time in this Seanad's term, and we should discuss and seek the changes that are necessary in the interests of our citizens.</p></speech>

Will the Leader bring motion No. 8 on the Order Paper, tabled by myself and Senator Bradford, to the attention of the Taoiseach so it could also form part of his reflections?  It proposes that we have proposals from Members on all sides of the House, that we would have a set of agreed proposals for reform by 20 February 2014 and that a committee be established to achieve that and to reflect the membership of this House.

It was an historic, constitutional occasion.  Everybody in the House, acting not only as part of an institution but as individuals, should have learned something from the debate, be it good or bad.  It was good for the future of the institution, although the outcome was probably unexpected.  Many citizens may have forgotten that since 1 January 1938 the imprint of every piece of legislation passed into law has had the involvement of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, but many are slow to forget this.  Perhaps the Leader or somebody else might enlighten me.  I hear the argument that 60% of the electorate did not turn up.  I have been involved in politics for a long time, ever since I was a child.  I have never seen more than 70%, on average, turn out to vote.  The average is in the high 50s and low 60s.  From my research, it appears the turnout in this referendum is in the top six for referendums held in the past 20 years.  These things puzzle me.  Perhaps the Leader has some answers, but I thought it was a substantial turnout.  The citizens had their say and gave their verdict, which was positive for this institution.  I respect this.</p><p>I thank the Leader for his indulgence.  It is an unusual and historic day for this establishment.  I apologise for allowing everybody in, but there will be no vote on the Order of Business and I took the liberty to try to give everybody his or her say on the day that was in it.</p></speech>

I do not wish to reply to all of the comments made on the Seanad referendum and the issue of political reform because we will have another opportunity to do so later today.  I am sure we will have a comprehensive debate, not only on the issue of Seanad reform but also on political reform in general.</p><p>Senator Ivana Bacik raised the issue of Priory Hall, as did other Members.  I hope that matter will be resolved amicably in the coming days.  </p><p>Senator Katherine Zappone referred to the issue of legislative change being required for reform.  I agree with her that there is no appetite among the public for another referendum on the issue of how individuals should be elected to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  Therefore, we must deal with that matter through legislative change.  </p><p>Senator David Norris called for a permanent electoral commission.  I will bring that matter to the attention of the Government.  I note the Senator's points on the ballot papers.  Many pointed out that the ballot papers for the referendums were less than clear and this matter will have to be addressed in future ballots.</p> <p> Senators Paul Coghlan, Mark Daly, Marc MacSharry and others referred to EU directives.  I am firmly of the view that this House should be involved in the scrutiny of EU directives, but there are very few due to be transposed into Irish law before the end of the year.  We have already had two debates on different directives - the first, on a health directive, in which four Members spoke, and the second, a directive on child exploitation, in which 12 people spoke.  If anybody wishes to bring forward further suggestions for debate on directives, I will certainly facilitate that.  I agree that scrutiny of EU legislation is an area in which this House should have a greater involvement.</p><p> Senator Paul Coghlan and others referred to the importance of ensuring the new court of appeal is established as a matter of urgency.</p><p> Senators Aideen Hayden, Jillian van Turnhout and Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh raised the issue of direct provision for asylum seekers, with reference to a report in <i>The Irish Times</i>today.  That report shows that the inspection regime put in place by the Reception and Integration Agency, under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality, is working.  Identifying problems and having them fixed is the purpose of a good inspection regime.  Maintenance issues are an ongoing fact of life and are dealt with on a comprehensive basis by that body.  I hope to have the Minister in the House in early course for a debate on the issue.  I had asked that he come in on Thursday, but he indicated that he is unavailable.  I assure Senators that I will ask him to come to the House soon to address the matters they have raised.</p><p> Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell sought details regarding the sale of the national lottery franchise.  She might table the issue for discussion with the Minister on the Adjournment.</p><p> Senators Colm Burke, Marc MacSharry and John Crown referred to the need to resolve the dispute between junior doctors and the Health Service Executive at the earliest possible date.  All Members would share that wish.</p><p> Senators John Crown and John Whelan referred to the 1979 referendum on Seanad reform, in respect of which no legislation has ever been implemented.  I hope a motion will be put to the House urging the Government to implement the provisions of that referendum as soon as possible.</p><p> Senator David Cullinane referred to job creation.  As I said, the Government's focus in the forthcoming budget and in general is on jobs and job creation.  Senator Cullinane expressed his regret at the loss of 70 jobs in my home city.  However, Honeywell has offered assurances regarding its continued confidence in Waterford, where 300 people remain employed.</p><p> Senator Catherine Noone raised the issue of submissions to the Minister for Finance on the sugar tax.  I am sure he has received those submissions, but we will have to wait until next week to see whether he acts on them.  The Senator welcomed the measures being taken by the European Union to tackle the abuse of tobacco.  This initiative was led by the Government and, as I am sure everybody will accept, represents a win for all the people of Europe in terms of taking on the tobacco industry.</p><p> Senator Ned O'Sullivan referred to political reform, which I have already covered.  He and Senator John Gilroy reminded the House that this is nurses week.  We all agree with their comments lauding the important work of nurses and midwives.</p><p> Senator Jillian van Turnhout raised the Health Information and Quality Authority report on a facility in Monaghan.</p> <p>I understand a decision has been taken by HIQA to close the unit by the end of October.  There are currently two young people residing in the unit and the HSE is finding suitable alternative placements for them.  All managers and staff of the unit will be redeployed.</p><p>Senator Mark Daly mentioned EU directives.  With regard to pyrite legislation, I will find out for Senator Byrne the current status of the Bill.</p><p>With regard to the point raised by Senator Landy, we will have the local government Bill in the House in the next couple of weeks.  I also note the Senator's point about medical cards, a matter I will bring to the attention of the Minister for Health.  Compared to when the Government took office, 250,000 more people are eligible for free GP care, a point that should be highlighted.</p><p>Most of the other points concern reform of the House and reform of the body politic.  Senator Mary White raised her Bill concerning mandatory retirement, a point that will be addressed again in the House.  With regard to the point made by Senator Healy Eames, I will listen to any proposals for reform of the House from any quarter and I will bring these matters to the attention of the Government.  Senator Heffernan commented on the role of Sinn F&eacute;in in the campaign.  I will leave it at that, a Chathaoirligh.</p></speech>

This important motion has come about as a result of the demise of rural towns across the country, particularly the centres of rural towns.  Some 90,000 people own and are employed in independent family shops in this country.  They generate &euro;3.5 billion annually.  The broader retail sector employs 250,000 people, amounting to 14.5% of the workforce.</p> <p>The contribution of the retail sector to GDP is 10% per annum.  It is interesting to note that 86% of retailers employ fewer than ten employees.  In the period since the recession began, 47,000 jobs have been lost in the retail sector, which equates to a drop of 30% since 2008.  In my home town of Carrick-on-Suir, 24% of retail units in the town centre are currently vacant.  A similar situation exists in Clonmel, Cashel, Cahir and many other towns across the country.  A number of factors are causing difficulties, the most obvious being the slowdown in the economy.  Car parking in town centres is a problem, and shoppers are choosing to shop in shopping centres.  The cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick have 17,800 free car parking spaces available to shoppers.  Shoppers in small towns in rural Ireland have remained faithful to town centre shops and businesses in small towns have fought back.  For example, the local traders in my own town of Carrick-on-Suir have reached agreement with the town council to allow 15 minutes' free car parking in the centre of the town in order to help trade.  The local business association has organised "golden oldie" shopping days, among other initiatives.  However, a national response to this problem is required, such as guidance from the Government on the issue of car parking in towns.  Retailers should be enabled to issue tickets to shoppers to provide more shopping time.</p><p>Urban renewal in town centres needs to be considered.  The original urban renewal scheme was introduced in 1986 and lasted until 2008.  Strange to say, it was availed of through all the Celtic tiger years and abandoned in 2008, when it was needed most.  A new scheme that takes into account the lessons learned from the old scheme must be established.  The previous scheme concentrated too much on providing tax derogations rather than dealing with social issues, as was the case with the first renewal scheme.  Run-down areas need to be improved and tax derogation must be linked to the provision of jobs.  The question of upward-only rent review must be tackled, a topic which was debated in the House last week.  I was accused of being absent for the debate, but I was paired that day.  The business districts improvement scheme needs to be enhanced and supported at national level.  It has been adopted by only two local authorities, Dublin and Dundalk, but there is great merit in the scheme, which can provide a clean and safe environment for shoppers.</p><p>I refer to another initiative in the response by retailers across the country.  Pop-up shops have arrived on the scene, many of them in Dublin.  I note there was a Glenisk yogurt company pop-up shop across the road at the corner of Molesworth Street for a couple of months.  These shops have fantastic potential but they require planning permission in order for the entrepreneur to access finance from enterprise boards and from the Leader programme.</p> <p>We need to give statutory authority to these initiatives.</p><p>There is also the matter of safety in town centres.  There has been some great work in the provision of closed-circuit television, CCTV, in town centres, with &euro;4 million invested to date.  None the less, many more towns need these systems.  Despite our economic woes, many town councils have surplus budgets and run in the black, so before the Government proceeds to abolish town councils after the elections in May next year, those authorities should be allowed to use some of that money to carry out improvements that are badly needed to kick-start retailing.</p><p>Development levies form another major issue.  During the boom - between 2000 and 2006 - &euro;2.1 billion in levies were collected, while in the last number of years the same method of collecting money has been, to say the least, unsuccessful.  Currently, &euro;750 million is owed to local authorities across the country, so it is clear not only that new businesses cannot start because of development levies but also that those that have started are unable to pay them.  What should we do?  I suggest we give all new businesses, particularly in the retail sector, an exemption from development levies for two years, and if the business continues trading, payments can be phased in over five years.  This will give a chance to new businesses to kick-start rural towns by helping to generate employment.</p><p>Rates are currently crippling retail outlets throughout the country and there must be some change in the current system, which is archaic.  There should be a link between the rates and the turnover and profit of a business.  There should be a requirement to maintain the front of vacant business premises at an acceptable level if there is to be a rates holiday when a premises is unoccupied.  In small town centres in rural Ireland, vacant premises are becoming dishevelled and run down, lowering the atmosphere and ambience of town centres.  The owners of certain businesses do not have to pay rates but I ask the Minister to ensure they keep the premises maintained.</p><p>The town councils with surplus cash should be allowed to use it to incentivise new retail business in the local authority areas between now and May of next year.  In other words, that provision should be made in the 2014 budget.  I ask the Minister to set up a national task force on town centre retailing, amounting to a body representing all the various interest groups.  It should only sit for 12 weeks but it should bring forward recommendations to be implemented by the Minister.  If that alone is accomplished, the sector can be helped.</p></speech>

I know these are not necessarily financial matters being directly dealt with by the Minister, but there are budgetary implications in some regards.  I am also grateful that the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, has made herself available to the Seanad this week as she has always been one of the more positive, progressive and receptive Ministers of State.</p> <p>I have always found that any time we raise issues with her, we get feedback.  She goes back to her Department with our suggestions and, therefore, they are not falling on deaf ears, which is important because we need the influence and support of Ministers to carry on our work in an effective fashion.</p><p>Senator Landy has done a great deal of work and research preparing for this debate.  The motion has not been tabled on a whim.  He has put forward a structured set of suggestions and proposals.  I second his worthy proposal to call on the Minister to initiate a task force following next week's budget that would sit in a short, sharp shock type of way to bring forward proposals that would have an immediate effect as we approach the winter, Christmas and spring to help to rejuvenate and support main street, Ireland, which is, unfortunately, on its knees.</p><p>I would like to be positive and constructive but family businesses and small retailers throughout the country are at the end of their tether and hanging on by their fingernails.  They are often working without a wage out of pride and dignity and respect for a business that was perhaps passed on from one generation to the next.  While the work the Government is doing on job creation is good and reaping dividends, particularly among multinationals through foreign direct investment, it cannot turn its back on town centres and the abject dereliction that is sweeping through main streets everywhere in the State.  I refer to towns such as Mountmellick, Portlaoise, Portarlington, Abbeyleix, Durrow, Mountrath and Rathdowney in my community.  I am certain there is a profound commitment to business and voluntary endeavour outside of business among people there.</p><p>Businesses in town centres are coming together and pooling their resources and ideas to put their best foot forward.  Mountmellick Business Association was reorganised and revitalised only in the past fortnight under the chairmanship of a young man in his 20s, Mr. Tom Horan, and Ms Edel Watchorne.  A colleague of mine, Lisa Delaney, is also actively involved.  An organisation, Downtown Portlaoise, has launched an initiative to promote the town centre in Portlaoise.  However, these organisations are up against multinationals and policies that have been in place over the past 20 and 30 years that have been biased in favour of multiples and multinationals.  I recall when working as a journalist in Portlaoise in the 1980s the introduction of urban renewal schemes that designated fields on the outskirts of the town to the neglect of the town centre.  Four of my uncles worked in Kelly's Foundry, whose emblem is on hay sheds the length and breadth of Ireland.  When the foundry closed, it lay derelict in the middle of town.  The then Government designated a field on the edge of town for development, which tore the entire heart out of the town.  The town centre continues to struggle because it is at a severe disadvantage.  The supermarket multiples received tax incentives, did not have to pay rates and were able to provide parking facilities that small businesses on the main street could not cope with.</p><p>It is up to us and the Government to rectify that imbalance.  The Government will not generate rates from derelict sites or from businesses once the shutters are pulled down.  We must stop the decline now.  The Government parties have been engaged in a fire fighting exercise to try to put the country back on its feet and I commend them for that.  Every Minister has worked hard in this regard but we must make sure that we do not lose more small family businesses.  The Gathering was a huge success and tourism remains at the heart of Government policy on economic growth.</p> <p>One will not get too many tourists into the country to visit Tesco, Lidl and Aldi.  People do not come to see supermarkets.  I welcome consumer choice and competition but not at the expense of small family businesses, boutiques, artisan butchers and bakers among others.  There is an opportunity for us to help organisations that are on the ground that are ready and willing to take up the opportunity.  If we needed any incentive to do so, the 9% VAT regime is an example in itself of how when Government came forward with an incentive, businesses matched it and created real jobs that took people off the dole.  The shops, retailers and small businesses to which Senator Landy referred would all take on one more staff member each if we met them even half way in terms of free parking and affordable rates.  That would take tens of thousands off social welfare in the morning and it would be cost effective and cost neutral.  We call on the Minister to take this message from the Seanad to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to feed into the budgetary process and support the ideas we put forward.</p></speech>

I compliment the Labour Party Senators who tabled the motion which is not only timely, it is overdue.  To some extent we are not getting to grips with a difficulty that is so great and will get worse.  If we think the economy is bad now, that the job situation is bad and that we have too much emigration, it is by looking at towns that we will realise where the real problem lies.  When we debated county enterprise boards last week, a statistic was presented that 98.5% of all firms are small firms and they create 650,000 jobs.  One finds such small firms in the main in small towns around the country.</p><p>Some years ago we argued that rural Ireland was the poor relation when it came to economic policies.  It is not an exaggeration to say that we must closely examine towns because they now face some of the problems in a different way that rural areas faced in the past.  We can point to specific reasons we find ourselves where we are at present.  Logic does not form part of the equation.  When one goes to a supermarket one sees small units closed due to rent increases.  From an economic point of view one could ask what is the sense in having the units closed if that is where the problem lies.  The same problem lies with small businesses in towns.  The commercial rates paid by retailers account for 28% of the income of local authorities.</p><p>One of the reasons people cannot keep going is due to overheads.  I refer to commercial rates, insurance, maintenance, hidden charges and paying staff.  I can never forget my very good friend who was a small business person who worked diligently and set up a particular brand.  He fell behind in his payments.  One day he was visited by the Revenue Commissioners and when they left he took his own life.  That particular person was the salt of the earth.  There is something radically wrong with life when that happens.</p> <p>I do not know whether people observed what was happening.  I am not blaming the Office of the Revenue Commissioners; I am blaming no one.  However, the set of circumstances I describe is being replicated weekly.  People can no longer take the pressure.  That is why it is important that this motion is before the House.  It is pertinent to why we are here also.  It is important that whatever we say today does not just disappear into the ether.  What we are trying to do is to be helpful.  None of us will have all the answers; it is as simple as that.  The main point is that we all have experiences, and those experiences must be kept in mind.</p><p>Let me outline some of the reasons the towns are suffering, bearing in mind what is coming down the line.  Even in this crisis, we need leadership teams in towns.  People with particular expertise and interests need to work in a united way for the revitalisation of their towns.  The only statutory voice available to the towns is that of the local councils, yet they are to be abolished.  My home town, Cashel, which has a population of 3,000, has had a council - a legislature - since the 13th century, yet we are going to get rid of it.  Where does that leave tourism?  How does it affect representation when seeking industry?  It makes no sense whatsoever.  I am certain that when the town councils are abolished and we ask whether our having abolished them has saved money, we will conclude it has not.  It will certainly have weakened the structure and leadership in the towns.  It will certainly have taken away a combined responsible response to the problems we face.</p><p>The cost of parking in towns has got out of hand.  One now needs &euro;4, &euro;5 or &euro;6 to park.  If one must return to the town twice in a day to do one's shopping, it is a problem.  Something should be done for people who are returning.</p><p>There is a lot to be said for a major national campaign.  I suggest a national market day, a single day to focus on the towns.  It should involve both economics and culture so people will feel comfortable coming into the towns.  It should be a matter of increasing the footfall in towns through theatre, culture, sport or otherwise.  If we had a single focus nationally, it would be particularly important.</p><p>I would love to believe that we might return to this subject in the very near future, as there are so many issues that need to be addressed.  If, as part of our consultative process, we could invite to this Chamber, rather than a hidden room, a group of people to outline the issues confronting them and their considerable problems, it would be beneficial.  If all people concerned throughout the country - not just those in towns - do not tackle the problem, it will become irredeemable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-10-08a.137" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1135" speakername="Ca&iacute;t Keane" time="17:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013100800026#Z00200"><p>I welcome the Minister.  This is a very worthwhile debate.  Without people, a town dies.  Without footfall, business dies and everything that goes with it, including communities.  It is most important to ensure that every town has a community, because people comprise communities.  We have had many policy documents over the years seeking to encourage more sustainable urban development.  Residential density guidelines were issued in 1999 and there is a national spatial strategy.  The NESC housing report was issued in 2004, Sustainable Rural Housing was published in 2005, and Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities was published in 2007.  All of these reports expressed a commitment to promoting development and the renewal of towns, including small towns and villages.</p> <p>Whatever about the commitment of various governments, we have failed in that objective and we need a renewed effort in this regard.  During the boom years, the vast bulk of housing construction was in the form of suburban housing estates or one-off housing in the countryside.  There are very few examples of new housing development at the edges of villages and in small towns.  Good-quality developments in town centres and over-shop developments were not commonplace.  What we need are developments whose scale and layout fit well with the existing towns and villages and which present a high-quality living environment to attract people back to small towns and villages, thus supporting local communities and businesses.  We must also provide more support for public transport and reduce dependency on cars.  Planning authorities have an obligation to make the centres of towns and villages attractive and affordable for people who wish to set up businesses.  </p><p> The architect Paul Keogh argued that we have not seen many examples of sustainable development.  He wrote in an article:  <blockquote>On the contrary, weak planning, suburban social values and an uncontrolled market during the boom years conspired to facilitate an overwhelming predominance of low-density greenfield development outside of - and often remote from - existing urban centres.  With the exception of tax-driven apartments, social and affordable housing, few family homes have been built in towns and village centres and essential services, retailing and businesses have relocated to the outskirts.  In short, the decline of the inhabited town is in freefall and rural Ireland is becoming overwhelmingly suburban.</blockquote>That statement must be taken seriously.  If we are to manage the projected growth in housing demand, we must review the suburban model and determine what action is required to ensure that we pull back from the sprawling development model and replace it with sustainable development around and within towns.  </p><p> Local authorities can do much to ensure business development and sustainability.  South Dublin County Council, of which I was a member until 2011, developed an action plan with some very good ideas therein.  An analysis was carried out of vacant properties which also examined the relationship between zoning and planning applications.  The aim was to examine each empty property with a view to maximising usage by local people, whether they be artists or other business people.  Local authorities can play a vital role in this context.</p><p> I welcome some of the very innovative ideas that have been put forward to date, particularly relating to the cost of parking in town centres.  The provision of free two-hour parking is welcome, for example.  The Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that under the Road Traffic Act 1994 local authorities have the power to set parking charges.  They can introduce by-laws for parking charges, as was done in south Dublin.  We have seen the introduction of disc parking, differential rates for different parking zones and so forth.  Local authorities can change by-laws in their own areas.  Not every village or town wants the provision of two hours of free parking.  It depends on the size of the village or town, the movement of cars and so forth.  Equally, fully free parking could mean that some people would drive into the centre of towns and villages and then get the bus to work.  Local authorities are best placed to decide what is appropriate for each location.</p><p> A key element of any business development strategy is ensuring access to credit for such businesses.  We have bailed out the banks and we must ensure they provide credit for viable businesses.</p> <p>There are several options for commercial retail premises wishing to avail of urban renewal assistance under the auspices of the Revenue Commissioners, which includes 50% of expenditure on new construction.  Regarding office accommodation in small urban centres, the Government has introduced eligibility for capital allowances.</p><p>The Government has already taken action to counteract the corrosive effects of the recession on towns.  New development contribution guidelines were introduced earlier this year.</p></speech>

From today&rsquo;s report on the number of unoccupied commercial premises across the country, I noted County Donegal has one of the highest rates of vacancy of commercial premises.  The national average is 12% while Letterkenny&rsquo;s rate is 21%.  Will the Minister clarify whether this rate is based on floor space or per unit?  I have two insurance offices in Donegal, one in Raphoe and one in Letterkenny, for the past 25 years.  I have noticed the downturn in small towns and large urban centres across the country in this time.</p><p>As a member of Letterkenny Town Council for 17 years, I recall that this was one of the issues that exercised most town councillors.  How does one revitalise a main street that is dying on its feet?  This is not an issue that is peculiar to Letterkenny, Mountmellick or Tralee.  It is happening in nearly every town, with the main streets ebbing away.  Some measures to tackle this include the use of a more creative way to strike rates.  It has to be remembered that in the past one had to have a physical property to run a business.  If one availed of services provided by the local authority, one had to pay rates.  Now, a person can run a business from his or her kitchen with a laptop or from a car with a mobile phone.  The rates system is based on the shop on the main street, which is being overtaken by the online retailer.  We will have to examine how the rates system is used.  It must be more equalised.</p><p>Last week I met a businessman who reminded me that the Government had promised to examine the issue of upward-only rent reviews.  He understood how we were restrained from dealing with it, but he said he was being screwed - that was the word he used - by his landlord.</p> <p>This man has been in business for 35 years and is a good businessman but these issues are holding him back.  Other retailers in Donegal have gone out of business.  They were good business people, but their banks had told them they should use the profits in their bank accounts to buy four properties in Manchester, four properties in Portugal and six properties in Cork.  As they were doing well, those business people took that advice on board.  Now these businesses have failed not because they were not viable but because of commercial debt.  Sadly, many of the banks here were lending money not to invest in Ireland but in Europe and beyond.  The money went out of the country and disappeared.  We must give such people a break.</p><p>There is no point in saying money is available to small businesses.  While that is very welcome, I speak to small business people every day socially or as Seanad spokesperson on jobs and enterprise, and many say that even if the banks offered them money they would not take it because they do not know what the future holds and how they would service the debt.  They may also have to go through many hoops to get that money.  We must devise a system that brings the high street back to viability.</p><p>There is a role for agencies such as An Post to do this.  An Post opened a second post office in Letterkenny recently after three to five years of grappling with it.  I got a petition going because there was a queue outside the post office.  This destroyed people's mornings because they were standing in the rain.  It was not helping local businesses because people were queueing past a number of shops and people could not get in.  It took An Post three or four years to realise what every dog in the street and every person knew, namely, that there was a need to open a second post office in Letterkenny.  An Post has done it and it has been successful.  It has also helped the area where the second post office opened.  The landlord there says the chemist and butcher are doing better and there is another shop opening.  State agencies have a role to play, but have been reluctant to engage with the chambers of commerce and ordinary business people.</p><p>I know from personal experience the difficulties of small businesses.  We must make a plan that gives people hope and ensure that small businesses starting up are not laden down with massive rents or overheads, and get them started again.  The family business is the last to give up.  The husband and wife with a family will fight to the last to save their business, and will be the last people in the business if it fails.  They will be there and do everything to keep it going and we must support them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-10-08a.151" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1169" speakername="Mary Ann O'Brien" time="17:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013100800029#CC00200"><p>I thank the Minister for coming here to listen to us.  Earlier, Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; mentioned 98.5% of our businesses are small businesses with 650,000 people employed by them.  Surely that is enough to focus our minds.  When America gets a cold, we usually get the flu.  All of us have been lucky enough to travel and look at the United States for years.  The Minister has seen what the advent of the wonderful business, Walmart, has done to the United States.  It is very hard to go into any town in the United States and not notice that the town centre no longer exists.  I have visited Dallas, and downtown Dallas no longer exists.  It is just a sprawl of little shopping malls with no soul or life.</p><p>I am trying to avoid repeating what other Senators have said today and to come up with some ideas.  Senator Quinn was involved with one idea, and I wonder if we should ask Linked Finance to come to the Oireachtas audio-visual room and speak to as many Senators and Deputies as we can get.  Linked Finance is a crowd-funding initiative.  At the second Global Irish Economic Forum, former US President Bill Clinton was the first person I ever heard make a very passionate speech on crowd funding, and he asked our Taoiseach to ask us all to examine crowd funding.</p> <p> We can speak all day about the ruination of towns and speak about free parking.  Perhaps as a knee-jerk reaction we should consider having parking charges at the big centres outside towns and free parking inside towns.  I listened to Senator C&aacute;it Keane state every town is different.  I spend much time in the medieval city of Kilkenny.  It has just managed to retain its vitality and everybody wants to go there.  Thomastown is a small village not far from Kilkenny and has managed to retain much of its vitality, although a few multiples have appeared on the outside.  We must consider what lessons we can learn from this.</p><p>To return to crowd funding, LinkedFinance, the crowd funding initiative established by Senator Feargal Quinn, Kingsley Aikins and Bobby Kerr, has created 50 jobs and hopes to fund 200 small businesses by the end of the year.  It has funded a butcher, a baker and a candlestick maker.  How cute this sounds, but it is the truth.  The butcher was funded locally by 400 fans and customers.  A small amount of money went in, but all of the people concerned feel they have a part of the business.  The butcher has their e-mail addresses and is able to social network with them and send them special offers.  They feel they are part of the business.</p><p>A total of &euro;1 million has been raised by the crowd funding company.  A similar crowd funding company in England which has a population of 60 million people has raised &pound;100 million for small businesses which are owned by local people.  Instead of rushing into the large multiple which has wonderful offers and great powers of advertising, if one feels one is part of the butcher or local community, or one has sponsored a business, of course, one will take the time to go there.  I will contact LinkedFinance to find out more about it and how we can bring this expertise to counties Donegal, Tipperary, Kildare, Kilkenny and other areas.</p><p>In Killarney a large international multiple has established a beautiful petrol station beside its big store and offered lower prices.  As we are all in desperate times, people fill their cars at this new petrol station.  All of the other petrol stations in lovely Killarney are now closed.  We cannot allow this to happen.  There is free trade - I am not sure how we can stop it - but this is not the way to go.  I will balance this with something positive.  A German multiple in a County Cork town has successfully sought planning permission to build a scout hall in the town and 120 scouts are over the moon and delighted.  It is not always the case that the big guy is bad.  We should examine linking local authorities with the big boys, supporting small businesses with crowd funding and linking with local authorities to sort out the issue of parking.  Why would one not go to the lovely big centre outside town where one can park one's car and walk across the free car park to do one's shopping?  I will admit one's soul would not be nourished.  It is hard to find parking in town and if one has no change, it is all a disaster.  One then gets a ticket and feels completely fed up.  We must stop this.  Senator must stop talking.  Senator loves small business.  Senator feels the centre of town is the life and soul of this small country of ours.  The United States showed us the wrong way; then it happened in England and now it is happening to us.  Let us examine the issues of crowd funding and car parking, but more than this, let us get all of our colleagues together to help move forward and use initiative.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-10-08a.153" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1061" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="17:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013100800030#DD00200"><p>I thank Senator Denis Landy and his Labour Party colleagues for giving us the opportunity to have this debate.  I have heard many bright ideas which I will certainly consider with my colleagues in government.</p> <p>As I will be staying for the rest of the debate, I look forward to others that will be brought forward.</p><p>We are all very much aware of the negative effect of money being sucked out of the economy because of the recession, whether it be through unemployment, emigration, lower incomes or otherwise.  This has had a negative impact right across our society but particularly so in the decline of business activity in our city centres, rural towns and villages.  Many shops and businesses, both new and even some which have been in operation for decades or generations, have not been able to survive the downturn in economic activity, resulting in increasing numbers of shop closures and vacant units in town centres.</p><p>I know this a source of great concern for all of us in our local areas and across the country.  The retail sector, combined with the wholesale sector, plays a very important part in the domestic economy, representing over 15% of the workforce.  However, over 48,000 jobs were lost in the retail and wholesale sectors in the period from the first quarter of 2008 to the first quarter of 2012 and while the volume of retail sales has shown some marginal increases in recent quarters, consumer confidence remains low.  Senator Jimmy Harte has made the point that people are afraid to spend and afraid to borrow.  Certainly, the level of consumer confidence is a real concern and many retail outlets remain vulnerable.  In addition to the impact of the recession, upward-only rents, parking charges, commercial rates, rising energy costs and online trading, an issue referred to by some Senators, are all factors which are threatening the viability of small and medium-sized businesses in the retail sector and threatening the fabric of urban centres.</p><p>The Private Members' motion put before us by the Labour Party Senators deals with an important issue and clearly reflects the difficult circumstances faced by retail outlets and small and medium-sized businesses in towns throughout the country.  There is no one simple solution or panacea to the situation faced.  An integrated cross-sectoral approach is required, but this must also be combined with proactive action by the retail sector and individual businesses within it.  The vitality and viability of town centres are central to our policy in government.  We recognise the vital role towns play in the social, cultural and economic life of communities around Ireland.  We have all seen the effects of urban sprawl and poorly planned out-of-town retail developments, as referred to by Senators Mary Ann O'Brien and John Whelan.  Families all over Ireland are paying for these mistakes through more expensive infrastructure, longer journeys and congestion.  Vibrant town centres also contribute to social inclusion and are better suited to multipurpose trips.  They provide for greater diversity of uses and create more interesting spaces where people can interact and do business.</p><p>We have done a lot within my area of responsibility.  As I said, I will certainly consider the suggestions made both in the motion and the contributions I have heard.  However, I would like to outline some the things we have done.  New development contribution guidelines were introduced earlier this year directing planning authorities to put in place reduced development contributions or waivers to support town centre development.  I am encouraging local authorities to do this because it is a practical measure we can take to encourage development in town centres.  New guidelines on retail planning are aimed at promoting and supporting the vitality and viability of city and town centres, ensuring the planning system plays a key role in ensuring competitiveness in the retail sector and advancing choice for the consumer.  In retaining the previous caps on store size in less populated and smaller towns, the retail planning guidelines strike the right balance by ensuring local monopolies are not created in smaller locations, which would be detrimental to competition.</p><p>Local authorities have been asked to exercise restraint or, where possible, reduce commercial rates and local charges to assist local businesses in the current economic climate.  The response to this request has been positive, with, for example, 87 out of 88 rating authorities either reducing their annual rateable valuation or keeping it at the same level as in 2012.  This follows similar trends in commercial local authority rates charges in both 2010 and 2011.</p><p>Retail outlets can also help themselves to survive the current difficulties by coming together and adopting innovative proactive initiatives.  In this regard, there is scope for the business community to utilise the business improvement districts scheme, BIDS, which is mentioned in the motion and was also mentioned by Senator Denis Landy, to a greater extent than has been the case up to now.</p> <p>A fundamental feature of  BID schemes - which is governed by legislation sponsored by my Department - is that it is the local business community, rather than central or local government, which is the sponsoring party for such schemes with the funds collected from local businesses being used to pay for the services and improvements to be carried out in the local area.<br />In terms of Government action other than by my Department in providing assistance to retail businesses, a number of measures have been introduced since 2011 including the following: the introduction of the 9% rate of VAT on certain goods and services; the halving of the lower rate of employers' PRSI; the introduction of the microenterprise loan scheme and credit guarantee scheme, both schemes have had take-up from the retail sector; and the extension of seed capital and the employment and investment incentive scheme to the retail sector.</p><p> Recognising the importance of the retail sector to the economy, the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 contains a number of specific measures aimed at supporting the sector.  These include: an initiative to increase the number of small businesses trading online; an initiative to streamline business licence application procedures; and the establishment of an interdepartmental group to identify possible further actions that could be taken to support the maintenance and creation of jobs in the sector.  This interdepartmental group has already been established and is mandated to submit a report encompassing various recommendations and actions before the end of the year.  Perhaps the idea of the task force as suggested by Senators Denis Landy and John Whelan could be looked at in conjunction with that group.</p><p> In addition, the Government has strengthened the Credit Review Office to deal with problems in getting access to finance, and has begun the process of integrating business supports into a stronger local enterprise office network to support micro and small businesses.  The introduction of the JobsPlus scheme from the beginning of July should also be of benefit to employers in the retail sector.  While some of the measures proposed in the motion are already being implemented to a certain degree at local level - for example, pop-up shops are promoted in some local authority areas and councils contributing to the painting and regeneration of shop front facades to improve the appearance of town centres - it is not possible to properly assess the contribution which some of the other measures proposed would make to addressing the problems faced without subjecting them to detailed examination and cost-benefit analysis.  Clearly some of them are the responsibility of the Department of Finance.  We can examine them into the future but we did not have time to do all of that work before addressing the motion. </p><p> The introduction of a first-hour free parking scheme might have negative revenue consequences for local authorities who would have to find the money for services elsewhere in an already constrained council funding environment.  I am aware that a number of councils have used the initiative in respect of parking.  However, within the commitments given in the programme for Government, both I and the Government are supportive of further consideration being given to some of the proposals in the motion before the House.</p><p> Members can also be assured that I and the Government are fully supportive of the need for local authorities, within the context of their own economic and development planning processes and the Action Plan on Jobs, to actively promote measures to stimulate and support local investment and associated job protection and creation.  Relevant Departments and national agencies also have a role in ensuring that the necessary legislative, policy and financial supports are available to local authorities in this regard.</p><p> My Department in its on-going interaction with local authorities in the context of development planning and the enhanced role envisaged for them under the programme for local government reform, Putting People First,<i></i>will continue to be as supportive as possible of the development of innovative approaches to economic stimulation and associated job creation in local communities.</p><p> There is one last thing that was not included in the motion but might greatly add to the overall vitality of towns.  I refer to the quest to see more people returning to live in towns either living over the shop or in buildings that no longer have a commercial use.  There is a great wealth of untapped uses in our towns that we, in central and local government, need to explore further.  For example, vacant dwellings could be used by artists and is an initiative that has worked well in my local authority, in Galway and some other areas. </p><p> I recognise in the motion the appreciation for the Irish town as the heart of a wider community.  There is much to celebrate in the built form, the architecture, the civic life and the history that breathes life into our urban centres and makes them more than just centres of commerce.  However, commerce is the lifeblood that makes the urban heart beat.  I realise that the economic difficulty of recent years has placed a strain on businesses in urban centres.  While many initiatives and measures have been introduced I assure the Senators that we will continue to explore all options for further action, including the proposals outlined in the motion.  I am determined that we will do all that we can to ensure that our towns are able to function to their full potential in order that they can be centres of our social, cultural and economic life.  I look forward to the rest of the debate.</p></speech>

All of us here, on both sides of the Chamber, are very pleased that the people voted "No" to the abolition of the Seanad.</p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il supports the excellent motion in the names of Senators Denis Landy and John Whelan which is at the core of many of our problems.  I thank them for tabling the motion.  Deputy Barry Cowen produced a Fianna F&aacute;il policy paper on the revitalisation of Irish towns.  He was assisted in this work by a great young man, a town planner, who works in the Fianna F&aacute;il research office, Mr. Kevin Dillon, who understands that planning issues are at the core of this subject.   </p><p>I have taken an initiative on retailing in Ireland.  The sector employs approximately 250,000 people.  As the Minister of State has said, more than 40,000 people have already lost their jobs in the retail sector.  Each job lost in the region leads to suffering by the families and children.  I am organising a conference entitled Revitalising Retailing in Dundrum Town Centre at 11.30 a.m. on Thursday, 12 December 2013.  It is open to all retailers in the city and around the country.  This event will be co-hosted by Mr. Don Nugent, director of Dundrum Town Centre.  I disagree with Senator John Whelan who spoke in a derogatory way about the large multiples because they employ people.  </p></speech>

That there should be houses everywhere is boring.  For example, in Mount Merrion, Dublin South, a lovely range of small shops is available to the people.  At my conference, independent shopkeepers will be invited to speak as well as individuals from larger stores.  Retailers will talk to retailers and people who may wish to start up in the business.  The challenge to retailing which will not go away is the relentless change in technology, including online shopping and every aspect of technology is introduced into retailing.  It is a very serious issue for the retail industry.</p><p>I am saddened at the closure of many small shops around the country due to a lack of consumer spending, high rates and high rents.  In Britain, there have been a number of reports on the whole issue.  It is facing up to the problem and doing something about it and is more advanced than us.  We have allowed the problem of dying town centres to continue.  It is beyond belief that nothing has been done about it.  In her contribution, the Minister of State mentioned the quest to see more people living over the shop.  There is a need to look at the changing facilities available in the town centres.</p> <p>The town centres must innovate.</p><p>It is very wrong of the Government to introduce legislation to abolish the town councils.  A total of 300 town councillors lost their jobs.  The town councils are being abolished when we need them more than ever.  If the abolition of town councils was put to the people, does the Minister believe all the people who live in the towns around Ireland would say &quot;Yes&quot;?  They would not.</p></speech>

I am on the same wavelength as my two colleagues and totally support them, but I see the other side as well because the large multiples provide jobs.  Tesco, alone, employs approximately 15,000 people.</p><p>Every town council or local authority should have a plan in place every five years for the development of the town centre, and each year it should refer to that plan and see if it is working.  It should assess the plan and how it is proceeding.  There is a deluge of life away from the towns, such as those mentioned by Senator Whelan.</p></speech>

I also compliment my two colleagues, Senators Landy and Whelan.  This subject has been close to my heart for years and I agree with everything they and many other Senators said on the matter.  I acknowledge the good work Senator Mary Ann O'Brien has done on this subject in the past.</p><p>It is good to know that Members on both sides of the House are all agreed on this.  However, the shocking situation, as outlined by Senator Landy, is that we have seen the demise of many town centres throughout the country.  Senator Landy referred to Carrick-on-Suir, Cashel and Cahir, Senator Whelan spoke about Portlaoise, Mountmellick and Durrow, while Senator Harte talked about Letterkenny and other towns.  Regardless of the county, town centres were hit very badly everywhere.  I will not talk about my own county, but Kerry was equally badly hit.</p><p>Senator White praised the large multiples and recognised that they might have done some good.  I would not dare to do that.  Senator Landy spoke about the 47,000 jobs that have been lost in small businesses in town centres throughout the country since the recession started.  There is no way that the multiples, in the number they employ, made up for the 47,000 jobs that were lost.  The vitality and vibrancy of town centres are a core part of policy, but it is a pity it was not there when county managers and officials were riding roughshod over towns and allowed the construction of out-of-town centres.  They contributed in many instances to the demolition of town centres.  Some councillors, perhaps in all the parties but principally in the party opposite, were often bullies in the way they got in league with managers to allow a developer to do whatever he wished.  Some of those developers would have been better off if they had been curbed, because they are in the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, today.  They have wreaked havoc on town centres all over the country.</p><p>I welcome the free car parking initiative introduced by some authorities in some large towns.  However, we must provide a level playing pitch in respect of in-town and out-of-town parking.  I do not have the answer and I realise the matter is being considered in the Department.  The Minister spoke about the loss to some local authorities in town centres, but perhaps they could impose a charge for the damage that grinding wheels delivering to these out-of-town centres do to the roads in and out of them.  Some mechanism must be found to level that playing pitch.</p><p>Senator Landy also mentioned the urban renewal scheme.  The last one, in fairness, did some good.  It dealt with urban degeneration in the hearts of towns.  Okay, it involved tax breaks and so forth but it was taken up and there are some lovely places.  Sadly, however, many of the shop units that were developed in the town centres are vacant today.  Perhaps it is time to consider a new type of scheme.  As Senator Landy said, it need not be all about tax relief, although it might be impossible to have one without some type of tax break.  Perhaps there could be a rates moratorium for new businesses in small towns, as mentioned by Senator Landy, or rates could be linked to turnover and profitability.  I agree with him that where town councils have the cash they can make improvements before they are, and if they are, absorbed into county councils.  Personally, I had hoped that the councils of towns with populations above 10,000 would survive.  Initially, I believed that would happen, but it has evolved since then.  Anyway, we have not yet seen that legislation so we will await it.</p><p>CCTV in town centres has been good and we need more of it.  I am on a policing board in my home town and we could do with more such initiatives to curb some of the things that happen late at night at weekends, unfortunately.  I welcome what Senator Landy has proposed with regard to a national task force for town centres.  The Minister is prepared to consider that further within the Department.</p><p>I do not wish to labour the point but we must continue to monitor this issue.  Hopefully, we and the Minister can do more about it.  However, I very much welcome the fact that national policy now has regard primarily to the vitality and vibrancy of town centres.  If managers, officials and councillors had that in mind in the past, many of our towns would not now be in the current sad mess.</p></speech>

It involves a number of different areas of responsibility and, as the Minister said, local authorities bear some of the responsibility for some of the measures being proposed.  I commend my colleagues, Senators Landy and Whelan, on proposing this motion and I apologise for being unable to stay in the House for all of the debate.</p><p>This is a very important motion.  The issue of urban renewal is close to my heart given that I live in Dublin's south inner city.  It is something that concerns all of us, whether we live in cities or small or large towns.  There is a serious concern about the need for urban renewal.  Other colleagues have spoken eloquently about the problems in city and town centres, including vacant properties and the closure of retail outlets.  The motion seeks to be constructive.  It refers to some of the positive initiatives that have been taken and asks the Department to support those in any way it can.  I am conscious that other authorities and Departments bear some responsibility.  Obviously, tax incentives are a matter for the Department of Finance.</p><p>To speak constructively on some of the matters that have been proposed, Senator Landy calls for a national task force.  The Minister is supportive of that idea.  She is correct to point out that there is a need for a cross-sectoral approach to examining something as broad as urban renewal.</p> <p>An integrated cross-sectoral approach is required, in combination with proactive action by the retail sector and individual businesses.  It is important to note the initiatives being taken.  The motion mentions business improvement districts and the purple flag initiative -  which we spoke about during a prior motion in this House on the subject - whereby town and city centre districts get together to seek the equivalent of a blue flag for beaches to show their district is a safe one, where people can feel safe at night, safe entertainment is offered, crime prevention initiatives are in place and people are being attracted there.</p><p>In Dublin and around the country there have been initiatives such as the open house event started by the Architecture Foundation, a private body.  This has been embraced and has spread to other cities.  There was a very successful hosting last weekend.  I went to some of the events and have supported it every year.  It has been a marvellous way of bringing families into city and town centres.  Similarly, culture night, another really successful initiative, is one we might seek to expand beyond a single night a year.  Many European cities have a &quot;white night&quot; once a month when museums and art galleries stay open late into the evening, the idea being to bring families into the city and town centres, which offers a boost for cafes, bars and all sorts of outlets apart from the cultural.  This also opens up city and town spaces, making them more safe.  From the criminological view point, such action has a hugely beneficial impact on crime reduction rates in urban centres.</p><p>The issue of pop-up shops and outlets was raised in the motion.  Perhaps we should have included restaurants and cafes.  A recent very good example of collaboration between Dublin City Council and a private group was the pop-up Granby Park on Dominic Street, a brilliant initiative which transformed a vast empty space that had been derelict and was a magnet for anti-social behaviour.  Through the voluntary work of a group of people in collaboration with Dublin City Council, it was transformed into a great space where lots of people visited, there were music events, speeches, political debates and so on.  Any such initiatives deserve support at any level from both local and national government.</p><p>I was delighted to hear mention of the living-over-the-shop scheme and usage of buildings that have no further commercial use for other purposes.  Other colleagues will have knowledge of other councils.  Dublin City Council has been very good at doing this although perhaps it should be a little more proactive in encouraging people to live in the city centre.  The living-over-the-shop scheme was heralded, rightly, as being a very important and positive scheme but it is quite hard to get information on it and it does not seem to have been rolled out as it should have been at this stage.  There is a need for a more proactive approach to the use of vacant sites and their development, in particular into residential spaces that allow people to move into the city centre and make it more vibrant.  Some streets in Dublin city centre where this has been working well include Capel Street and Francis Street which offer good examples of where living over the shop has worked and has made the streets into safer and more attractive spaces.  We need to see that scheme spreading to town centres throughout the country, making it more attractive for people to live in the centres.</p><p>I commend my colleagues for introducing this motion.  It is an important initiative on the part of the Labour Party Seanad group.  An important part of our work is to try to bring forward opportunities for people to debate ideas of urban renewal, support for SMEs and businesses that are facing difficulties in the current economic climate.  We are trying to ensure that the ideas put forward in the Seanad will be heard.  I thank the Minister of State for attending and listening to what we have to say about bringing those ideas to Government.</p></speech>

My father owned a shop in Brooklyn, New York.  Both my grandparents, my father for a while, my aunt and my cousins all ran small businesses in smaller towns in Ireland.  I have a certain feeling for the current sadness and tragedy surrounding the threatened demise of the sector.</p><p>I ask Senators not to think me judgmental, but If we are to spend our time today productively, not just singing hymns to Mom and apple pie about what we would like to see happening, we should provide some specifics.  I would like to throw my strong support behind the argument that the Government should adopt Senator Quinn's upward-only rent review Bill and try to push it through remaining Stages in both Houses.  If there are problems which need to be overcome in terms of constitutionality we should deal with them and not merely reject the Bill.</p><p>I have a couple of somewhat radical suggestions, one of which I have made before.  One of the problems businesses face does not concern attracting people back into town centres.  Many businesses are marginal because they are groaning under a colossal weight of debt incurred in the easy money days of the Celtic tiger.  This is not necessarily because the people who borrowed the money were irresponsible but rather they were told the rules had been changed and it was okay to take a bigger loan than they would have been given beforehand.  There was no longer the belief a person could borrow only a certain percentage of income.  It was thought to be easier to take large amounts because the property value a person held would always go up.  People were professionally advised to do this by those who should have known better and often, through limited fault of their own, they found themselves facing unsustainable levels of debt that might make their businesses go under.</p><p>That kind of desperate situation needs novel solutions.  I have made the point before and will continue to do so whenever I get a captive Minister.  There is &euro;100 billion of Irish wealth tied up in private pension funds, &euro;90 billion of which is outside the country and cannot be accessed by people when they need it, at a time when it might keep their business afloat or their house in their possession.  I have made the point before, and Deputy Mitchell O'Connor has made a similar suggestion in the other House, that when businesses are genuinely in trouble and there is a pot of money available, the discretion should exist with the pension investor to apply to get premature access to his or her pension to pay whatever tax penalty is necessary and get money which might keep the business afloat.</p><p>I have also suggested an idea I believe to be particularly relevant in this area.  The Government should consider introducing some kind of pilot scheme to take people off social welfare and out of unemployment by redeploying the money that would be paid to them and pay it to a business to employ them, mandating that business to top up the amount of income involved to a reasonable living wage.  This would mean the person who is currently getting a subsistence living on unemployment payments would get a bigger family income and would return some money to the Exchequer by way of tax.  In addition, the businesses would have an opportunity to restore some competitive advantage by having some percentage of their workforce effectively being partially subsidised by the Government.  It is a win-win-win situation.  The only constituency that would not like it are our masters in Europe.  Given that we have so many hundreds, perhaps thousands, of unemployed lawyers in the country, I do not believe we would have any difficulty ganging them up in the European courts for five or ten years until the recession is over and we can tackle the problem of any fines we might accrue.</p></speech>

As part of a broader initiative aimed not only at rejuvenating the retail sector but also looking to health issues, could we consider having a novel approach to smoking and the selling of cigarettes by offering preferential rates of VAT and tax advantages to shops, pubs, off-licences and businesses to declare themselves to be ethical businesses that will not sell tobacco?  People would be incentivised to do that by being given preferential rates of tax.</p></speech>

Decisive action must be taken, and I hope it will be.  I commend the two Senators who have spearheaded this issue, which I have done some work on in recent weeks.  Many town centres - once the heart and soul of Irish communities - are continuing to slide rapidly into decline.  That is well documented and beyond debate.  The location of branches of large supermarket chains on the fringes of almost every town, boasting convenient free parking, have drawn large numbers away from town centres.  My home town of Claremorris is a good example of this, with people from the hinterland and from other towns coming to shop in the large multinational outlet on the outskirts.  Even the layout of the facility's car park serves to discourage people from going into Claremorris itself.  The requirement to turn left or right, as appropriate, when negotiating the car park, means most people leave without going anywhere near the town centre.  That facility is essentially sucking the life out of the place.</p><p>I have referred on previous occasions to the system introduced in the North, and referred to colloquially as the multinational tax, whereby larger retailers pay more in terms of rates and so on.  It is a rather complex process, but I have asked the Minister for Finance to give it serious consideration.  It seems to be working very well north of the Border.  An ever decreasing level of footfall is leaving many indigenous businesses desperately struggling to survive.  We urgently need to revitalise town centres and make them more attractive places in which to socialise.  As Senator Ivana Bacik and the Minister of State both observed, they must become places where people actually live.  The planning system was at fault to a large degree for the problems that exist in this regard.  Dublin city is a prime example of a location in which large numbers of apartment blocks in which families could not possibly live were thrown up.  The reality is that people simply will not choose to live in a city or town centre if they cannot access appropriate accommodation.  There is work for the Government to do in encouraging and facilitating people in doing so.</p><p>Another incentive that might help to revitalise town centres would be to give mayors more responsibility and a greater incentive to make towns vibrant places in which festivals take place, markets are held and so on.  Such initiatives help to bring people back into the towns.  The town centre should be a place where people want to go regularly to meet other people, do business and engage in social activities, even if they are not necessarily shopping there first.  In France, mayors are given the responsibility of encouraging that type of activity.  In fact, it is fundamentally a matter for local government.  If mayors were elected on the basis that they had to deliver targets in terms of increasing footfall in town centres and the amount of business transacted there, it might lead to a larger movement of people into smaller towns.</p><p>We should aspire to progressive measures when it comes to parking.  Other speakers referred to the possibility of free parking provision at peak times, which would make a crucial difference.  Ideally the first hour would be free of charge, but I take on board the Minister of State's point regarding differences between towns and the balancing act that is required.  However, we must look to simple innovative ideas such as these if we are to get towns moving.  In New Zealand, for example, various initiatives are taking the stress and cost out of parking by making it more available and more enticing for shoppers.  One such measure is a coupon system which offers free parking spaces close to town centres for the first two hours and free spaces in more strategic locations, such as outside the post office, for 15 minutes.  Another possibility would be to charge adjusted rates in car parks belonging to large supermarkets such as Aldi, Lidl and Tesco, with the additional revenue going back to the local authority to assist in town centre rejuvenation.  I accept this might not be as straightforward as it seems, given that most of these facilities are located on private property, but it is something that should be considered.</p><p>The reopening and re-letting of derelict properties in town centres should also be encouraged.  There is scope to adopt programmes to promote town centres, main street revamps and regeneration of shop facades and signage.  Priority should be given to tackling anti-social behaviour in small towns, which will make them more attractive as places in which to spend time and to live.  Initiatives such as local-authority-funded family entertainment in town centres on Saturdays would also help to increase footfall and thus encourage shopping.  Again, there could be a role for mayors in this regard, as is the case in France.  Rates and rents which suffocate small businesses in towns throughout Ireland must also be tackled.  Local authorities are slowly coming to terms with that situation.</p><p>It is high time we generated new ideas and considered adopting those that are working abroad.  That is essential if we are to breathe life back into our town centres.  I thank the Labour Party Senators for raising this issue and the Minister of State for taking the debate.</p></speech>

I look forward to seeing her here on many occasions in the future.  I commend the Labour Party Senators on the motion before us today.  Opposition Members often table amendments to motions from the Government side, but this particular proposal is worthy of standing on its own and offers scope for a comprehensive discussion.</p><p>It so happens that this particular issue was raised at today's meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, where representatives of RGDATA offered suggestions as to how the committee might support retailers.  We all accept that if we hope to address the problems facing our town and city centres, then we must have a change of policy which serves to lift the domestic economy, put more money in people's pockets and get them spending again.  That would certainly help retailers in towns and cities.  The sooner we are all part of that solution the better.</p><p>We in Sinn F&eacute;in are, like others, concerned about the decline of town centres.  I did a series of consultations across the south east - in Carlow, Wexford, south Tipperary, Waterford and Kilkenny - in preparation for a report on economic development which was published by the committee some weeks ago.  As part of that consultation process I met with a range of groups, including retailers and chambers of commerce.  It was interesting to observe how different local authorities are dealing with the decline in towns and cities in different ways, including through some very innovative initiatives.  Carlow County Council, for example, has a pop-up programme whereby it engages with the owners of vacant properties and seeks to encourage people with new business ideas to use the properties for a couple of months.  If that cannot be done, signs are placed in the windows to brighten them up, which looks better than a row of empty shops.</p> <p>There are innovative proposals being examined by local authorities across the State.  If we are serious about urban renewal and the development of town and city centres from a retail perspective, we must acknowledge planning failures in recent times.  This is particularly true of out-of-town shopping centres which have had a big impact.  In Waterford we are fortunate that the local authority resisted pressure from developers.  The market went crazy during the Celtic tiger years, when we had any amount of out-of-town shopping centres.  People looked to build projects that are now white elephants.  They had an impact on town and city centres.  We must get back to the regional retail planning guidelines and stick to the primacy of town and city centres, particularly for convenience goods.  In the case of bulky goods, an argument can be made for having retail warehousing and out-of-town shopping centres.  Where we can, we should keep retail busineses in town and city centres.  Sensibly and proportionately, we could then look at out-of-town shopping centres.  We must accept that, in some areas, the position is out of kilter and based on the craziness of the market at the time rather than the reality.  One of the other issues that came up in consultation in the preparation of the report was that of upward only rent reviews.  I linked the matters because we were examining economic development in the preparation of that report, but retailers wanted to talk about the issues that affected them.  Last week the Seanad progressed a Bill from Senator Feargal Quinn on the issue.  My party has tabled a Bill in the D&aacute;il, but it has not yet had time to discuss it.  It is an important issue to which we must face up.  We must stop hiding behind the Attorney General.  All of Sinn F&eacute;in's legal evidence tells us that we can do something on this issue.  The Government must wake up to it because it affects many retailers.</p><p>On the afternoon we were having the debate on the Bill a chain of shoe shops went into examinership because of an upward only rent review.  The North is often criticised in this House, but the Northern Ireland Assembly introduced a Tesco tax.  It made rates much fairer and put the burden on multinationals, thereby taking it away from the SME sector.  It also acts as a deterrent to out-of-town shopping centres.  We should look at something like this.</p><p>With regard to local government, I will not deal with the abolition of town councils as we can leave the topic of abolition off the agenda today.</p></speech>

I live in Sligo where we have we are lucky because we have the Cranmore regeneration project.  While it is slow, it is slow for a good reason because people want to make sure the mistakes made in other regeneration projects do not happen there.  It is exciting to see an entire area in a small city like Sligo being regenerated, with all of the prospects it brings.  That is not always possible in other small towns that are struggling with derelict shops.  We need to draw up a menu of solutions to counteract serious problems that will pull towns and small cities in a situation from which they cannot be restored.  The solutions must come from local people and councillors.  We will not get into a dispute about councillors.  I refer to solutions about parking.  In Sligo there is free parking for the two weeks before Christmas, but the dilemma about revenue arises for the rest of the year.  We had a scheme entitled, &quot;I Love Sligo&quot;.  Various shops signed up and vouchers entitled people to discounts if they signed up and shopped locally.  It encouraged people into towns.  Others have experimented with these ideas to keep business in place.</p><p>I am interested in looking at the bigger picture and having a vision for towns and cities in the future.  Many are based on the way we did business in the past, but we have moved on from driving cattle through the main street.  We are now doing a lot of business online.  That means that we must reinvent our towns and cities because they were built at a time when there was no Internet and the idea of buying and selling online had not been thought of.  As the figures for online activity will only increase, we must think about how we can reinvent towns as places where people will want to live part of their lives and not just see them as centres of commerce.  They must be attractive places where people will want to meet their friends, enjoy their lives, go to the theatre and the cinema and perhaps cycle their bicycles.  I am surprised Senator Ivana Bacik forgot this point.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-10-08a.201" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1129" speakername="Susan O'Keeffe" time="18:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013100800036#KK00600"><p>They can offer the life people imagine online but can never lead.  We must reimagine towns as offering the authentic version of a life we can lead online.  Until we start to realise in our heads and the Civil Service and Government mentality that towns are not what they were, there is no point in restoring them to what they were because it no longer the case.  There is a menu of things that could be done locally and immediately.  They need to be supported and encouraged, but we must also consider the bigger picture.</p><p>What struck me in New York was the High Line, where a train line had been rescued and turned into a park.  It was mostly done with private money because several people saw it as an opportunity to showcase New York in a different way.  It is only one mile long, but it has captured people's imagination.  How do we reinvent the way we live now?  It brings green space into a town in a way that we appreciate and that we must value even more.  While I was making a small joke at the expense of Senator Ivana Bacik, she and others are dedicated to the idea of cycling and cyclists being made more welcome.  Many of my friends and colleagues are working hard with Sligo County Council and other councils to encourage greater awareness of pedestrians and making towns better places to walk around in.  We have failed at this in many towns.  We still always talk about parking and getting cars into towns.  It is about people and getting them to leave their online space and computers and out-of-town places to come into these places because they have rivers, bridges, green spaces and parks.  We are lucky in Sligo because we have parks on the edge of the town.  We also have adult gyms.  They are free and many use them.  That is what we must reimagine if we want to see a new life for our towns and cities.</p><p>When I lived in Cork quite a number of years ago, the English Market was a place to which I did not go because it did not feel like a place one wanted to be in.</p> <p>It is now an outstanding of example of something that has been recovered and restored and it has a new sense of purpose and identity.  The visit of Queen Elizabeth II gave it a lift but it has to sustain itself beyond a queen's visit.</p><p>There are ways in which we can develop our natural heritage.  Senator Bacik mentioned Culture Night and Open House.  These ideas do not cost money but they show that our towns are places in which to live and that the built heritage is very important.  It is a case of joined-up thinking in co-operation with the Minister for Health, in order to encourage healthy living, and with the Minister with responsibility for heritage and culture.  We must find better ways to use those spaces.  As Senators have said, many small towns are disappearing because we have not reinvented and re-evaluated them.</p><p>I thank the Minister of State and Senators and I foresee our revisiting this topic in the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-10-08a.203" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1116" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="18:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013100800037#LL00200"><p>I found the justification by Senator Keane for breaking the rules by saying that two Fianna F&aacute;il members had already spoken to be extraordinary.  I hope this does not happen again.</p><p>Towns themselves need to rise to the challenge.  Kells in County Meath has car parking charges which work to the disadvantage of the town and are a disincentive to doing business in the town.  I commend the efforts of my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues, who are in the minority on Kells Town Council, for their efforts to alleviate the situation.  Some schemes have been successful, such as the introduction of free parking at Christmas.  However, Kells Town Council annual estimates show the massive cost associated with putting paid parking in place.  It costs the council significant money to run paid parking.  In my view, towns such as Kells should take a chance - especially now that town councils are being abolished - and abolish paid parking to see if there would be a financial return in increased commercial rates as a result of increased commercial activity.  There is no doubt that paid parking is a disincentive to visit the town.  Drivers need to have the change to put into a machine and hope they do not overstay the time period.  While the staff of Kells Town Council are very helpful and are not in the league of what is reported in Dunleer, paid parking is a disincentive.  Ashbourne was awarded a retail excellence award for being the fourth best town in Ireland.  Ashbourne has a major advantage over other towns because it has free parking.  It is quite handy to come to Ashbourne with no worries about leaving the car to do one's shopping.  This brings money into the town.  I encourage the ruling majority in Kells Town Council to follow some of the advice of my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues and examine the issue of paid parking.  I ask them to go further and to consider the possibility of abolishing it completely, because such a decision would be of great benefit to the town of Kells.  It would facilitate people in coming to the town and allow them to take their time in making purchases.  </p><p>Among the reasons for the increase in out-of-town shopping is that shoppers like out-of-town shopping centres and they like the convenience of big supermarkets.  The lack of public transport is another reason for driving by car to out-of-town shopping centres.  It is easier to go to an-out-of-town shopping centre.  I do not decry out-of-town shopping centres but I say to the towns that they need to respond and paid parking has to be one of the key issues in this regard.  I hope that paid parking will not be introduced in those towns in County Meath that do not already have it.</p><p>During the debate on the Seanad referendum it was widely claimed that no Bills had been stopped by the Seanad since 1964.  However, the commercial rates Bill was stopped last year and I do not know its current status.  The Minister put forward a flawed commercial rates Bill.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party pointed out the flaws and it was the only party to oppose the Bill.  We have heard nothing further about this Bill in nearly a year.  If that Bill were presented to the House on Committee Stage with amendments to provide for a fair appeals system and an inability-to-pay clause, this could be of great assistance to small and medium-sized enterprises.  However, there is inertia in the Department with regard to this Bill and nothing has happened in 300 days.  The Minister has not presented that Bill to the House.  We pointed out the flaws, which are relatively easy to deal with, but they need to be dealt with as a matter of urgency because small businesses cannot hang around.  A few months ago the Taoiseach blamed the Seanad for the delay, which was pretty cheeky, in my view.  That Bill is stuck in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It needs to be radically amended on Committee Stage if we are to support it in order to help business.  Commercial rates, paid parking and rents are the key issues because these are the cost factors that are closing down businesses all around the country.  It would be far easier to trade and to shop if these costs were not so burdensome.</p><p>I commend Senator Landy on his motion.  He is from Carrick-on-Suir and he knows all about the problems of small towns in rural Ireland.  I will not oppose his motion.  I encourage all town councils to abolish the one-hour paid parking system because it is a risk worth taking.  They will see the benefits with more people coming into town centres.  It is a risk worth taking, in particular, in the commuter belt around Dublin, in the counties of Meath, Kildare and Cavan.  It is quite easy to get to retail parks on motorways.  There is no point in giving out about retail parks; nor do I agree with taxing them or their parking spaces.  The towns must respond and one of the ways in which they can respond is to remove paid parking, while the Government could remove the upward-only rent reviews and deal with commercial rates.</p></speech>

I sincerely thank Members for allowing this motion to pass without amendment.  That means a lot to Senator Whelan and myself because this motion was tabled in the spirit of trying to direct policy in order to improve the lot of small and medium-sized businesses.  It gives me no great pleasure to say to the Minister that as we speak, an interim examiner has been appointed to A-Wear, which employs 350 people in 40 shops around the country.  This is not an issue that will arise in the distant future; it is happening today, here and now.</p><p>We live in two Irelands: rural Ireland and the Ireland of Dublin.  They are two different places.  Rural Ireland is suffering, but it is not all doom and gloom.  We are facing a budget next week whether we like it or not.  I am pleased to say that, for whatever little pleasure it gives me, the reduction will be &euro;2.5 billion as opposed to &euro;3.1 billion.  That is no great boast and I do not boast about it, but at least it is better than what it looked like two weeks ago.</p><p>I welcome much of what the Minister of State said, particularly the fact that direction has been given for a waiver scheme for development levies.  I was a member of a local authority for 23 years in Carrick-on-Suir and I am pleased that rates have not been increased in most towns and some towns have reduced their rates.  I welcome the JobsPlus scheme, which should be utilised in retailing to take on employees.  In response to Senator John Crown, the scheme is logical and it makes sense.  People can gain work experience in the retail sector, which will provide them with the opportunity to take up work when the retail economy improves.  </p><p>The Minister has set up an interdepartmental group.  I hope she takes on board what I have requested today so that this group can become a national task force on retailing in town centres in rural Ireland.</p> <p>The Minister has already set up an interdepartmental group and I hope the Minister of State will take on board what I requested today, namely, a national task force on retailing in town centres in rural Ireland.</p><p>We still need guidelines for parking in rural towns, although there have been some fantastic initiatives.  When I was on my feet before I meant to mention the example of Thurles in Tipperary, which has three hours of free parking from 9 a.m. to noon every Saturday.  Councillors in the town have told me the footfall in the town is significant in that period.  Local authorities have also taken initiatives with regard to rates, and my own town council - I do not mind saying it was led by me - brought forward a rates initiative that gave a rates holiday to new businesses, provided there was no duplication.</p><p>If there is a constitutional issue with upward only rents, we should have a referendum on the matter.  It could be on the same day as the local elections next year rather than costing the taxpayer another &euro;15 million.  I guarantee that the &quot;Yes&quot; side would garner 99% of the vote in that referendum because people want to see businesses trade and survive, and people understand the problem with it.</p><p>I accept there is a cost factor involved in urban renewal but we could have a scaled back version linked to job creation and which would ensure that retention of jobs is to the fore.  That is instead of having bricks and mortar, with units that are no longer needed.  We should put our heads together to formulate an urban renewal scheme relevant to where Ireland is today, as opposed to where we were when the previous scheme operated in 1986.  I ask that the national task force be put in place as we will see a benefit from it.  It will create jobs in the country.</p></speech>

They voted to retain the Chamber on the basis of keeping the system but also a wish to reform not only this Chamber but the body politic.  It was good to see quite a few members of the press here today, as it is not always the case, and the people still do not realise the amount of work done by Senators in amending and enhancing legislation.  That is our job.  The blocking of legislation, which was mentioned on several occasions throughout the campaign, is not the game we are in, and we have improved legislation over 500 times this year alone.</p><p>I understand the impetus of colleagues in the House to reform the Seanad but before we speak about what we intend doing, we should contemplate the changes made in the Seanad over the past two years.  We have had a public consultation committee, which brought people in from outside to give ideas on policy areas.  We have addressed those public consultation reports with Ministers in the House, and they have taken on board quite a number of the proposals made by this House.  That is a significant contribution of the House that has gone largely unnoticed.  We have also dealt with a number of EU directives, providing a forum for MEPs to come to the House and explain to us and the Irish people their work in the EU.  They were grateful for the opportunity to come to us and let us know what they are doing on various committees; that work is necessary and should be welcomed.</p><p>We have done quite an amount of reforming in the way we do business in that respect.  Last year we approved a motion relating to committee meetings taking place when the Order of Business was taking place, and it was decided that Members would not attend those committees in order to facilitate quorums.  I remind Members that Senators decided to facilitate commencement of committees in the past, so we had ourselves to blame in that regard.  My preference is to have a specific week for the holding of committees and meetings should not be held when the plenary sessions are taking place.  We have heard excuses that there may not be enough rooms, etc., but they do not wash.  It could be done and it should be tried, as it would amount to true reform, concentrating the minds of people on the work of committees.  Many committees do excellent work, which certainly goes unnoticed as well.  The Government should take these steps on board as they would be a meaningful reform.</p><p>In speaking of reform, right now everything is focused on how the Seanad is to be reformed.  The focus should be switched to the other House, which can make decisions on finance and other very important matters.  That House needs as much if not more reform than this body, and I hope the Government will act on that.  I am confident that it will do so.</p> <p>We have a number of reports, especially the most recent report by Mary O'Rourke, in which there are a number of laudable recommendations that should be acted on.  Likewise, Senators Crown and  Zappone and Quinn have introduced reform Bills in recent months.  While I do not agree with some of the provisions, I agree with the main thrust of both Bills.  That is the reason both passed Second Stage in the House.  Between the O'Rourke report and the two Bills that have been presented we, as a body, should come up with proposals that are acceptable to Members and then pass it to the other House.  It will be then up to the Members there to decide whether they wish to implement the reforms this House favours.</p><p>We cannot rush into reform at this point in time and we cannot say we will implement the Bills straight away.  Everyone will rightly focus on the budget and on jobs for the next few weeks.  However, this gives us time for calm reflection.  The vote of the people should not be taken only as a matter of retaining the Seanad as it is.  It was a vote for reform and we have to go about our business in a proper, professional and calm manner, which requires reflection.  By mentioning the word &quot;reflection&quot;, people will say we are again kicking this issue to touch.  I hope that will not be the case and that the Government will give serious consideration to the reports and Bills that have been published in order that we can have meaningful reform.  It will be difficult because the main thrust of the reports and the Bill relate to how the Seanad will be elected.  That is the sticking point and it will be difficult to implement some of the proposals before us but where there is a will, there is a way.  There has to be a way to implement the ideas in the Bills and the O'Rourke report.  I have opened the debate and I am sure we will have many contributions on the political reform.  The reason the debate is entitled political reform rather than Seanad reform is that one cannot happen without the other and without us working together on this matter.</p></speech>

This will not be the only one we have and it was appropriate to have a discussion on this issue today.  Other Members thought we should have waited until Thursday but I did not agree because one must strike while the iron is hot.  I agree with most, if not all, of the Leader's contribution on the basis that we must think carefully about what needs to happen next.  I do not suggest that we take our foot off the pedal but we must consider what we can change now.  The Leader outlined a number of changes that have taken place independent of the referendum such as the establishment of public consultation committees, invitations to guest speakers and invitations to MEPs to enhance our connection to Europe.  MEPs in my party are frustrated that no one knows what goes on in the European Parliament.  They receive coverage approximately once a month late at night on television and there is little reporting of anything that is done.</p><p>We need to examine how we can add to our work now.  I have a number of suggestions we can work on into the future.  Is it possible to allow more time for legislation from Members from all parties or none to be produced?

I ask the Leader to jump in at any stage.  It could be good not to have a Minister present in order that we can have a  proper interactive discussion.  The Leader should feel free to jump in.  We should consider providing more time whereby Members can bring forward their own legislation.  While I acknowledge the intention behind these debates, the Topical Issues debate format in the D&aacute;il does not work as it should.   Perhaps we can improve on that in order that a Member can bring forward his or her own legislation.  My party could have ten or 12 Bills in preparation but we have to wait for our private members' slot to introduce them and have them debated.  I am not sure whether there is an impediment to us in Standing Orders to increasing the number of opportunities Members have.  For example, we could pick a Thursday or a Friday or a few days a month where Members could introduce their legislation or the time for its introduction could be shortened.  Will the Leader consider this?</p><p>I wholeheartedly agree with him about committees and the primacy of the Order of Business and the business of the House generally. </p></speech>

Senators have an equal say on joint Oireachtas committees.   If we have to facilitate the commencement of committee meetings while the Order of Business is taking place in the House, we should not do so and we should seek a change to the time committees meet.  I would also look into the Leader's suggestion of setting aside a few days or a week in the month solely for committee business, which would not impinge on plenary business.</p><p>The Order of Business has come in for criticism from time to time.  I understand that when some Members entered the House first, they thought it might have been an opportunity to raise local issues.  However, in the main that does not happen.  Most Members raise issues related to their own briefs and areas of expertise and matters of national importance on any given day while many Members raise issues about legislation.  I refute the criticism of even some of my own party colleagues about the Order of Business.  They think it is a farce but I refute that and I encourage more Members to engage in the Order of Business.  Perhaps we have to look from time to time to take the party political element out of it.  I try to do that most of the time but sometimes it is difficult to do so on specific issues.  If we take this as a fresh start to see what we can do under the law as it stands, we should do that.  There is no question that overall political reform needs to happen and I do not want this to be kicked to touch to produce more reports.  People voted for reform.  I canvassed on this, as did the Leader who was prominent during the campaign, and voters talked about reform in all areas of politics, including the way politics is conducted, the way members are elected and the business that takes place in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This needs to be examined.  There are good reports and Bills from Senator Crown and others.  We should consider the Bills and reports that have been published, including my party's document, A Seanad for the People.  There are good points in it but I do not agree with all of it.</p> <p>We produced a document entitled, A Seanad for the People.  I do not agree with all of it but it has some good points.  The Seanad should get together and set out in boxes what can be done now and what requires legislative change.  We must examine whether we need the Government's permission to do certain things.  I urge the Leader to examine one issue in the coming weeks, namely, to see whether we can get more time to produce individual Bills.</p><p>Thank you, Acting Chairman, for your indulgence.  I am in favour of the proposal for the Seanad on European legislation and statutory instruments, in particular those that are signed.  People want us to debate the issues at the very least.  Senator Daly mentioned that, as did many Government party Senators.  We should set aside time to do that work irrespective of whether we get staff.  I made the suggestion previously about commitments from each grouping.  I can give a commitment that the Fianna F&aacute;il group will give resources from within our own staff.  If we were to share the work among our parliamentary assistants and political staff, they could act as rapporteurs.  I do not want anyone to say we cannot do such work because more staff would be required.  We will return to the issue.  It is important that we have spoken about these matters today.  I do not disagree with anything the Leader said.</p><p>My final point is how we let people know what we do and what we can do.  We must examine ways in which we can be inventive in that regard.  Senator Byrne referred to the role of the Seanad.  As the Leader said, there was much misinformed comment about the Seanad not having blocked certain issues.  Let us set out the issues and see whether there is a way of outlining the work of the Seanad each month.  If the print media will not cover it we could examine other avenues to do it.</p></speech>

I do not know whether we need to do exhaustive research, as it has all been done.  There are up to eleven reports and many people with much knowledge, skill-sets and abilities who can extract what is good and bring forward a conclusive report on which we all agree.</p><p>  Having been in the other House also, the much bigger question of political reform relates to it.  While the Seanad has been under the microscope for the past six months, there has not been such microscopic analysis of the other Chamber.  Political scientists from all educational institutions say the same thing about the other Chamber, namely, that the electoral process and multi-seat constituencies must be changed.  That leads exclusively to clientelism and as long as that is the case members of political parties will look over their shoulders at their party colleagues as they are all chasing the same vote.  Fine Gael members chase the Fine Gael voters in a constituency, as do members of Fianna F&aacute;il, the Labour Party and others.  That is the biggest mistake within the political process in this country.</p><p>  The analysis of legislation in this Chamber is far ahead of the analysis in the other Chamber.  I say that from my experience of both Chambers.  What we should do is facilitate the creation of better legislation, which is not happening at the moment.  It will not happen unless we are inventive, original and daring.  It is not easy for politicians to be daring because we are all satisfied with the <i>status quo</i>.  We leave things as they are rather than take a chance of making an original change.  That is the reason every Government for the past 50 years has not changed this Chamber.  A Government Bill has not been rejected by the Seanad since the 1960s.  I was not born in the 1960s.  The body politic does not change the system because it is grand.  No one wants to make the structure uncomfortable or upsetting.</p><p>  Following the referendum I am hopeful that we will get the co-operation of the other Chamber.  Such co-operation is crucial to pass legislation that will facilitate the expansion of a better role for Seanad Members without a referendum.  We should try to introduce change before the next general election.  We do not know when that will be, but at the latest it will be spring 2016.  There is time enough to be original and inventive, but we must want it.</p></speech>

That is something which occurs when people have had cardiac arrest or serious stroke and they are felt to be clinically dead.  Their pulse is gone and their hearts are no longer beating but due to the sophistication of modern intensive care their brains are kept alive while their circulation is restored.  The literature describing what happens during that time is controversial.  For many, it is just unconsciousness.  People have said they got a chest pain when they were walking down the street and they woke up in the intensive care unit wondering where they were.  Other people record a number of different events which occurred to them during the experience, ranging from mystical experiences, which are interpreted by some as being true religious experiences when they are on the interface between life and death and their soul has not yet been wrenched free of their body.  Others take a more physical and neurological interpretation of the events and say it is a dying brain syndrome; that if one&rsquo;s brain is being deprived of blood and oxygen, funny things happen and various hallucinations occur which might involve dead relatives, walking towards the light and religious figures but it is all just one&rsquo;s brain misfiring and if one recovers one will remember it.  Regardless of the interpretation people put on these events, what is common is that it changes them.  They often say that their lives change afterwards; their perspectives change; their priorities change.  I think Members can all guess where this is going.  I am sorry for being predictable.</p></speech>

Collectively, this House did have the fabled near-death experience.  For one, I can freely admit that about a week before the referendum I would have thought we were truly on death row; that this was an unsalvageable enterprise.  It should change us.  Perhaps I am being terribly na&iuml;ve, but I do see little seeds of the fruits of that experience in the interactions of my colleagues who are coming forth today, because it should change us.</p><p>Not only should we mop our brow with relief at what we just missed but we should also listen to the bad stuff that was said about us because a lot of it is true.  That is the reality.  Many of the charges which were laid at the door of the Seanad were sincerely laid by people who knew what they were saying and who had some validity to what they were saying.  Rather than just moving on from here and saying we have survived - nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, we should take on board the message and see how we can learn not only from our little triumph last week but also from the valid criticisms which were made.  We should all change our perspective, not just the members of the big parties.  I am sorry if I have been disproportionately critical of the big parties in the couple of years I have been a Member, but it is important that there should not be so many opportunities for people in this House to see a motion or proposition as a Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael or Labour Party one.  The reality is that we have been given a certain level of personal liberation.  It is pretty obvious that many of the people who are the bosses of some of the Members in this House and in the other House were not as supportive of this House as they might have been and people should regard that as a liberating experience.  I do not ask anyone to preach sedition or insurrection against their organisations but with a clean conscience they can look at various propositions that come before this House and various ideas which come to us from an entirely different perspective without checking in their long-held loyalties at the door.</p> <p> The question of priority should also change in respect of those who have had the near-death experience.  We should really work out what is important to us as Senators.  I will not delve into any of the stereotypes but people should understand the work that takes place in this House is important because it is important in this House, not just because it may be a means to achieving other ambitions we may have.  I am not saying the other ambitions are illegitimate, as Members are entirely justified in pursuing them, but Members should try to minimise the effect they have on the way they do business in this House.</p><p> With the waffly aphoristic bit over, let me propose a few reforms.  Reform No. 1 is to reform ourselves.  We need to work out a new <i>modus operandi</i>within this House for doing business together.  We do our business in a good way in this House but we can do so even better.  We can be a beacon to the other House and to those who will inevitably be scrutinising this House to a significant extent in the aftermath of the referendum.</p><p> I am sorry if I sound boring.  There are a number of very practical reform suggestions we can help to implement, with the aid of colleagues in the other House, relating to the reform of this House.  I was very delighted to hear our Leader, Senator Maurice Cummins, and commend him on the way he conducted himself during the referendum campaign.  He did an unbelievably good job.</p></speech>

There are those who have ideas that they can advance here in a way that they could not be advanced in the other House.  I refer to direct and specific legislation.  As several speakers mentioned, we are frustrated by the limited opportunity we have to introduce Bills.  I will work longer hours to have more opportunities to introduce legislation.  If one is a backbencher, one can introduce a Bill only once every eight months.</p><p>In the remaining term of the Seanad, I would love to implement three or four other ideas.  Sometimes we can work in unity with our colleagues in the parties and sometimes we cannot, but we should accord considerable priority to the proposed reforms.  Perhaps we should have fewer statements or, if we are to have them, more limited time should be allowed for them.  Perhaps there should be more opportunities for legislation.</p><p>We should all examine collectively &ndash; I have not been good at it &ndash; our serious input into making amendments.  Perhaps we should try to set up some cross-party sub-committees within this Chamber to consider potential legislation.  The members may identify the need for a Bill on a technical issue, a science issue, an agricultural issue, a commercial issue or a tax issue, for example.  There are individuals who could give us advice as a collective on how we might improve in this regard.</p><p>Let me make a more ambitious proposal.  We all agree absolutely that there is a need for fundamental reform, not just of the Upper House but also of the system of governance.  Some of us will approach this in different ways.  I have a bee in my bonnet and believe there should be greater separation between executive and legislative functions, with greater legislative oversight of the executive functions and enhanced ability to appoint people to executive functions.</p><p>This Chamber could act as a very important sounding board for bigger ideas.  We should make use of our public engagement process.  Let this be not a convention but a sounding board for individuals to afford us opportunities for reform.</p></speech>

Other Members and I have already welcomed it on the Order Of Business.  With respect to the Leader, I believe that while it is good to have the opportunity in the immediate aftermath of the referendum to discuss this matter, it is rather early.  For many of us, because the result was rather unexpected &ndash; there appeared to be a real change in the last week of the campaign as people engaged thoughtfully with the issues put to them &ndash; there is a need to process the results.  I would like us to be able to return to this in a couple of weeks and have the debate when we have all had a chance to process the result and think a little more clearly and in more detail about how best to proceed with the task of reform.</p><p>It was very clear that while the majority did not want the crude abolition proposal put to them, they and all those campaigning on the &quot;No&quot; side, including me, were calling for reform.  There is now a very clear mandate for reform.  Senator Crown referred to the near-death experience.  We all need a little recovery time after it to process the result and think in a meaningful way about reform.  It would benefit us to return to this after a little more time.</p><p>I take issue with one statement of Senator Crown in his otherwise very eloquent and thoughtful speech.  Those of us in political parties do not have bosses in the other House.</p></speech>

They are parallel and do not follow from each other.  Each should be started immediately.  The first concerns internal procedures, about which others have spoken.  Senator O'Brien spoke in detail about the Order of Business.  I agree with him and believe the Order of Business is an important part of the day, but we need to be much tighter with time.  It looks self-indulgent when we go way over time on the Order of Business, as we did today.  We need to ensure that we keep to time and that we are professional in our conduct of debates generally.</p><p>There are internal procedures that we have already changed.  Senator Cummins has very much taken a leading role in bringing about the internal changes.  The public consultation committee has been a real strength of the Seanad.  We can strengthen it further by trying to engage more Senators in the committee's hearings.  The only flaw so far is that there has not been enough participation by a larger number of Senators.</p><p>I agree with the Senators who talked about the need for fewer statements.  However, our question-and-answer sessions involving Ministers are very valuable.  We have had some really good exchanges.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, for example, gave a very important answer on credit unions during the course of a session.  The contributions by distinguished speakers, including by Mr. David Begg recently, have been very positive.</p><p>There are internal procedures that we can work on, tighten and make more professional.  We should lead the way on being a family-friendly Chamber and examine how we conduct our business in a way that encourages those with young families to get involved.  This would be part of an international movement on parliamentary reform and we should be part of it.</p><p>The second set of changes is through legislation.  I agree entirely that the first legislative measure, the easiest, should be to reform the composition of the six university seats and extend the franchise to all third level graduates.  This should be done without delay.</p><p>I was glad to hear Senator Crown saying that the Bills currently on the Order Paper, in his name and those of Senators Quinn and Zappone, should be examined to determine how best to merge them or take the best parts from each.  We should consider taking the best elements of Ms Mary O'Rourke's excellent cross-party report from some years ago and unite on a cross-party basis to agree on achievable legislative change, particularly on the election of Senators.  The latter was a key issue in the debate before the referendum.  It can be tackled and does not require constitutional change to broaden the electorate for the Seanad.</p><p>The third type of change is the constitutional change that would be required for any more significant structural changes to the Seanad, for example, to change the Taoiseach's nominees system.  In that regard, the obvious body to deal with this is the Convention on the Constitution.  I said this earlier today.  Through talking to the Leader, we could work in a collegiate fashion.  We could pass a cross-party motion, with agreement on all sides, to refer the issue of constitutional change pertaining to the Seanad to the convention.  The convention is seeking an extension into 2014 and it could easily examine Seanad reform as part of its extension, having already examined D&aacute;il reform.</p><p>The Seanad has been really strong on Committee Stage debates, Private Members' business and accepting Private Members' Bills.  Ministers have been more amenable to accepting amendments and Private Members' Bills in this House and the other.  Let us have a communications strategy whereby the Seanad communicates to the press whenever a Minister accepts the Bill or an amendment.</p> <p>That is something that was lacking in the debate.  People really need to put the message out about the work we are doing and the way in which Ministers can be more effective.  Some are particularly receptive to amendments and Private Members' Bills.  If we were to devise a communications strategy - the entire House as opposed to individual Members - that would be very useful.</p><p>The scrutiny of EU legislation and public appointments is referred to in the O'Rourke report.  There is plenty more to be said on this matter and I look forward to further stages of the debate.</p></speech>

For many of us, it is an appetiser and we are looking forward to the main course at some stage.  We all take different messages from the result of the referendum, debates, opinion polls and so forth.  It may be a wake up call for some, a slap on the wrist for others, while for others still, it might even be a vote of confidence.  One can imagine the range of interpretations coming from the debate.  The fact that it happened is good and I must say I welcomed a comment made by the Leader this morning to the effect that we should avoid retaliation and recrimination.  That must be the starting point.  As the old Chinese proverb goes, a journey of 1,000 miles begins with a single step.  That is precisely where we are.</p><p>  We can come up with all kinds of ideas to deal with the frustration we are experiencing with the committees.  The Oireachtas committee of which I am a member sits on a Tuesday at 2.15 p.m., but Senators are required to be in the Chamber at 2.30 p.m.  I attended the meeting today for only 12 minutes and took the advice of the Leader to be here for the start of today's Seanad sitting.  That, however, is not the way to do business.  Unquestionably, the size of the committees is wrong.  Committees with 20 to 25 members dealing with up to four portfolios are unworkable and we all know we are not making progress in that regard.  I only make these points to underline the fact that the issue of reform is not confined to the Seanad but is much bigger than that.</p><p>  I wish to focus more on <i>modus operandi  </i>rather than putting forward ideas because there are hundreds of ideas floating around.  The Leader might consider <i>modus operandi</i> in the context of how the reform agenda would be advanced.  I suggest we have four to six sessions similar to this one but expanded.  Each session should have a focus.  We must decide what issues we want to deal with because there are too many involved and the debate is too complex.  A decision should be made to have four to six sessions covering particular items and we must be really independently-minded in this regard.  We must deal with this issue ourselves, as Senators and as a House.  We must make a decision that an all-party grouping will absorb what comes out of those sessions.  We must do this and not wait for anyone else to do it for us.  Our aim should be to help the Government in its deliberations.  </p><p>  We are aware that there will be, according to the Taoiseach, a period of reflection.  Reflection generally suggests marking time, but that would be a pity.  We must be exceptionally urgent in our approach, if for no other reason than to say &quot;Thank you&quot; to those who voted for the Seanad to remain.  Furthermore, those who voted &quot;Yes&quot; and had doubts about this House are also entitled to answers to the points raised during the debate.  If we have an unfocused approach and do not harness what is coming from the debate, we will find ourselves wondering at Christmas why we lost so much time.  I ask the Leader to consider organising a number of highly focused sessions and to set up an independent all-party grouping within the Seanad to monitor the debate, take on board the points made and come back to the House with views, if not an actual policy.</p><p>  Many of the specific issues raised are relevant.  There is nothing worse than having to speak during the Order of Business, with one eye on the Cathaoirleach, wondering whether one can get in under the wire with something that does not relate to the Order of Business.  That is a problem and makes us all feel uneasy, but we do not blame the Cathaoirleach for this.  Some mechanism must be found to change this in the very near future.  It would be totally wrong to lose out on the opportunity to raise topical issues.  If we are not raising topical issues, we are not really relevant.  For that reason, we should examine the possibilities.  Perhaps the Committee on Procedures and Privileges might be asked to examine this issue.  It would be better for us not to be hypocritical in the way we handle the Order of Business.  Incidentally, there are some excellent contributions each day on the Order of Business, many of which are relevant.  However, that raises the question as to what exactly makes us relevant, a question that was also raised during the referendum debate.  </p><p>  In the first part of the campaign it was said the Seanad had never blocked any Bill.  However, people answered that point, explaining that it was not our job to block Bills but to scrutinise and enhance legislation.  In the second half of the campaign that point was taken on board.  I read one statistic which showed that in 2009, 1,201 amendments had been accepted.  That is a huge number and amounts to enhancement.  If those amendments had not been accepted, the relevant legislation would have been passed and enacted in a flawed state.  We must put our current position into perspective.  </p><p>  My final suggestion is that we approach the editors of newspapers and broadcasters to put it to them that if they were actually present for the real debates, there might be a totally different perception of this House.  I was glad to see members of the media here today, but we all know why they were here.  It is important that we do not just grouse about this.  We must show independence as a House of Parliament and get to the editors, in whatever manner is effective, whether it is face-to-face or through some other form of communication.  We must relay to the media that we would welcome their presence and also scrutiny of what happens in this House.  I ask the Leader to take this suggestion on board.</p></speech>

We all knew when we signed in initially that we would be subject to a referendum and the Taoiseach must be complimented on sticking to his word.  He said he was going to hold a referendum and he did.  Many had spoken about reform and about doing this, that and the other, but nobody had done anything.  At least, the Taoiseach did something, about which we cannot complain.  We facilitated the holding of the referendum, engaged in the debate and ensured that the issues were put before the people.  Now they have spoken and, as good politicians, we are bound to listen.  They have spoken in many ways.  We cannot compliment ourselves and declare that we are the greatest thing since brown bread, given that the people wanted to save us.  There are many reasons they voted in the way they did.  I listened to phone-in radio programmes on the issue and there were many reasons for the way people had voted.  Having said that, reform was very high on the agenda and we must take note of this.  Some were in favour of abolition, but for others, their vote was a kick in the backside for the Government.  However, we cannot be complacent about the result.  People want to have a good Seanad and we must ensure we give them a better Seanad than the one they now have.  All through the campaign it was agreed that what existed was not ideal.  Nobody disagreed on that point.</p><p>The Leader has done much to try to reform the House within the current limitations.  I compliment him on framing this debate in the context of political reform rather than simply Seanad reform.  As he and others have said, political reform is a wide umbrella.</p> <p>Political reform of the other House and the committees is also necessary.  I sit on the environment committee which was discussing the important climate change Bill today.  However, owing to a debate in this House, I had to absent myself from the committee for a while.  That is not right.  There was all-party agreement several years ago that there should be a dedicated week for committee hearings.  If we brought this in, we would be doing the whole legislative process a favour.</p><p>It is important to extend the franchise to all university and institute of technology graduates.  We tried to extend participative democracy by bringing citizens before the Seanad, an effort on which the Leader must be complimented.  When the House was originally established, it was envisaged that it would offer real opportunities to build bridges to citizens representing different sectors of society.  Without having another referendum, we can make changes to provide this opportunity again.</p><p>When we tried to scrutinise European legislation before, we could not go ahead with it.  It was through no fault of our own as one needed back-up and secretarial support.  In theory, committees are supposed to be scrutinising EU legislation.  However, from sitting on committees, I know many of them just rubber-stamp the legislation presented to them.  Staff from the committees can be diverted to the Seanad for the scrutiny of European legislation.</p><p>We cannot speak about political reform without speaking about local government reform.  I have often asked for a debate on this issue.  Many of the examples of unicameral systems used in the referendum have good local government systems.  Ireland does not.  We need a strong local government system with real powers.  Powers from central government need to be devolved to local government, too.  While most Members have a background in local government, the Taoiseach&rsquo;s 11 nominees came from outside this area.  There are many changes to the Seanad we could introduce without having a referendum and we should proceed with them.</p></speech>

It is extremely refreshing to find this from somebody who has been placed in such a difficult position.  Not everyone has been like this.  There have been people parachuting in and out, indicating that their real desire - even during the referendum - is to get into the other House and showing this House contempt.  I find it astonishing.  I also find it astonishing that Members on the other side voted so enthusiastically for the extinction of this House.  The Bill that was passed was entitled the abolition of the Seanad Bill.  It did not mention the word &#8220;referendum&#8221; once.  I wonder how people can take their pay when they feel the Seanad is rubbish or that it is a jumping-off point for trampolining into the other House.  I wonder about the integrity of Members accepting their salary if that is what they actually feel.</p><p>  I have been campaigning for over 30 years for reform of the Seanad.  It amazes me that after 30 years suddenly the Government is parroting all of my arguments about the lack of democracy.  There were people lying brazenly on radio during the referendum claiming the university Senators had always opposed the extension of the franchise granted by the referendum over 30 years ago.  We have all begged for it to happen.  It is quite complicated because it would mean constituencies about the size of an EU constituency.  It should not be left to people with a high national profile like me.  It must be about bringing in younger people if it is to be truly democratic.</p><p>  Then there is this rubbish that we should do it for nothing.  Do the people who write this do their jobs for nothing?  I do not think so.  I am not going to just pass over an insult that our work is worth nothing.</p><p>  With regard to the reforming legislation already introduced, it has been useful.  I compliment my colleague Senator John Crown on his brilliant performance during the referendum.  He has said honourably that much of the work done on his Seanad reform Bill has been done by his assistant, Mr. Shane Conneely.  On the other side, the abolition Bill was prepared by a team of anonymous lawyers in the background.  It is time we took possession of reform.  It cannot be done outside the House.</p><p>  We should examine the panel system.  The Seanad should remain a vocational institution and reflect expertise.  What the hell else do these people who so easily trot out this anti-intellectual line about elitism and such rubbish want?  Do they want a collection of cab&oacute;gs like they have in the other House?  I am very glad that we have expertise in this House.  In fact, I want more of it.  For example, I want more of it from people who are unemployed.  I was hoping Mr. Tom Hyland, the hero of East Timor, would be brought into this House.  These are the sort of people who should be brought into it.</p><p>  The panel system should be like the university system, which makes it work, in that it enfranchises ordinary Members.  We could make sure everyone was on a panel and if there were some left over, they could be introduced to an extra panel.</p><p>  I must warn about scrutinising EU legislation.  There is an absolutely unbelievable volume of this stuff, most of it highly technical.  It is not the vocation of this House to go through it.  Throughout my political life, I never went for anything I could not accomplish.  For example, all of the polls claimed I would be the first elected mayor of Dublin.  It is nonsense, as I would have been hopeless.  I recognise my talents, but I also recognise my limitations.  If we take on EU legislative scrutiny, we will be absolutely banjoed.</p><p>  We should demand more responsibility from the newspapers.  Last week in <i>The Irish Times</i>, the paper of record, two columnists, Breda Power and Fintan O'Toole, said those on the &#8220;No&#8221; side should spoil their votes by writing &#8220;reform&#8221; on the ballot paper.  I had to get on Twitter - with the help of my neighbour across the road, Muireann Noonan, because I am useless at computers, twiddles and what not - about this.  At one stage, we were in contact with 1.2 million people and told them not to spoil their votes.  Local radio stations such as those in Waterford, Donegal and Clare were just as important in the referendum as the national broadcasters.</p><p>  Yes, this is a time not for recrimination but moving forward.  We have had a degree of support from the people and need to justify it.  Yes, we can be grateful to the Taoiseach.  For the past 30 years I have been campaigning for Seanad reform, but it has never been on the political agenda.  At least, the Taoiseach has managed - perhaps through the law of unintended consequences - to put Seanad reform on it.</p> <p>The people are hungry for it.  I have hundreds of e-mails from people saying they are delighted, but now let us get on with the job and reform.</p></speech>

We cannot walk away from it, and nobody who has been through this referendum wants to walk away from it.  My colleague Senator Bacik said perhaps it was too soon and maybe we would come back to it, and I feel sure we will revisit the subject.  We need to discuss it now but we will need to discuss it into the future.  Senator Michael D'Arcy referred to the fact that the Seanad had been scrutinised for the past six months.  I beg to differ.  There was not much scrutiny of what the Seanad is and does.  There was much argument about what people thought the Seanad was and what it did, but much of that was incorrect or wrong.  Senator Norris referred to brazen lies on the radio.  I am sure he is well used to brazen lies on the radio.  We all are.</p></speech>

It became a debate about something else.  I am glad the referendum is over because it gives us a firm and proper opportunity to discuss reform, which is where we all wanted to be.  Not to be provocative, but most people, whether they voted "Yes" or "No", were looking for change of some description.  Some wanted to change it by throwing us out, but that was a vote for change.  Some wanted to keep us in the hope that we would be changed.  That was also a vote for change.  Arguably, everybody who took part on Friday wanted change.  It is up to us to some extent to keep the pressure on and say that political reform, which will involve Seanad reform, is something we value.</p><p>One cannot have Seanad reform alone.  It is a three-legged stool.  It is local government, the Seanad and the D&aacute;il.  Unless one reforms them in an holistic way one cannot reform them properly at all.  When Denmark and Finland removed their second houses they replaced them with either a regional structure or lots more local government with thousands of local politicians.  They gave local government genuine powers to make all kinds of decisions about how they govern and how they spend their money.  They said there were two ways of doing business: national government for big issues and local government for local issues.  That was very clear, and they gave sufficient power to local government.  If we say we want three parts to our Government, we must reform them all together.</p><p>This is not the day to discuss it because it is far too complicated, but Senator Bacik and others mentioned the Constitutional Convention, and that is an appropriate place to discuss some of the ideas that exist.  Senator Crown generously suggested there should be a Seanad electoral reform Bill which would include the best of all the ideas that came from his Bill, that of Senators Zappone and Quinn, former Senator Mary O'Rourke's cross-party committee and other places.  On our own internal business, we have made some very valuable changes.  I would like the Seanad Public Consultation Committee to be continued and extended.  I am a member of that committee, so I might say that, might I not?  However it is a very good blueprint for what we can do in the Seanad.  We must be more strategic about the subjects we choose.  Somebody suggested that committee should be bigger, but however we do it, it should become a fundamental part of our activity here.</p><p>I would like us to run the Young Senators initiative again.  That was very useful in opening a space in the Houses of the Oireachtas for younger people to take part.  It is much easier to do it here than in the other House.  We have had many very interesting speakers here and we might make that a monthly Speakers' Corner, so to speak, where they are not necessarily the great and the beautiful but representatives of older people, those with mental health issues, children and creative people, so that we would be a Chamber of vision and creativity of older and younger people.  We need a real change internally in the clash between the committees, the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  That is fundamental.  I sit on two committees and I am chasing around, as many people are.  The committees have real and powerful business to do, and the only way to do it is to separate that business from the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.</p></speech>

It is important, in the wake of the referendum, that Members of this House reflect on the outcome of the referendum and the messages both sides sent to all of us and the political system itself.  Referendum day is the people's day.  The people spoke and the people are sovereign.  We all regret that the majority of people entitled to vote did not vote, not just on the Seanad referendum but also on the referendum on the establishment of the court of appeal.  We saw something similar with the children's referendum, where the turnout was approximately 30%.  We must recognise that we have a job to do as a political system to reach out to a section of the population who are disengaged with the political system, who are indifferent, apathetic, angry or whatever.</p><p>For those who voted, it was a clear, resounding vote for reform.  It would be wrong for anybody in this House to see it as a vote of confidence in us, as individuals or Senators, or in this House as an institution.  People want reform, not just of the Seanad but of the entire political system.  It was regrettable that the option of reform was not put to the people.  While it was not on the ballot paper, people took the option of voting &quot;No&quot; as their way of saying they want reform.  The Government should accept that.  It might be easy for the Government to say the people voted to retain the Seanad, but the vast majority, if not all, of the people who campaigned for a &quot;No&quot; vote were campaigning on the basis of a radically reformed Seanad.  I hope we do not go into the next general election with the Seanad exactly as it is, with a few cosmetic changes but with Senators being elected exactly the same way as they were elected in the past.  The people will not forgive us for that, nor will they forgive the political system, because it was genuine vote for reform.</p><p>First, we must reform how people are elected to the Seanad.  We all accept that this must change.  While Senator Norris took exception to the term &quot;elitist&quot;, I make no apologies for saying the way we elect Senators is elitist.  We elect a number of Senators through university panels on which only a certain portion of people who went to universities have a vote.  We do not give the franchise to the vast majority of citizens.  Where only 3% of the population can vote for people in one arm of the Parliament, it is clearly elitist and undemocratic, and that must change.</p><p>Senators should be elected through universal suffrage.  There should be one vote for everybody.  If we really want people to have an affinity with the Seanad, the first thing we do is give them the vote.  When people can vote for Senators, the whole perception of the Seanad will change.  The Press Gallery is empty.  The press came in today because it was the first day after the referendum.  Will we see them again tomorrow, next week and next month?  If every person had a Seanad vote, it would change that attitude and that perception.  We should do it because it is the right thing to do.  Legislators should be elected by the people.</p><p>Another question is what the second Chamber does.  In defence of its abolition strategy the Government argued that there are any number of proposals.  Senator Crown made proposals.</p> <p>Senators Quinn and Zappone have made proposals, as have Sinn F&eacute;in and Fianna F&aacute;il.  I am sure the Labour Party and Fine Gael made proposals prior to the referendum.  We have any amount of reports on Seanad reform.  There is no end of reports or ideas.  We must work out in a very careful and thoughtful way how we will reform the Seanad with regard to its powers.  There is scope for examining EU legislation and directives.  How many times have we seen directives that have not been properly transposed into Irish law?  A recent example, as the Leader would agree, is the insolvency directive, which resulted in Waterford Crystal workers not getting their pensions.  Senator Norris is correct in saying that generally EU legislation is very technical and weighty and it would not be possible to go through every piece of it, but there are directives and areas of European policy that the Chamber could quite usefully examine.</p><p>It would also be a mistake to reform only the Seanad.  We cannot allow the issue of D&aacute;il reform to slip off the agenda, because it needs to be radically reformed.  I agree with previous speakers with regard to local government.  I hope we will have constructive, thoughtful debate.  I appeal to Senators on the Government side to appeal to the Taoiseach to put the issues of political reform and the future of the Seanad and the D&aacute;il to the Constitutional Convention, to extend its remit and to let all of these ideas be properly ventilated, after which it can come back with a proposal which, it is hoped, would add value to our democracy and the workings of the Parliament.</p></speech>

The number of people who voted to retain the Seanad works out at more than 10,000 votes per Senator, which is equivalent to a quota for a Deputy.  It was a substantial vote in favour of keeping the Seanad and we should not forget this.  With regard to politics, democracy and the cost issue, when one considers countries that do not have democracy, one appreciates everything we have here.  People had an opportunity to state whether they no longer wanted the Seanad.  They decided comprehensively that they wanted it retained.</p><p>I came to the House from the European Parliament and I have serious issues with the time the voting procedure here takes.  The European Parliament has a set time for voting, which is between 12 p.m. and 1 p.m., and during this time up to 200 votes can be dealt with at 30 seconds per vote.  When Bills are going through the Seanad, votes can be called on individual sections.  I would like this procedure to be examined to see whether each section could be debated as it arises but the votes taken together at certain times.  This may require major reform, but it is about effective use of time.  We should consider it.</p><p>Many people have raised the issue of European directives.  The need to scrutinise EU legislation was one of the first issues I raised when I came to the House.  We should also examine the Commission's programme for each year.  In November of each year the Commission publishes its work programme for the following 12 months, and I do not believe it has ever been debated in either House of the Oireachtas.  Its programme will affect us, perhaps not now or in 12 months' time, but at some time in the future.  It would be appropriate to discuss the Commission's programme when it is published to see the issues coming down the road of which we need to be aware.  Today the European Parliament dealt with cigarettes and the tobacco industry.  In fairness, the Minister for Health and the Taoiseach wrote to MEPs in support of the change required.  We should debate at a very early stage not only directives but also the entire programme, whether it is a 12-month programme or a five-year programme.</p><p>Many people are very critical of Oireachtas committees.  I am lucky to be on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, which I consider to be a very good committee.  One reason it is so good is that no one plays politics.  All of the contributions from everyone involved are extremely constructive.  It has been extremely successful and long may this continue.</p><p>Senator Darragh O'Brien raised the issue of working together.  In Brussels we all sat down around the table and worked through issues.  I have given the example previously of the cross-border health care directive.  I did deals with the communists, the Union for Europe of the Nations, UEN, the liberals and every group to bring through the amendments I wanted.  On committee stage more than 400 amendments were dealt with.  Everyone had a part to play and people did not vote against an amendment because it came from a particular party; they voted in favour of it because of the benefits it would bring and because it would make the directive a better document.  We should consider these issues when examining reform of the House.</p></speech>

I must confess I am a little curious about Sinn F&eacute;in's analysis of the election.  It seems so certain about the reasons people voted as they did.  One will never be able to understand what motivates a voter.  All I have to go on is anecdotal evidence.  Those I spoke to who voted "No" stated that they wanted to retain the institution, but they did not go any further than this.  They felt it had been put there for a purpose.  They were not all that certain the Government would continue with its reform proposals and they were not quite clear about them.  The bottom line I came away with from those who voted "No" was that they wanted to retain the institution.  One can interpret any other reasons they may have had for voting "No".  It may be that they wanted meaningful reform of the House.  Perhaps they want meaningful reform of the other House.  Perhaps they are cursing all our Houses because we need to get our act together.  It has presented a challenge and it is incumbent on this House to rise to it.</p><p>One cannot have reform of one House without examining the other, because this House complements the D&aacute;il.  This is why the House exists.  One House cannot operate without the other under the current system.  We must examine how to make both Houses more efficient and relevant to the general public and to improving the lot of the citizenry, which is the main reason we entered politics.  The Taoiseach's nominations should be examined.  We should move to a situation somewhat similar to that in the House of Lords, where people continue to be appointed but there are also others.  A great body of expertise exists, which sometimes falls between the cracks.  A person may not be electable or may not want to put himself or herself before the public for election, but could still have a contribution to make.</p> <p>They make that contribution in other ways through civic society, and we see them all the time.  One often wonders how they never got involved in politics, but maybe that is just not the route they want to take.  I believe there should be a system of nomination that would fill in the cracks.  This could include, for example, former Ministers and former leaders of civic society, be they trade unionists, those from the public sector or those from the voluntary sector who have come towards retirement age and who have a vast range of expertise.  Why should we lose that?  The British do not lose it; they make use of it and it works for them.</p><p>The other aspect is the vocational panels, which should also be retained.  After all, the original intention of the de Valera initiative was that there would be a vocational aspect to this House, although how it works out in practice is something we need to look at.  It seems to me that the step of giving the franchise to the general public within the vocational panels, as suggested by the Zappone-Quinn Bill, is the way to go in that we would retain the panels and would have people with particular expertise in each area.  In fact, we should get the nominating bodies themselves to nominate people, as they do currently, but stop short of exclusively giving them the vote and instead extend the franchise.</p><p>I now have a somewhat jaundiced view of some of the nominating bodies, which I did not have prior to this referendum.  I actually met people who have the right to nominate people for this House who told me they could not discuss the issue because it was too political.  They said that, under their standing orders, they could not discuss the abolition or retention of this House by their executive committees, although one of them was a teaching union.  I wrote to every nominating body asking them to convene a meeting of their executive committees in order that they would then direct their membership to at least retain the right of nomination to the House, even if they were somewhat sceptical about the manner in which the House operated.  I got just two replies, one an acknowledgement and the other telling me that, under its standing orders, the body could not discuss the issue because it was political.</p><p>I also had the experience of meeting an individual from one of the agricultural nominating bodies who said &quot;We are not a political body.&quot;  I told him that the body had the right of nomination and asked him how nominations were processed.  I asked whether there was discussion and whether the body understood it was nominating somebody to a political Chamber.  He said he had not thought about it in those terms.  There is a need to perhaps examine the functions, mandate, responsibilities and obligations of the nominating bodies, although I do not believe they should be wiped away.</p></speech>

One that has been touched on by a number of Senators, including my colleague Senator Colm Burke, concerns EU legislation.  I see a significant role for this House in discussing and scrutinising EU legislation.  The majority of legislation now coming through the D&aacute;il comes from the EU.  I agree with Senator Burke in regard to the work programme.  The workload in this regard is quite significant and we should perhaps look to set aside, for example, two Fridays a month to deal solely with EU legislation.  I believe this House should take the lead on that.</p><p>My other suggestion is in regard to the Constitution.  The status of the current Constitution is very topical.  Although I do not have any scientific figures on it, there is a body of opinion that would suggest the current Constitution is not fit for purpose.  It is over 70 years since it came into existence and our society and the needs of our citizens have changed significantly over that time.  We need a holistic view of where we are now and where we see our country in 50 years' time.  There has been a huge amount of debate on this - for example, on the amount of time our courts spend dealing with challenges to the Constitution.  What I propose is a cross-party group that would look at drafting a new Constitution.  This group would have technical backup and it would come before this House and the D&aacute;il within ten or 11 months.  The document would be a discussion point, a focal point for people to think about where we see our country and what we need within our Constitution for a modern society.  That work would be very important and I believe this House should take the lead.  It would also be important to engage with the public on this through focus groups throughout the country.  This would be a very significant move in terms of political reform and is something the Seanad could champion.</p></speech>

There are many issues we now have to consider.  The 1 million people who voted on Friday looked for reform, not just of this House but, obviously, of all our institutions.  There are a number of areas where reform must be considered, particularly given that only 2% of the laws that come into effect in Ireland every year are debated by the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  We have an ongoing situation in which we exclude all those people who, under Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, are entitled to be Irish citizens - those in the North and those Irish living overseas in our diaspora.</p><p>My colleagues have previously discussed the issue of EU scrutiny, which is an area I have examined.  As the Leader knows, we recalled the Seanad this summer to look at one piece of legislation that was brought into Irish law by a Minister without debate, meaning no Deputy or Senator saw the legislation before he signed it into Irish law.  It happens with about 75% of the laws made in Ireland that Ministers use their powers under the 1972 Act, which is obviously unacceptable.</p><p>We talk about the scrutiny of EU directives, regulations and statutory instruments.  I pointed out on the Order of Business the scale of the laws that are coming into effect while bypassing these Houses.  One hundred and sixty four EU directives, 194 statutory instruments and 1,291 EU regulations were brought into effect in Ireland in one calendar year without proper scrutiny or debate, as opposed to 47 Acts of the Oireachtas.  That is the scale of the national democratic deficit.  However, there is no point in talking about our scrutinising of EU regulations unless we have the technical support to do so.  We cannot be expected to start scrutinising EU legislation without having staff available to us who will assist us in understanding its nature.</p><p>We have talked about our role under the Lisbon treaty.  In the first two years after Lisbon, 139 pieces of draft legislation came in from Europe, yet, of the 439 submissions made by EU Parliaments, Ireland made only one submission and even that one was ruled out of order.  This should tell us about our inability to engage correctly with EU legislation.</p><p>Another role is in regard to scrutinising Government appointments.  I am not for one moment defending the previous Government and the way it appointed people to Government agencies and roles.  However, this has to change.  I would go back to the issue I raised about the Irish overseas and in the North.  It is 184 years since O'Connell fought for Catholic emancipation, 95 years since women got the vote for the first time and 45 years since people marched in Derry just to have the right to a vote, yet we still deny the vote to more than 3 million people who are entitled to be Irish citizens, including 1.8 million in the North and 1.2 million who are living overseas and who have Irish passports.  That is nearly 40% of those who are entitled to be Irish citizens under Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  Only four countries in Europe deny a vote to their citizens overseas - ourselves, Cyprus, Malta and Greece.  When one considers that an emigrant leaves Ireland every six minutes-----</p></speech>

Of course, Irish emigrants are engaged and want to know what is happening at home and want people for whom they can vote to ensure the economic and social conditions improve in order that they can return.  The Constitutional Convention, of which I am a member, approved voting rights for Irish citizens in Presidential elections.  There are nine countries that extend voting rights to citizens only in presidential elections.  All of these Presidents have serious executive powers.  We are talking about giving our citizens abroad a vote in Presidential elections only, a role that is largely ceremonial, with some constitutional responsibilities.</p><p>There are three things we need to do: first, we need to examine the proposed legislation tabled by Senator John Crown on how we can reform this House without the need for another referendum.  Senators Katherine Zappone and Feargal Quinn also have a Bill and if these two Bills were merged, they could form a platform to move forward without the need for a second referendum on the Seanad.  The Leader has set up a Seanad consultation committee which could be the vehicle to bring all of the groups together without having to wait for another to take the leadership role in the process of inviting groups to debate how this Chamber can be changed for the better.  Could we consider inviting the JFK School of Government at Harvard University to look at our entire political system, the D&aacute;il, the Seanad and the permanent government which have not been sufficiently scrutinised?  I ask the Seanad committee to consider this suggestion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-10-08a.253" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1158" speakername="Martin Conway" time="20:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013100800047#VV00200"><p>I will take up the latter point made in Senator Mark Daly's contribution on inviting the JFK School of Government at Harvard University to examine our system of government.  I studied there briefly in the mid-1990s.  Were we to consider taking that line, the JFK School of Government would have a very interesting role to play, as would other academic institutions.  When I was in UCD, I studied American politics and comparative European politics as part of my course.  In most cases, citizens want their parliaments to have more power and be reformed, as they are not happy with the way they do business.  We are not unique in that sense.</p><p>The result of the referendum is very interesting and I look forward to the academic analysis of the &quot;No&quot; vote, in particular.  It would be very interesting to make a comparison between the votes cast in the referendum on the court of appeal and those case in the referendum on the abolition of the Seanad.  Some 65.2% voted in favour of establishing a court of appeal, whereas some 48.3% voted in favour of abolition of the Seanad.  Almost 25% of the population voted &quot;Yes&quot; in one instance and &quot;No&quot; in the other.  If one was to analyse this as an anti-Government vote, that would be incorrect.  One of every four who voted against abolition of the Seanad voted for its reform.  If they had wanted to give the Government a bloody nose, the percentage vote would have been more or less similar in both instances.</p><p>The debate has moved on.  Senator Maurice Cummins as Leader of the House has initiated the most radical reform of the Seanad in its history, which has gone unrecognised, to a large extent, in the media.  Initiatives such as bringing a representative of the Orange Order, former President Mary Robinson, Dr. Maurice Manning and others to the House have contributed significantly to debate and that process will continue.  That is a significant reform.  I understand that prior to that, initiatives of this type were not engaged in.  We have used the expert knowledge of Members such as Senator John Crown to identify the prevention steps that I have no doubt will feed into the Government's cancer strategy.</p><p>I would like to see the franchise extended.  I do not believe this House would serve a useful function as a replica of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  We, in this House, have the ability to scrutinise legislation, propose amendments and take a cold dispassionate view, as Members have more time to discuss and examine legislation.  That is an area that could be improved on without the need for another referendum.  We could extend the franchise easily without holding a referendum.  We have already passed a referendum on extending the university panels.  I am sure the Leader could enter discussions with the Government to implement that change in due course.  </p><p>We need opportunities to open the discussion on this issue in order that people can outline their understanding and beliefs in reforming this Chamber.  We have a critical role to play in the scrutiny of European legislation.  People consider that Ireland is very compliant in implementing European directives quickly, in particular the European environmental and food directives.  Let me give some examples.  A pub in west Clare or County Kerry will not be allowed to serve food, unless it complies with the very strict HACCP requirements, whereas in a country such as Italy or France, most sheebeens are serving food.  Both countries are member states, but we have a problem.  This House has a significant role to play not only in scrutinising EU legislation, but also in creating and reflecting informed opinion in Irish society in a mature and calm way.</p></speech>

They have done the State a service in that we have maintained one of the democratic institutions of State.</p><p>I am somewhat surprised by the result.  I had conceded to my colleagues that the temptation to dispense with 60 politicians would be irresistible, but I am happy that did not happen.  The debate showed a paucity of argument on the &quot;Yes&quot; side for the abolition of the Seanad.  That was sad and begs the question as to why a referendum was held.  It was a pet project of the Taoiseach.  I would not remove from the line of fire those senior civil servants who planted the seed in the first place in an bord snip nua.  Some in the Department of Finance were extremely anxious to do it.</p><p>The denigration of politicians during the campaign by people involved in the profession only fed into elements in the media who were constantly looking for avenues to denigrate the political classes.  As I said to some of them, unfortunately, as a consequence they are undermining our democracy.  I know of many good young people who have an interest in politics but would not touch it with a barge pole because of what is going on.  They do not want to put themselves in a position where they would be involved in a profession that could not stand up for itself.  That is regrettable.  It cost &euro;15 million to hold a referendum, of which the Taoiseach needs to be reminded.</p><p>I am amazed in the current climate that the person in charge of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation was given six or seven weeks to travel the country to campaign for the abolition of the Seanad.</p> <p>It showed a lack of focus on what needed to be done and what the priorities in government should be.  We have a 49% youth unemployment rate in County Wexford.  The Minister came to Wexford during the campaign, but I did not get an opportunity at a public meeting to make the point to him that his responsibility was to those who were unemployed and perhaps this task might have been more appropriate to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p><p>The public has decided that dismantling our democracy is not a recipe for real reform.  I hope this message will be learned by the Government.  Many of us in this House objected to its decision to abolish town councils.  The urbanisation of society and the challenges within urban areas all mean that there should be political leadership and political institutions to address these issues.  At this late stage I appeal to the Leader who was some influence with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to ask him to go each town and let the people decide whether they wish to retain their town council, as there is provision in local government legislation for the holding of a plebiscite.  I think the overwhelming answer would be to retain the town councils.  We need to respect democracy in this country and not try to engineer it in order that it suits our own political agenda.</p><p>We need real meaningful political reform, not just in the Seanad but across the two Houses of the Oireachtas.  The D&aacute;il is the main organ of the Oireachtas and has shown enormous group think.  It is extremely partisan in debates.  There is an urgent need to separate the Executive from the workings of the Oireachtas and the ordering of business.  Providing more hours is not reform.  The only effective reform I can think of in the past ten years in the D&aacute;il was the introduction, under a Fianna F&aacute;il Government, of Leaders' Questions.</p><p>The Presidency should also be examined.  It should be retained.  The President is the person with the strongest political mandate, in that he or she is elected by the people.  We should look at empowering the President with some executive functions, one of which could be a right to appoint two members of the Cabinet.  Why should the Taoiseach have the sole prerogative to make appointments to the Cabinet?  Two good independent people with expertise in different areas could be appointed.</p><p>The Seanad certainly needs reform, but I appeal to Members not to focus solely on the Seanad because we will only have a tinkering around the edges of it, rather than the overall context of political reform, which we need.  The Taoiseach said during the campaign that the Seanad was in some way responsible for the economic collapse.  Any impartial observer would say the dysfunctional nature of the D&aacute;il was a much larger contributor to it.  I would like to think we would not shy away from holding another referendum on the Seanad.  For example, I do not believe the Taoiseach's nominees should be taken out of the equation.  The Seanad would then speak with a more objective and independent voice on the business before it.  We would still not have a veto on legislation and the D&aacute;il could still overrule us, but that would be a better system.  We do not want the American system where we would have two Houses with equal status, which would lead to a logjam.  That is not the way to go either.</p><p>I compliment the Leader, as others have done.  One reform he should examine is allowing more time for some of these debates.  Some of them are too concentrated and in many instances we are only given sound bites.  I appeal to the Leader to allow for more adequate time to be allocated to these debates.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-10-08a.256" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1131" speakername="Fidelma Healy Eames" time="20:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013100800048#WW00200"><p>I thank the Leader for giving us time to discuss this very important issue.  We must start by asking what is political reform.   It is about changing the way we do politics, the way we manage to represent and integrate the people and solve the problems they are bringing to us which are real issues in society.  We received a mandate at the weekend to do this.  We can be sure of one thing: if the Seanad had been abolished on Friday, political reform would not be on the agenda.  In fact, it probably would not be considered in the D&aacute;il anymore.  We did not achieve this; the people achieved it for us.  We are now looking at reform across both Houses and, as others have pointed out, the other leg of the stool is local government.  It is a feeding process from top to bottom.</p><p>Some people even went so far as to write the word &quot;reform&quot; on their ballot paper.  I thought it was quite discerning of one or two returning officers to allow this without calling it a spoiled vote, risky though that was.  I heard Senator Martin Conway's analysis of the vote on the court of appeal and the Seanad.  I thought the people showed huge discernment in that regard.  They said they wanted a court of appeal, but that they did not want to throw out the Seanad.  They were able to say the Constitution mattered and that there were safeguards in it.  Let us not, therefore, throw out the baby with the bath water; let us improve democracy and how we do politics.</p><p>The Leader will be taking a lot of feedback from everybody here.  I would like to put into the pot what others have said, such as references to the Bills introduced by Senator John Crown and by Senators Feargal Quinn and Katherine Zappone.  The Leader should take written submissions from the various parties and individual groups such as the Reform Alliance which Senator Paul Bradford and I are representing.  While we will all say our piece, it will be good to see who will put their piece in writing.</p><p>I would like to see a vote for all citizens.  I would also like to see a non-partisan approach in the House; in other words, we should get rid of political parties.  Somebody referenced Michael O'Regan's point today that this should be a House in which there is more policy and less politics.  I agree.  The other House can be more partisan, but this should be the thinking House and the pulse of the nation.  We should vote on policy by a simple vote and then pass it to the D&aacute;il to legislate.  We can initiate legislation here also.  I agree with the idea of having panels of experts put to the people to vote on.  There might be some merit in having regional quotas, as we do not want all of the experts to come from Dublin.  There could be a very considerable role in scrutinising EU legislation and Government appointments.  There is a major body of work to be done.  A Seanad election should take place mid-term in order that any Seanad would span two Government terms.  I would like to see considered the proposal we placed on the Order Paper, No. 8, that all of this be gathered by 20 February 2014.  We must have a deadline or it will not happen.  Unless we have a deadline, we will be levied with the insult of it being a talking shop.</p><p>We have done some good work duing this term, be it in the public consultation session and the young Senators session.  However, I am really disappointed with the people who have insulted this House from within this and the other House.  This is a House of Parliament and the people have decided to keep it.  I ask those who decided, following a rush of blood to the head, to insult it beyond all reasonable measure to reconsider withdrawing their remarks.  It was just a means to push people into a &quot;Yes&quot; vote, but the people were not fooled by it.</p></speech>

It was calm and dealt with the issue of reviving and reforming the Seanad, bringing about change and listening to what was discussed in the course of the campaign.  Often in election and referendum campaigns, emotion can take over and reflection can turn into argument.  A period of reflection on the future of democracy generally in this country is required.</p><p>Whether we like it or not, there is a disconnect between politics and the citizens of this country at present.  That disconnect is due in no small way to the economic woes of the country.  There is a need to re-align politics closer to the people.  I do not believe this is the right time for the country to have the knee-jerk reaction proposed by the Taoiseach of reducing democracy or the number of political fora.  It was never more important in this country, or in any part of the world, to have political dialogue and political fora so the views of the people can be expressed in a chamber that is representative of the people's views.  That is exactly what is done in this Chamber.</p><p>There is a need to review Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  Excellent proposals have been brought forward by various political parties and none, such as the proposals from Senators Crown, Quinn and Zappone.  They all deserve recognition and discussion.  Obviously, there is a requirement for a period of engagement on all of those documents.  I agree with Senator Healy Eames that there might be an opportunity for the office of the Leader of Seanad &Eacute;ireann to invite submissions from the general public and public interest groups outlining their views.  Instead of sending those submissions into an Oireachtas committee which is predominantly controlled by Members of the D&aacute;il, they should be brought before the Seanad through the office of the Leader.  That engagement with schools, universities and civic society might be an opportunity worth considering.</p><p>We cannot control our destiny and should not try to control it.  We must listen, reflect and decide on the best way.  Certainly, any future Seanad &Eacute;ireann must have an input from the general public with regard to who sits in these seats, and that can only be done by extending the vote to the general public.  That must happen.  It would bridge the disconnect that currently exists.</p><p>Following the result of the vote last Friday I believe this Chamber has been reinvigorated.  Countries such as France and Germany use their second parliamentary chamber to have debates on regional issues which affect their countries.  In the model of Irish democracy people tend to think the Irish parliamentary system is based on the British system.  It is not.  The provisions in the Constitution establishing both Houses of the Oireachtas were founded on the principle of the American Congress and Senate system.  The aim was to replicate that system.  If we are to do that, we must extend the universal franchise.  In the United States, every state sends two senators to represent it in the US Senate.  A state such as Wyoming, for example, with a population roughly the same size as that of greater Belfast, sends two senators to Washington, the same number as states such as California and Texas, which are the most populous states in the United States.</p><p>We must take all of that into consideration and look at how other parliaments operate.  We should not simply rush into it just for the sake of political reform.  It should not be quick political reform, but the best possible political reform.  We should try to work together on this issue on both a cross-party and non-party basis.  We should show the general public that we are putting this issue above party politics, that we will try to achieve something that will outlast all of us in the years ahead and that it will provide the people with a voice in this Chamber.</p></speech>

It has been a very constructive debate and I thank the large number of Members who contributed to it.  We will take on board all of the suggestions that were made.</p><p>A number of Members suggested that we should have a period of reflection.  It is important that we have that and that we do not jump into making quick decisions.  We must make the right decisions.  Certainly, written submissions on the matter from Members, groups and parties would be more than welcome.  It would make my job easier in collating all the information put before the House this evening.</p><p>Naturally, EU legislation, directives and work programmes have been mentioned.  To do that properly we would require some technical assistance.  Whether the area of EU scrutiny could be designated to the Seanad and Members given the technical backup to do the job properly is a matter which should be considered by the Government, and I will certainly put that forward.</p><p>Many Members referred to the issue of political reform, including local government, the other House and committees.  Many supported what I have said with regard to committees, namely, that there should be a committee week in the Oireachtas rather than have committee meetings taking place at the same time as plenary sessions.  The system is not working at present.  It would be of assistance to all Members of the House if there was a committee week-----</p></speech>

I will certainly put it forward as a reform which this House would suggest for the other House, since the other House is making a lot of suggestions about this House.  However, I do not wish to be facetious and I agree that if we come up with reforms that we wish to implement, we will need the support of the other House in terms of passing them through that House as well.  There is, and will be, a need for co-operation in that regard.</p><p>The 1979 referendum extending the franchise to all graduates was mentioned on the Order of Business and was raised by a few Members in this debate.  That should be acted upon.  The legislation that would be required should not prevent us from doing that.  A motion from this House asking the Government to implement the provisions of that referendum should be forthcoming in the next number of weeks.</p><p>As I said in my opening remarks regarding the basis for reform of the House, we have a number of reports, particularly the last all-party report and the Bills from Senators Crown, Quinn and Zappone.  That should be the basis of the reform.  Despite what we say about Taoiseach's nominations and so forth, changes of that nature would require another referendum and I do not believe anybody has an appetite for another referendum on this issue.  I might be wrong, but that is my opinion.</p> <p>We must work within the system of legislation rather than go to the people again to change the whole shebang.  In that regard Senator Crown's Bill and the other Bill, plus the report chaired by the former Senator, Mary O'Rourke, are very important and we should take them on board.</p><p>I refer to other items raised.  Some speakers stated the vocational panel should be retained, others the reverse.  It must be retained, however, if we are not to have another referendum.  It will be difficult to reach agreement between all parties present as to what is the best way to elect the Seanad.  Many people will have their own seat in mind when they are thinking of this-----</p></speech>

I was surprised by the number of people who were so ill-informed, who I would have expected to know these functions.  Many commentators I believed would have known better made outrageous statements about what the House could and should do but they were ill-informed about the functions of the House.  </p><p>We have made progress on public consultation and have reformed in this area.  Consultation is working but can do better.  We were criticised for having the young &quot;Senators&quot; attend but as one who was present that day I believed the occasion worked very well.</p></speech>

The people certainly knew what they were voting for - that is evident when one considers the vote in the other referendum, on the court of appeal.  They are ahead of us in many regards.  Commentators suggested that people did not know what they were voting for and this may have been the case in a few minor instances but in general people are well informed.</p><p>Speakers mentioned the time available for debate in this House.  I will allow as much time as is necessary but we all know that for all the times I order statements and legislation, only a handful of Members will contribute.  We have done an excellent job on many items of legislation but others go through in half an hour because only two or three speakers are present.   We have to look at ourselves in that regard.  That is the type of behaviour people comment upon so we must look at the way we do our business.  If time is necessary for debate and legislation, however, it will be allowed.  The last thing I want to do with any legislation that comes to this House is to guillotine it and I have no intention of doing so unless it is emergency or financial legislation.  Times come, however, when we give an airing to Committee Stage of a single Bill over days and weeks and it is imperative for me to be able to say we have debated it at length.  That will happen only in exceptional cases and will happen less rather than more often.</p><p>I believe I have covered the majority of points raised.  I reiterate I would welcome written submissions from parties and groups.  The submissions we have had from the likes of Senators Crown, Quinn and Zappone now exist in Bill form and have been passed on Second Stage.  Their jump from Second Stage to Committee Stage is where we stand now and we must have reflection from all parties as to how we can knit this in and we can only do so much.  I am the Government representative in this House but as I speak I cannot give the exact position of the Government in regard to reform of this House.  It, too, needs time for reflection.  I will certainly bring the points raised tonight to the Government and I would welcome the co-operation of the House in having written submissions from parties and groups.  I hope we can all work together.</p><p>There will, of course, be votes.  In an ideal world there would be no Whip system but that is utopia and we all know it will not happen.  Any co-operation there can be in respect of legislation and prior debates, etc., would be appreciated.  The leaders of groups meet regularly.  I am not here to cause problems between groups, parties or individual Members.  I want the House to work well and I want co-operation between all Members.  I assure the House I will do my utmost to initiate reforms the House wants.</p></speech>

I refer to the workings of town councils throughout the country.  The Government's proposals, covered in the Putting People First policy document, are to abolish all 75 town councils and the five borough councils.  From meeting local town councillors and attending public meetings in places such as Letterkenny in County Donegal, I know this to be a retrograde step that would remove the layer of democracy closest to the people.</p><p>I offer the example of the cost of running a town council such as that in Letterkenny, which has nine elected members and a number of staff.  The town council has a budget of between &euro;8 million and &euro;9 million per annum.  The cost of running the council is &euro;80,000.  If that does not reflect value for money I am not sure what does.  The town has a population of approximately 20,000.  The council is deeply engaged with the Tidy Towns committee, is involved with 90 resident associations and is deeply rooted in all the sporting and voluntary organisations within the town council area.</p> <p>Moreover, it offers money back to the county council from the rates collected within the town.</p><p>The argument that these proposals will save substantial moneys does not make any sense whatsoever.  As such, I am calling for a period of reflection.  I appreciate that the legislation might already have been drafted, but I hope the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, will at least prove himself willing to accept amendments whereby some of the town councils in a position to prove their effectiveness and success would be retained.  To clarify, I am not arguing that all town councils should be retained.  However, having carried out my own survey of the 75 town councils and five borough councils throughout the country, I discovered that only 29 covered a population of 5,000 or fewer.  In other words, 51 of these fora are catering for a population of more than 5,000.  Why not set a population threshold whereby councils at or above that level and which can show they are economically viable and effective and have benefited the local community would be retained?  To use the example of Letterkenny, with a budget approaching &euro;10 million, the net cost to the taxpayer is &euro;80,000 in the form of salaries for council members.  The argument that savings will arise from laying off town council staff does not stand up because these staff will be redeployed in the local government sector.</p><p>Now is the time for the Government to reflect on its local government reform plan.  The people indicated in the referendum last week that they did not favour the abolition of the institutions of our democracy.  Town councils are the democratic fora which are closest to the people.  Given the outcome of the referendum, the Government should at least consider retaining some, if not all, of the effective, efficient and successful town councils throughout the country.  I am not sure whether the Minister of State will be able to give me the response I am looking for.  I ask, however, that she and her senior Minister take on board last week's vote and reflect on the points I have raised, with a view to accepting the amendments my party intends to table when the legislation comes before the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

I am glad to have the opportunity to provide some context and detail of the important issues he has raised.  </p><p>The Government's action programme for effective local government, published in October 2012, sets out proposals for a range of measures to reform and strengthen local government structures, functions, funding, governance and operational arrangements.  Chapter 6 of the action programme details the policy decision to replace town councils with a new comprehensive model of municipal governance based on principal towns and designed to strengthen local government within counties and address weaknesses and anomalies in the current system.</p><p>I fully acknowledge that many town councils have achieved successes for their communities.  I am convinced, however, that the strengths of municipal governance that have been a hallmark of these councils will be brought to bear on a wider basis in each county under the new arrangements which will see towns being united with their natural hinterlands.  Instead of talking about abolition, it should be recognised that a new model of municipal governance is being introduced in which municipal districts will cover the entire territory of each county, reflecting European norms, removing outdated boundaries and ending the anomaly of small towns having municipal status and dual representation, while certain larger centres and rural areas lack any sub-county governance.  The effect will be to enhance significantly both democratic leadership and accountability, on the one hand, and operational efficiency, on the other, within a far more cohesive and integrated system which reflects the realities of the 21st rather than the 19th century.</p><p>As well as creating a more rational and comprehensive structural arrangement, the new system will result in more effective and community focused decision making and implementation.  The successes of town councils such as Letterkenny have been achieved, despite limitations of powers and resources.  Under the new arrangements, there will be full integration of local authority resources across each county and the elimination of duplication both in administrative and electoral terms.</p><p>An important benefit of the new system will be a more appropriate assignment of local authority functions.  The performance of different functions by members at county and district levels will result in greater effectiveness than the current parallel town and county system which involves a significant element of duplication of functions.  The division of functions between county and district levels will be determined on the basis of what is most relevant to each level.  Local matters will be dealt with at municipal district level, while those of wider strategic application will be decided at county level, without duplication between county and district jurisdictions.  Elected members will perform a range of important reserved functions at district level on a fully devolved basis, subject to certain requirements relating to consistency with overall local authority policy.  By ensuring decisions are taken on a devolved basis and functions are carried out at the appropriate level within the county, the principle of subsidiarity will be strengthened in the local government system and the best features of effective councils such as Letterkenny will be retained and extended across the country.</p><p>The new arrangements will also address the extent of disparity in representation levels.  The local electoral areas recommended in the boundary committee report, published on 30 May 2013, will form the basis for configuration of the new municipal districts.  As is evident from the report, the committee was mindful of the need to integrate towns and boroughs into the new governance structures when determining the local electoral areas.  The electoral review also had a specific goal of achieving a better balance and consistency in representational ratios, having regard to the significant population changes that have taken place since the current numbers were decided.  The review also took particular account of factors such as the location of towns and local identities in the new municipal governance arrangement.</p><p>I am confident the new governance arrangements within counties will enable councillors to represent their constituents more effectively than under the current arrangements.  Work on the implementation of the reform agenda is proceeding rapidly and we will be moving shortly to the next phase with the publication of the necessary legislation to provide for the new arrangements, thus paving the way to deliver the benefits outlined in the action programme.  These include greater operational efficiency and representational effectiveness, getting more from the local government system, improving the range and quality of local government services for citizens and communities, maximising value for money for taxpayers, and ensuring local government can make a strong contribution to national recovery.</p><p>Most agree that radical change in the local government system is long overdue.  This is not about change for the sake of it.  It is about delivering a restructured and revitalised local government system that is capable of acting as the main vehicle of governance and public service at local level.  I am sure there will be room for proposals from Members on Committee Stage.</p></speech>

I disagree, however, with the fundamental approach being taken.  The Department can dress it up however it likes, but the reality is that we are seeing a stripping of powers from local authority members at both town and county level.  This is of particular concern in a context where Irish Water is set to subsume all of the relevant functions for which councillors have formerly been responsible.</p><p>Where the town council model has worked well, towns throughout the country will, as a result of these proposals, lose an important local democratic forum.  In addition, pressure will come on other areas within the extended rural electoral area because ratepayers and people in these areas will not be able to meet the demand-----</p></speech>

I appreciate his taking time from a busy schedule to respond to the issue I am raising.  I am taking the opportunity to seek clarification and reassurance on behalf of ESB workers in the context of the recent revelation of a significant shortfall in that company's pension fund.</p> <p>I have been contacted on a daily basis over the past number of weeks by ESB workers throughout Laois, Offaly, Kildare and the midlands.  The ESB is a strong, well-respected and valued employer.  Generations of families have been employed in the ESB throughout the midlands over the years.  There is unnerving news that the ESB pension scheme is in deficit to the tune of between &euro;1.6 billion and &euro;1.7 billion.  It is difficult to see how it can occur in a highly successful and profitable semi-State company with international status.  It pays substantial annual dividends to the State on behalf of the taxpayer.</p><p>An area of concern to the workers is that the management has unilaterally changed the status of the pension scheme from a defined benefit scheme to a defined contribution scheme.  I fell victim to the same thing when I was employed in the newspaper industry.  That also rings alarm bells for workers looking forward to retirement in years ahead and the significant impact it will have on their entitlements.  Due to the financial flux in the sector and the industry over the past number of years, Waterford Crystal workers were left high and dry.  It is not a parallel but it rings alarm bells.  In companies in the private sector, pension schemes are seeking a writedown from the Pensions Board in respect of exposure and what is due to workers.  I hope the Minister can bring clarity and reassurance to the area, particularly because the ESB pension scheme is the largest funded pension scheme in the country, with liabilities in the region of &euro;5 billion.  This is a worrying signal to all workers in the public, private and semi-State sectors if they cannot rely on, and trust, a pension scheme in a gilt-edged company such as the ESB.  What hope do workers in other companies have when they do the prudent thing and contribute on a weekly basis to their pension for retirement?</p></speech>

I understand the issues concerning the ESB pension scheme, which has some 13,700 members, need to be handled sensitively and carefully.  I am pleased to provide what information I can, which was provided to my Department by the ESB.</p><p>In late 2008, the trustees of the ESB superannuation scheme brought forward the tri-annual valuation of the scheme by one year to assess the financial health of the scheme.  The actuarial valuation to 31 December 2008 showed an ongoing valuation deficit of &euro;1.9 billion and a minimum funding standard deficit of &euro;1.8 billion.  As required by the scheme rules, the ESB and the ESB group of unions formed a working group to assess how best to address the reported deficit and to protect as far as feasible the interest of the ESB and the current members of the scheme.  The ESB reached an agreement with staff in 2010 to resolve the pension deficit.  That agreement closed the scheme to new entrants, it broke the link between salaries and future pension increases and introduced a solvency test for future pension increases.  The measures adopted under that agreement have, I understand, had a positive effect, resulting in the scheme actuary recently reporting that the scheme is now in balance on an on-going actuarial basis.</p><p>Aside from the on-going actuarial position, the Pensions Board also requires the ESB scheme to assess whether it could meet a certain prescribed standard, known as the minimum funding standard, MFS.  This effectively tests whether the scheme could meet all its current obligations if it were wound up immediately, in other words, if everyone retired from the company on Friday.  Neither the Government nor the ESB envisages the winding up of the scheme or everyone retiring on Friday but, regardless, the scheme is currently still required to meet the requirements of the minimum funding standard.</p><p>I understand that the scheme actuary reported at the end of 2011 that the ESB scheme, like many others, did not at that time satisfy the MFS requirements.  I assume this is the deficit to which Senator Whelan is referring in his question.  I understand that the Pensions Board does not require the MFS deficit to be addressed immediately but does require that a plan be developed to address it over a reasonable time.  I am informed that the trustees of the ESB scheme, with the agreement of ESB, submitted a funding plan to the Pensions Board, which was approved in October 2012.  I am also informed that this plan aims to eliminate the deficit by 2018 and that this plan remains on track.</p><p>In common with other companies where the Irish Government is the principal shareholder, the scheme is governed by legislation and supplementary regulations.  I understand that, in the event of a deficit arising in the scheme, the regulations require that the relevant parties meet to agree a mechanism to address the deficit.  I understand that in August 2013 solicitors on behalf of a small number of members of the ESB scheme served a plenary summons on solicitors for the ESB and therefore the issue is subject to judicial proceedings.</p><p>Finally, with regard to the manner in which the ESB accounts for the scheme in its financial statements, my Department has been assured by the ESB that, having taken expert legal and financial advice, the company is entirely satisfied that the current accounting treatment for the scheme is correct and in accordance with applicable laws and international accounting standards.  I trust that this provides some clarity to the Senator.</p></speech>

In the matter he raised, I would like to respond by saying it is not on the part of the Senators that the schedule was changed at 2.30 p.m to reschedule the business of the House.  I had anticipated the question would be taken at 6 p.m.  With no disrespect, the question was tabled last Wednesday and deferred at the Minister's request to be taken this week at a more suitable time.</p><p>I am grateful for the response but for the ESB workers it is a worrying transformation in how the pension scheme is being handled and dealt with in the company.  The ESB group of unions is going so far as to describe it as a pensions crisis.  From speaking to workers, it is leading to unease and some of them are talking about industrial action and unrest.  No more than the workers, the Minister would not relish that outcome if the workers did not find comfort in the reassurances of the ESB.  The last thing we need heading into the winter months is industrial unrest from a company of such strategic importance to our economic recovery as the ESB.</p></speech>

The last thing the country, the economy and private domestic consumers need is industrial unrest.  I genuinely do not believe there is any serious cause for industrial unrest.  The ESB pension scheme is absolutely sound.  There is no comparison of any kind to be drawn with Waterford Glass and the tragic circumstances that happened there or in any other private failed pension scheme.  The ESB pension scheme is one of the most robust in the country.  It is not the fault of the ESB unions or the ESB management that the pensions board requirement in respect of the application of minimum funding standards has created a situation whereby a scheme that previously was in sync now has a temporary deficit, but the plan entered into between the trustees and the company will bring the fund back in sync by 2018.  I am aware, of course, that judicial proceedings are pending and it is not for me to comment on what will happen in the courts.  However, I honestly believe that the pension scheme is sound.  I can understand why it is so important for the workers concerned but in my best judgment there is not any cause for concern or unease on their part.  Everybody knows that the ESB is not going to close down on Friday evening, nor will all the employees be going out on pension at the weekend.

I raise the question of an individual who has a university degree from Cork and proceeded to a master's degree in the University of Ulster.  It appears the individual had to apply to the Department for recognition of the qualification from the University of Ulster.  I am a little concerned about a letter from the Department of Health which states that non-Irish dietetic qualifications are assessed under Directive 2005/36/EC.  I was not aware that a qualification from a university in Northern Ireland was regarded as non-Irish.  This person has an offer of a job in Ireland but cannot take up the position because a master's degree awarded in Northern Ireland is not recognised by the Department.  The Department wrote to the person on 11 September 2013 and said it would give its decision on or around 23 December 2013.  I find this amazing that someone who has a primary degree from a university in Cork and is awarded a master's degree in Northern Ireland must wait up to six months from the time of application for recognition of this qualification by the Department of Health.  I ask why this is taking six months for a person who is from Cork, who went to school in Cork, who has a degree from Cork and who has been offered a job.  The reason the person went to Northern Ireland is that it was the only place where further studies in this particular area could be pursued.</p></speech>

I am answering on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, although I do not have any expertise in the matter.  However, I will read the Minister's statement on the record of the House for the information of Senator Burke.</p><p>At present there is no system of statutory registration for dietitians in Ireland.  The health and social care professionals' council, CORU, which was established in March 2007, provides for statutory registration of 12 separate health and social care professions, including dietetics.  The Dietitians' Registration Board has been established and is expected to open its register by the end of this year.</p><p>One aspect of statutory registration is the possession of an approved qualification.  In the absence of statutory registration, persons are free to work in the private health sector in Ireland without having their qualifications recognised.  However, persons wishing to work in the publicly funded health sector in Ireland who have obtained their qualifications outside the Twenty-six Counties must apply to have their professional qualifications recognised under Directive 2005/36/EC.  This directive applies to all EEA nationals wishing to practise a regulated profession in an EEA member state other than that in which they obtained their professional qualifications.  Its intention is to make it easier for certain professionals, including health professionals, to practise their professions in European countries other than their own, but due safeguards are provided in the assessment of qualifications for public health and safety and consumer protection.  The professional qualifications directive applies to a range of professionals, not only health professionals, and the Department of Education and Skills has overall responsibility for qualification recognition policy in Ireland.</p><p>Dietetics is a regulated profession for the purposes of the professional qualifications directive.  Where statutory registration does not exist for a profession in Ireland, non-Irish qualifications are assessed for their equivalence to the Irish entry-level qualifications required to work in the public health sector.  The directive provides for mutual recognition of qualifications for certain professions.  In the case of the health and social care professions, including dietetics, the directive does not provide for automatic recognition of professional qualifications obtained in another member state.  It provides for an assessment, on a case-by-case basis, of the formal qualifications and professional experience of an applicant against the qualifications required to practise in the host member state - in other words, Ireland.  If deficits are identified, an applicant must be offered a compensation measure - that is, the choice of completing an adaptation period or taking an aptitude test.  Because of the case-by-case nature of the assessment, the directive provides that applications must be acknowledged within one month and the applicant informed of any missing document.  A final decision must be communicated to the applicant within four months of submission of a complete application.</p><p>Under SI 139 and 166 of 2008, which transpose the professional qualifications directive into Irish law, the Minister for Health is the competent authority for the assessment of dietetic qualifications.  The Department of Health is advised on applications for recognition by the professional body, the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute.  There are currently no applications on hand which exceed the specified timeframe and in general, in the case of dietetics, applications are processed in a much shorter time.</p></speech>

It is unfortunate that the Department has issued a letter to state that a qualification from Northern Ireland is termed as a non-Irish qualification.  It is unfair and it is not justified.  The clarification that such persons can work in the private sector is not what the individual was advised.  It is interesting that this clarification is now given because the individual was advised he could not work at all without recognition by the Department.  I thank the Minister for that clarification.  The correspondence that my constituent received clearly indicates that a decision is not expected to be made until 23 December 2013.</p></speech>

I do not know whether that is of any assistance in this particular case.</p> <p>I am bound to say that I cannot disagree with Senator Burke.  If we are talking about a recognised validated university in Northern Ireland, I am not exactly sure why it ought to be seen as non-Irish in terms of recognition here.  I know that dietitians have over very many years fought for recognition within the social care system but I was unaware that this is the disposition towards universities based in Northern Ireland.  I will be happy to take this up with the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, as I do not know the background to it.</p></speech>

This question is exercising many people at this point and the Edward Snowden scandal was a wake-up call with regard to what can happen with the sharing and usage of data for inappropriate purposes.  It is again a question of what is inappropriate, which is anybody's guess.  I make a distinction between information provided for security reasons and that which relates to personal data.  A European Commission survey confirms 72% of Europeans do not feel in control of the data they have disclosed on social network sites and 90% indicate that having their data protection rights respected whenever data is collected or processed is very important.  That is clear.</p><p>Since the Snowden affair we have heard from Commissioner Reding that she has put strong rules on the table that will ensure companies offering products and services to European customers will have to play by European rules, even if the companies are based in the US, Asia, India or anywhere else.  National data protection authorities will be able to sanction firms that violate the rules.  There is a difference between how the US and EU, for example, regulate data privacy, and that has been recognised for a long time.  In the US, data can be processed unless the act is specifically prohibited but in the EU, personal data cannot be processed unless the task is specially authorised.  There is a difference but companies outside the EU work here under the guise of guidelines and self-regulation; we need to get to a point where companies outside the EU but operating within the Union and providing services abide by EU regulations, laws and rules rather than those from the home country.</p><p>It is an important issue and Commissioner Reding has indicated strong rules have been put on the table to control the matter.  Will the Minister of State detail Ireland's view on this and how we will move forward in the area?  We have guidelines and proposals from Commissioner Reding but we need to act swiftly to give users of the Internet confidence that their personal data is not being used or abused for services they do not want.  I accept that information is needed for security reasons in the fight against terrorism - we all need to feel safe and secure on our streets - but private data can be used by companies for reasons other than that for which it was surrendered in the first place.  We need to move swiftly, as the media reaction following the Snowden affair has alarmed many people and suggested that private data is not secure.</p></speech>

At the outset, I thank Senator Clune for raising this important subject, which is relevant to all of us who use the Internet, whether for commercial, personal or leisure purposes.  By way of introduction, I should state that general issues of Internet security are matters for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and his Department, whereas data protection policy falls within the area of responsibility of the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p><p>Communication networks and information systems have become an essential component of both our economic systems and social life.  All of us here today have witnessed an information technology revolution in our lifetimes, and the pace of change shows no sign of slackening.  Electronic communication systems and networks have become necessary utilities almost the same as electricity or water supplies.  The security of those networks and information systems is therefore a matter of utmost concern, not only for business but for individual citizens.  Security breaches, whether they arise from accidental loss, mistakes or unauthorised access such as hacking, pose a threat for businesses and for individuals alike.  They also put at risk the trust and confidence of users of the Internet services which are essential to the continued development of the digital economy and the economic growth and job creation potential of this dynamic sector.</p><p>The threats to Internet security are continuously changing.  The European Union has reacted by establishing the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security, ENISA, to raise awareness of network and information security and to develop and promote a culture of network security in society for the benefit of citizens, consumers, businesses and public sector bodies.  It also assists member states in enhancing and strengthening their capability to prevent, detect and respond to network and information security breaches.  Specific safeguards for the protection of personal data, which also apply in respect of the processing of such data in the Internet context, are also in place at European Union level.  I would like, on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, to take this opportunity to briefly set out the background.</p><p>The centrepiece of existing EU legislation on personal data protection is Directive 95/46/EC, which seeks to reconcile the protection of personal data with the free flow of such data within the Internal Market and to countries outside the EU.  It has been transposed into Irish law in the Data Protection (Amendment) Act 2003, which supplements the Data Protection Act 1988.  This legislation requires all those handling personal data to take appropriate security measures against unauthorised access to, or unauthorised alteration or disclosure of, the data, in particular where processing operations involve the transmission of such data over a network.  In determining what is appropriate in any particular case, account must be taken of the risk of harm that might result from security breaches and the state of technological development and costs of implementation.  These security measures also apply where data are transferred to a destination outside the European Union.</p><p>The 1995 data protection directive has been supplemented by other more specific legislative measures, such as the e-privacy directive which applies to providers of publicly available electronic communications services, namely, telecom providers and Internet service providers.  This directive requires such companies to take appropriate measures to safeguard security of their services and to protect the confidentiality of communications and related traffic data.  In January 2012, the European Commission tabled proposals for a reform of the current data protection framework and these proposals are currently being discussed separately in the Council of the European Union and in the European Parliament.  These proposals, if implemented in their current form, would provide substantial extra protection for the privacy of citizens across Europe.</p> <p>It is generally recognised that the 1995 directive's standards need to be updated to take account of more recent developments such as the increased usage of mobile phones, cloud computing, social networking and increasing globalisation of data transfers.  Key features of the existing legislation, including the need for appropriate security measures, remain part of the reform agenda.  The proposed regulation's enhanced data protection standards will, when agreed, apply directly in all member states without the need for transposing national legislation.</p><p>Achieving progress on the reform proposals was a priority of the Irish Presidency and I am pleased that substantial progress was achieved on key aspects of the reform package.  The reform proposals remain a priority for the current Lithuanian Presidency.  A detailed debate on an important aspect of the reform proposal took place at a meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council in Luxembourg yesterday, which the Minister attended and participated in.  However, it is not possible to predict when agreement between the Council and the European Parliament can be reached.</p></speech>
