Niall, his son, another former Deputy, is a friend of mine.  The service will be held tomorrow.  I thank Harry and his family for their dedication and service to the State over many generations.</p><p>  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Finance about the status of the Mercer report on bank pay and conditions?  I asked him last week to obtain a commitment from the Government that the proposed cuts of between 6% and 10% would be heavily weighted against the executives and board members of the two pillar banks and Permanent TSB, the banks over which we have control.  Over the weekend I noted with great interest the statement of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, that bankers' pay should be cut substantially at executive level.  I agree wholeheartedly, but I cannot marry his comment with the fact that he decided to abstain from voting on the pay of executives in Bank of Ireland.  The Minister, on behalf of the people, holds a 15% stake in that bank, yet he chose to remain silent despite the fact that senior executives in the bank will have pay packages of over &euro;800,000.  The governor of the Bank of Ireland who works in a part-time capacity has a pay packet of nearly &euro;500,000.  The Government decided it had no opinion on it.  While it was great to read his opinion in the<i> Irish Independent</i> on Saturday that the levels of pay were unsustainable, why, then, did he not use his vote on behalf of the people when the remuneration package was put to the shareholders of Bank of Ireland last week?  I am still at a loss to understand why.</p><p>  Will the Leader update the House and arrange a discussion on the negotiations on Croke Park II which was an abject failure?  The Government, including the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, in particular, failed completely to allow and enable a deal to be done with the trade unions.  This is the first time in 25 years we have not been able to bring the trade unions in the public sector on board.  After the vote resulted in defeat, I welcomed the fact that the Minister had put Mr. Kieran Mulvey in charge to talk to the union side and determine whether we could move forward in some way.  The Government gave Mr. Mulvey two weeks and  within three days it was briefing against the public sector.  Again, there were threats that it would cut pay and pensions.  There was a threat of a 7% arbitrary cut across the board and the threat to job security is being made again.  Why can the Minister and others not just keep their mouths shut and let the negotiations happen in a respectful manner and in private?  Three days after the appointment of Mr. Mulvey to try to bring forward a resolution and a way forward, the Government was briefing against the public sector.  The public sector carries out an extremely important role.  I include garda&iacute;, firefighters, teachers, nurses and staff in all Departments.  How in God's name can one expect to get a deal if one is threatening people with a 7% cut across the board?  That is not the way to do business.  In the next couple of weeks I would like the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to explain in the House the Government's position.  I again formally call on the Government to withdraw the threat of an arbitrary cut of 7% across the board should a deal not be reached.</p></speech>

We all await the outcome of that process.</p><p>I also welcome the announcement today of the creation of 1,000 construction jobs in the planned upgrade of the N7 and N11.  As a very welcome consequence, we will see the removal of the bottleneck at Newlands Cross.  This is a really important deal.  It is worth &euro;282 million and will provide some comfort to those who have lost jobs in the construction sector.  It is a very welcome announcement.</p><p>I seek a debate on the levels of autism in Ireland.  The survey commissioned by Irish Autism Action is examining the prevalence of autism in Ireland.  I hope that before long this House will have before it the Private Members' Bill that was accepted in the D&aacute;il, the autism Bill brought forward by my Labour Party colleague, Deputy Michael McCarthy.  While I hope there will be a debate on that Bill in the House, we might also have a general debate on the prevalence of autism in Ireland and the best methods of education for children with autism.</p><p>Finally, the Cabinet meeting today has adjourned.  We understand it was considering the heads of a Bill on the X case, 21 years after the Supreme Court judgment in that case.  It is welcome that heads of a Bill have been prepared and are being discussed by the Cabinet with a view to providing clarity, at last, to doctors, pregnant women and their families as to the criteria which may be applied where a doctor needs to intervene to save a woman's life.</p></speech>

I also extend my sympathy to the family and loved ones of the former Deputy and Parliamentary Secretary, Dick Barry.  I had the pleasure of meeting him at the funeral of the former President, Mr. Patrick Hillery.  I hope there will be an opportunity to pay tribute to him.  He was certainly a gentleman.  He told me some very interesting things about his early days in Leinster House.</p><p>I also wish to be associated with what my cousin, Senator Michael Mullins, said last week about the costs associated with the treatment of patients who have alcohol-related problems in Galway, with over &euro;22 million having been spent in the past five years in Galway hospitals and 35,000 bed days having been occupied.  Considering how much time we spend talking about saving money, can we not get smart for the future and tackle the problem of alcohol abuse in this country with more aggression?

His brother Philip is extremely well known.  I must confess a church connection because I sang in the church choir with him at one time.  Joseph Treacy has spoken critically about the availability and marketing of alcohol and how it is the slickest campaign we have ever seen.  We must respond with particular measures to discourage the abuse of alcohol in our society, and not delay about it.</p><p>I understand the Cabinet meeting has adjourned.  I do not know if that is just for the optics, but I wish to pay particular tribute to my fellow Galwegians, Senator Fidelma Healy Eames and Deputy Brian Walsh.

It is not a good idea that whatever the Government proposes to introduce in the draft heads of a Bill would be developed and discussed at the health committee first.  There is an unequal relationship between Deputies and Senators in that committee.  This is a life and death issue which should be discussed at the heads of a Bill stage in each House.  Senator Healy Eames and Deputy Brian Walsh have laid bare the fiction that this is about necessary medical or life-saving treatment.  All of that is just spin.  This is about a dangerous and destructive proposal to introduce abortion on a ground of threatened suicide for which there is no medical evidence.</p> <p>Last week we heard from more than 100 psychiatrists, representing 90% of those who responded, who are deeply concerned about the way their profession would be compromised by being drawn into something that is not evidence-based.</p></speech>

Even at this stage the issue needs to be stalled, not just adjourned until 5.30 p.m., until we can have a proper discussion about what constitutes a genuine, necessary medical intervention - which we would all support - and something that is really just a fiction masquerading as medical treatment designed to introduce abortion into Ireland.</p></speech>

The myth of laundered diesel being a victimless crime still abounds.  It costs a fortune to clean up the toxic waste that is dumped on the side of the road from the diesel laundering process and this is taking money out of the pockets of every taxpayer in the county.  Together with Senator Brennan I had the honour of attending the second meeting and the first instalment of the North/South Inter-Parliamentary Association last Friday.  On the fringes of the meeting we had a discussion with members of the Northern Ireland Assembly from the Border region.  They too are very concerned about this issue.  I call on the Leader to invite the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, back to the House to give an update on what measures are being taken to combat this criminal activity, particularly with regard to North-South co-operation on the matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-04-30a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1128" speakername="Paschal Mooney" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013043000006#E00700"><p>I join our group leader and others who have expressed their sympathy to the Blaney family on the sad passing of Harry Blaney, a former Deputy who served in these Houses between 1997 and 2002 and who continued a long and illustrious tradition of national politics for the Blaney family in Donegal.  I express our deepest sympathy to his wife and family.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.  Also, on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il group, I echo the comments of Senator Mullen in expressing our sympathy to the Leader and the Fine Gael party on the passing of Dick Barry, the former Deputy and Minister of State.  I first came around these Houses as a member of the Fianna F&aacute;il national executive when Dick Barry was coming to the end of his illustrious political career and had the pleasure of knowing him and his daughter, Myra, who, all would agree, was a great loss not only to the Fine Gael party but to national politics when she decided to retire from national politics.  I call on the Leader to convey to the Barry family the deepest sympathy of the Fianna F&aacute;il group on his sad passing.</p><p>I wish to alert the Leader to an issue that has been mentioned here frequently not only by my colleague Senator MacSharry but also by others as part of the ongoing campaign to have essential road works carried out on the N4 at Castlebaldwin, going into Sligo.  There was some good news last week and I pay tribute to all those involved.  I understand there will be an environmental impact assessment and a compulsory purchase order in the coming 18 months, which, I hope, will lead to the works being carried out.  Anyone who has travelled on the N4 will know that this stretch stands out like a sore thumb.  I pay tribute to the local campaign group, which kept this on the national radar.  Despite all the pressures on Government, it has responded to the activities of the campaign group.  Some 30 people have been killed on this stretch of road, which is only a couple of miles long; the most recent was killed in the last few weeks.  With all the crosses erected along the route, it looks more like a cemetery than a national primary route.  The reason I raise this issue - I thank the Cathaoirleach for his indulgence - is that the newspapers are reporting today that the president or chairman - I am unsure of his correct title - of the European Investment Bank has indicated that the bank would facilitate loans being provided for essential infrastructural works in the country.</p> <p>He cites a number of examples to which the Government has already committed, such as the N11 at Rathnew, Newlands Cross and the Gort road.</p></speech>

All I am asking is that we could have an opportunity, if the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, could come to the House in the context of the initiatives the Leader has embarked on, to question him on this, perhaps in the form of a question and answer session.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-04-30a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1161" speakername="John Kelly" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013043000007#F00400"><p>I raise the impending carbon tax on solid fuel, which will have effect from tomorrow.  I am concerned, as are members of the hardware industry, that this will result in a loss of jobs in that sector.  Apart from all that, it will be an added burden on struggling households.  People may not realise that in many cases, with families using up to three tonnes of coal per year to heat their homes, their carbon tax could amount to more than their property tax.  We should be very mindful of that.</p><p>When families are struggling and do not have money, they will look at other ways of providing their fuel.  They will look north and get their coal provided from Northern Ireland at a cheaper cost and at a VAT rate of 5%, as distinct from 13.5% here.  The sulphur content of coal in the North is 2%, whereas it is 0.7% here.  It is a serious concern.  When we realise it was a big mistake to levy this charge on coal, we will do what we did with diesel; we will give a rebate on costs.  Hauliers were driving out of this country and filling up in foreign countries to save hundreds of millions of euro.  Eventually we will address it, but we should do so before it is too late.  This year was the coldest winter I can remember in years, and the fodder crisis is evidence of that.  It is very important.</p><p>On the free fuel scheme, we should consider a voucher or smart card scheme, as has been highlighted by the hardware sector.  If the Exchequer is giving people a free fuel allowance and they are spending that money in Northern Ireland, we are losing money.  A voucher system would ensure they spent the money locally.  It is important that this be brought to the Minister's attention and that this decision be reviewed as a matter of urgency before we lose jobs as well as everything else.</p></speech>

I deprecate the level of hypocrisy, abuse and heckling that goes on from people who are opposed to this.  The real mistake was in 1983, when the theological position of one church in this country - that the fertilised egg represents a full human being - was instituted in the Constitution.  My church was very strongly against this.  The Constitution was not the place for that, and that is what has landed us in all this trouble.  Anybody who knows anything about reproduction knows that the female body sheds fertilised eggs all the time.  There is no doubt about that.  Millions will vanish unknown, and these are said to be full human beings.  That is the kind of logical impasse into which one drives one's self.</p><p>My colleague, Senator Mullen, talked about psychiatrists.  Apparently just over 100 spoke.  I understand the membership of the association is 800.  They tried to make out that 90% of those replied.  They wrote to 300 or 400 and approximately 100 replied.  That is a small proportion, and out of 800 it is minute.</p></speech>

I am not one to have a go unless there is a reason.  However, this week&rsquo;s Seanad schedule is very disappointing.  It is quite light on meaningful debate on serious legislation.  There also seems to be a significant lack of Ministers attending the House this week, which is not acceptable.  This is a trend that has been going on for the past several weeks.  This week we have three MEPs rolled out almost like a human shield to protect the Ministers.  I have no doubt the debates with them will be fruitful and meaningful, as was the debate with Pat The Cope Gallagher last week.  However, they should not take the place of robust and meaningful debate on the issues raised by Senators on the Order of Business over the past few weeks.</p><p>I am not laying the blame at the Leader&rsquo;s feet.  Perhaps it is at his behest.  Is there an issue with the Ministers?  Are they afraid of coming into the House because we give them too much of a hard time when they do?  Is it that they have so much disdain for this House and they feel it is already half abolished that they do not bother to come in at all?  What is going on that we are not getting Ministers in to debate issues of health, education, mortgage distress, poverty, equality, rural affairs, agriculture, direct provision and natural resources, all issues raised over the past several weeks?  It is about time the Ministers showed us the respect we deserve.</p><p>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business: that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, attend the House to discuss developments on Croke Park II, where the Government stands on it and why it is trying to bully the unions into taking a stance that they are obviously not going to take.</p></speech>

By intangible cultural heritage, UNESCO means all kinds of oral traditions of living expression of culture, as opposed to objects and monuments.  Music is an obvious and important example of an intangible cultural heritage.  I believe that by adding Irish music to the programme, we could have Irish traditional music, or at least some aspects of it, validated as part of UNESCO's list of intangible heritage of the world.  If we look to other recent examples, this could have a real impact on cultural tourism here.</p><p>I call on the Minister with responsibility for arts to work to ratify the UNESCO convention for the safeguarding of the intangible cultural heritage.  Ireland has yet to do so, while 142 other countries have already done so.  Ratifying the convention would be the first step towards having Irish music recognised in the UNESCO programme and is worth doing in itself.  Once the convention has been ratified, after a short interval of time a country is then in a position to nominate some aspect of its intangible cultural heritage to be inscribed by UNESCO on its list.  I believe Irish traditional music should be considered worth nominating.</p><p>Portugal was successful last year in applying for its Fado song tradition to be inscribed on the UNESCO list.  Following its successful application, there was a huge surge in activity around Fado and cultural tourism in the country.  I call for the Minister to look into this as I believe it would be worthwhile for Ireland.  </p><p>I would like to support Senator Brennan in his comments on tourism.  On a related issue, I hope the Government will maintain the 9% VAT rate on tourism services.  As Senator Brennan said, some 1.25 million trips to Ireland were taken by individuals between January and March this year, a huge increase which shows The Gathering is having an effect and that sporting events are also having a significant impact.  I believe the VAT decrease has been an integral part of the increase in tourism and in leaving tourists with a pleasant taste in their mouths when leaving the country.  I call on the Minister to retain the VAT rate at the reduced rate for the coming year.</p></speech>

I would also like to be associated with the vote of sympathy to the family of Dick Barry, with whom I served in the House and with his daughter Myra, two excellent Deputies who made history by being a father and daughter combination from the one constituency.  Myra was elected in the by-election of 1979.  Everyone who knew Dick would say that he left a lasting impression on all who met him.  He was a wonderful character and Deputy and we are sorry to hear of his passing.</p><p>I would like to reiterate the comments made by Senator Denis O'Donovan two weeks ago with regard to the fodder crisis.

The Government does not have a co-ordinated policy to deal with the issue.  When Fianna F&aacute;il was in power, all the farming organisations would be outside Leinster House protesting on such an issue, but that would not be necessary because the former Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith, would have taken decisive clear action.  Some 846 cattle have been picked up dead by a company in east Galway in the past seven days.  These cattle will never be replaced.  Cows with calves cannot even get up and are dying.</p> <p>When one goes through the countryside and sees the devastation, it is unbelievable.

It states that the Department of Health increased the amount decided by the Health Insurance Authority as an appropriate compensation for the treatment of old people by 53% over what the referee had recommended, resulting in an increase from &euro;190 to &euro;290.  We will soon have a distinguished sports person in the House, and I am delighted the Leader has invited him.  However, I do not believe overturning referees' decisions to that degree would be accepted in any part of society.</p><p>  We have to cast serious doubt on whether the Department of Health has any bona fides when it adjudicates between competing health insurance companies.  The intervention in this case was disgraceful and will cost the consumer &euro;30 million.  Given the Milliman report, which the Leader kindly placed in the Oireachtas Library, we have always said in the House that this whole thing is bogus.  When the Southern delegates were in Stormont last Friday, Professor Charles Normand, who previously worked at Stormont and is now at Trinity College, Dublin, and the secretariat from the North also cast serious doubt on this piece of folklore that old people need to have their health insurance compensated by other people.  It seems that, more and more, it is just an excuse for the Government to keep on bailing out VHI.</p> <p>We should debate the basis of subsidising health insurance companies according to customer age and the movement of all of this away from the Department of Health, which has such a dreadful record in so many ways, to the financial services regulator and the Central Bank because health insurance is a financial service.  This latest intervention casts even more doubt on whether the Department of Health has ever been sincere or neutral in adjudicating between competing health insurance companies.  It should not have decided to increase the amount of the independent award by 53% in a couple of months.  We must address this because the result is that fewer and fewer people will take out health insurance, particularly the young, and when we have compulsory health insurance, goodness knows what it will cost if the Department of Health is in charge of the pricing.  </p></speech>

I reiterate that call today for a different reason.  I want to discuss with him what is happening in the central medical card office.  Obviously, it must have cleared the backlog of applications because it has now embarked on a campaign of reviewing everyone with a medical card.  Many people issued with medical cards until 2020 are now being reviewed and in many cases, being denied cards following the review.  In particular, many people received discretionary medical cards due to serious illness and did not receive them lightly.  They received the cards because they were extremely ill but the cards are now being taken off them as well.  I want the Minister to come here and answer questions from us as to why this is happening and why he feels it necessary to review people whose circumstances have not changed since they last applied for cards but who are now being refused them.</p></speech>

I did not know Dick Barry personally but I certainly know Myra Barry.  As a Munster colleague, I found her to be an exceptionally good and forward-thinking politician.  I express my sympathy to the Blaney family on the death of Harry Blaney, particularly to his sons Niall, a loyal former Deputy, and Liam, a county councillor in Donegal.  There always has been a strong family connection between the Blaney family and my home town of Listowel for reasons that are too complex to go into.  It has much to do with their holidays.  I take this opportunity to extend the sympathy of the community in Listowel to the Blaney family.</p><p>I previously raised the absence of Parkinson's disease-trained nurses in the south.  Articles published at the weekend prompt me to repeat my call for the Minister for Health to come to the House to discuss a clear inequity in the system whereby Parkinson's disease-trained nurses are found in the west, north and, naturally, Dublin but not in the greater Munster area where a very prominent neurologist described what we are facing as akin to an epidemic because the number of patients with Parkinson's disease will double in the next ten years due to the aging population.  </p><p>I also wish to touch on the imminent publication of the Government's position on dealing with the X case.  I welcome the fact that it has finally agreed the heads of a Bill we can examine.  I hope it will be debated at an early stage, as Senator Mullen requested - even at heads of Bill stage.  I also express the hope that the debate will be conducted in a very gentlemanly or ladylike and proper manner.  I have never commented on this before.  There has been so much pre-emptive debate on this issue in the past six months and very strong voices on both sides of the argument have been heard.  I respect the rights and opinions of those people but there are many other people whose opinions have not been heard.  There is a middle ground somewhere.  My parliamentary party will discuss it and I will make known my views known there.  Let everyone have a fair share.  Nobody will be bullied in a debate no matter what side they are on.  We all have minds of our own and have all had to do our thinking for ourselves.  It is very difficult but I hope the debate will be conducted in the manner I outlined.  </p></speech>

I met him on a number of occasions and was particularly friendly with his daughter Myra.  I know he made a major contribution to politics over the years.  I also extend my sympathy to members of the Blaney family in Donegal on their loss.</p><p>I am disappointed Senator Leyden is playing politics with the difficulties experienced by the farming community.  </p> <p>He knows full well that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, is working very closely with the co-ops, the financial institutions and the farming organisations and has provided subsidised transport to ensure badly needed fodder is brought into the country as a matter of urgency.  The Minister has taken this matter seriously from the word go and has been working on this project with the farming organisations for the past few months.  We need solidarity rather than division between politicians in respect of the task the Minister is undertaking.</p><p>Will it be possible for the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, to come to the House for a discussion about the length of time it is taking to have applications for carer's allowance and disability pensions and benefits processed?  This is unacceptable, particularly applications for carer's allowance.  It is taking medical personnel too long to review appeals.  We want to keep elderly people in their homes for as long as possible and out of nursing homes.  The carer's allowance is critical in achieving this.  It is totally unacceptable that in some cases it can be up to six months before anybody looks at these appeals.  I would like for the Minister to come here to discuss how we can streamline the process and get more timely results and decisions from the Department.</p></speech>

I was not acquainted with Dick Barry, but I knew Harry Blaney for many years when he was in this House and before when we were both members of the General Council of County Councils.  He was an absolute gentleman, one whose heart was always in the right place.  He epitomised the ethos and values within our party and was always prepared to stand up and defend them.  That challenge faces many of us now, in my party and others.</p><p>I welcome the announcement today by the National Roads Authority about the improvement to the N11.  It is good to see this, not least because it is needed and long overdue but also because capital expenditure will generate jobs and improve infrastructure in the south-east corner, particularly my own county of Wexford.  That infrastructure will I hope be a driver of economic growth.  Rosslare Europort is one of the major entry points for goods into the country and when the motorway is finished, it will end at Gorey.  There is a real need for the rest of that section of roadway to be prioritised.  I hope that will follow immediately after this section is done.</p><p>I agree with my colleague, Senator Ned O'Sullivan, in asking the Leader to have an early debate in the House on the forthcoming abortion Bill.  I agree that the debate should be conducted in a respectful way that will recognise that there are different viewpoints, but it must also be honest.  This morning I heard a senior politician on radio claim that the Bill would protect the unborn.  If that kind of dishonesty is to be injected into the debate, it is not going to be respectful.</p></speech>

As a former member of South Dublin County Council when we were always seeking funds for the N7 flyover, I am delighted to welcome the announcement today of the expenditure of &euro;282 million and the 1,000 jobs that will be created during the project. </p> <p>Hopefully, the bottleneck at the N7 will be alleviated.  I wholeheartedly welcome this.</p><p>One might say Bangladesh is a faraway place to talk about in the Seanad but it is very relevant to people in Ireland because some of our clothing chains purchased clothes in the factory which collapsed killing hundreds of people.  We have enough to do in looking after our own building and safety regulations but I would like a debate to see what we can do in regard to those who source clothing from those factories not only in Bangladesh but in Saipan, China, etc.  Nike and Apple are doing something.  Penneys has said it will compensate the families of those who were killed but it is a bit late to compensate families when people are dead.  It is unfair to mention Penneys because Gap, Walmart and others source clothing from those factories.  Consumers want cheap good clothes, and rightly so, but they do not want them at any price, or at the price of lives being lost.</p><p>I call for a debate to see if we can draw up a code of ethics for chains to ensure preventive measures are taken, that independent inspectors go into those factories from which they source the clothes before they sign the deal and that they do not buy clothes at any cost.  We must see what measures we can advocate and if we can take example from companies taking measures to ensure it is policy.  We all want to buy Irish but if we cannot do so and if we must buy something else, we should ensure the people making these clothes are working in humane conditions which are satisfactory to us.</p></speech>

Glanbia Ingredients Ireland is to build a state-of-the-art facility in Belview on the Waterford-Kilkenny border.  The Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister said 1,600 jobs will be created in the south-east region.  There will be 450 construction jobs and 1,600 part-time and full-time jobs through a combination of jobs at the facility and increased dairy output in the south east.</p><p>This must be seen as a very good news story for a region which has suffered very badly because of the jobs crisis.  As the Leader, who is from Waterford, will know, we have taken a lot of knocks and heavy hits over the past number of years, so a major announcement such as this must be welcomed by everybody.  It will obviously be good for the farmers in the south east, for rural communities, which have suffered because of the economic downturn, and for everybody in Waterford and the south east in that it will give the region a lift and will create jobs, which is what it needs.  Hopefully, this will be the start of a lot more to come for Waterford and the south east.  </p><p>I commend all of those involved, including Government representatives and, of course, the company for its vote of confidence in the Waterford site, which is a very important one, and in the south-east region.</p></speech>

The late Deputies Barry and Blaney gave great service to this country and to public life over many years.  May they rest in peace.</p><p>Senator Cullinane mentioned Waterford and the south east but I remind him that the plant is being built in County Kilkenny.  Glanbia is a Kilkenny company with worldwide distribution.  It is welcome news that 1,600 jobs will be created and that there will be 450 jobs in construction, which will start on 17 May.  It is great to see Sinn F&eacute;in coming into the House with a positive message for a change.  I compliment Glanbia and Enterprise Ireland on this major investment.  Hopefully, it will have a benefit for rural Ireland, for farmers and for the people involved in small industries such as providing trucks to bring the milk to the plant.</p><p>I listened to the Opposition with its populist politics.

After listening to the Opposition at the weekend at its Ard-Fheis, one would wonder how the leopard has changed its spots so much.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-04-30a.109" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1158" speakername="Martin Conway" time="15:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013043000014#N00400"><p>Last Friday the newly independent Shannon Airport made 300 acres available to the IFA and made a contribution of &euro;5,000 to cut the grass.  The airport must be commended on its actions.  It also contributed hundreds of bales to a scheme operated by the IFA to help the farmers of County Clare.  That is a clear example of the benefit of an independent Shannon Airport.  If it had been tied to the Dublin Airport Authority, the fodder crisis would have been well and truly over by the time agreement was reached to cut the grass and a financial contribution would not have been made.  I say hats off to the management team of Shannon Airport.</p><p>The banks need to step up to the plate when it comes to assisting farmers and dealing with the fodder crisis.  Unfortunately, evidence on the ground to date is that the banks are not co-operating to the degree that the Minister and the farming organisations expected.  We need a new and renewed commitment by the financial institutions to farmers during what is hopefully a temporary difficult period.</p><p>Finally, I was troubled to make a discovery in the past few days about a construction project in Clare that the NRA has tried to embark upon for some time.  I refer to the demolition of houses at Blake's Corner in Ennistymon, County Clare, which is regarded as the most dangerous junction in the west of Ireland, with more than 1 million cars travelling through it in any one summer.  I was troubled to discover that An Bord Plean&aacute;la has recommended to Clare County Council that &euro;100,000 be spent on an environmental impact study, when everyone, whether they have expertise on the area or not, realises that the result will be the demolition of the two buildings.</p></speech>

Tomorrow the carbon tax increases will come into effect.  I would like to ask at this late hour if the Minister for Finance would consider extending the deadline for a fortnight due to the harsh weather that we are experiencing.  By that time, temperatures should have risen.  It is lovely outside today but last night it ranged from 3&deg; to 4&deg; Celsius where I come from, and it is still very cold at night and early in the morning.  People in the lower socioeconomic grades have been affected by cold weather and fuel costs this long winter, which lasted from October to May Day.  An extension would help people.</p></speech>

I knew both men.</p> <p>They were wonderful men who gave great service to the country.  I am sure we all wish to express our sympathy to their families. </p><p>At the risk of repeating myself on the Mercer report, I have given a number of explanations for the Minister's decision not to oppose the proposal, including that we only have a 15% shareholding in Bank of Ireland.  The Minister has requested a 6% to 10% pay cut, in particular for senior bankers.  We hope we will have these proposals within the next day or two.  It would be much more meaningful to have cuts and wait for the proposals rather than going through the motions of opposing something we know will be accepted.</p><p>With regard to Croke Park II, I do not deal with speculation and leaks to newspapers.  We should alllow the space requested and hope the negotiations will bear fruit in the near future.</p><p>Senator Ivana Bacik and other Members welcomed the N7 and N11 improvement projects and the creation of over 1,000 construction jobs in the next two years.  This should be welcomed by all.</p><p>The Senator also mentioned the prevalence of autism in Ireland and called for a debate on the issue.  I will try to arrange it.  She also mentioned a Bill in the other House.  I am not sure whether it will be dealt with.  I do not think it is on the A list, but we will check to see when it is intended to have it discussed in the House.</p><p>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen referred to the &euro;22 million being spent on treating alcohol-related diseases in Galway and said we should encourage methods to discourage the abuse of alcohol.  I have asked the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, to come to the House soon to discuss the issue with us.</p><p>On the protection of maternal life Bill, ample time will be afforded to discuss that issue in the House.  Anyone who wishes to speak on it will be afforded the opportunity to do so.  I can give that assurance to the House.</p><p>Senator Jim D'Arcy raised the issue of diesel laundering, a criminal activity, and called for the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, to come into the House to discuss it.  I have requested the Minister of State to come to the House to address the matter and he is agreeable.  I am waiting for a date and hope it will happen in early course.</p><p>Senator Paschal Mooney referred to the N4 road works mentioned by Senator Marc MacSharry last week.  As he stated, we have seen progress since last week in that an environmental impact statement has been requested.  The compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, will also be attended to, which is good news.  The matter is being progressed, which I am glad has been welcomed by Members on the other side of the House.</p><p>Regarding the European Investment Bank, I am sure the Minister will take on board what Senator Paschal Mooney mentioned in that regard.  To the best of my knowledge, he has already taken that matter on board.</p><p>Senators John Kelly and Tom Sheahan spoke about carbon taxes.  Senator John Kelly referred to a voucher system, while Senator Tom Sheahan spoke about extending the fuel allowance.  That issue might be raised in the form of an Adjournment matter to allow the relevant Minister to deal specifically with these items.</p><p>To reply to Senator David Norris, as I have stated, ample time will be afforded in this House for the debate on the protection of maternal life Bill.  As expressed by Senator Ned O'Sullivan, I hope when that debate it held, it will be conducted in a proper manner with respect shown from all sides.</p> <p> Senator Terry Brennan welcomed the positive news on the tourism front where visitor numbers were up significantly in the first quarter of 2013.  He also noted that there would be a large influx of rugby supporters in the next week or two, in particular from France.  I am sure they will afforded the welcome they always receive in our capital city.</p><p>I remind Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh that, as I announced last week, that next week is Europe week.  I indicated that in the lead-up to Europe week we would have three MEPs in the House this week.  If one looks at the subjects of the addresses of the MEPs to the House, especially those of Ms Nessa Childers and Ms Marian Harkin, one will see that they deal with items requested by many Members, including the links between the Seanad and the European Parliament and European directives.  They are very relevant matters for the House to address.</p></speech>

Ministers have their responsibilities in that regard, as well as to the House.  We have had all senior Ministers attend the Chamber when requested to deal with legislation.  I will endeavour, as I have always, to have Ministers attend to hear statements.  Many Ministers have co-operated, notwithstanding their busy schedules in the European Union and the other House.  I agree with Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh on the Seanad - "We have not gone away, you know."</p><p>Senator Catherine Noone referred to Irish traditional music and its UNESCO programme listing.  It is a matter the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, will probably attend the House to address.  I am sure the matter is of interest to Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; who has been involved in the area for a long time.  I will certainly bring the matter to the Minister's attention.  I agree completely with Senator Catherine Noone on the measures the Government has taken in the context of tourism, including the 9% VAT rate.  The rate has certainly borne fruit and I hope it will be continued.</p><p>Senator Terry Leyden is always a good man to look for a headline.  He is probably the only person who does not agree that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is doing his utmost to deal with the fodder crisis.</p></speech>

Farmers can contact the hotline number which the Minister mentioned at the joint committee and which has been advertised in the broadcast media.

There is a need for dialogue between staff in the appeals office and applicants whose applications for carer's and invalidity allowance appeals, in terms of documents submitted, are found to be deficient.  This is not happening. </p><p>Senator Walsh welcomed the proposed improvements to the N11 and the benefits that will accrue therefrom for Rosslare and Waterford ports.

I also note the Senator's points in relation to companies using what can only be described as slave labour in places like Bangladesh and so on.

Is &eacute; seo mo ch&eacute;ad uair taobh istigh de dhoirse c&aacute;ili&uacute;la &aacute;rsa an tSeanaid.  Is geal liom bheith i bhur measc ar feadh tamall beag.  In thanking the Leader, Senator Maurice Cummins, for the opportunity to address the House today, I commend him and his office on this excellent outreach initiative to improve communications and dialogue between the Oireachtas and the European Parliament.</p> <p>I am very grateful for the opportunity and hope this series marks the beginning of a continued, frequent and productive line of communication between the two parliaments.  To be afforded 15 to 20 minutes speaking time is a novelty for me - I barely know what to do with it - being so accustomed to the European Parliament's practice of affording one or two minutes at most.</p><p> In the midst of Europe's difficulties and given our holding of the rotating Presidency of the Council of Ministers, coinciding with the 40th anniversary of Ireland joining the European Union, it is an appropriate time to reflect on our participation in the European Union and consider how we wish to see it develop in the next 40 years.  I congratulate the Seanad on being to the fore in our national discourse on this issue.</p><p> Ireland's membership of the European Union has empowered and enriched us.  When Ireland joined 40 years ago in 1973, our GDP <i>per capita</i>was approximately 60% of the then European average.  Today, despite the recent economic turmoil, we continue to boast one of the highest GDP <i>per capita</i>ratios in the Union.  Living standards have risen to such an extent that modern Ireland looks and feels like a very different country from the Ireland of 40 years ago such are the improvements and developments our participation in the European Union has gained for us.  </p><p> The clearest embodiment of our membership of the European Union, after the euro, is the Common Agricultural Policy.  Up to 2008 Ireland had benefited from almost &euro;44 billion under the CAP.  I am cognisant of the fact that my colleagues have already addressed the House on CAP and Common Fisheries Policy reform and I will, therefore, avoid discussing these issues, despite their being a substantial portion of my workload.</p><p> The European Union has experienced many difficult phases since its foundation, from accusations of inactivity to incompetence, overreaching and failure.  Nobody here would deny that the current difficulty facing Europe, while not an existential crisis, is one of the most challenging to date.  As this House has debated many of the issues involved and with my colleagues, I do not wish to bore Members with repetition.  However, the situation at the European level is unrecognisable from it was only one year ago.  Europe has managed to pull itself back from the brink.  While the situation has calmed, in March, unemployment nationally still stood at 14%, while across the European Union it had reached a figure of 10.9%, two depressingly high figures.  Worse again are the figures for youth unemployment across Europe.  At 23.5%, nearly one quarter of all young people in Europe are unemployed.</p><p> Unemployment is a scourge which has continued to wreak havoc across the Continent, not least in Ireland.  While we are in the midst of the greatest economic crisis in living memory, the problem of unemployment can only be fundamentally solved through a return to economic growth.  Growth and job creation go hand in hand, albeit with a lag between a return to sustainable growth and significant job creation.  This House has focused on this issue relentlessly and I hope Senators will continue to do so.</p><p> The European Union works slowly, in a somewhat Byzantine manner, while markets, the media and, most importantly, citizens expect rapid, speedy action.  This has resulted, several times throughout the crisis, in expectations for the European Union being too high, particularly regarding timeframes.  That said, it can also be reasonably stated it has failed to achieve reasonable expectations at other times.</p><p> The mantra of &quot;more Europe&quot; is a common, catch-all, silver bullet solution touted by many in the European Parliament and the European Commission without a clear outline of what it would consist of.  The failure to communicate is made worse by the sense of disconnection between European institutions and citizens and has led to legitimate questions on credibility.</p> <p>The need to re-engage with the peoples of Europe has never been more urgent.  This is why I am of the firm belief that next year&rsquo;s European Parliament elections are of such crucial importance.  They offer the citizens of Europe the first pan-continental opportunity not only to cast judgment on how the challenges Europe has faced since 2009 have been dealt with, but also to set out how they wish to craft Europe&rsquo;s future narrative.  This is a critical time for Ireland and Europe.  It is imperative that charting the way forward and building a shared vision for the future of Europe is a bottom-up process where events such as this provide the forum for expressing views and crafting that shared future.</p><p>National parliaments have an integral role to play in this.  While Europe is engaged in what can only be described as a mass fire-fighting exercise, we are now at the point where we can and must begin to envisage a future for Europe.  The era of fire-fighters is coming to an end.  We are about to witness the dawn of a new era of architects.  Designing a shared vision of the future and charting the path to achieving this will be a long and arduous process.  However, it is also incredibly exciting and exhilarating that for the first time in a generation Europe is being remoulded and reformed before our eyes and with our participation.</p><p>My paper today revolves around the theme of beyond the crisis, informed by my work on several European Parliament committees.  The construction of our future demands policymakers to be architects and visionaries, capable of brave decisions based on sound evidence, to think long term, to focus on the sustainability of economic decisions, to strive to ensure that both citizens and businesses reap the full benefits of long-term continuing investment in education and to anticipate the infrastructural demands of society and the economy 20 to 40 years down the line.</p><p>I am fortunate that the committees that I serve on in the European Parliament are more focused on meeting the long-term future prospects of Europe.  I sit on the industry, research and energy, the culture and education and the regional development committees, as well as the delegations for relations with the United States and Canada.  I will outline the work of these committees and delegations towards fashioning the architecture of Europe beyond the crisis.  The industry and regional development committees focus on the foundations for economic growth and development.</p><p>The potential of research and innovation offers Europe the greatest opportunity for future economic growth.  From the &quot;eureka&quot; moment onwards, researchers and entrepreneurs must be supported and encouraged in developing their ideas into tangible concepts, as well as fostering their inquisitive entrepreneurial spirit from the genesis of a product to its delivery to the final consumer.  In 2010, European leaders adopted the Europe 2020 strategy.  It is designed to place the European economy on a sound and sustainable footing.  At its core is a recognition that research and innovation are absolutely and fundamentally necessary in fostering and spurring long-term sustainable economic growth.</p><p>Horizon 2020 is the programme for implementing this goal.  It brings all European funding for research and innovation under one umbrella.  The programme will make it easier to avail of EU research and innovation funding schemes.  Increased and more streamlined investment in research and innovation will play a core role in economic recovery, the return to jobs and growth and will be vital in regaining European competitiveness.  Up to &euro;70 billion is earmarked over the next seven years for Horizon 2020, 3% of European gross domestic product.  It represents the greatest commitment ever to research and innovation and is an example of the EU directly investing in the European economy, providing researchers and innovators with solid support and real opportunities.</p><p>It comprises three mutually reinforcing pillars.  The first, excellence in science, concentrates on basic fundamental research managed by the European Research Council promoting the gold standard for research.</p> <p> The second pillar - creating industrial leadership and competitive frameworks - revolves around supporting research and innovation by business and entrepreneurs, particularly SMEs in the areas of ICT, nanotechnology and biotechnology.  The third pillar - tackling societal challenges - focuses on a broad range of the challenges European society faces now and into the future - issues such as health, demographic change and energy security.  To quote the Commissioner for Research and Innovation, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, "Horizon 2020 means simplification.  Since we want our scientists and innovators to spend more time in the lab or workshop and less time filling in forms, we are slashing red tape to make it easier to access financing."</p><p>Ireland is already at the forefront of research and innovation in Europe.  We are among the best placed member states to fully exploit the funding opportunities offered by Horizon 2020.  Over the next seven years, I am confident that our researchers and innovators will continue to secure a disproportionately large amount of European research funding, generating more jobs and higher sustainable real growth.  Investment in research and innovation is a solid, sound investment in our future economy and prosperity.  Horizon 2020 empowers prepared countries such as Ireland to continue as innovation pioneers in the science and technology spheres, building a stronger, sounder, sustainable economy.</p><p>I will move now to the issue of data protection, which has dominated my work on the industry committee over the past year.  I attended over 250 external meetings on this and a similar number of meetings within the institutions.  With the increasing use of big data, and people living more of their lives online, come big questions regarding privacy issues.  Horizon 2020 calls for the development of a framework to safeguard human rights in the digital society so that users can control how their personal data is used by third parties.  Big data offers huge potential benefits to society as a whole.  It can offer innovative solutions to some of greatest societal challenges in the fields of health research, smart cities, education and the efficient delivery of public services.  This was at the heart of my recent week-long conference on EU science, global challenges and global collaboration, the biggest conference ever held in the European Parliament, from 4 March to 8 March.</p><p>We are entering a data-driven era, but what does that mean to citizens?  There are many benefits, but there are also many legitimate concerns that citizens' privacy is at stake.  We must remember that the right to privacy is a fundamental right enshrined in the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights.  As citizens, we demand that our privacy be protected in the context of rapid technological development, and this must be our top priority.  Therefore, the Commission came forward in early 2012 with the biggest data protection reform in 20 years, the proposed general data protection regulation.  This seeks to update the provisions of the 1995 directive on data protection.  I was appointed on behalf of the Parliament's powerful industry, research and energy committee to lead negotiations on this reform in collaboration with the lead civil liberties committee.  What we are seeking to do is to provide a clear framework for innovation in big data, which can deliver enormous benefits to society as a whole, without unnecessarily hampering it with meaningless red tape.  Key to this balance is trust, so that we as citizens are aware that our data is being protected.  As a result, there are a number of key innovations in this reform, focusing on robust corporate governance models, which are anchored in the powerful new mandatory position of the data protection officer.  Also, there will be a strong system of administrative sanctions implemented by independent data protection authorities - watchdogs with teeth.  Consent will be made clear and unambiguous for data subjects and the relationship between controllers and processors will be clarified, something of crucial importance in the burgeoning context of cloud technology.  I have also introduced wording to promote broad consent, which is of key importance in the field of medical research.  At the heart of my report has been the goal of achieving a strong balance between the right to privacy and the obligation to promote innovation to be respected in the ongoing negotiations.</p> <p> An area closely related to research, innovation and data protection is patent protection.  It is one of the real triumphs of the Irish Presidency and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, in particular, that agreement has been found, whereby 24 countries have agreed to what is known as the Unified Patent Court Agreement.  The importance of patent protection cannot be understated.  European businesses invest billions every year in research and innovation, nurturing an idea from the "eureka" moment and guiding it all the way to the marketplace.  Recognising and vindicating the rights of businesses and innovators to the ownership of their ideas is crucial in empowering European businesses and researchers to continue to increase their investment in research and innovation, confident in the knowledge that their endeavours will be respected.  The patents package provides the framework for this recognition, reducing costs for business and providing a simplified structure for the recognition of patents across Europe, with access to a robust judicial remedy in cases of conflict.  It is a crucial step in reducing the burden of red tape for enterprises across Europe through providing innovative European businesses with a one-stop shop for registering and protecting patents within the European Union.  It has the potential to unleash economic growth across Europe.  It is estimated that it could potentially save European businesses between &euro;150 million and &euro;290 million annually and this is only the initial saving under a simplified system.  The true opportunity which patent reform affords European businesses is in unleashing the potential within European businesses and research sectors.</p><p>With regard to recent developments at the European Parliament's Regional Development Committee, the committee focuses on the fundamental physical infrastructure required for economic development in Europe's peripheral regions.  Ireland has benefited incredibly from regional development funds over the course of the past 40 years through investment in vital economic structures, transport mobility and connectivity, thereby ensuring the necessary economic infrastructure was in place to empower the regions to fulfil their economic potential.  The work on regional development has now moved towards those regions which need it most in eastern and southern Europe.  While that does not mean the issues and economic potential of peripheral regions in western Europe are forgotten, nonetheless, one is less concerned with roads and railways and more concerned with realising the long-term economic potential of the regions.</p><p>I wish to briefly present to the House, if Senators will indulge me for a few more minutes, a summary of a report on the topic of Blue Growth which I authored for the committee and which was overwhelmingly accepted last week by 41 votes to one.  The fact that Ireland is an island nation places it in an enviable position to fully benefit from the European Union's new Blue Growth strategy which is fundamentally aimed at utilising our marine resources in a sustainable manner to generate growth and foster job creation.  It is being formulated to identify and tackle long-term challenges and highlight synergies within the sector to unleash growth.  In concrete terms, it is examining ways of removing the administrative barriers that hamper growth, fostering investment in research and innovation and promoting skills through education and training.  It focuses on the aquaculture industry, as well as short-sea shipping, coastal tourism and the offshore wind energy sector which present incredible opportunities for Ireland.</p><p>The role of aquaculture in promoting regional development in coastal areas across Europe is central.  Some 90% of aquaculture businesses in the European Union are SMEs, providing 80,000 jobs.  There is a need for the sector to be supported but, more importantly, to be significantly expanded through adopting innovative methods and schemes, funded through the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, in promoting the development of aquaculture in deep water, alongside offshore wind farms.  My opinion is focused on developing maritime clusters and exploiting the resulting synergies across the sector.</p> <p>The opportunities for growth and resulting job creation, both normal and innovative, are evident throughout this strategy.  This strategy, once completed and implemented fully, has the potential to generate thousands of long-term sustainable jobs directly and indirectly across Ireland and with proper implementation and ambition, millions throughout Europe.</p><p> Having touched on what I believe are the major issues which I have worked on in the European Parliament over the past year or so, I will now discuss a topic which may be of more direct interest to Senators.  The Lisbon Treaty conferred considerable extra powers on the European Parliament, transforming us as an institution into a full legislative Chamber and an equal partner with the European Council, a fact we do not tire reminding ourselves of in addition to any poor commissioner whose legislative proposals are not quite to some of my colleagues' liking.  The same treaty conferred a new, more substantial role on national parliaments as watchdogs for the principle of subsidiarity as part of a wider role to contribute to the good functioning of the Union and right to information.  National parliaments are now expected to scrutinise freedom, justice and security issues in addition to their traditional role in treaty change and enlargement.</p><p> As the House is aware, the European Commission sends out copies of its legislative proposals and the Oireachtas, along with every other parliament across Europe, has eight weeks to respond.  Given the sheer quantity of Commission legislative proposals, I wonder how national parliaments currently manage their responsibilities and I genuinely wonder how their role can be strengthened and reinforced within the context of the development of EU institutions into the future.</p><p> While the future of Seanad &Eacute;ireann will be decided by the people in the exercise of their sovereign right this autumn, I hope that the responsibility of European legislative scrutiny will be given due consideration in whatever new configuration of the Oireachtas develops after the referendum.  I note that many Members of this House have been very much to fore in calling for the Seanad to take on these European responsibilities in a structured and comprehensive manner as part of an overall reform of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  This is certainly a development I would welcome if the Seanad was to be retained.</p><p> T&aacute; an t-aitheasc seo tagtha chun deiridh anois.  I will finish with one sentence of Euro-speak.  I wish to thanking you for good opportunity to speak on this issues today during the Irish Presidency and I wish you very well in your legislation today and today after, <i>vielen dank</i>. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-04-30a.170" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1140" speakername="Terry Leyden" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013043000026#Z00200"><p>I welcome Mr. Se&aacute;n Kelly, MEP, to the House and wish him well in his work and his work as a former uachtar&aacute;n of the GAA who contributed greatly to the work and development of the GAA during his period as president.  I also congratulate him on his membership of very prestigious committees.  He has detailed very comprehensively the amount of work he undertook in the industry, energy, and research committee, the committee on culture and education, the regional development committee, the delegation for relations with the United States, and the delegation for relations with Canada.  It is very important to have Irish MEPs involved at that level given the significant connection we have with the US.  I know Mr. Kelly is working very closely with the EU Commissioner for Research, Innovation and Science, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, who is an excellent and very experienced commissioner.</p><p>One of the issues affecting farming, which I am sure Mr. Kelly brought to the attention of the European Parliament, is the crisis in fodder in Ireland.  It is a fodder famine.  Farmers are disappointed by the lack of response from the EU.  Perhaps Mr. Kelly can outline what the reaction has been because it is an emergency and in those circumstances, one expects an emergency response from the EU and the Government.  </p> <p>Has any action been taken or will it be taken to involve the European Commission in the crisis in this country?  It is absolutely essential that the crisis is brought to the Commission's attention and that the Commissioner for Agriculture is aware of the situation and comes here to see at first hand how serious the situation is.  It is imperative that every action is taken to support farming at this critical time.</p><p>The Leader of the House is making every effort to give this House a role in the scrutiny of EU legislation.  During the debates on the Lisbon treaty this was clearly articulated, promised and committed to, and the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Creighton, was very supportive of this suggestion.  The D&aacute;il is extremely busy and the Seanad could play a very strong role in scrutinising EU legislation.  For example, a Bill on the below cost sale of cigarettes came before this House in the past two weeks.  I am not sure whether Mr. Kelly is aware of its details although his portfolio might cover it.  As Senators White and Norris highlighted, it was quite shocking that a directive and decision by the Commission, based on obvious lobbying by the tobacco industry, would provide for the below cost sale of cigarettes.  There should be no tolerance of below cost selling of alcohol or cigarettes.  To encourage anyone to engage in smoking or drinking by providing products at low cost seems to be contrary to the European Union.  Those issues should have been scrutinised here and a yellow card should have been presented to the European Parliament and it should have been debated.  I will not ask Mr. Kelly to respond to that point now but he might look at that situation when he returns to Brussels.  That is something that people cannot understand and it gives the European Union a very bad reputation.</p><p>A question also arose about the eel fisheries.  When a decision is made and a directive issued it should be reviewed after a certain number of years.  There is a 99 year ban on the fishing of eels in the Republic of Ireland and that does not apply to Northern Ireland where there is a much more tolerant approach.  I was appalled by the Ministers at the time, led by the Green Party Ministers, who pushed this agenda through.  I know that we must conserve eels and that is fine but there should be a unified approach to this.  Why are we the only country of the 27 that has a total outright ban on the development of eel fisheries?  Those are the types of issues that bring the EU into disrepute in this country.</p><p>I am sorry I do not have more time to speak but I wish Mr. Kelly well in his work.  I have one final point to make.  I regret very much the reduction in the number of MEPs from 12 to 11.  Will we lose an MEP every time a country joins the EU?  I accept that we voted for that in the Lisbon treaty but is it really the situation?  We need every MEP possible to represent this country in Europe.  I hope that there will be no more reductions, if the number is reduced to 11.  I assume Mr. Kelly will be able to respond to that question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-04-30a.172" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1130" speakername="Maurice Cummins" time="17:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013043000027#AA00200"><p>On behalf of my colleagues in the House I welcome Mr. Se&aacute;n Kelly, MEP, to address us this afternoon.  His address was most enlightening.  It is very important that we have such exchanges between Members of this House and Parliament and our representatives in the European Parliament.  Before I ask Mr. Kelly a few questions, I want to take the opportunity to acknowledge not only the great work he is doing in the European Parliament but also the level of commitment and energy he gave to his previous roles which included a very successful presidency of the GAA.</p> <p>From the level of knowledge and detail shown today, Mr. Kelly's extensive experience outside politics has served him well in Brussels.  I also congratulate him on being voted MEP of the year last year for research and innovation, which is quite an achievement for a person who is in his first term in the European Parliament.</p><p>There are a number of issues on which Mr. Kelly might be able to share his thoughts today.  Online gambling is an issue which has been raised on several occasions in this House and Mr. Kelly has made strident efforts in proposing legislation which seeks to protect minors from online gambling advertising.  This is a very strong initiative on his behalf and perhaps it is one on which he might touch further.  </p><p>Only last week, Seanad &Eacute;ireann invited in 45 transition year students from around the country.  They submitted questions to the Deputy Leader and I on a wide range of issues.  I was taken aback at the extraordinary level of awareness and engagement shown by most of these young people.  Some spoke quite forcibly on the issue of bullying and how we can promote positive mental health among young people.  When we think about the challenges modern society pose for our youth, alcohol and drug abuse spring to mind as the main culprits, but Mr. Kelly is right that we need to open our minds to the new forms of bullying affecting our young people.  I am interested in hearing his views on how we can balance the protection of the rights of our young people while acknowledging the importance of free expression which social media provides.  I commend Mr. Kelly on his efforts to highlight the growing instances of cyberbullying and his recent seminar which focused on young people and how they can combat this epidemic.  I am eager to hear his views on how we can protect young people from this new form of communication.</p><p>I would also like to touch on Mr. Kelly's committee work, in particular the work with regard to data protection.  The Irish Presidency is at an advanced stage in negotiating the harmonisation of data protection legislation across the European Union.  There is huge potential for Ireland in taking full advantage of big data which would benefit transport and infrastructural planning, medical research and e-commerce but what is of concern here is maintaining people's right to privacy.  Mr. Kelly might be able to share his thoughts on how we can strike a very important balance in that regard.  </p><p>Finally, I wish to touch on the issue which could be one of the defining points in our Presidency of the EU, namely, the negotiations for an EU-US trade and investment partnership agreement which has been raised by Senator Barrett on several occasions.  I have seen the studies which have suggested that if such agreement were in place, the EU would benefit to the tune of up to &euro;220 billion, with the creation of more than 400,000 new jobs.  That certainly would be a significant achievement which would pave the way for a more competitive and expandable single market.  Such an agreement would see the establishment of the largest trade bloc in the world.  As a country which is driven by export-led growth, there would be huge opportunities for Ireland in this regard.  I would like to hear Mr. Kelly's views on what stage our Presidency is at in terms of progressing these negotiations and on the potential benefits we can expect from such negotiations.</p><p>I assure Mr. Kelly that this House is very aware of the important role it can play in the scrutiny of EU legislation and the exchange of views we have had in recent weeks, which will culminate in Commissioner M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn coming in next week - European week - will add to and help progress the relationship between this House and the European Parliament which is of paramount importance.  I hope we will be in a position to progress these closer links between Europe and this House in the future.</p> <p>I sincerely thank Mr. Kelly for his enlightening address and look forward to hearing from him regarding some of the questions that have been posed. </p></speech>

There are many aspects of his work that I would like to raise and commend him on.  Perhaps I shall limit myself to crediting him for his work on the committee called Delegations for Relations with the United States.  Senator Cummins mentioned the EU-US trade agreement and a number of Senators are following its progress.  I also commend Mr. Kelly on his valuable contribution as rapporteur regarding the Commission's proposals to reform the EU data protection rules and to examine how the continent can have uniformity and introduce one data protection law for one continent.  I have read the proposals with great interest.</p><p>  I was heartened to hear Mr. Kelly speak so passionately today, and earlier this year, about youth unemployment and the youth guarantee.  As he will know, Ireland has the fourth highest rate of young people not in education, employment or training in the EU, also known as the NEET figure.  He expressed the need to tackle the monumental toll that emigration is taking on young people today.  I commend all that he has done to support the youth guarantee.  I would be heartened to hear his opinion on the draft recommendations establishing the youth guarantee that were adopted by the Council last week.  Does he feel that the measure goes far enough?  </p><p>  With regard to his work on the Industry, Research and Technology Committee and the Regional Committee on Data Protection in Europe, what role will the digital agenda play in Ireland's recovery?  I know that he has touched on the subject in some way.  </p><p>  Mr. Kelly raised the issue of data protection and talked about the importance of balancing rights.  Therefore, I wish to raise a people protection issue.  Perhaps it is more of a child protection issue but we have discussed it in the House.  I refer to child abuse material on the Internet which is an issue of considerable concern to myself and several Senators.  As a State we have an obligation to protect real children from real abuse in the real world.  The Independent group tabled a motion on 29 February 2012 that called on the Government to block all child abuse material, irrespective of its jurisdiction or origin.  At present we block material from within Ireland but it should be blocked, irrespective of jurisdiction.  The Minster for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, said that he would consider the proposal in the context of the planned sexual offences Bill.  However, there has been no urgency in bringing the Bill before us so I look to the EU to see what it can do.  Several member states have introduced such blocking of the Internet.</p><p>  I note and acknowledge the European Parliament's written declaration on highlighting the global dimension of the fight against online child sexual abuse content<b>.  </b>I thank Mr. Kelly for signing the declaration earlier this month.   As noted in the declaration, the cross-border nature of most online child sexual abuse content shows that strong international co-operation is necessary.  What does Mr. Kelly feel can be done to facilitate this co-operation to remove the content at source and address its online distribution networks?  I believe that we should block it but some people will counter my belief by citing Internet freedom.  However, each digital image is an image of a crime scene.  We have a policy to block drugs entering the country.  It does not solve the problem but acts as a deterrent.  In the same way we should block all child abuse in Ireland as happens in several EU member states.  I would welcome hearing Mr. Kelly's opinions and I hope that he will support me on the issue.  </p></speech>

As Senator Cummins has rightly said, credit is due to him for the enormous amount of work he does in Europe and for his work in his previous role as president of the GAA.  I wonder, as I sit here, which EU country is closest to counties Kilkenny or Kerry in their race to be supreme at various sports.</p> <p> One of the main dilemmas, and Mr. Kelly touched on it, is the way we reach out to Europe and Europe reaches out to us.  Mr. Kelly referred to the disconnect, and people always do that.  We have not made the progress we should have been able to make by now with modern technology, our understanding of politics and our greater capacity to travel as ordinary citizens of Ireland, and that does not apply just to Ireland.  For example, the greater power granted to the European Parliament under the Lisbon treaty is very welcome.  Voting to cap bankers' bonuses, as the Parliament did last week, and the Parliament voting for a new policy on discards for the Common Fisheries Policy are two welcome and timely initiatives that are in touch with what Members here are interested in. However, I suspect if people on the street were asked if they knew the European Parliament had voted for any of those measures, they would ask what we were talking about.</p><p>Is the difficulty, as Mr. Kelly said, that one gets only a minute to speak?  Is it because Europe is still based in Brussels and people do not believe it is relative to home?  Is it because of the huge variety of activities in which an MEP engages?  People here and in other countries find it difficult to find something that is happening in Europe that is relevant to their daily lives.  All the work about which Mr. Kelly spoke - the blue growth strategy, the patents and so on - is relevant.  I speak having had only a brush with Europe having stood in the European elections and I found that was a matter people would raise constantly.  They would ask what Europe does for us and when one tried to explain a number of issues their eyes would glaze over.</p><p>There is clearly no quick fix, nor should there be one, for an issue as important as this, but does Mr. Kelly believe there ought to be something proposed.  Many people in this room would share his view on the Seanad having a greater role in regard to European legislative scrutiny.  That would help but if it is the case that the people decide to abolish the Seanad, is there another solution to the enormous amount of scrutiny required of European legislation and to that disconnect because if the Seanad cannot fulfil that role, who will?</p><p>In addition to that disconnect we have the rise of any number of right wing parties across any number of countries in Europe including Finland, Switzerland, Austria, Greece and the Netherlands to name a few.  Right wing parties-----</p></speech>

I thank the Senator.</p><p>In the vacuum where people are not connecting with Europe it is very easy to create a message that Europe is too strong, has too much power, that the power should revert to the sovereign and that we do not want Europe interfering in our lives.  That message then takes hold in the vacuum that is caused by the fact that our capacity to connect with Europe and Europe's capacity to connect with us is not as good as it should be.</p><p>Mr. Kelly is a relatively new MEP but it is often such people who can see clearly the way that might be managed into the future.  I would have a serious concern as to the way that might be managed.  That does not take away from the work being done by Mr. Kelly and his fellow MEPs.  I am not trying to do that.  I am saying that would be my biggest fear about the success of Europe.  I am a Europhile and I agree that many of the changes that have occurred in Ireland occurred because we were members of the European Union but what is Mr. Kelly's view on that?  What could he bring to that given that, as Senator Cummins said, he had a great deal of experience outside of politics?  Is it the case that Europe is too big and that we should return to a free trade environment?  Is it that the project is too big and too disparate to connect with people?  I am not suggesting that.  I am curious to know Mr. Kelly's view on it.</p><p>I thank Mr. Kelly.  I will follow with interest the blue growth strategy because it is an extremely interesting area.  I commend Mr. Kelly's work.</p></speech>

Bh&iacute; br&uacute; m&oacute;r ann don phr&oacute;iseas s&iacute;och&aacute;na nuair a thoghadh Se&aacute;n mar uachtar&aacute;n ar Chumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; an-fhoighneach agus cneasta in aghaidh gach a bh&iacute; ina choinne an t-am sin.  N&iacute;l aon dabht againn anois ach go raibh s&eacute; ar fheabhas don t&iacute;r agus do Chumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael gur tugadh cead sacar agus rugba&iacute; a imirt i bP&aacute;irc an Chr&oacute;caigh.  T&aacute; meas m&oacute;r ar She&aacute;n i measc Aontachtaithe, de bharr gur canadh &quot;Dia, S&aacute;bh&aacute;il an Banr&iacute;on&quot; - &quot;God save the Queen&quot; - i bP&aacute;irc an Chr&oacute;caigh.</p><p>  What I have just said is that they liked hearing &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; sung in Croke Park.  It made a major impact.  As recently as last Friday, the gesture was recognised as huge in the North-South discussions at Stormont.  I spoke to some constituents in Enniskillen soon afterwards and a strong Unionist said that if his barn needed repairing and a neighbour loaned him his, he would respect that neighbour.  Senator Brennan referred to the Rugby World Cup which we have applied to host.  The fact that it could be staged here without any of the controversies which Se&aacute;n Kelly had to endure represents a remarkable contribution to his country.  I am delighted that we have a Kerry Senator in the Chair.  Mr. Kelly will recall that in his difficulties in the GAA, it was a key man from Leitrim, Tommy Byrne, who rang the bell after three minutes, thereby extinguishing loquacious clergymen and former presidents of the GAA from Cork who thought they were still running the organisation.  It was a major achievement.  Senator O'Sullivan is playing an important role in ensuring that proceedings observe the rules.</p><p>  There is an interesting story in the book about an encounter with a former Cathaoirleach, Rory Kiely.  Mr. Kelly wrote that &quot;Rory was a shrewd operator and, as Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, carried a fair deal of weight&quot;.  I am glad to hear it.  We will pass on the news to the current Cathaoirleach.  Mr. Kelly will recall that while Mr. Kiely was against the change being proposed, his son voted for it.  I hope when the retention of the Seanad is dealt with, the precedent will be observed.  I was delighted that a constituent of mine, Mr. Peter Boyle, was president of the IRFU at the relevant time and helped Mr. Kelly move through a wonderful period of sporting friendship and ecumenism.  I remember the legendary P&aacute;draig Kennelly of <i>Kerry's Eye</i> introducing me to Se&aacute;n Kelly.  It is hardly a surprise that he is MEP of the year for research and innovation.  If he accomplishes in Europe a fraction of what he has done in Ireland to promote the peace process, the EU will be in his debt.</p><p>  To respond to Mr. Kelly's speech, our present problems are the result of the massive design faults in the euro currency.  We have discussed them here.  There should have been more debate with the British, the Danes and the Swedes, who pointed out the faults originally.  I find it very difficult to imagine that Greece and Portugal can survive at a fixed exchange rate with Germany.  Mr. Kelly mentioned the &euro;44 billion we have made from the Common Agricultural Policy, but the currency has cost us &euro;64 billion to rescue banks which went broke as German money flowed in.  The EU must move faster.  Last week, the Seanad discussed legislation to introduce mechanisms like those being implemented in the USA and UK to separate utility banks from casino banks and to require banks to be better capitalised.  The legislation is being held up by the slow pace in Europe, which should be addressed.  There are now 25 million unemployed people in the EU, which represents an increase of 2 million in the last 12 months.  As other Members have said, there is problem with Europe appearing to be so distant and 27 people taking an age to make up their minds to do anything.  The EU must justify itself to the citizens.</p><p>  The research budget is good, but it must have inputs.  To refer to one of Mr. Kelly's previous great interests, much of the research, innovation and education budget should focus on primary level.  Science was removed from the Irish curriculum in the 1920s and it would be brilliant to reintroduce it.  There is also a languages problem.</p> <p>I think languages were nearly there in the primary schools in the 1920s, but to make room for religion and the revival of the Irish language, they were taken out of the curriculum.  It would make a major impact if these subjects were part of the primary school curriculum as everybody goes to primary school.</p><p>Mr. Kelly will play a crucial role in the new era of architects.  I have already mentioned research and innovation.</p><p>As the Leader has said we are crucially well placed to foster relations with the United States and I am delighted that Mr. Kelly is on that committee, as we are midway between the United States and Canada and the European economy.  Canada has the largest proportion of Irish people in its population.  I think we will be organising some visits there in October and November.  This provides huge scope and I am delighted that Mr. Kelly is connected with that also.</p><p>Mr. Kelly quoted the statement by the Commissioner for Research and Innovation, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, who said: &quot;Since we want our scientists and innovators to spend more time in the lab or workshop and less time filling in forms, we are slashing red tape to make it easier to access financing.&quot;  I think we should also add that they should spend more time teaching because scientists must encourage and develop the current crop of young people to take an interest in science.  They have been neglecting that due to the current emphasis on research and on independent funding of the research and filling in forms.</p><p>County Kerry has had remarkable success in regional development and has developed an airport with a link all the year round with Germany.  The Liebherr group came to Kerry long before the Common Market.  That has to be promoted and people such as Denis Cregan, the chairman, must be commended for what they are doing.  We have the resource of the marine, an immense area off our coast that is far bigger than the land mass of the country.  What we can get out of the blue project will be most interesting.</p><p>Mr. Kelly's success comes as no surprise.  We wish him well and I thank him for his address to the Seanad.  From setting the precedent of rugby in Croke Park, I am delighted that he sees a role for the Seanad in the future.  I would much prefer to have him on my team than on the opposing side.</p><p>Go raibh maith agat a She&aacute;in.</p></speech>

I agree with much of what Senator Sean D. Barrett said on the lethargic approach of the European Union to a range of issues since the economic crisis.  We have seen inconsistences in its approach to banking.  We in Ireland were forced not to burn the bondholders but Cyprus was forced to burn the bondholders as well as depositors.  There are still controls and credit limits on the banks in Cyprus.  Europe has not had a coherent approach to the banking situation.  There is some move towards a single European banking supervisory body, which we support.  We need strong regulation in the banking sector.  We also need to ensure the European Central Bank acts as lender of last resort, which has been the missing element since the crisis started.  While we have had difficulties with the European Stability Mechanism, we would prefer the European Central Bank to be the body to provide the funding for the ESM.  The EU has gone for a different approach but it is still not up and running.  We saw that it was not used to capitalise the banks in Cyprus.  We still have not got the retrospective deal that will take off our balance sheet and off the shoulders of the taxpayers, all of the banking debt that we hold as sovereign debt.  Unfortunately some of this was made sovereign by Mr. Kelly's party by the promissory note as well as the money that was put in by the previous Government.</p><p>There is an unemployment crisis across Europe.  The level of youth unemployment in Spain is phenomenal as is unemployment generally.  Many countries across Europe, to mention just Italy, Portugal and Greece are facing a real crisis in unemployment as we are in this State, with the number of unemployed people stabilising at 14.5%.  This is still a significant figure which presents challenges.  We need a coherent focus in the European Union and in this State on how to respond to this crisis.  That step change must involve some level of easing of austerity.  The Government seemed to be moving in that direction and talking about taking &euro;1 billion less in austerity measures next year.  That needs to happen.  We need a stimulus to create jobs, we need more investment.  </p><p>I have two quick questions on the domestic situation.  With the abolition of the milk quotas, there is a major opportunity in the dairy sector for Munster and the south east.  Will Mr. Kelly comment on that?  There are major opportunities in beef production and fisheries.  The Common Fisheries Policy needs to be reviewed and we must ensure we have a thriving fishing industry that supports many coastal villages. </p></speech>

We were in the College of Education together.  It was a very good year, which produced no less than the Taoiseach, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle of the D&aacute;il, an MEP, and m&eacute; f&eacute;in. </p><p>Mr. Kelly has approximately five minutes.</p></speech>

That was a great move by the Government because it sent a positive signal and a great deal of progress has been made on it.  It is expected that when President Obama comes to Enniskillen for the G8 conference he will be able to announce an agreement to start negotiations.  That is a significant advancement.  When I was elected and went to Europe four years ago, I attended as a delegate on the EU-US conference and at that time America had more or less given up on Europe.  America was looking east.  Things have changed.  The Irish Presidency has done a good job at putting ourselves at the centre and getting people together.  President Obama's special envoy was here last week and this shows that the Americans and Europeans are serious about it.  The Commissioner for Trade, Karel De Gucht, thinks we can have an agreement in two years.  I think that is a bit optimistic but in terms of timetabling it is good because the US President will be anxious to conclude it before his term finishes and a new European Parliament will be coming in.  This is a significant development for Ireland, Europe and the United States.</p><p>I sympathise with farmers on the fodder crisis.  I was in Mitchelstown last Saturday week when Dairygold brought in lorries of hay.  The Minister has been doing his best.  He has spoken to Commissioner Cioloş about the issue and I, as a member of the regional development committee, have written to Commissioner Hahn, as he is responsible for regional development and in particular for the solidarity fund.  I have asked him to address the fodder issue and to meet me as soon as possible.  The solidarity fund usually takes effect after an event, for example after disasters, such as the flooding in Cork or fires and drought across Europe, but help is needed right now, which is the problem.  We need to consider an emergency fund that can kick start immediately.  We will do our best and keep pressing the message.  If solidarity is to mean anything one must come to the aid of people, at a time of crisis.</p><p>I am concerned about the whole approach to tobacco in Europe in the sense that we should be trying to encourage the farmers in southern Europe who depend on the tobacco crop to try to diversify into some other crops so that in the long term we would eliminate it. </p> <p>There is a question of competition concerning below cost selling and so on and much more could be done in that regard.  I agree that we should be targeting the elimination of smoking in the long term.  That would encourage farmers, particularly in southern Europe, to diversify.  </p><p>I agree that the issues concerning fishing, particularly eel fishing, are ones for the Cabinet rather than the European Union.  However, MEPs are concerned about them.</p><p>Small member states have suffered a decrease in their number of MEPs, from 15 to 13 to 12 and now 11.  Member states have a veto, if they wish to exercise it, and that aspect should be considered.  We need to consider this matter from a broader perspective, especially in the context of the enlargement of the European Union.  If new member states continue to join and the number of MEPs per member state continues to reduce, with what number will we finish up?  Small countries such as Malta have a guaranteed minimum of six MEPs, which number cannot be touched.  Is Ireland's representation going to fall to near that number soon, bearing in mind that Malta has a population of only 500,000?  Therefore, this issue needs to examined in a broader context.  The best thing to do would be to postpone the decision.  With one year to go before the European elections, we do not have a clue what the constituencies will be or whether we will have 12 or 11 MEPs.  In terms of timing, that is unacceptable. </p><p>Senator David Cullinane referred to the bondholders.  We would all like to see the bondholders being burned, but when the crisis occurred, the European Union had to respond to it.  There was no mechanism in place in that respect.  As Senator Sean D. Barrett said, the euro was introduced without the necessary important structure being in place to accompany it.  In the case of Cyprus, at least the taxpayer did not have to carry the burden.  That should I hope strengthen our case when we come to ask that it be examined in a similar light under the ESM when the banking union is established.  From that point of view, a line may have been drawn in the sand to the effect that taxpayers will not pick up the bill any more.  That in itself would make banks, their shareholders and boards of governors more cautious when they know they would be hit first.  The fact that we will have one single supervisory mechanism in Europe will I hope ensure banks will be properly monitored in the future.  This is a very important development.  </p><p>On unemployment, we all want to see more people in employment.  In this regard, there is a need for more investment.  The European Union is conscious of this and it is part of the Irish proposals under the Irish Presidency in terms of stability, growth and job creation.  Different measures will be examined to try to improve the position, particular in regard to Structural Funds and so on.  </p><p>Under Food Harvest 2020, there will be great opportunities for Ireland.  The reformed Common Agricultural Policy allows for this.  There was a move to keep milk quotas, but that proposal has been more or less rejected.  I hope that will be the end result and it will help us.  Markets are growing worldwide.  There is a huge growth among the middle classes in developing countries, particularly the BRIC countries.  There are also great opportunities for Ireland in fisheries, particularly the aquaculture sector, to which I referred.</p><p>My friend, the Leader of the House, Senator Maurice Cummins, gave me great praise for my role as president of the GAA, as did other speakers, for which I thank them.  It was a great occasion when Croke Park was opened up.  It was great to have the Queen of England there.  It is also great that Croke Park could be used in the holding of the Rugby World Cup in 10 or 15 years time.  It took congress less than one minute to agree to this, which shows the way things can move on and opinions can change.  As was mentioned, Mr. Tommy Moran from County Leitrim and I got a lot of stick at the time, but we got over it and matters worked out well.  </p><p>The question of bullying, including cyberbullying, was mentioned.  In that respect, the protection of minors is crucial.  It is important to work with parents to help them to become aware of what is happening.  They need much more help, as do schools.  There is a move towards peer to peer mentoring in Britain, something that should be introduced here because many young people who are bullied believe it is their own fault.  As a consequence, they do not speak to anybody about it.  There is scope to address the problem by introducing peer to peer mentoring, or cyber buddies is another term for it.  The Oireachtas is examining that issue.  I will help to progress it in the European Union to try to deal with the issue of bullying generally, particularly cyberbullying which is far more secretive and damaging to young people.  </p><p>The issue of data protection was raised.  We have to balance the right to privacy with the opportunities for businesses to grow.  A proposal was brought forward by some committees in the European Union that every company with 250 customers should have a data protection officer.  I fought to have this proposal rejected, as it was a ridiculous proposal.  A butcher could have 250 customers and he or she would have to take on a data protection officer.  That proposal would simply not work and, thankfully, we were successful in defeating it.  Trust is key.  It is important to instill confidence in people that their data will be protected.  On the question of consent, we are seeking a clear and unambiguous approach in this respect.  I hope we will achieve a balance.</p><p>Another aspect that is important for Ireland is the concept of a one-stop-shop where companies operating throughout Europe could pick one member state as their main establishment.  That would suit Ireland more than any other member state because many of the big companies have a base here.  We have a good reputation in data protection through the work of the Data Protection Commissioner, Mr. Billy Hawkes.  This is something companies would welcome and it would be useful and helpful to Ireland in attracting more companies to invest here.  </p><p>I have dealt with the US trade agreement; therefore, there is no need to go over it again.  I also mentioned bondholders.  </p><p>The youth guarantee scheme is very important.  It is great if a young fellow finds a job within four months of attaining his qualifications, but I am concerned about how the provision on training will be interpreted.  Such training must be meaningful, beneficial and lead to a job.  We will have to put on our thinking caps and monitor it when it comes into effect because there is a danger that young people might be sent for training which might not be of great benefit to them.</p></speech>

I congratulate him on being the model MEP.  We have been watching his progress and appreciate how well he is doing on committees in the European Union and his work, on the issue of data protection in particular.  I merely want to wish him well and ask him when he comes here again to say a few words on a matter in which we are all interested and about which there is much guesswork, namely, the new Irish constituencies and the loss of seats, which we all regret, to also speak about EU expansion.  Serbia's application has been approved and Turkey and other countries want to join.  I wish him very well in the future.</p></speech>

It is often thought that the sum of human experience is contained in this House.  It probably is, but it is also good to have an opportunity to hear what representatives in other Houses of Parliament have to say.  I listened carefully to Mr. Kelly's contribution which I found to be astute and incisive.  If any evidence was needed that he was a more than ordinary and thoughtful politician, we do not need any more having heard what he has had to say.  I have two brief questions for him.  He made a reference, obliquely I admit, to the future of this House.  In other European countries with a bicameral system in place is a debate taking place on the future of the Upper House?  Can he point to any rumour or talk among his colleagues about this possibility?</p><p>My second question is about how we might be perceived by our European partners.</p> <p>From speaking informally to European MEPs, how do they see us implementing the austerity programme, which we are obliged to do?  I understand there is a diverse range of views on the issue.  In a formal way, do people think we are doing well and that it is the right way to go, or that we are stone mad to pursue this policy?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-04-30a.199" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1153" speakername="Catherine Noone" time="17:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013043000034#HH00200"><p>I welcome Mr. Se&aacute;n Kelly, MEP.  I think the title is Deputy Kelly but Mr. Se&aacute;n Kelly, MEP, sounds much better.  His presentation was extremely interesting and shows the innovative and important work he is doing.  He is also well recognised in Brussels, obviously because of the award he has been given.  I had occasion to be there recently and everybody seems to know him.  He is gaining a similar status in Brussels to that he has in Ireland, and he is certainly making an impact.</p><p>There are two issues I wish to raise, one of which has already been addressed by Mr. Kelly, which is that of scrutiny of European Union legislation by the Seanad.  The reality is that Brussels and Strasbourg influence much of what we do here, yet there is a huge disconnect, as others have mentioned, including Senator Susan O'Keeffe.  As I know he agrees with that proposition, I will not waste my time on that issue.</p><p>I wish to mention the co-location of the European Parliament.  The financial and environmental costs of having two seats, one in Strasbourg and one in Brussels, strike me as extraordinary.  It is estimated that it costs between &euro;180 million and &euro;250 million per year, as every month the Parliament must be moved lock, stock and barrel from Brussels to Strasbourg, with files, staff and Members of the European Parliament all being transferred at great expense, for the sake of a few days' work before moving back to Brussels, only to repeat it the following month.  Does Mr. Kelly have a position on the issue?  Perhaps we should move towards a one-chamber European Parliament.  I commend him on his work and thank him for coming to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-04-30a.200" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1132" speakername="Marie Maloney" time="17:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013043000034#HH00300"><p>I welcome not only a fellow Kerry person but a fellow parishioner to the House and commend Deputy Se&aacute;n Kelly on his work in the European Parliament.  I would like to hear his views on the proposed alignment of the partnerships with local authorities and how it will affect EU funding, as there is a fear in communities that the funding will be diluted.  EU nationals working here have child benefit paid to the countries in which their families reside.  It is a bone of contention for many people, especially in a time of recession, that child benefit is paid at the Irish rate in other EU countries.  Has the proposal that child benefit be paid at the rate of the country in which the family resides been discussed at EU level, as the rate is quite high in Ireland?</p><p>My third question concerns EU tourism policy.  In Europe, has Deputy Kelly heard discussion of the price of rail travel in Ireland and whether it is prohibitive for tourism, given that a one-way rail ticket costs the same as a return ticket?  I am aware this is having an adverse affect on tourism.  I would welcome his views on those issues.</p></speech>

Given the welcome and support he has received from all the Kerry representatives in the House, his re-election must be assured, whether Ireland has 11 or 12 seats the next time.</p><p>I enjoyed his presentation.  It was encouraging to hear that we are coming to the end of the firefighting and will see a new era of architects with a better engineered European structure where, I hope, the mistakes of the past will not be repeated.  My questions relate to Mr. Kelly's experience since he became an MEP.  For a person who was previously involved in an organisation that made decisions quickly and achieved much in a relatively short period, I am curious to know whether he finds the pace of decision-making within the European Union frustrating.  How much influence can 12 MEPs have in such a large Parliament?  Does it matter whether we have 11 or 12 MEPs in the future?  How well do the 12 Irish MEPs work together on common issues?  With regard to the jobs crisis, Mr. Kelly mentioned the huge challenges we are facing.  Where does he see the real opportunities for job creation?  What areas should be targeted?  What advice would he give to the Government to stimulate the economy and create badly needed jobs?</p></speech>

N&oacute;sfaidh an aimsir.  Is maith an sc&eacute;ala&iacute; &iacute;.</p><p>I was in the middle of responding to Senator Sean D. Barrett, whose father I admired immensely, on an important point about education, particularly at primary level.  It is an issue we are highlighting at the education committee in the European Parliament, especially with regard to science and languages.  Ireland has failed badly in respect of languages.  The one thing I notice in Europe is that the vast majority of people speak two, three or four languages without difficulty.  There are opportunities for people as interpreters if they have languages.  Two years ago I visited Intel, where a presentation was made to me and I was informed that 25,000 jobs were lost to the sector in Ireland because although we had people with skills they did not have the language skills required.  Germans or French people want to deal with people in their own language.  The Senator is right; this should start at primary level.  Like sport, the younger a person takes up a language, the easier it is for them.  Members may have heard of CoderDojo in the D&aacute;il.  I took that to the European Parliament.  It is helping to fill a void in respect of skills.  There are 2 million job vacancies in Europe owing to a lack of ICT skills.  To some extent, that is an indictment of educationalists generally and a lack of vision.  That is the reason there is a constant need for more interaction among education institutions, business, industry and politicians - to ascertain the trends and ensure those gaps will not occur into the future.</p><p>Senator Susan O'Keeffe mentioned connecting with Europe; that is a big problem.  There are two things I wish to highlight.  First, good news is no news.  If one does good work it will not be reported, but if one says something controversial one has a much better chance of being noticed.  That is the reality. Second - I have said this in the European Parliament on a few occasions - the European Union is the worst PR machine in the world.  For all the good work it does, it gets no credit.  Member states will speak about the money they are giving for this and that without any reference to the fact that the money is coming from Europe, and the European Union does nothing about it.  There is a major job to be done in looking at the way in which the message is communicated.  Initiatives such as this, with MEPs addressing the Seanad, are important in helping to get that message across.  If one speaks to any visitor group to the European Parliament I can almost guarantee they will all say they have a far more positive view of Europe as a result of the visit.</p> <p>Obviously, there is a job to be done in communicating the message.</p><p>People give out about the powers of the European Union.  Those powers were given to it by the people, or by their governments, in the treaties.  If they want to change them, then it is a matter for the people.  That point is often lost when discussing what is happening.</p><p>I see my good neighbour Senator Paul Coghlan has been joined by other neighbours Senators Sheahan and Moloney.  </p></speech>

Croatia will join on 1 July and there are many applicant countries.  I have used the phrase <i>festina lente</i> and believe we should expand perhaps more slowly than we are currently, in order that we can control it properly and it does not unravel, which is a slight danger.</p><p>  We do not know what the constituencies of MEPs will be at the next election because a decision has not been made.  We probably will not know until July or possibly September, which is six or seven months before the election.

I said to the parliamentary party that I felt there was too much expectation in regard to the Irish Presidency because it was looking at the countries before us and after us and at our record where each of our six Presidencies were deemed successful.  It was perhaps expecting too much of the Irish Presidency.  The Irish Presidency is going well and our reputation is very good from that point of view.  The vast majority of MEPs work hard.</p><p>I was asked about co-operation.  We co-operate, in particular on national issues, and we discuss issues which will impact on Ireland.  For example, in regard to the Common Fisheries Policy, before the vote, Mr. Pat The Cope Gallagher said to me that my group - the European People's Party - was against the Hague Preferences, which was a special arrangement for Ireland, and asked if I could get a few people to vote with us on that.  I said I would because many would not know what they were voting on.  Seven people around me voted in favour and it was passed by six votes, so it was crucial.  We co-operate on such issues which is only right, or we nearly always co-operate.  Some might have a different ideological view.  However, in the vast majority of cases, we wear the green shirt once we step on the aeroplane.  </p><p>In regard to the single location, the leader of our group, Joseph Dual, is great but he comes from Strasbourg, so he does not want to hear about it.  However, over the past three years, the majority of MEPs have voted for a single location as opposed to going to Brussels and Strasbourg.  As was said, it costs &euro;180 million per year and the CO2 emissions are 19,000 tonnes, with lorries going to and fro.  There is the inconvenience because it is more difficult to get to Strasbourg as there are fewer flights going there.  It takes me approximately 13 hours to get to Strasbourg in that one has to wait on a bus for an hour in Frankfurt waiting for other MEPs to arrive.  I have made a number of suggestions.  We actually had a meeting last week at which I said that if MEPs wanted to keep Strasbourg, which is a lovely city, as a symbol of peace because of its history - depending on whether Germany or France won the war - perhaps we could go there one week each year.  That might be a sensible proposal.  Even though we go to a lovely building, it is idle 317 days of the year, so it does not make sense.  That should not happen, in particular at a time of austerity.  </p><p>The price of rail tickets is high but I think they are higher in Europe, unfortunately.  Again, I suppose it is an internal matter.  I got the train from Mallow last Saturday week and I think it cost &euro;62 return but if one was going for more than one day, it would cost a lot more.  In the times we are in, one cannot control everything.  Ideally, the less public transport costs, the better but at the same time, one has to balance the books.  </p></speech>

It is completely different.  Why would somebody in the private sector want to buy our lottery?  Why are we seeking &euro;500 million for the sale of our lottery, if it is not a sale?  Why is some outside gaming consortium in the private sector going to pay us?  Why are we looking for bidders, if it is not a sale over 20 years?  Who will give us &euro;500 million?</p><p>I understand we need the money to build the national children's hospital but my argument is that we are automatically on the back foot if we look for &euro;500 million.  If we were to get &euro;400 million, &euro;500 million or &euro;600 million upfront, that is a sale and if it is not a sale, it is a loan.  If it is a loan, that makes it even more disastrous.  Either way, we must pay it back.  Not only do we have to pay it back but we must pay back the profit on it.  If one has to extract profits, no gaming consortium or otherwise will give the Government &euro;500 million unless it will look for that &euro;500 million and the profits on it over 20 years back.</p><p>One cannot say it is a National Lottery Bill; it is the sale of the national lottery licence over 20 years for money upfront to pay for the national children's hospital.</p> <p>It follows that any investor will expect to make a massive profit from the venture.  It will have chosen it because the Irish national lottery is known as one of the best cash cows in Europe and is guaranteed its money back.  One cannot say that it is not a sale.  It is a sale of the national lottery licence.  It is not a national lottery Bill that will reap a rich reward.</p><p>I wish to make a basic point.  What if somebody hands over between &euro;400 million and &euro;600 million?  I feel that the national lottery is worth an awful lot more but we will not get that sum in July which is why selling it off is a massive mistake.  The sale is an exchange.  The licence is a commodity.  It is an exchange of the operation and running of the licence for the next 20 years yet we do not know what Ireland will look like in three years.  I hope that I have not been theatrical and declamatory as was stated last week.  I am extremely convinced about my claim and I would like the Minister of State to answer my query.  When people rose to speak about the matter they said, and they have told me the same for weeks, that this is not a sale.  However, on every second line the term &quot;sale&quot; is used.  It is the sale of the national lottery licence for 20 years and that is why the head of the Bill should be changed.  </p><p>I am a communicator - at least I hope that I am - and I implore the Minister of State to say what the legislation is.  This is obfuscation.  The whole thing is built around receipt of an upfront payment which twists our lottery from what it was into something else, a profit and loss margin.  The profit may come from a gaming consortium or whoever buys it.  The buyer will not be from England or Ireland because we do not have &euro;500 million.  An Post does not have &euro;500 million and I do not know of any pension fund with &euro;500 million.  People are looting their pension funds to pay for goods in this country.  I shall not carry on.  Perhaps the Minister of State will answer my question.  </p></speech>

Let us agree to that at the very least.</p><p>We, the Executive, have no responsibility in respect of the amendment.  The Senator shall accept it is a matter for the Speaker of the House, the Cathaoirleach.</p><p>With regard to the Title, I understand the view of the Senator but we do not agree.  She has her view and the Minister, Deputy Howlin, and the Government have another view.  I suspect that we will not reach an agreement on it but we may as the Bill progresses its way through Committee and Report Stages.</p><p>We do not agree with the Senator that this is a sale.  We believe that this is a competition under EU law to establish a licence, as it has in the past, for a period of 20 years.  We are hopeful that the competition process will obtain financing.  We all agree that finance is very important for a national infrastructure project such as a new tertiary paediatric hospital.  It is the firm view of the Government that the Title of the Bill, which is effectively the issue that we are discussing, section 1, is correct.  We are using the opportunity, as I said last week in the House, presented by the competition for a new licence to generate an upfront payment, part of which will be used to finance the new national children's hospital.  Even if no provision were made for the upfront payment, a competition would have to take place for another licence.  One might question the duration of the licence but either way a licence competition must occur.  It is our considered view that the means through which we have chosen to operate the licence for a 20-year period with an upfront payment means much-needed funds can be used for this purpose.  I know that the Senator does not agree with my comment but I respectfully disagree with her.  It is okay not to agree on the issue but that is what parliamentary democracy is about.  It is okay not to disagree.  </p></speech>

I am not in any way personally angry that people do not agree with me.  I am trying to make a case by making two points.  First, the sale is not under EU law, it was not under EU law and it is not part of EU Law.  It was not even part of the troika's communication with the Minister at the time, it was outside of it.  I have a quote by him that stated that it was outside but he and his Department made the decision which is fair enough.</p><p>Second, the Minister of State said that the competition must take place anyway.  Yes, the competition does have to take place for operation but not for sale.  Of course he was correct that it must be opened up for operation.  I know that it was the Minister's Department which decided to sell and the idea came from New South Wales.  Over the past three or four years it has been a trendy idea to sell lottery licences because they are natural cash cows, especially the Irish one which is a most magnificent sacred cash cow.  I understand the reasons to sell them and to get money.  Let us not say what it is not.  It is not a national lottery Bill, it is the sale of the lottery licence.  It is not under EU law, it was not part of the troika and is not part of EU law.  It does not have to happen because one must have a competition to sell, one does not.  One must have competition to open up the operation which is different from a sale.  The Minister decided to sell it because he wanted the money upfront.  I do not have a problem with that but let us say what it is.  We are not saying what it is.  My problem is that we are not doing it for ourselves and that we are letting somebody else do it.  I am not against the measure but we could have done it for ourselves by providing a weekly draw.  That is my opinion and I am not against the measure.  I am opposed to selling it to a gaming consortium from outside of the island.  Here we go again.  It reminds me of what happened to Shell, pharmaceutical companies, Eircom and the privatisation of public moneys.  </p></speech>

She is right and the Minister conceded that point from the start.</p><p>As the Minister of State responsible for procurement, I have a little knowledge of the matter myself because these licences are under EU procurement, particularly when it comes to a State asset which the national lottery is, effectively.  As the Minister has said, we have a responsibility.  As the Senator will know, between 1999 and 2001, three competitors competed for the licence, Sisal from Italy, Autotote Lottery from the USA and the winning bid came from An Post, our own national lottery company.  She is incorrect to say that EU law in this area does not apply.  That is not correct, it does apply.    </p></speech>

It is one of the first occasions on which the Government has admitted that something it is doing has not been forced on it by anyone else.  It is worth putting on the record that the original troika agreement did not commit the Government to sell any State assets but merely asked the Government to examine what I believe was in the McCarthy report at the time.  There was no agreement to sell State assets, and therefore, what the Minister put on the record with regard to this legislation is important.</p></speech>

I do not understand why there should be any resistance to telling the public exactly what it is, namely, the sale of the national lottery.  That is what we are doing; we are selling the national lottery.  I believe in honesty.  I know it is not fashionable but it is good to be honest, and the Title of the Bill should express the content of the Bill and its impact on the Irish people.</p><p>It strikes me that we should try to keep as much as we can that is profitable at home.  This is selling off State assets, and I do not approve of it at all.  It does not bother me whether it is at the instruction of the troika but it is very bullish and hectoring.  We should retain as much of this as we can and make as much profit out of it as we can, because public assets that are privatised invariably go wallop from the point of view of the public.  I instanced previously the bin collection services, which are disastrous because they have been privatised.  There is mess everywhere throughout Dublin and the poor unfortunate corporation, having had its aspect of it sold off, now has to come around and clean up after the commercial boys.</p></speech>

It is about time we started revising drastically our view about the virtues of competition.  It can drive people out of business sometimes.  Unscrupulous people can use competition.  We only have to look at what is happening to our domestic shops.  Enormous supermarkets are coming in here selling trash, doing down local bakeries-----</p></speech>

We are selling bits and pieces of Ireland, as we have done in allowing these supermarkets to come in here.</p><p>Competition was invoked by the Minister.  That idea is ludicrous.  I remember being here when a previous Government introduced the Competition Bill, under which everyone had to compete for everything and everything had to be advertised.  It was just like the bloody European Union, but it forgot to ensure that the chief executive would be appointed as a result of an open competition.  I do not believe in bowing down to these false gods of competition, EU authority and all the rest of it.  It is about time people challenged them, and thank God for Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell, her colleague, Senator Mary Ann O'Brien, and others who are prepared to stand up, speak the truth and alert people to the fact that this is happening.</p><p>Also, we have a reasonable lottery, and if we sell it I believe it will be largely out of control.

The reason for the Government's view of section 1 is that this is not the sale of the national lottery.  It is effectively a long-term, 20-year lease, and therefore it would not be correct to say the national lottery is being sold, because it is not being sold.  There are many examples of State assets being leased into the private sector for a period of years, and a number of models in which that occurs.  We stand over section 1 because it is not the sale of a State asset.</p></speech>

This is the Government's decision.  It is the view of both parties in Government that this Bill, and this process, should proceed.  The Minister is not taking some sort of out-of-orbit position and moving ahead of everyone else.  This is the Government's position.  The Government stands over it and it respectfully asks colleagues here in the Upper House to support this Bill.  We are not selling this asset in perpetuity.  That is not happening.  It is a long-term lease.</p><p>Senator O'Brien asked if I had a means of establishing how we would come up with a figure, and she gave a figure.  The Government has been careful not to use a figure because, pending the decision of this House on the Bill, a competition will commence and it would not be useful for any Minister to set out his or her ambition for an amount.  That would not be useful.  We will have a competition, and the outcome of the competition will set out what the market shows for these things.</p><p>In terms of the operation of all these licences, there is a view internationally that they can be done differently and that the model of business can be different.  The Senator would know from her own business that flabby costs can be taken out.</p></speech>

We must have the same rationale and the same competitive edge in the public sector as we evidently have in the private sector.</p><p>One of the reasons I suspect there could be interest in this lottery internationally is a view that significant savings can be made on its operations, which would make it more sustainable in the long run.  It is not just a question of people coming in to make a cheap buck out of our lottery.  On the contrary, one of the reasons people view it as a good licence to obtain is that they believe they can drive greater efficiencies.  It is no different from the rationale within the private sector.</p><p>Senator O'Brien asked if we are bound by this measure.</p> <p>The answer is "Yes", we are bound by this under EU law.  It is the same as the situation where Irish plcs and semi-State organisations can pitch for business across the 26 member states.  The same principle applies in this instance.  There must be consistency for procurement purposes across the European Union or advantage will be taken by the cottage industry of lawyers who take the State to task if there is some peculiarity in a procurement process.  What we are doing is entirely within the spirit and the letter of EU law.  It is in our own interests and the long-term interests of the lottery.</p></speech>

However, the Government does not have to put the national lottery to tender.  There is no EU law which prevents the Government from operating it within a Department.  EU procurement law is generally neutral on whether a state owns something.  It could be decided to run it from within a Department without putting it out to tender.</p></speech>

The section is directed by language.  I would have thought that was clear, philosophically.  A tender implies a contract and a sale.  The Minister of State is wrong to say one cannot sell a lease.  Of course, one can and it happens every day.  If one goes to London, buildings are often not bought outright as they are so enormously expensive.  One buys a lease.  The cost may be &euro;1 million for a 20 year lease.  If one buys something, it must be for sale.  Therefore, this is a sale.  It is not a sale for infinity, but then "infinity" is a problematic concept which few Members understand completely.  This is something of a problem.  There is no logical or philosophical reason to discount the change of title suggested by Senator Marie Louise O'Donnell.</p><p>I compliment the Minister of State on his fine use of Hiberno English in terms of language and pronunciation in referring to &quot;vagaries&quot;.  It is an Irish word and has an Irish meaning.  Among the English stress is placed on the first syllable.  I say this for the benefit of anyone on the neighbouring island who is listening on their twiddly thing.</p></speech>

I want to discuss the model itself in terms of section 3.  The Government is using the Bill as an opportunity to change fundamentally the model of the national lottery.  While we will be discussing the regulator later in the debate, the fact that the Minister is being removed from the equation and a regulator introduced underscores yet again the private, for-profit nature of the new lottery model being advanced.  The fact remains that since the commencement of the national lottery, we have seen &euro;12 billion in sales, &euro;6 billion in prizes and &euro;4 billion raised for good causes.  It has been a tremendous success story and has a tremendous track record.  That the amount of money generated through the current model has remained broadly the same despite the catastrophic collapse of the economy and the finances of the State is an indication of the resiliance and strength of the current model.  Therefore, we should not change it.  To brand as positive reform interference with something that has been so successful is wrong.  We should not pretend that because the licence is up for renewal, these changes have had to be made.  It is an initiative of the Government and a move from the traditional, successful model over which the State has had some control and authority to a privatised model.</p><p>No one will make the up-front payment on the basis of pragmatic decision-making.  Whoever takes on the licence will do so solely on the basis that it is a commercial concern.  On Second Stage in the D&aacute;il the Minister and the Minister of State reaffirmed what a successful story the lottery had been, which begs the question of why it is being undermined by changing the model and moving towards privatisation.</p></speech>

While the Bill replicates many of the provisions of the National Lottery Act 1986, it is intended that the former will replace the latter.  Therefore, section 3 provides for the repeal of the 1986 Act.  Section 1(4) provides that a ministerial order to repeal the 1986 Act may provide for the repeal of different provisions on different days.  Section 6(2) provides that notwithstanding its repeal, the provisions of the 1986 Act will continue to apply to the current licence as held by An Post National Lottery Company until the termination of that company.</p><p>Before the Government made a decision on this legislation, it considered an analysis of the options for the licence.  The decision was based on that analysis.  While it is correct to say the model and the appointment of a regulator are new, it is not unusual in other areas of State activity to appoint a regulator to supervise the operation of a licence.  It is a more recent parliamentary device.  The new model puts the regulator at the heart of the lottery.  The Government's decision was made in the context of the current fiscal environment.</p> <p>All we are doing in section 3 is providing for that, so that the long-term sustainability of the lottery adapts itself to that environment in the most efficient way possible.</p></speech>

The question that arises is: can we believe this promise?  The record shows that the Government cannot be trusted when it comes to promises made.  Why can this provision not be written into the legislation?</p><p>  The proposed amendments refer at least to the purpose of this sale of the national lottery licence.  What will happen to the money derived from the sale if a financial emergency arises during the summer?  One may well arise, given that we have been told Anglo Irish Bank may require additional capital when assets are realised and that there may well be other capital calls on the banks.  There is no legal commitment to use this money for the construction of the children's hospital.  It could well be that the people are being sold a pup, namely, that this licence is being sold and no provision is being made, legally or otherwise, for that money to be utilised for the construction of the children's hospital.  We have to take the word of the Minister in this regard, which is not believed by the public.  That is an unfortunate political reality.  The broken promises have been rehearsed on numerous occasions.</p><p>  In proposing these amendments we are seeking to ensure that the money will go to the construction of the children's hospital and that the National Treasury Management Agency be designated with responsibility in this regard.  We are also seeking that the Minister bring forward a report in regard to the ring-fencing of that money.  We believe this is critical.  What we are seeking may not even go far enough but it is important to highlight the significant absence of such provision from the legislation.  I will push this to a vote because I believe this provision is central to the legislation.  While four years ago I would have advocated something along the lines of privatisation of the national lottery - it is opportune to do this now given that the current licence will soon expire - as a means of generating funds for capital purposes, that is not what the legislation will do.  That is unfortunate and it is a missed opportunity.</p></speech>

My personal views on this matter differ from my political view on it.  I would like to know the reason the Minister of State would not give credence to a dedicated draw for the national children's hospital, which is one of the most important aspects of health provision in this country.  If we do not have education or health provision for children we do not even have a country.  The British did this during the Olympics.  I have stated many times in the debate on the sale of the national lottery licence that if we are serious about building a national children's hospital we could have done so through funding derived from a dedicated draw.  I believe the Irish people would have supported it and that the hospital would long since have been built.  Some of the &euro;240 million per annum available after prize and administration costs had been met could have been used to build the children's hospital over the next three years.  The Irish people would have supported it.  Why was this not given credibility?  Why has there been no outside-the-box thinking on this proposal, which is well proven and in respect of which the statistics indicate no other good causes would have suffered?  I would like a response from the Minister of State to that question, given that stated reason for selling the licence is to obtain funding for construction of the hospital.</p></speech>

Has an actuarial valuation of the national lottery been carried out?  I ask that question based on the assumption that between &euro;400 and &euro;600 million will be achieved from the sale of the lease for 20 years.  A turnover of &euro;762 million with a net profit of &euro;240 million does not add up.  The Government hopes to put by &euro;300 million from the sale of the licence for the national children's hospital.  What will happen if the highest tender is &euro;300 million?  Much of the discussion thus far has been about bids from outside tenders.  I am aware of an Irish consortium hoping to tender for it.  I hope it will be successful; however, we have no power over that.  The figures in respect of gross turnover and net profits do not add up.  I have a 20-year lease, which includes a five-year rent review and a ten-year opt-out clause.</p></speech>

I am sure the Senator will appreciate that it would not be prudent for any Minister or the Government as a whole to place that assessment in the public domain in advance of the competitive tender.  I was told that when the previous Government had decided on decentralisation, property prices in the proposed locations for decentralisation mushroomed by one third on the evening of the decision.  The way to proceed is to first seek support from the Houses of the Oireachtas for the legislative base and then run the competitive tender.  The third step is to see what exactly is in place.  We have an open mind on this.  The Senator is correct in assuming we have clear indicative valuations which are predicated on an expert report and analysis submitted to the Government in advance of the process.  I understand Davy was the company in question.  This is in the public domain.  Based on the potential valuation, the Government has embarked on the process.  It would not help the process, however, if a Minister was to state in public what he or she believed the valuation was.  We have a firm view on what we want to obtain from the process.  Let us just see whether we do obtain it.</p><p>  With regard to the issue the Senator Byrne and others raised about ring-fencing, I have some sympathy for the argument.  If the objective is to get the up-front payment to build a hospital, it is not unfair of parliamentarians on both sides of the House to seek guarantees if there are to be risks later in the year, as EU officials tell us.  The Senator is correct in highlighting this issue.  To get over the problem, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform made a firm commitment to Deputy Tom Fleming on Committee and Report Stages that when we concluded the process at the end of the competitive tendering and valuation process, he would return to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform to discuss the arrangements for the up-front sum payable to the successful bidder.  Deputy Tom Fleming acknowledged the Minister's <i>bona fides</i> is in that regard.  We want to involve colleagues because, if they choose to do so, they will give us the power to embark on the process.  Therefore, it is only right and proper that a committee of the House examine this issue in detail with a Minister at the end of the process.  Our firm view is that Parliament, in all its manifestations, needs to be kept abreast of this issue.  The way in which we believe this should be done is through informing a committee of the House.</p><p>  Senator Marie Louise O'Donnell asked why we had chosen to go this route as against the one-off dedicated draw for the purpose of obtaining funds for the new national children's hospital.  She correctly cited the example from the United Kingdom of where a series of draws had been established for the purpose of funding the bid.  To be honest, I am not very competent on this issue, but my understanding from the debate thus far is that the Government examined the matter.  The view of the Government is that if we were to do as proposed, it would represent a significant drawing away from other good causes up and down the country to which people were already committed.  The Senator will make the point that this is a once-off project based on getting behind the campaign to build a hospital as part of one great initiative, but, given the scale and the number of organisations at the pin of their collar trying to raise funds, one would have to ask whether it would be an undue burden on them in circumstances where we want to keep all of the voluntary bodies and NGOs in place in communities.  From my limited understanding of this issue, there was an assessment in this regard made by the Government which concluded that the best route forward was through the one suggested.  I hope I have answered all of the questions.</p></speech>

He has refused to state the sum the Government expects to receive from the valuation.  He is right in that regard, but I ask him to examine, in his capacity as procurement Minister, the process throughout the State system.  Certainly in local authorities, councillors are still going around stating there is &euro;25,000 for one road or &euro;50,000 for another.  It is lethal to the tendering process if firms know exactly the bidding position at local level.  This is rampant throughout the country.</p></speech>

In seeking the permission of both Houses to advance this legislation, we are asking to give the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and his Department the opportunity to strike the balance in a fair way that will allow people to see the opportunity presented by the lottery, while at the same time putting in place the safety valves we would like to see.  The way in which one should strike that balance is through ministerial order and negotiation, rather than primary legislation, notwithstanding the fact that the primary legislation needs to set out the standard on which the discussions, negotiations and deal between the winning bidder and the Government are to take place.  The balance needs to be struck at the end of the process, having regard to the fact that all of these issues have been raised in the context of the discussion in both Houses.</p><p>  I do not disagree with Senator Thomas Byrne's point.  The small contracts announced locally from time to time are an important source of local employment.  In many cases, the contracting is carried out by the local authority as opposed to the State.  The State gives a block grant for various purposes, including road construction and flood relief works, for example.  Local authorities need to be mindful of this and of how they construct their panels and proceed with procurement.  It is fair to state we all want , the Government's website for the purposes of procurement, to contain every SME.  I understand up to 50% of all Irish SMEs do not even know about it.  One cannot pitch for Government business unless one knows about Government business.  That is important.  There ought to be confidence at local authority level that we will run the competitions in a fair and open way to allow businesses, both big and small, to pitch.  The Senator has made a fair point that if one sets out the block grant by way of announcements by politicians, it may result in a false dichotomy.  We always need to be mindful of this and guard against it.  The way around it is through the etenders website and using technology for the purposes of achieving better procurement and helping Irish SMEs to determine whether they can win a percentage of the public pie.</p> <p>The way around this is through e-tenders and using technology for better procurement, as well as helping Irish SMEs to find out if they can win a percentage of the public pie.  The public pie, even in these constrained times, is more than &euro;9.5 billion per year.

Officials have also had discussions with trade unions which represent the staff of the national lottery.  These discussions were held to clarify the issues that arise in the context of the next national lottery licence.  Further engagement on this matter will take place as soon as possible.  In view of the ongoing consultation on the matter, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage.  However, we are working through these issues to obtain a fair outcome for all the people concerned, given their long-standing service to the company.

I understand the very legitimate case put as to why we should establish any body unless there is a compelling need for it.  We thought long and hard about it.  Under this legislation we are asking people to make a bid for a robust contribution to the State.  They will want to ensure that the licence will operate in accordance with the law, and the general trend now is for that not to be done by the State but by an independent person.  I do not expect this to be a very elaborate body.  It will be a small, self-funding unit.  It will be funded by the lottery profits.  I hope it will be a modest outfit.  We will set out in the licence terms the scope and work of the new regulator.  Other than ensuring full compliance with the terms of both the law and the licence agreement, it will also ultimately do the ground work for the next lottery licence because, under the law, that will not be a matter for a Government Department but for the regulator.</p><p>I do not wish to trespass on the remit of another Minister but Members will be aware that general legislation on gambling is being examined.  Many Members expressed a concern in this regard on Second Stage.  I am aware from reading international papers on this area of gambling that lottery operators do not even like to regard this as gambling.  The lotto is somehow like a national punt that people take on the grand national.  However, it is very regulated.  There is a great deal of other gambling that is not regulated at present, including online gambling, online casinos and so forth.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, is advancing detailed legislation in that regard.  I have posited the view, although it might not come to pass, that we might have a single regulator for gambling and that the lottery regulator might migrate into that wider role, but that is a matter to be considered by the Minister, Deputy Shatter, and would be subject to legislation being brought forward for consideration by the Houses in due course.</p><p>However, even as a standalone entity, I am convinced from my consideration of international best practice that there is a case for a discrete, singular function, lottery regulator.  It will not be extensive.  I understand the very reasonable point that we should not set up another quango.  This is a small, discrete, single function body which will be funded by the lottery, not the State.</p></speech>

Also, if we are to open up online gambling, it should be regulated.  I give the Minister that as my only gift in this whole thing.</p></speech>

Why can a Minister not do the job?  At least if we are not happy with a Minister he can be kicked out.  We can do that and there is public accountability.  When a politician makes a decision the public can do something about it to effect change.  We have had multiple instances of regulatory capture over the years, most famously with the banks.  They were all playing golf together as the banking system was destroyed because of regulatory capture.  We have seen other regulators in the media discussing price rises and so on but they seem to be acting on behalf of the industry they are regulating.  One does not know what is going on.  They see their area as their fiefdom and they become so entrenched with the industry and so knowledgeable of it that they cannot see the other side.  There must be a way of doing this differently.  One way would be to have a politician do it.  In the United States, people in such positions are routinely elected.  Another way to do it - the Minister might consider this - would be to appoint a regulator from within the staff of the Department to do it as a side job within the Department, rather than establishing a new office.  A relatively senior official could carry out these functions and it would not be too much.  Why not do it within the Department?  Does it have to be independent of the Department or could it operate independently within the Department to avoid the opening of a new office?  The Minister would have theoretical oversight of the official and therefore there would be some political responsibility.  There may be an example to follow in the appeals office of the Department of Social Protection, which is independent but remains part of the Department.</p><p>I urge the Minister to consider some of these possibilities because the legislation allows the Minister to appoint a person on such terms and conditions as he may determine.  Therefore, he could appoint someone to do it for nothing - for example, a businessman who is independently wealthy and honest and whom the public would accept.  Let such a person be the regulator, as in the case of an honorary consul.  As far as I can see, there will not be a great deal of work to be carried out.  The regulator would not be regulating a market as such but only one entity.  I am concerned that if we set up an independent office, it would simply become a sub-office of the lottery company.  It may be better to have someone who is completely independent and who will take a wider approach, because he is not dealing only with a lottery company.  If such a person was dealing only with the lottery company he would start to see everything from the point of view of the lottery company.  That is the natural way of things.  It has happened time and again with regulators in this country and other countries.</p></speech>

The Minister has referred to the possibility that the office of the lottery regulator could be enhanced to create a gambling regulator.  That is a different story and it is badly needed.  It occurs to me that we could set up a lottery regulator who would be paid for by the lottery company and whose biggest decisions would be to allow the lottery to bring in new games, etc.  I would prefer if in some way a percentage of profits could be taken off the lottery company to run the regulator's office.  This should be provided for in the legislation.  Hypothetically, the lottery company could pay &euro;1 million per year to run the regulator's office and the regulator could then determine whether the lottery company should be given three or five new games this year, next year or whenever.  While I agree with an overall regulator for all gambling, I believe we should tread carefully.  I am concerned that the regulator would have one job and that his job, effectively, would be to accede to requests from the lottery company to introduce new lottery games and, as we discussed previously, put gambling in people's faces.</p></speech>

The points made are very reasonable.  I am not in the business of setting up any entity for the sake of it, but I am convinced by the argument put to us by my advisers and by the specialist advisers we brought in that this is the best way to go.  I have no wish to hang my hat entirely in respect of the potential for the office to migrate to something else.  I have no wish to make commitments on that, but it is something I would like to see and I believe it would be a good thing if we had a more regulated structure for gambling.  Anyway, that is for another day, another Minister and another debate in the House.</p><p>I made a point in the other House and I have no wish to sound discordant in this regard.  Reference was made to the failures of banking regulation.  Bluntly, the regulator is only as good as the policy set down.  There was a determination of light-touch policy that broke up the powers of the Central Bank at the time.  A committee made those recommendations and they were enacted.  Light-touch regulation was the order of the day.  However, not all regulators have failed.  I believe we need to have an independent regulator to ensure the law is applied.  I do not believe the regulator would be captured by the lottery company because the terms and conditions, wages and so on would be set by the Minister and not by the lottery company.  Therefore, being nice to the lottery company would not result in an enhanced wage packet or bonuses for the regulator.  We will set the schedule of payments to support the office of the regulator.</p><p>Senator Byrne makes a fair point.  Up to now the Minister has been the regulator and it has worked.  That is true.  However, this is a new departure, and since we are modernising the legislation it is appropriate to take the regulation of games or the regulation of how the lottery is done away from the Minister and leave it to a professional, competent regulator.  I have acceded to the request made in the other House that the regulator be amenable to the Houses.  It would be proper for this committee, if it believed he or she was not doing his or her job, to bring the regulator in and put questions and get a regular report.  There will be an annual report as well.  The regulator will be subject to a good deal of scrutiny, probably in a way that a civil servant would not, unless one established the office of the regulator - I believe this is what Senator Byrne is suggesting - and appointed a civil servant to that office.  Is that what he is suggesting?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-04-30a.350" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1116" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="19:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013043000042#QQ00700"><p>No; I am suggesting something like the social welfare appeals office, which is independent of the Minister but is actually part of the Department of Social Protection administratively.  As I understand it, staff are appointed by the Minister to be independent but the office is within the Department.  The Minister could establish a smaller entity within a Department in an administrative sense.  It would save costs, there would be no need to recruit staff, and the civil servant could possibly be given some other things to do.  It is not that we are accusing people of corruption or suggesting they will act only in the interests of the lottery company or that they will do something wrong.  Bank regulation is not the only example of regulatory capture.  There are multiple examples of regulatory capture in various countries throughout the world.  It is a natural consequence of having a regulator for one industry that he begins to see everything from the companies' point of view.  I cannot see how the regulator could stay independent if his entire life is dedicated to discussions with the lottery company unless he has the opportunity to talk to colleagues within the Department and get a different view.  Such a person would be single-minded and would believe he is doing the right thing, but I can see it ending badly.  I do not mean in an unlawful or corrupt way or anything like that, but it is the natural order of things that regulators inevitably know too much about the market and too much about the bodies they regulate and simply become less independent as a result.</p></speech>

I believe the regulator is a bigger job than that and it would not be a case of having nothing else to do.  There are two massive strands to this: the regulation of the lottery, because it is so vast and because it makes so much money, starting at &euro;763 million per year; and the distribution of money to good causes, including the questions of objectivity and how we distribute the money.</p> <p>The Government is often accused of being prejudicial when it comes to giving lottery money to constituencies.  </p><p>The opening up of online gambling is an enormous issue.  I agree with the Minister - it is possibly the only thing on which I have ever agreed with him - that it is a most important role.  Objectivity is the key, which is why the regulator is in place, not a civil servant who has nothing better to do.  Other lotteries around the world have regulators who like to speak to other regulators about co-ordinated lottery funding, namely, north-south, which did not happen here for that very reason.</p></speech>

It has been promised in terms of reform and it is a pity to see matters relating to the national lottery moving away from the scope of parliamentary questions.  I listened to what the Minister had to say about the regulator coming before committees.  The tabling of a parliamentary question in the D&aacute;il is a critical function of a Member and should be allowable in the regulation of the national lottery.</p></speech>

It is inevitable that there will be massive communication between both sides.  While it may not be a direct interest of the regulator under the terms of this section - perhaps I should have discussed this issue under an earlier section - it seems that the Minister will have to keep a close eye on how the regulator operates in practice.  He or she should not get too close to the lottery company.  He or she should keep his or her mind broad in how things operate and should not be captured.  As I keep saying, regulatory capture is a well known phenomenon in economics and business.  It is not just about the unfortunate regulator of the banks. The Minister has to be on guard.</p></speech>

It will be the job of the Oireachtas to ensure this will work.  This section obliges the regulator and its staff to disclose any pecuniary or beneficial interest they may have in a matter which falls to be considered by the regulator, his or her office or staff.  It requires the regulator to disclose any conflict of interest he or she may have to the Minister and that a staff member to make any such disclosure to the regulator.</p></speech>

Why do I feel that in holding this competition the Government is giving away our rights as Irish people to make profits and extract them in the next 20 years?  Perhaps somebody is lurking in the background, but we cannot get involved in the competition.  The competition for the up-front payment, namely, the selling of the lottery licence, is skewing the issue.  It is the reason we are all here, why we will probably not have a regulator and why we will have to extract funds and pay back profits to gaming consortiums which will come in with the highest bid.  I asked the Minister about bids for the licence.  In one sense, the Minister's office is trying to constrain online gambling.  If that is done, it will bring down the bid, but if not, it will bring up it.</p> <p>The holding of a competition for the upfront payment for the leasing, sale or loaning of the licence for 20 years is the nub of the whole thing.  I am deeply opposed to this for 1,000 different reasons, one being that we will not get the right price because of the constraint and we will have an explosion if we do not have it.</p><p>I am not against change and reform, as I was accused of.  I am not a purist, a fantasist or a lunatic, but I feel we could be opening up online gambling, and restricting it or semi-restricting it for ourselves.  It is the upfront payment that skews us to have to repeal an Act, change things, extract a profit, because no matter who they are, whether they are Irish, English or Italian, they are not altruistic and they are not Santa.  So over 20 years a profit is going to be extracted back, and rightly so.  Give somebody &euro;500 million and you are going to get &euro;1 billion back over the years.  Section 26 is the nub of the Bill, and I am absolutely and entirely opposed to it for those reasons.  We are no longer in control.  When you are in control you can tighten things.  When you are not in control, and the people who are operating the lotto do not get their money back, it can end up getting loosened, prices can go up and profits must be made.  I wonder about that Hobson's choice, because that is the nub of the whole thing.</p></speech>

I have explained the genesis of this.  It is no knee-jerk reaction.  We have thought it out very carefully from the time it was first explored.  In the preparation for the capital programme we examined how we can provide the capital infrastructure we need.  I have just come from a meeting earlier today with the European Investment Bank to get more capital because we have a big deficit regarding schools, the new Grangegorman campus, some transport projects and primary health care centres.  There is so much we need to do and so little capital.  We need to do these for a range of reasons.  Not only do we need schools for children, we need to have jobs for the people building them.</p><p>One of the big capital projects we wanted to do in the health area, as I explained, was to build the national children's hospital.  As there was so much to do in health, we determined to keep the level of capital available under the capital programme in the health area unchanged at a very high level, while everybody else was squeezed, particularly transport.  Even within that high level there was no scope for the children's hospital, and I did not want to abandon it.  I thought about getting an upfront payment, as other countries have done.  This is not unique and the Senator knows that.  We can have a very well-regulated, well-run lotto that meets the needs of the State and people or groups who want a flutter or a gamble on a weekly basis, and keeps the excitement and fun element in the national lottery.</p><p>We will obviously migrate to different platforms including online because that is the way we will do more and more of our business anyway, and it would be a Luddite approach to think that we cannot do that for the next 20 years.  By the end of that time we will all be doing all our business online.  At the same time we can get the capital this year, now, to be certain we can build the national children's hospital.  Other ideas have been proffered about dedicated games, etc., but I can do this with certainty.  It is the right thing to do and I recommend it to the House.  As I said, it is no knee-jerk reaction.  It is a very considered opinion.  We have looked at what happens elsewhere in the world.  This is a Bill that has taken very careful crafting.  We have had expert advice externally as well as internally.  Notwithstanding the sincere and genuine views expressed, I recommend we do this.</p></speech>

Hypothetically, if we thought we would achieve &euro;450 million as an upfront payment, what if we were to go to the markets or world banks for a loan instead of an upfront payment, with the Irish lottery to stay within the State as collateral?  We know, and have commended, how well the lottery is being run, how well it has withstood the recession, its turnover and its profitability.  I am sure the Minister has considered getting that loan at a good interest rate, allowing us to keep the lottery, rather than the upfront payment.  The lottery is better than any collateral one can think of for the markets.  What would have been the equation?  I am sure the Minister feels saddened and I know he has had the best expertise in the world to leave it outside of our nation.</p></speech>

Would we gain more from borrowing the money for ourselves from a bank that has &euro;500 million?  Maybe we could ask Mr. Richie Boucher for his salary?  He has a lot of money from his salary.  I am not being smart, but can the Minister tell me what will be extracted from the lottery for this upfront payment?  What will continue to be extracted?  Will we Senators know that?  I know the Minister's heart is in the right place, but is this not the privatisation of public funding, which we are totally against in this country?  We have seen what it has done.  We know that any kind of private gaming consortium, or people who have lots of money, who come in and bid on something must get back their profit.  It is their duty to get back their profit.  Camelot Group gave a &pound;5 million advance to its board seven or eight weeks ago because of its success.  It is crazy.  There is the other side of this, that is the privatisation of public funding.  I just do not think the upfront payment is worth it.  I want to know what is going to be extracted and what will continue to be extracted over the 20 years, because we do not know what Ireland will look like in three years, let alone 20 years.</p></speech>

So in the 20 years they will have a turnover of between &euro;19 billion and &euro;20 billion.  With a possible turnover of &euro;20 billion over the next 20 years, a small percentage going to the Government would cover the national children's hospital.</p></speech>

This licence is due to be renewed.  We have to tender for the licence in any event.  We could do it in the traditional way we have done it to date or we can do it in an upfront payment way.  I am a social democrat, as Senators know, but I do not regard business and making a profit as a dirty occupation.  Obviously whoever is successful in this will expect a return for their investment.  Nobody argues with that.  However, we have controlled the things we want to control.  The bigger the lotto is, the more likely they will get a substantially better return on their investment, but also the bigger the flow of money will be to good causes, because that is a fixed percentage.</p> <p>I listened to Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; on the last occasion.  He rowed in behind the Senator&rsquo;s view that we should have a dedicated lottery.  There are plenty of arguments about having a game devoted entirely to the national children&rsquo;s hospital for the next 20 years and borrowing money against it.  Such a development would impact on the funds available for good causes.  There is a finite sum of money.  If one were to take away a large chunk of it to fund the national children&rsquo;s hospital, funding for the Irish language, sporting and other causes would be squeezed.  I am trying to square a circle to hold on to funding and increase it in order that all of the organisations that depend on it will continue to have an income stream and that we will have a robust and good lottery that people will continue to support.  Would I be better off not doing it at all and borrowing the money?  We could do it through a public private partnership, but it would not be done in the timeframe we envisage.  It would mean other projects of substance would be knocked off the list.  I could replace the whole Grangegorman project and it would not be enough in itself.</p></speech>

Steady on, please.  This has to be done in a regulated and measured way.  Having a professional operator who has competence operating within the regime is a much better way of doing it.</p><p>  I am exploring every avenue to get capital to invest in the economy.  Today we had very good talks with the president of the European Investment Bank, Mr. Werner Hoyer, and his team.  It was the first time the full board of the bank had met outside Luxembourg.  This year they will put &euro;600 million into this country for school bundles, road and other projects.  I am in talks with the Council of Europe Development Bank which is funding the project in Oberstown, a development I felt morally we had to pursue to take young boys out of the adult prison at Mountjoy.  One has to desperately scramble around to find the wherewithal to undertake these imperative projects.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, recently showed me the demographics to indicate how we needed to build more schools for 10,000 children a year.  We have approved three bundles under the PPP system, which are on top of the &euro;2 billion allocated to the schools capital programme.  We need to get the primary health care centres up and running to take the pressure off the acute hospital system.</p><p>  Everywhere I look there are screams for capital.  I am sure that if I came here with proposals to sell Coillte, we would have a robust debate.  People would not be happy with the sale of the generating elements of Bord G&aacute;is or the ESB's two foreign power stations.  We need objectively to make rational decisions to meet the needs of the people and the economy.  We are doing everything in a controlled and thoughtful way.  Doing nothing is not an option.  There is a comfort in the <i>status quo</i> and always an argument not to change it.  Objectively, this legislation is a creative and imaginative way of getting an additional significant sum of money which will create short-term construction jobs and, much more importantly, in the long term have a legacy for the Oireachtas, namely, the national children's hospital which will be a flagship for the island of Ireland and a beacon for all of Europe, if we get it right.</p></speech>

He has claimed he is a social democrat, that he does not think "business" is a dirty word and that he is all for profit.  I am all for profit, too.  However, in this case, it is profit for citizens.  We want to give the licence to a professional company.  There is a professional group of people in Middle Abbey Street running the lottery.  I want to keep the profits from the lottery for the people and causes that the Minister so eloquently explained he is under pressure to service.

If we get a substantial up-front payment of cash which I can turn into a national children&rsquo;s hospital and have more to invest in other capital projects, it will get some of the 200,000 of the 250,000 construction workers who lost their jobs and are still on the live register back into work.  Also, a national children&rsquo;s hospital will save children&rsquo;s lives.  This can all be achieved while having a robust, well regulated lottery that will prove a solid and robust stream of income for good causes.  Is that not a win-win for the State?</p></speech>

This money does not go to good causes at all; it goes to the Exchequer for Government decision as to how it is spent.  The fact we cannot put down an amendment to direct that it goes to a good cause because it would be a charge on the Exchequer proves the point that I have been making time and again in this debate, namely, no good causes are actually ring-fenced.  It is all to do with a decision of the Government as to how it spends money out of the Exchequer, because the money that is supposedly for good causes goes from the lottery to the Exchequer and will continue to go the same route.  This is specifically provided for in section 44, which refers to moneys being paid into the Central Fund and the Government then making a decision.  Therefore, Senator Reilly cannot table her amendment.  It gives the lie to the whole notion of good causes, because if the money was ring-fenced for good causes the Opposition could certainly table an amendment.  I have tried to highlight this issue time and again but it never seems to get traction.</p></speech>

Good causes could never be provided for.  The money from the lottery that was supposed to go to good causes goes straight into the Exchequer, or Central Fund, and can be spent by the Government under any of the headings.  As I understand it, applying moneys under heading (d), health and the community, would not stop the Government from using good causes money to plug a deficit in the Department of Health.  I am not sure there is any particular requirement that the money must not become capital expenditure, although the Minister could disabuse me of that notion.  As I understand it, this money might even make up a shortfall in wages in the Department.  The heading on the natural environment was inserted into the legislation for very good reasons.  However, as I understand it, there will be nothing whatsoever to prevent the Government or the Minister, Deputy Hogan, from paying for a sewerage scheme out of good causes money, as it is an aspect of the natural environment.</p></speech>

Officially, there should be some record, at some point after everyone makes their local announcements, to show where the money is spent.  If it is just being spent on sewerage or health facilities that should really be paid for out of general taxation, while that may be for the good of the community, it is not what people would imagine when talking about good causes.  They would have assumed it meant, for example, a specific cancer nurse providing a specific service funded by the national lottery, but I do not believe that is the way it operates in practice.

The Government then "shall", not might, apply that money for particular purposes, and the purposes are then listed in the Bill - for example, sport, national culture, the arts or health.  I added "natural environment" at the request of Members of the other House, where a coherent case was made for that.</p><p>The system is transparent in that every year there is reporting of what the national lottery moneys are spent on and one can put down a question to any Minister about what lottery money is applied to in his or her Department.  It is not applied to staff in the Department of Health, needless to say.  With regard to the natural environment, I would envisage the funding of pathways, walks and so on.  With regard to sport and recreation, we all know the fantastic investment in sports facilities as well as in the arts throughout the country.  It is a fairly transparent process.  One can ask at the end of every year how the money is distributed and it is certainly not siphoned off to any other purpose because under the law it &quot;shall&quot; be applied for one of the purposes that are listed in the Schedule.</p></speech>

Could it be applied for some reason?  I suppose there is no prohibition on it, if there were some crisis in health funding for the elderly, for example, where we might all agree this is what should be done, particularly given that we have lived through a crisis period.  There are rational decisions that can be made at the time.  However, if it is not one of the items listed here, we would have to change the law.  If it is one of the listed items, it needs to capture the spirit of what is intended.  There is transparent publication of where the money is going, so there would be a debate if the allocation of money was deemed to be inappropriate.</p></speech>

There has been, up to now, a bit of boundaryless meshing of where lottery moneys come in and where they go, not in a dishonest way but with a general boundarylessness.  As I said earlier, there are accusations out there, be they true or not, that certain constituencies get more than others.  While I do not mean that in an accusatory way, people have that perception.  Having worked in a part of the city that needed lottery funding very badly for 25 years and was often at the bottom of the pile, I want to know if the Minister envisages that the regulator would have a part to play in how these lottery funds were distributed, in fairness and objectivity, which might allay Senator Byrne's fears?</p></speech>

The bottom line is that at least decisions made by politicians are accountable.  One can put down parliamentary questions, call in the Minister or have a committee hearing.  Often, we set up boards that are independent, and they are so independent that they are unaccountable.  Even in terms of appointments, I find that independent appointment boards are often so independent that there is no rationale for their decisions, or one cannot get behind them.  At least with a politician, one can say "Why did you do that?" or "Why is there a preference for one over another?"  By and large, there has been a reasonably fair distribution of money.  I suppose people sometimes look for political kudos for things that are happening in the natural course anyway, and we are all guilty of that.  I believe the system is robust.

I would like to reiterate the point that one of the major concerns of taxpayers and citizens is that the level of moneys going to good causes will be maintained and this was the reason behind trying to specify an amount in legislation.  I understand the Minister has not settled on a precise formula regarding the moneys that will go to good causes.  However, will he elaborate on or give us some information regarding when he will make known the formula?  This would be of benefit to many of the people, communities, good causes and charities that have benefited from lottery funding over the years.</p><p>In respect of retailers, the proposed change in the lottery represents a fundamental shift in the lottery model.  It would be good practice to provide all of these people with certainty in as far as the Minister can.  Will he give us some detail on the formula he proposes for the future?</p></speech>

I know that, but the fact is the Irish people own the whole lottery, not just the good causes.  Therefore, it is not as if we are gifting back the good causes to ourselves.  Why is it the 30.5% is not specified in the Bill?  Is that because it will increase to 40.9% or because it will be a moveable feast?   That is the question with regard to the operator.  It needs to get its profits, which are ring-fenced.  However, if they do not happen, what happens the money for good causes or the amount of money for scratch cards or the lottery itself?  Will the cost of buying a lottery ticket go up?</p></speech>

I am anxious to maintain the income flow to good causes.  I indicated the amount for good causes would be of the order of 31% of lottery sales, because that was, more or less, last year's pay-out.  That figure is not in this legislation nor in the original legislation because it is determined in relation to the prizes and so on.  I have asked my officials to consider what would be the most robust way of ensuring that if the lotto grows, we will continue to get a good income flow for good causes.  That will be in the licence and the licence will not be subject to change.  Neither the operator nor the regulator will be in a position to alter that once it is fixed.</p></speech>

The reason I am doing that is that the variety of games offer a different prize fund.  Despite what we might think, most people play the lotto to win a prize, not to support good causes.  However, there is a comfort in being able to say one's money is going to a good cause and that is important.</p></speech>

The main point in playing is the chance of winning something.  As the lottery has changed, the different games have developed a different prize structure.  Some offer prizes in excess of 50% of the take, up to 55% in some of the games.  Therefore, rather than have a fixed 30% of all going to good causes, I have suggested a fixed percentage of an overarching amount of sales, less prizes.  That is what I am working on currently.  The advice I have received is that this is the way all the modern lotteries are structured and that this will maximise the take for the good causes, particularly as the lotto grows and different games are advanced and approved by the regulator.  I will write that into the licence and it will not be subject to change thereafter.</p></speech>

The Minister will recall that seven or eight months ago when we were speaking on Senator O'Donnell's motion on the lottery, I spoke about the retailers of Ireland.  We must remember that the lottery was born in our little post offices, in small and rural retailers and in our corner shops.  Thank God, many of those businesses still exist.

This money does not go to good causes at all; it goes to the Exchequer for Government decision as to how it is spent.  The fact we cannot put down an amendment to direct that it goes to a good cause because it would be a charge on the Exchequer proves the point that I have been making time and again in this debate, namely, no good causes are actually ring-fenced.  It is all to do with a decision of the Government as to how it spends money out of the Exchequer, because the money that is supposedly for good causes goes from the lottery to the Exchequer and will continue to go the same route.  This is specifically provided for in section 44, which refers to moneys being paid into the Central Fund and the Government then making a decision.  Therefore, Senator Reilly cannot table her amendment.  It gives the lie to the whole notion of good causes, because if the money was ring-fenced for good causes the Opposition could certainly table an amendment.  I have tried to highlight this issue time and again but it never seems to get traction.</p></speech>

Good causes could never be provided for.  The money from the lottery that was supposed to go to good causes goes straight into the Exchequer, or Central Fund, and can be spent by the Government under any of the headings.  As I understand it, applying moneys under heading (d), health and the community, would not stop the Government from using good causes money to plug a deficit in the Department of Health.  I am not sure there is any particular requirement that the money must not become capital expenditure, although the Minister could disabuse me of that notion.  As I understand it, this money might even make up a shortfall in wages in the Department.  The heading on the natural environment was inserted into the legislation for very good reasons.  However, as I understand it, there will be nothing whatsoever to prevent the Government or the Minister, Deputy Hogan, from paying for a sewerage scheme out of good causes money, as it is an aspect of the natural environment.</p></speech>

This has always been the case and the Government from time to time decides it will spend the money on what one would imagine are good causes, such as a specific grant scheme for sports or buses for the elderly or the disabled through the Department of Health.  If he wants, the Minister can tell me I am totally wrong, but I do not believe I am too far wrong.</p><p>  One way to open the whole system up would be to provide that every decision to grant money for good causes be published in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>, which I understand is not currently the case.  I am not trying to take the political glory away from Government Deputies, as it is part of the scene that they can make these announcements when in government, and that is fine.</p></speech>

Officially, there should be some record, at some point after everyone makes their local announcements, to show where the money is spent.  If it is just being spent on sewerage or health facilities that should really be paid for out of general taxation, while that may be for the good of the community, it is not what people would imagine when talking about good causes.  They would have assumed it meant, for example, a specific cancer nurse providing a specific service funded by the national lottery, but I do not believe that is the way it operates in practice.  I invite the Minister to enlighten me and tell me I am wrong.  If he does, I will withdraw what I said.</p></speech>

The Government then "shall", not might, apply that money for particular purposes, and the purposes are then listed in the Bill - for example, sport, national culture, the arts or health.  I added "natural environment" at the request of Members of the other House, where a coherent case was made for that.</p><p>The system is transparent in that every year there is reporting of what the national lottery moneys are spent on and one can put down a question to any Minister about what lottery money is applied to in his or her Department.  It is not applied to staff in the Department of Health, needless to say.  With regard to the natural environment, I would envisage the funding of pathways, walks and so on.  With regard to sport and recreation, we all know the fantastic investment in sports facilities as well as in the arts throughout the country.  It is a fairly transparent process.  One can ask at the end of every year how the money is distributed and it is certainly not siphoned off to any other purpose because under the law it &quot;shall&quot; be applied for one of the purposes that are listed in the Schedule.</p></speech>

Could it be applied for some reason?  I suppose there is no prohibition on it, if there were some crisis in health funding for the elderly, for example, where we might all agree this is what should be done, particularly given that we have lived through a crisis period.  There are rational decisions that can be made at the time.  However, if it is not one of the items listed here, we would have to change the law.  If it is one of the listed items, it needs to capture the spirit of what is intended.  There is transparent publication of where the money is going, so there would be a debate if the allocation of money was deemed to be inappropriate.</p></speech>

There has been, up to now, a bit of boundaryless meshing of where lottery moneys come in and where they go, not in a dishonest way but with a general boundarylessness.  As I said earlier, there are accusations out there, be they true or not, that certain constituencies get more than others.  While I do not mean that in an accusatory way, people have that perception.  Having worked in a part of the city that needed lottery funding very badly for 25 years and was often at the bottom of the pile, I want to know if the Minister envisages that the regulator would have a part to play in how these lottery funds were distributed, in fairness and objectivity, which might allay Senator Byrne's fears?</p></speech>

The bottom line is that at least decisions made by politicians are accountable.  One can put down parliamentary questions, call in the Minister or have a committee hearing.  Often, we set up boards that are independent, and they are so independent that they are unaccountable.  Even in terms of appointments, I find that independent appointment boards are often so independent that there is no rationale for their decisions, or one cannot get behind them.  At least with a politician, one can say "Why did you do that?" or "Why is there a preference for one over another?"  By and large, there has been a reasonably fair distribution of money.  I suppose people sometimes look for political kudos for things that are happening in the natural course anyway, and we are all guilty of that.  I believe the system is robust.  To answer the question directly, no, I would not give the regulator any role in determining where the money is going.  Let us keep that to ourselves in a democratic assembly.</p></speech>

There have been some examples of shops that have not been able to get permission to sell lottery tickets.  Any time I have made a representation on their behalf, the response has been less than satisfactory, to say the least.</p><p>I always thought that this type of protectionism was holding back the lottery and I hope that when the licence goes out this will change and that any able shop will be able to sell lottery tickets in a normal, competitive environment.  There have been allegations of favouritism and protectionism.  They were never really brought to the surface but were certainly made to me by individual shopkeepers.  I hope this area is opened up because how on earth one gets permission to sell lottery tickets as an authorised seller appears to be a mystery.  It is quite lucrative and should not be done in the way it used to be done years ago where certain shops were the only ones allowed to sell newspapers and other shops were not newsagents.  We are much better off now and I would like to see this area opened up.  I just wanted to put that on the record.</p></speech>

If it has an agreement with a local shop, it is often very important to the maintenance and sustainability of that shop.  The operator must make a commercial decision as to whether it needs to put one next door to it if there are enough in one area and whether we need everybody in the street to be selling them.  I think retailers would resist that.  I understand from the perspective of pure competition the argument that anybody should be able to do it.  I have an open mind on it but it will be a matter for the operator to determine how to sell the product.</p></speech>

I am looking for an update from the Government on what plans it has to upgrade development at the ports at Rosslare Europort and Waterford.  It is coincidental that today we heard a very positive announcement regarding the building of a state-of-the-art facility by Glanbia Ingredients Ireland Limited at Belview, which is around the Port of Waterford, that will create about 70 jobs directly and potentially up to 1,600 jobs in the region through increased dairy production.  Obviously, that is great news.</p><p>One of the reasons I raised this matter is the need to look at the potential of the Port of Waterford and Rosslare Europort.  I appreciate that there has been a review of ports across the State but there is a concern in Wexford and the south east that we need to move the management of Rosslare Europort away from CIE and towards a more independent port authority.  That makes sense.  There is also a sense that we need to look at how we can improve operations at the port.  Rosslare Europort is the largest roll-on, roll-off port in this State and is hugely important to the south east.  The Port of Waterford is equally important to the economy of Waterford and the south east and I would like to find out what the Government's plans are.  </p> <p>I know that proposals have been made to deepen one of the berths at Rosslare and potentially in Waterford Port, too.  Is that being considered?  Is it a possibility?  Have feasibility studies been carried out?</p><p>Does the Minister of State accept that Rosslare Europort, a roll-on roll-off port, and the Port of Waterford, a load-on load-off port, are very important to the regional economy?  They are strategic assets.  If the south east is to capitalise on its potential and create the jobs it needs, we will have to get the best from the assets we have.  There is no doubt that we need to put in place infrastructure across the region such as roads and wastewater treatment facilities.  That is important, but it is equally important to look at existing assets in the region and these two ports are key examples.  There is a sense in the region that we can get more from both.  That will require investment, a strategic vision and policy changes and, in the case of Wexford and Rosslare, it will and should mean an independent port authority to manage the ports and be involved in putting in place a strategic plan for them.  I will listen to the Minister of State's reply and thank him for coming into the Seanad.</p></speech>

This new policy aims to harness the potential of every port in Ireland, including Rosslare Europort and the Port of Waterford Company.</p><p>Our ports are vital to our economic recovery and future economic prosperity.  As an island nation, we depend on the quality and efficiency of our ports more than most of our trading partners.  Recent analysis by the Competition Authority indicates that approximately 84%, by volume, and 62%, by value, of all goods moved into or out of the State come through our ports.  Many of our major exporting sectors, for example, pharmaceuticals, chemicals and agri-foods, are heavily reliant on the commercial ports.</p><p>It was clear that the previous ports policy did not allow for the diversity within the sector.  There are 19 ports that handle commercial traffic in any given year.  There are, however, big differences between these ports and their roles and functions.  The new national ports policy, therefore, categorises them as ports of national significance, tier 1; ports of national significance, tier 2, and ports of regional significance.  National ports policy must focus on those ports which fulfil a national function.  This realignment of national policy focus will, in part, be facilitated by a transfer of control of the ports of regional significance from central to local government.  Legislation to provide for these transfers will be introduced by 2015.</p><p>Funding for port infrastructural development must be sourced by the ports.  There is no Exchequer funding available.  The Government is open to a variety of mechanisms for private sector investment in the port sector.  Additional funding opportunities may also arise through the European Investment Bank or other State or European sources.  Any such investment will only be made, however, on a commercial basis with a commercial return.</p><p>At European level, work is continuing on the new trans-European network transport regulation which will allow for some parts of the network to avail of EU funding through the Connecting Europe facility.  Both the Port of Waterford Company and Rosslare Europort are designated as forming part of the &quot;comprehensive&quot; network and will, therefore, have the opportunity to apply for such funding, if required, in the future.  National ports policy categorises Rosslare Europort and the Port of Waterford Company as ports of national significance, tier 2.  These are ports that are responsible for at least 2.5% of overall tonnage through Irish ports, have the clear, demonstrable potential to handle higher volumes of unitised traffic, and have the existing transport links to serve a wider, national marketplace beyond their immediate region.  Between them, these two ports handle approximately 8% of total tonnage handled in the State and enjoy good road and rail connectivity.  Both offer services in the higher value unitised sectors, lift-on lift-off in Waterford and roll-on roll-off in Rosslare, that support competitive conditions within these sectors by providing an alternative to the two larger unitised ports of Dublin and Cork.  It is, of course, the case that both Rosslare and Waterford Port face differing challenges.  </p><p>Rosslare Europort is unique within the commercial port sector as it operates as a division of larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann rather than as a stand-alone commercial port company.  This is due to its unusual legislative background and the port is technically part of the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbour Company.  Several studies have highlighted the potentially inhibiting factor of the port's unusual legislative and operational status, when compared to the other State-owned ports, and recommended its integration within the State commercial port governance framework.  In January this year Indecon economic consultants were commissioned to examine the port's current commercial and operational efficiency and consider whether the port was maximising its potential.  It is expected that the report will be completed and presented to the Minister in the summer.  Without wishing to prejudice its conclusions, the Minister is committed to acting to ensure the port's potential is achieved in line with its designation as a port of national significance, tier 2.</p><p>The Port of Waterford Company has, unfortunately, witnessed a significant fall-off in trade in the past decade.  This is particularly severe in the case of its share of the lift-on lift-off market which fell from almost 20% in 2001 to 5% in 2012.  In real terms, the drop in total tonnage handled in the Port of Waterford across all modes and by lo-lo is even starker, falling by 30% and 29%, respectively, between 2001 and 2011.  These declines led to the company last year commissioning an external review of its business.  That review contained a number of important recommendations designed to address and reverse the company's current situation.  The board of directors has accepted these recommendations and is working towards their implementation, notwithstanding the challenges involved.  The implementation of these recommendations is crucial to the future of the Port of Waterford.  Like Rosslare, the port is significant in the context of a national ports policy and the Government is committed to ensuring it achieves its potential.  </p><p>Rosslare Europort and Waterford Port will continue to play an important role in the economic development of the State.  Obviously, they face challenges, but both have significant potential and the Government is committed to ensuring they enjoy a vibrant future.</p></speech>

The figure he quoted for the fall in the Port of Waterford's share of the lift-on lift-off market from 20% in 2001 to 5% in 2012 is very stark.  It is a remarkable drop.  There have been independent and in-house reviews of the port which will make recommendations.  There will be a need for the Government to support development at the ports at Waterford and Rosslare.  Crucially, the Government has a leading role to play in examining the strategic land banks and sites around the ports such as the Belview site in Waterford.  It has a responsibility to be part of the solution.  We heard a good announcement today about Glanbia.  That is part of it.  There is the possibility, too, of the sugar beet industry being revived and the development of a bio-refinery plant.  The Belview site would be a good location and offer new opportunities for the port because these are export-led industries.  If we maximise the potential of the surrounding sites in and around the port, that will give it a lift and help to increase its share in the load-on load-off market.  I reinforce that point.  I understand there are limitations to what the Government can do directly with the port, but it has responsibility for the land banks and strategic sites around it.</p></speech>

There are difficult challenges facing both ports and one can see from the statistics and the drop in goods coming in and out of the port that it has problems, which is why it commissioned its own report.  The Government has commissioned its report.  The Senator is correct that today's news is very good for the south east and I am delighted with it.  He is also correct in saying this affords an opportunity to the ports.  While he has not yet received the report, the Minister is committed to these two ports.  It is important that the port companies consider ways and means to look for business, particularly following the announcement of the new jobs.  The current situation cannot continue.</p> <p>People must be realistic.  If one loses that type of business and if that is the type of tonnage operating in the port, it just cannot exist.  It requires the company, Government, community and business support of the region.  Today's announcement is great.  With regard to funding, there is EU funding and I hope some of that can be drawn down.</p><p>Wearing my other hat, Rosslare and Waterford, but particularly Rosslare, are important to our tourism infrastructure.  We need that port very badly.  Tourism is also very important for that region.  For that reason I hope that when this report is produced something can be done for these ports through everybody working together.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-04-30a.542" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1161" speakername="John Kelly" time="20:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013043000050#YY00500"><p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.  I am seeking a moratorium on future wind farm developments.  I have three reasons for doing so, which I will explain presently.  Senator John Whelan and I have been beating the drum about wind farm developments for the last 14 months.  What we are seeking to achieve is the right of people to live in peace and tranquillity within their community, without having to live beside and with the effects of wind turbines.  That is why I introduced a Private Members' Bill in February 2012, which passed through this House with flying colours but did not get support elsewhere.</p><p>  The first reason for seeking a moratorium is that the decision of the European Court of Justice strongly indicates that the State may be liable for the adverse effects of wind farms which were granted planning permission between 1999 and 2012.  This is because the State failed to implement Article 3 of the 1985 environmental impact assessment, EIA, directive, which was to apply to wind farms from 1999.  The EIA directive was agreed by all EU member states, including Ireland, and provided that any project within the EU that has an impact on the environment would be consistently subject to an independent environmental impact assessment by the competent planning authority.  The competent planning authority must not only describe but also investigate and analyse the direct and indirect effects of the project on the following specified factors: human beings, fauna, flora, soil, water, air, climate, landscape, material assets and cultural heritage.  Sadly, there has been no regard to people's human rights, the landscape or, indeed, people's material assets.  Apart from the obligation on developers to produce an environmental impact statement, EIS, there is also a legal obligation on local authorities to carry out an independent environmental impact assessment.  Planners within local authorities were doing that themselves, and this was deemed to be illegal.</p><p>  The second reason for seeking a moratorium is the decision by the European Court of Justice on 14 March 2012, in the Leth<i> v</i>. Austria case, that failure to implement Article 3 of the EIA directive can lead to state liability in the case of property devaluation.  I got a consultant to examine this and he has estimated that we could already be liable to compensation of approximately &euro;1 billion for developments that have been granted planning permission but which are not compliant with the EU directive.  Who will pay that bill?</p><p>  The third reason is that we are currently reviewing the guidelines pertaining to wind farm developments.  There is an acceptance that the guidelines are out of date because they are based on 1980 material.  Heels are being dragged on reviewing the guidelines and for that reason I ask the Minister to implement a moratorium.  In addition, given that all of these developments have been non-compliant, it is important that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources write to all the developers who got planning permission and ask them if they can now comply with the EU directive.  If they say they cannot, and they clearly cannot, it is incumbent on the Minister to withdraw the refit energy feed-in tariff, REFIT, funding that is in his gift under EU and environmental law.</p><p>  With regard to the spin surrounding all these proposed wind farm developments throughout the country and particularly in the midlands, four or five months ago there was an announcement that 66,000 jobs would be created.  Two weeks ago that was refined in <i>The Irish Times</i> to 2,000 jobs and tomorrow's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> will probably report that hundreds of jobs will be created in this project.  It is spin all the way when it comes to the wind energy sector.  I believe we are being sold a pup and people throughout the country are beginning to wise up to that.  There will be a serious revolt against these plans.  Unless we take the landscape and the lives of people into consideration and respect both, there will be a problem.  This requires the wind energy sector to conduct its business in a far more transparent way.  We also have a duty to the taxpayer, and we certainly do not need another Army deafness case.  That is coming down the track unless we deal with this in the right way.</p></speech>

I am aware that he has a keen interest in this area.</p><p>The wind energy development guidelines of June 2006 provide advice to planning authorities on catering for wind energy through the development plan process.  The guidelines are also intended to ensure consistency of approach throughout the country in the identification of suitable locations for wind energy development and the treatment of planning applications for such developments.  To ensure that Ireland continues to meet its renewable energy targets and, at the same time, that wind energy does not have negative impacts on local communities, my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and other stakeholders, is undertaking a targeted review of certain aspects of the wind energy guidelines of 2006.  This focused review will examine the manner in which the guidelines address key issues of community concern such as noise and proximity.</p><p>All statutory planning guidelines issue first in draft form for a public consultation over a period of a couple of months.  Once the consultation period is closed the submissions received on the draft guidelines are considered and taken into account in the final form of the guidelines.  The draft guidelines will, like all other new or revised guidelines, be subject to extensive public consultation for a period of six weeks to two months.  The indicative timetable for the publication of the draft guidelines is quarter three or quarter four of 2013.</p><p>Planning is a dynamic policy area and there are over 25 sets of ministerial policy guidance in place at present, including the guidance on wind energy developments.  At any given time my Department is therefore likely either to be in the process of updating existing guidance or developing new guidance.  Typically, there is a lead-in period of several months between publication of draft guidance for public consultation and the publication of final guidance taking account of the submissions received.  Examples of recent such processes include updated statutory guidance on retail planning in April 2012, development contributions in January 2013 and guidance on carrying out environmental impact assessment in March 2013.  The imposition of a moratorium on retail development, the levying of development contributions or development requiring environmental impact assessment pending publication of the final guidance would clearly have been inappropriate.  Therefore, I do not believe it either appropriate or necessary to impose a moratorium on planning applications for wind energy development at this time.</p></speech>

We must wait to see what comes from that.  I realise there are targets for green energy and so forth, but we have done this from 1999 to November 2012 in defiance of EU directives.  That is the problem.  We are clearly leaving ourselves open to be sued.  The developer, the local authority and the Government will be sued.  I have already been told that house prices will be devalued by between 20% and 50%.  There are a couple of ways to deal with this.  First, county councils can decide to revoke planning permission.  That is within their gift.  Second, the Minister must withdraw REFIT funding where EU directives have been breached.  It is important that he be informed of that.  At least I have put this on the record of the House.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State, Deputy McGinley, for coming in to take this matter.  I will be as brief as I can.  Labour Court Recommendation 19550 relates to approximately 4,100 home care workers who worked in non-profit making organisations, the majority of which were funded by the HSE in the home help sector.  The Labour Court recommendation stated: "Having considered the submissions put to it on this case, the Court is of the view that the best way to deal with the matter is by way of a Gratuity Scheme based on 4.5 weeks' pay per year of service."  This relates to the fact that previous Labour Court recommendations had effectively bestowed upon workers in the sector the same rights as direct employees of the HSE.  There are other recommendations with regard to sick pay which have not been dealt with yet either but I am dealing with this issue specifically.  It relates to approximately 4,000 workers represented by SIPTU an approximately 80 others represented by IMPACT.</p><p>I wrote directly to the Minister for Health and the parliamentary affairs division of the HSE.  This issue is relevant to several agencies, including Fingal Home Care, which I am representing, and workers in that sector who worked between 2000 and 2008.  The reply from the HSE stated that a number of agencies submitted the requested data to the HSE and that the information was subjected to meetings both internally and with colleagues in the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Unfortunately, the HSE indicated that is was not in a position to fund the significant costs which arose nor was any additional funding made available for it to do so.  That position was advised to both staff representatives and agencies in 2012.  The HSE concluded by stating that due to current financial constraints the position remains.</p><p>I have a small degree of sympathy for that case but the fact remains that there are several thousand workers who have made contributions and who are entitled to average payments of between &euro;12,000 and &euro;15,000 for up to eight years of service within the sector.  They are entitled to these payments and two Labour Court recommendations have reaffirmed as much.  Most of these workers have retired from the sector but they had relatively low-paid jobs, earning anything between &euro;9 and &euro;11 per hour, and therefore the average payment of approximately &euro;12,000 is significant to them.  It is within the gift of the Department of Health and the Minister to affirm the recommendation and to pay the moneys.  The moneys are due to these workers and they are entitled to them for the period 2000 to 2008.</p><p>I have taken up the case of and met approximately 90 workers in my area of Fingal, Dublin, but this is relevant throughout the country.  It is not only relevant to Fingal but I am starting on that premise.</p><p>The payment is not significant in the context of the overall health budget.  The money is owed to these workers who have worked at the front line of the health services.  All of us fully recognise the great work that home help workers carry out and the value of that work.  If we recognise the value of the work they do, surely they are entitled to the gratuity payment that has been affirmed by the Labour Court.  I am keen to hear the response of the Minister of State and I thank him again for coming in to take this matter.</p></speech>

Home help and home care are delivered by the HSE, voluntary, not-for-profit and private service providers.  These non-statutory organisations are funded by the HSE under section 39 of the Health Act 2004, which provides that the executive may assist a body that provides a service similar or ancillary to those which the executive may provide.  The pay and superannuation terms and conditions of the staff of such providers are not subject to the control of the Department of Health and, as such, these staff are not classified as public servants.</p><p>Access for home helps in voluntary organisations to a pension scheme similar to that provided for home helps in the employment of the HSE has been the subject of several Labour Court recommendations involving SIPTU, IMPACT and the HSE.  Pension access for home helps directly employed by the HSE was addressed by the Department in 2005.  Access to the scheme is strictly limited to staff employed directly by the HSE.  It is not available to home helps employed by voluntary agencies because they are not public servants.  In June 2009, following a hearing of union claims for access to a pension scheme for staff of voluntary home help providers, the Labour Court recommended that this issue should be dealt with by way of a gratuity scheme based on four and a half weeks' pay per year of service and that the scheme should take effect from the date of the home helps' collective agreement of August 2000.</p><p>Given the serious budgetary constraints under which the HSE has been operating in the period since the recommendation was made, the executive has not been in a position to provide the necessary funding to the employers concerned.  This position was advised to the staff representatives and the agencies in February 2012.  At present it is not possible, given the Government's financial requirement that health service funding should be focused to the greatest possible extent on maintaining front-line services, to indicate a point at which it may be possible to re-examine the issue.</p></speech>

I am disappointed with the response.  I appreciate why the Minister for Health cannot be here this evening.  I call on the Minister of State to bring this back to the Minister for Health.  It has been outlined clearly that the Government is not even arguing that these workers are not entitled to these payments.  I have written to the Minister for Health to try to quantify what the cost would be to the Department of Health.</p><p>I will continue to pursue the matter and this is simply the beginning.  These workers are entitled to this money.  It is difficult because I cannot explain to them, nor should I have to, why we are not paying them although it has been affirmed independently that they are entitled to these payments, which average approximately &euro;12,000.  I call on the Minister of State to bring this back to the Minister for Health.  I have written to him to quantify the matter and I will continue to raise it.  We will look at other legal venues available to the workers to ensure they get the money they are due.</p></speech>
