    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-03-30a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1389" speakername="Paul Gavan" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017033000002#A00600"><p>The Minister of State is very welcome.  I wish to raise the issue of health services in County Clare, with specific reference to the drastic curtailment of the Shannondoc service.  As no doubt she is aware, Shannondoc is an urgent out-of-hours GP co-operative that was established in 2002.  Its main purpose was to provide an urgent out-of-hours GP service to the people of the County Clare area.  On November 14 of last year, despite protests from the local community, the service was massively scaled back in the county.  Both Shannondoc centres at Kilrush and Ennistymon have relocated to Milltown Malbay on weekdays from 6 p.m. to 8 a.m. and on weekends the service is operational until 7 p.m.  As Kilrush has such a large catchment, Shannondoc decided that it would introduce a nurse service on weekday evenings for an additional two hours to enable remote video consultations to soften the blow of taking the doctor away fully.</p> <p>According to the HSE, which funds Shannondoc to the tune of nearly &euro;5 million each year, the reason for the scaling back of the service is not related to funding.  According to Shannondoc, the reduction in service is as a result of the inability to attract doctors to work in rural areas combined with a lack of available locums.  Changes in immigration law in 2015 have also been cited as making it unattractive for locums.  The long-standing failure to complete negotiations for a new GP contract has also been cited.</p> <p>With the withdrawal of the Killaloe service, patients in east Clare now face the prospect of travelling to Nenagh, Limerick or Ennis to be seen by a GP after 6 p.m.  We are informed that neither the Minister nor the HSE can determine or make changes to the decision of individual practitioners.  The HSE promised to keep the situation under review every three months for the next 12 months.  I ask the Minister of State to give me the details of that review in her reply.  I would be interested to hear how the review got on and what were the results.  A HSE spokesperson has been quoted as saying that the HSE might consider a rethink of the situation if there were "significant or adverse consequences to these changes".   I wish to repeat that: If there are significant or adverse consequences to these changes, the HSE may consider a rethink of the situation.</p> <p>What does that mean?  Does it mean that it might reconsider the situation if a few people die?  If so, how many deaths are required?  This is a publicly funded service and families rely on it.  What will the Minister do?  Are the Minister and the Minister of State telling the people of County Clare that they do not deserve the same level of out-of-hours GP services as the rest of the country?  Are people in rural parts of Ireland now expected to be treated as second-class citizens?  I remind the House that, in the context of County Clare, the hospital in Ennis has been downgraded.  Fianna F&aacute;il took care of that.  It only runs a 12-hour accident and emergency unit.  There are no maternity services in County Clare.  People living in remote parts of the county cannot get sick after 6 p.m. because the nearest doctor is stationed an hour's drive away.  That is the same length of time it would take them to drive to the hospitals in Limerick or Galway, which happen to be the two hospitals worst hit by over-crowding.</p> <p>I want answers with regard to the review, the action her Department is taking to address the situation, the GP contract negotiations and the visas issues that have been raised previously with the Minister.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-03-30a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1307" speakername="Catherine Byrne" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017033000002#B00100"><p>On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Harris, I thank the Senator for raising this issue.</p> <p>At the outset, I would like to assure the House that the Government is committed to enhancing primary health care services, including GP services, throughout the country.  The development of primary care is central to the Government's objective to deliver a high quality, integrated and cost-effective health service.</p> <p>GPs contracted under the General Medical Services scheme must make suitable arrangements to enable contact to be made with them, a locum or a deputy for emergencies outside normal practice hours.  While there is no obligation on GPs to participate in GP out-of-hours co-operatives as a means of meeting the contractual requirement, such services have been developed and expanded over time and are now an essential part of the primary care services.  This helps to ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, urgent care needs are met in the primary care setting.</p> <p>As the Senator will be aware, in the mid-west region out-of-hours arrangements are discharged through Shannondoc, a not-for-profit GP co-operative owned and managed by a group of individual GPs across Limerick, Clare and north Tipperary, which is funded by the HSE.  The HSE has signed a service arrangement with Shannondoc for 2017.  Last year, Shannondoc announced that, due to a difficulty in attracting GPs, in particular, locum cover, it was no longer able to maintain its existing service across all its centres.  Following discussions with Shannondoc, in order to ensure the sustainability of the service, the HSE accepted a proposal from the co-operative to changes in the provision of the service.  The HSE's funding model to Shannondoc has not been altered and the changes to service provision decided on were not influenced by the availability of funding from the HSE.  The most significant changes relate to part of east and west Clare, essentially affecting Ennistymon, Kilrush, and Killaloe, with minor changes in terms of operating hours in two locations in north Tipperary.</p> <p>The changes made to the Shannondoc out-of-hours services are subject to a three-monthly review and their impact is being closely monitored and evaluated by the HSE.  There have been no further changes in the provision of Shannondoc services to date.  The Government is committed to ensuring that patients throughout the country continue to have access to GP services, especially in remote rural areas and also in disadvantaged urban areas, and that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future.  It is imperative that existing GP services in these areas are retained and that general practice remains an attractive career option.</p> <p>As part of ongoing attempts to provide additional supports to GP services, and to ensure the future provision of these services in all areas, the programme for partnership Government commits to increasing the number of GP training places to 259 places annually.  In July 2016, the GP training intake increased from 157 to 172 places and the HSE's 2017 National Service Plan envisages a further increase, to 187 places this year.</p> <p>The Minister, Deputy Harris, is anxious to achieve further increases in future years in order to ensure that the future manpower needs of general practice can be met.  Further efforts undertaken in recent years to increase the number of practising GPs include changes to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to accommodate more flexible-shared GMS-GP contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme.  An enhanced supports package for rural GPs was also introduced last year.</p> <p>The Minister has also emphasised the need for a new GP services contract which will help modernise our health service and develop a strengthened primary care sector, and health service management have already progressed a number of significant measures through engagement with GP representatives.  The GP contracts review process will, among other things, seek to introduce further measures aimed at making general practice a fulfilling and rewarding career option in the future.</p></speech>

I asked for detail of the three-month review that should have taken place by now and the Minister of State has given me no detail.  I asked her to comment on any steps in relation to the visa restrictions issue for locums and she has not given me an answer in regard to that.  I asked what steps the Department is taking to attract GPs to rural Ireland and the Minister of State has given me no answer on that.  I asked what did the HSE mean by "significant or adverse consequences to these changes" and the Minister of State has ignored that as well.</p> <p>I will put this in context for the people of County Clare.  We hear a lot of guff from the Government in regard to protecting and enhancing rural areas.  In reality, the Government is shutting down bus services.  It is shutting down health care services.  It is shutting down post offices.  The Government is killing rural areas.  The people of County Clare want to know why are they being treated as second-class citizens when it comes to their health service.</p></speech>

There is a clear answer.  The Minister has outlined and explained about the GP services.  The Senator made it clear in his opening statement that there is a need for GPs in rural areas.  Unfortunately, for whatever reason, GPs are not attracted to rural areas in some cases.  The Government cannot force GPs to go into rural areas to become part of a practice.</p></speech>

That is something we all welcome.  I will get the Minister's office to come back to the Senator on the review for the past three months and what the accomplishments have been.</p> <p>It is not fair to say that the people do not deserve a proper health care system.  Every citizen in this country does.</p></speech>

Do I take it that the Minister is not here?  He was in Leinster House last night.  I was in the same vicinity as he was.  He did not request me to postpone this motion.  The Minister can run, but he cannot hide, from this issue.</p> <p>The wind turbines in my area will destroy our locality and it is up to the Minister to bring in guidelines.  It is three years since this matter was at issue.  I ask that these turbines would be at a distance equal to ten times the height of the turbine.  The height of one of these wind turbines is 130 m and it should be roughly 1,500 m from any house within that vicinity.</p> <p>The Minister attended a public meeting.  He knows the issue involved.  In protest, I will be re-entering this matter.  I will pursue this continuously until the Minister, Deputy Naughten, is prepared to stand up to his responsibilities, both as a Minister and as a Deputy for the constituency of Roscommon-Galway.  I will not allow the Minister to destroy our area.  He has in his power the right to bring forward the new guidelines and those guidelines are being held up by him.  I hold the Minister personally responsible for this issue.</p> <p>In this issue, I am walking out in protest of the slight and continuous insult on this House.  I have received no explanation from the Minister, Deputy Naughten, who was in the House last night, and I was in the House last night.</p></speech>

It was actually changed by agreement between the Minister, Deputy Naughten, and the Minister, Deputy Coveney's, Department.  The Commencement matter states, "The need for the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government" to attend.

I thank him for coming in.  I am sorry the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality is not able to be here to take this question.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->He might pass on the fact that I wished to commend her on the penal reform programme generally and, in particular, the announcement this week that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, will be introducing an order that finally ends the detention of young offenders in adult prisons, which is welcome.</p><p>This Commencement matter is a lengthy question that relates to a specific issue, that is, the imminent closure of the training unit prison on the North Circular Road prison estate beside Mountjoy Prison.  It has been some years since I visited it, as I visit Mountjoy and D&oacute;chas more regularly, but its imminent closure has given rise to serious concerns among current prisoners, staff, the Irish Penal Reform Trust, IPRT, and the Prison Officers Association.  I have discussed this matter with Mr. Michael Donnellan, the IPRT and others, but I wish to raise directly with the Minister of State a number of concerns.  Mr. Donnellan spoke at the justice committee on 8 March on this issue, but I wish to have more details about the consequences of the closure.</p><p>I will raise three specific issues.  First, there is a concern among current prisoners that their regimes might be adversely affected by the closure.  Those in the training unit are engaged in a wide range of rehabilitation measures.  Many are on temporary or day release and are concerned about what the transfer will mean for them.  For those transferring to open centres, such as Shelton Abbey and Loughan House, key issues will arise, for example, distance from families and services and continuity of their programmes.  For those transferring to Mountjoy west, formerly St. Patrick's Institution, there is a concern around normalisation as being central to rehabilitation.  Prisoners in the training unit have communal eating facilities.  If they move to Mountjoy, will they be subject to in-cell eating and earlier lock-up times in their cells, will there be a deterioration in their family visiting conditions and will they be able to continue with their rehabilitation regimes?  The concern is that the move could amount to a regressive step for those currently serving time in the training unit, in particular those with life or other lengthy sentences who are engaged in long-term rehabilitation regimes.</p><p>Second, why is it proposed to house older prisoners together in one place once the training unit is reopened?  Mr. Donnellan stated that the unit needed to be upgraded and in-cell sanitation needed to be installed.  Once that is done, it is proposed to reopen the unit.  I understand that there are approximately 90 prisoners aged over 60 years across the prison estate.  Why must they all be kept together?</p><p>Third, will the Minister of State confirm whether the closure is in line with the overall penal policy aim of rehabilitation as articulated by the penal policy review group?  The IPRT is concerned about this matter.  The strategic review group on penal policy recommended an increase in open prison provision, particularly in Dublin.  The closure of the training unit will reduce the provision of semi-open accommodation by 96 places to under 7% of bed capacity.  This reduction is contrary to the group's report.  Mr. Donnellan stated that it would take 18 months to two years to refurbish the training unit.  There is a concern that this will be a retrograde step, in that there will be a reduction in semi-open and open prison accommodation during that period.</p><p>There is also a concern that the plan to close the training unit in the absence of the provision of alternative open or semi-open facilities amounts to an efficiency measure rather than what it should be driven by, that being, the needs of prisoners and an emphasis on rehabilitation.</p><p>While I appreciate the need to refurbish the training unit, I wish to get the Minister of State's response about addressing these concerns on record.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-03-30a.31" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1267" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017033000002#C00200"><p>At the outset, I apologise on behalf of the T&aacute;naiste, who unfortunately cannot attend.  I assure Senator Bacik that I have noted the individual concerns that she raised and I will relay them to the T&aacute;naiste.</p> <p>I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to discuss the planned repurposing of the training unit place of detention as an older prisoners unit.  The training unit is a semi-open facility based within the Mountjoy Prison campus for males aged 18 years and over.  As a semi-open prison, prisoners accommodated within the training unit are afforded more latitude in terms of out-of-cell time than prisoners with a higher security rating.  A key action of the Irish Prison Service strategic plan, specifically action No. 2.5, is to ensure that older prisoners are identified as a specific group that has particular needs within the prison population.  There are a number of such prisoners in the care of the Irish Prison Service who have significant and ongoing health care needs, many of whom are dispersed across the estate, in some cases significant distances away from the health care providers on which they rely.</p> <p>The development of a bespoke facility to cater for the needs of this specific cohort will allow the Irish Prison Service to provide a physical infrastructure that takes cognisance of the needs of older adults in terms of mobility, access and appropriate age-related services, forge strong strategic links with statutory and community services critical to effective care provision for older persons in custody, ensure that age-related mental health and related social needs are met through appropriate assessment and intervention methods, including early detection, and ensure that older adults in prison are given opportunities for participation in meaningful and purposeful activity or occupation to meet their needs, preferences and capacities.</p> <p>The House will be well aware that significant investment has been undertaken by the Government in Mountjoy Prison.  As a result, overcrowding has been eliminated and all of the wings in Mountjoy Prison have been completely refurbished, thereby facilitating the elimination of the practice of slopping out and the significant enhancement of regime activities and facilities available to prisoners.  To facilitate the refurbishment of the prison, one division of Mountjoy Prison, equating to 125 cells, has been continuously closed since 2010.  With the recent completion of the refurbishment project, however, these cells are now available for occupation.</p> <p>As a result of the developments I have outlined, an opportunity now presents itself to migrate prisoners to Mountjoy Prison from the training unit in order to repurpose the existing facility into a dedicated unit to accommodate older prisoners.  The temporary closure of the unit will not result in any reduction in the regime or sentence management arrangements currently in place for prisoners accommodated there.  Given the existing capacity within Mountjoy Prison, prisoners currently accommodated in the training unit will be transferred to an enhanced area of the prison, which will allow them to continue to avail of the level of openness of regime and provide improved, more structured activities than those currently available within the training unit.  Moreover, there will be no interference with the sentence management plans in place for prisoners, many of which are based on recommendations of the Parole Board.  Likewise, the temporary closure of the training unit will not result in the displacement from Mountjoy of staff currently serving in the unit.  Staff will be reassigned across the Mountjoy campus and the resulting surplus of staff will be redistributed across the service by way of current voluntary transfer arrangements.  The latter will have the significant added benefit of allowing the Irish Prison Service to consolidate its staffing resources and will greatly assist in addressing current staffing shortfalls, pending the training of recruit prison officers, which is scheduled to commence later this month.</p> <p>In addition, a new lifers unit has recently opened in Wheatfield Place of Detention, offering prisoners a more open prison regime.  It is the intention of Mountjoy Prison management to establish a second such unit for suitable life sentence prisoners, including those transferring from the training unit.</p></speech>

I am grateful to Mr. Donnellan, the head of the Irish Prison Service, for also communicating with me much of the information that the Minister of State just provided.  I appreciate the progress being made in refurbishing Mountjoy Prison, in particular the ending of the appalling practice of slopping out.  I am glad to hear the Minister of State confirm that there will be no reduction in the regime or sentence management arrangements that are currently in place for prisoners accommodated in the training unit.  I welcome that those being moved to Mountjoy will be transferred to an enhanced area of the prison and have the same level of openness of regime and so on.  However, I will keep this issue under review.  The IPRT is also following it.</p> <p>I would be grateful if the Minister of State could ask the T&aacute;naiste to follow up on the more specific questions that I have raised and to respond to me on same.  I will follow them up with her as well.  In particular, when will the new unit that was mentioned be established and open?  I refer to the more open prison unit for those transferring from the training unit.  Is this closure in line with the general policy of emphasising rehabilitation as a sentencing rationale?</p></speech>

I will relay them to the T&aacute;naiste and ask her to revert to the Senator.</p></speech>

I know he is aware of the skills shortage in the hospitality industry, especially chefs and front-of-house staff.  The expert group claimed that we need approximately 5,000 chefs a year in terms of training, and I understand 1,800 currently go through the system.</p> <p>My background is in the hospitality sector, and I know how important it is to have the right staff who are properly trained.  The hospitality sector is very reliant on service delivery to their customers.  Tourism numbers are up.  No matter where people go, they will want to eat and drink.</p> <p>I served on the old VEC and the LCETB for a number of years.  I visited the training centre in Limerick, which is run by the LCETB, on many occasions.  It has provided those who are long-term unemployed in the area with skills and training.  Some have gone into front-of-house, management or trainee management and others have become chefs.  I would like to see a similar system elsewhere.  I would welcome any suggestions from Minister of State regarding how he will address the situation.</p> <p>Career decisions involve long-term choices.  Culinary skills and front-of-house management in the tourism and hospitality sector offer long-term employment prospects.  We need to examine how we can encourage people to apply for the relevant courses through the CAO system or return to education for reskilling or retraining as mature students.  Education in skills is very important.  Not everyone will go into third level education or the skills sector.  I look forward to hearing the input of the Minister of State.</p></speech>

When I became Minister of State I was made aware of the difficulty we are having in the area to which she referred.</p> <p>In 2015, the expert group on future skills needs, EGSFN, carried out a study on the future skills needs of the hospitality sector.  It assessed skills demand across the sector so as to ensure provision of the right supply of skills for the sector.  The report was published in November 2015, and sets out a clear framework to provide for the skill needs of the sector in the years ahead. </p> <p>A key recommendation of the study was the need to establish a national oversight and advisory group comprising all the key hospitality stakeholders to monitor progress on the implementation of the recommendations in the report.  The hospitality skills oversight group was established last year, with membership including Government Departments and agencies, education providers, SOLAS, ETBs, HEA, the Restaurant Association of Ireland, Vintners Federation of Ireland, the Irish Hotel Federation, the Irish Hospitality Institute and the Licenced Vintners Association.  </p> <p>The group met on eight occasions.  I have asked it to publish a report as quickly as possible.  I have been told it will publish its first progress report shortly.  To date, work has been undertaken on careers promotion via a range of fora such as, for example, the launch of the tourism insight online programme which is aimed at promoting careers in tourism and hospitality, the publication of a draft new specification for junior certificate home economics and the establishment by Skillnets limited of a dedicated training network for the hospitality industry. </p> <p>Promoted by the Restaurants Association of Ireland, the network plans to design tailored programmes covering all aspects of the restaurant, food and beverage industry to SMEs nationally.  Work is progressing on the development of a new commis chef apprenticeship, planned to commence later this year, led by the Irish Hotels Federation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland which are working with Kerry Education and Training Board. </p> <p>We are working with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport on this issue.  We realise that there is a difficulty, but we have taken the right approach in bringing on board all of the shareholders and asking them to report back.  The report should be with me very shortly and I will be delighted to send a copy to Senator Byrne.  If stakeholders such as the Senator believe they can add to the report, which has not been finalised, they can do so.  We are asking stakeholders to come on board to assist us in the development of the apprenticeship model which we know is necessary.</p> <p>Some months ago I was handing out certificates at an event and it was indicated that there is a shortage of perhaps 8,000 in the sector, which is a significant number.  Once we receive the report all of the interested parties can push forward to determine how we can deal with the serious problem the Senator has addressed.</p></speech>

I do not have the relevant information, but a number of people have contacted me who would be delighted to offer him some suggestions.  I welcome that there will be an opportunity to provide input to the report.</p> <p>I would like the Minister of State to see what is happening in the centre in Limerick to which I referred.  It is something that should be rolled out across the country.  It has taken people from areas of high unemployment and provided them with a skill set.  The centre produced a very positive video.  One woman spoke about not being in a good place because she was not working, but is now permanently employed.  There have been a number of good news stories from the centre.  </p> <p>It is good that the Minister of State is addressing the issue and that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is coming on board.  That is important because both Departments have responsibility for this matter.</p></speech>

Yesterday I went outside the gates of Leinster House with some of my colleagues and met some of the decent, hard working staff in Bus &Eacute;ireann who are rightly concerned about their future employment status and the future of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  I cannot understand how the Leader's party can stand by a Government Minister who refuses to engage at any level with one of the most serious issues facing us today.  We are faced with a situation where companies and local economies are affected, where some companies are paying privately to chauffeur their staff to and from work.  This has an awful impact on Ireland as a place to do business.  Especially with the triggering of Brexit yesterday, we need to sell ourselves as a place where a company can do their its with ease and not be hampered by basics such as a faulty transport system.  We also have a situation where it has been reported that some private operators operating school runs are not being paid on time.  This will have a cash flow implication for these companies and may put these routes in jeopardy.  Having this type of impact on children's education, flowing from the Minister's inaction, is unacceptable.</p> <p>With regard to the ongoing Garda controversy, we learned this morning that the Commissioner has apologised to the Policing Authority for failing to mention the breath testing audit, despite having met the Policing Authority six times over the past year.  She also admitted that officers deliberately falsified driving statistics and she apologised in regard to the wrongful convictions.  This has led to more questions that need to be answered.</p> <p>The Commissioner also apologised for the scandals in the force over the last ten years.  This is not enough.  I call on the Minister to introduce a fast-track Patten-style reform as colleagues mentioned yesterday to immediately restore public confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to assure those honest, hard working garda&iacute; that they can have confidence in their job and in the organisation for which they work.  </p> <p>I commend Joanne O'Riordan and the 100 disability groups who are protesting outside the D&aacute;il today to acknowledge the Government's failure to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</p></speech>

There has to be ministerial involvement at this stage.  At the very least, the Minister could talk to the company and tell them to get back into the WRC and to remain there until such a time as they find a solution.  To sit on the bench and refuse to play part in this is not the way the world works.  Many Ministers down through the history of this State have used their office to force organisations to come together with their unions and solve problems and that is something that will have to be done.  Otherwise, there will be contagion of this problem and we will grind this country to a halt while we are trying to rebuild it.  That is not the way forward.</p> <p>However, I rise this morning to talk about something good.  Microfinance Ireland has provided finance for small companies throughout the country to get this country back to work.  Setting up Microfinance Ireland and empowering it to lend money to small start-ups was one of the fine things done by the last Government.  Alongside it, there are organisations such as the PorterShed in Galway which is an innovation and incubation centre.  I visited it recently with the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and it is the most exciting place in which I have been in a long time.  It is a hive of activity, where there is a complete exchange of views and ideas.  It is an incredible place to be.  </p> <p>I raise this issue because when they were first established, the education and training boards, ETBs, were to have capital funding to provide seed capital for small start-ups.  That was taken off them in the 2013 Act, which was a regressive step.  The institutes of technology and the universities are phenomenal at providing research and development and providing incubation centres.  There is an ETB in every county in Ireland and there is no reason why the ETBs could not be playing their part in the establishment of start-ups.  </p> <p>Coming from a teaching background, the Leader will know himself that there is many the young person who came out of a PLC course, as they were known, or a further education or training course, and found within himself or herself the ability to start up a small business.  Small businesses can grow to very large businesses.  The 1817 project in Chicago is an example of a small company starting off with one or two people and finished up as big as the Googles, Facebooks and Twitters of this world.  We need to put that kind of money into rural Ireland because it is unlikely that one will get any of the large companies there.  Ten small companies employing five people each is 50 jobs no matter how one looks at it.  Five jobs in a small town lifts the entire town because of the knock-on effect.  Perhaps we might get the Minister for Education and Skills in here and see can we re-establish some form of capital for ETBs to provide seed funding for small start-ups. </p></speech>

The country is weary and fed up and I think we are weary and fed up getting up day after day, fed up at perceived skullduggery at all levels of this country.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, has accelerated this.  He needs to understand, and he seems to misjudge, the anger and ire of citizens who are faced with a tsunami of corruption, cronyism and those who believe they are untouchable.  It is clear that the Minister has gone on the defensive.  As an experienced politician he should have known to never have met with individuals from Cerberus, especially on the eve of the closing date for bids for Project Eagle.  It is incredible.  What is even more incredible is the Minister's sense of omnipotence and grandiosity in his threat to injunct the Committee of Public Accounts for doing its job.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator M&aacute;ire Devine:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2468"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2468&amp;amp;pid=MaireDevine&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->He attempted to insult my colleague, Deputy Cullinane, branding him and my party fibbers.

Yesterday I spent an hour with four bus drivers who were very pessimistic.  They are very worried about the future of their company and very upset about its mismanagement over a number of years.  They spoke about the fact that senior management of the company changed recently.  They also spoke about the background of those now overseeing the company.  For all the faults of the previous management, the new management does not have the same interest in engaging with trade union leaders.  They are worried about their jobs and about the future of public service transport in this country.</p> <p>The point made to me was that it is time for the NTA to get involved.  We are at the stage where the script is written for us to come to the House and ask the Minister to do something, to come to the House or to intervene in some way.  He will not do it.  He appears to have no interest in coming to the House or any House to address the fact no Bus &Eacute;ireann buses are running at present.  This is not a one-day strike here or a two-day strike there.  It is an all-out strike.  As I stated on Tuesday, this could spread to Dublin Bus, the other CIE companies and the school bus service.  It is time for the NTA to get involved because it sets the context for public transport in this country.  It oversees the entire CIE system and private operators.  If the Minister will not do it, surely there is a role for the NTA to get involved.  This is far too serious for it to be allowed to continue as is.</p> <p>I am as guilty as anybody else in the House of personalising issues too much, but in this regard it is quite clear the Minister involved has a responsibility to those who use the service and who believe in public transport.  I live in a part of the country which is not served by Bus &Eacute;ireann with regard to day-to-day use of a bus service so I can speak with a level of independence on the issue.  A number of bus drivers were outside the gates of Leinster House yesterday and I thought security was a bit over the top.  I do not know why the barriers were put up in such an over the top manner but I will leave that where it is.</p> <p>When will the political system react to this situation?  The company will die if something does not happen.  Are we trying to starve the drivers back to work?  They will not go.  The four gentlemen I met yesterday I am quite sure reflect the entirety of the Bus &Eacute;ireann workforce.  They are not going back to work in the current situation.  This has gone beyond one-liners and personality-based politics and I plead with the Leader to make representations to the Minister, Deputy Ross, to come to the House and address the situation, and we can toss over ideas about how we can resolve this issue.  In all fairness to everybody in the House, none of us wants to oversee a situation where next we have Dublin Bus out, then the trains out and then school buses not running and we all knew it was coming.  I beg of the Leader to make representations to the Minister, Deputy Ross, in all fairness and in good faith to address the House on this issue.</p> <p>I second Senator O'Sullivan's amendment to the Order of Business.</p></speech>

This is very welcome, but it goes hand in hand with the disappointing news that Lloyds of London has decided to relocate to Brussels post-Brexit.  All of these are opportunities and difficulties which present themselves now the UK has officially triggered Article 50.</p> <p>My colleagues and I on the Seanad select committee on Brexit are going through the issues, but we also need to address a number of societal issues and we need to have Ministers come to the House to hear the thoughts of the Seanad on these issues.  The first of these should be the review of the capital programme being undertaken by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe.  I call on the Leader to bring the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, to the House to allow us have a strong debate on what strategic investment is needed throughout the country so we can offset the oncoming difficulties of Brexit and prepare our economy to capitalise where possible.</p></speech>

Since then, the trust has helped many families whose loved ones have been tragically killed abroad and helped them bring home the bodies.  It provides a vital service and I am sure all Members of the House, on behalf of the people of the country, would like to pay great tribute to Colin and Eithne for the fantastic service they provide to the citizens of the country and families who have been heartbroken by the tragic news of a sudden death abroad.</p> <p>As Members know and appreciate, it costs thousands of euro to repatriate bodies from abroad.  This expense is not covered by the Irish Government or the UK Government.  One can imagine when family members receive that devastating phone call they do not know where to turn.  Now, due to the good work of the Bell family, they have somewhere to turn.  To date, more than 200 bodies have been repatriated thanks to Colin and Eithne Bell.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Robbie Gallagher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2471"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, this work since the death of their son has all been done in the family home.

They made an application for charitable status two years ago and are still awaiting a decision.  They were also seeking a small donation of &euro;30,000 per annum to allow them to continue with their good work.  Not one penny of the donations they receive goes to any personal gain - it all goes towards the trust.  I ask the Leader to mention to the relevant Minister or Ministers that they are still awaiting a decision and to see if, somewhere in the Exchequer, &euro;30,000 can be found to help them continue their good work on behalf of all families in this country.</p></speech>

We are hearing stories of shops in towns getting lower footfalls and we have to remember that striking workers are not being paid and, every day that goes by, Bus &Eacute;ireann is haemorrhaging more money.  We need a breakthrough because there is an impasse at the moment.  I have met with a number of striking Bus &Eacute;ireann workers, including drivers at the Ballina depot where I am from and outside the D&aacute;il yesterday.  Some specific issues are within Government control.  It is contended that the free travel scheme, whereby people have free travel passes for buses, is underfunded.  For pass holders the company gets 40% less than the full fare from the Department of Social Protection but the company is required to compete with commercial service operators.  There is room for work to be done on this and I know it is being looked at.  I urge the Minister for Social Protection and the Minister for Transport to iron this out, although it will only be part of the answer to the funding shortfall.  The other issue striking workers raise is the fact that, on Expressway routes, Bus &Eacute;ireann buses are required to stop in specified towns and villages while their competitors, private bus operators, do not have to.  The way forward is to re-evaluate these routes and assess them as PSO services and the indications are that the NTA will go down this route.  They are necessary services and therefore need to be funded by the Exchequer.</p> <p>These two items will not resolve the company's woes and I would like both parties to engage.  There is a place for all stakeholders and there is a part for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, to play.  At the very least, management has serious questions to answer, including over the fact that in the first two months of this year losses were 41% higher than last year.  In addition, while workers are being asked to take a diminution in their take-home pay and their terms and conditions, there is no such proposal for management.  There needs to be fairness and equity and management needs to be held to account for the way it has run the company.  It has not gone to ground just in the past few weeks.</p></speech>

Our reputation is on the line but, ten years later, we have not ratified it.  Many people outside the front gate today want to see ratification.  We have just received the new social housing figures for people with disabilities.  In 2003, just shy of 4,000 disabled people were on the social housing waiting list but now it is just shy of 6,000, an increase of almost 46%.  There is a housing crisis for people with disabilities and it is not just a recent crisis.  There are 11,000 people under the age of 65 in nursing homes because we shaved away community supports and services, particularly in the time of the recession.  We are talking about getting people out of residential centres and we are just churning people around.  The CSO poverty statistics came out on 1 February and, thankfully, things are getting better for the general population but they are getting significantly worse for people with disabilities and their families.  The recession in the general economy ended in 2013 but it has not ended for people with disabilities or their families.</p> <p>The Leader comes from Cork so he will know the expression "face the puck out".  We need to face the challenge today.  Successive Governments have taken the view, which one could challenge, that certain legislation needs to be passed before ratification but there is nothing in the convention that says a State cannot get on with improving the life status of people with disabilities before it ratifies.  A budget is coming up in October and Ministers and people in Departments are trying to sort out what they want.  The time is here to put a decent cross-departmental disability package in place covering health, poverty, transport, housing and employment issues.  Employment is a chronic issue and there were people at the presentation yesterday morning with degrees coming out of their ears who cannot get a job.</p></speech>

I congratulate Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh and the members of the Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services on the hard work they have done on this issue.  If everything we are hearing on water charges proves to be correct, our own hard-working champion of the people, Deputy Cowen, will also deserve to be congratulated.  There is sometimes a need to stand up to the big bogeyman in Europe.  I commend the committee on the work it has done in this regard.</p><p>In light of the Enable Ireland protest on Kildare Street, which has been mentioned by Senator Dolan, today is an ideal day to mention the promised upgrade of St. Mary's school in Delvin, County Westmeath.  Local councillors, including Councillors D'Arcy, Shaw and Hill, have raised this matter <i>ad nauseam</i>over the past year, but to little avail.  I ask the Leader to raise the matter with the Ministers for Health and Education and Skills because we need a firm commitment regarding the school in question.  It has been suggested that the existing school might be upgraded or a new school might be built.  This has been in the public forum for the last while.  As far as I know, both Ministers have visited the school.  I would appreciate it if the Leader could chase up this issue.</p></speech>

It is one of many companies looking at this country because they need to move their operations.  It is not realistic to expect them all to move to Ireland, but we will certainly fight hard for each and every one of them.  I am aware that other companies are seriously considering moving here too.  Dublin Airport is connected to the whole of Europe.  There are 120 flights per week from the airport to various locations in the United States.  Some 28 million people passed through the airport last year.  Dublin Airport has already secured planning for at least four buildings, comprising approximately 450,000 sq. ft. and capable of housing 4,000 employees.</p> <p>I commend the Minister, Deputy Harris, and the Minister of State, Deputy Corcoran Kennedy, on fighting for and planning to bring the European Medicines Agency to Dublin.  As a city, Dublin offers much of what the agency needs.  Our greatest advantage from the perspective of the agency is that English is the language of medicine internationally and Ireland is an English-speaking country.  We have very strong pharmaceutical, information technology and medical devices industries.  This country's medicines agency is highly respected throughout Europe, to the point that if a device or a drug is approved here, it is accepted across Europe.  The scene is set.  Dublin Airport and the wider north Dublin area comprise an obvious place for the European Medicines Agency to be based.  The facilities are already in place.  The area has great connectivity to the city and the national motorway network.  Land is available for the construction of new houses.  Perhaps a new international school could be developed on the north side to meet the needs of people living in the area.  Believe it or not, 20% of people in Dublin are international.  Half a million Irish people are fluent in a second language.  I am making the case for what is already in place in Dublin Airport to be used to bring the European Medicines Agency to our country.  It would be an advantageous location in light of the connectivity between the north Dublin area and the UK and other parts of Europe.  It should be at the top of the list.</p></speech>

We saw the celebrations that were shared by everybody all over the communities of this island.  This year marks the centenary of 1917, which was another seminal year in the move towards Irish independence.  I ask the Leader to update us from time to time on the progress being made by the committee that has been established to deal with the centenary commemorations.  The sacrifice of 1916 would have come to naught without the continued work of patriotic men and women in 1917, many of whom were behind bars at the time.  It was a tall order to continue a revolution after most of its leaders had been executed or were serving life terms in British jails, but they managed to carry it off with great discipline and unity.  There were some outstanding stirring events in that year.  A number of by-elections were contested successfully.  The Kilkenny City by-election brought WT Cosgrave into prominence.  Perhaps most famously, the East Clare by-election was won by &Eacute;amon de Valera on a clearly republican programme.  This was followed by his election as president of Sinn F&eacute;in and of the Irish Volunteers.  In the same year, the prisoners received a tumultuous welcome in Westland Row.  Sadly, 1917 also marked the terrible death under awful circumstances of my fellow Kerry man, Thomas Ashe.  I know the Government will want to honour these events in a fitting way.  I ask the Leader to give us an update on the Government's plans.  Perhaps the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, will come to the House at some stage to talk about these matters.</p></speech>

It is the second development in a very small area.  When this project has been completed, over 5,000 people will be working in the city.  This shows the confidence the developers have in growth levels in Cork.  It is possible that EU agencies currently based in the UK might come to Ireland.  I suggest that the focus should not necessarily be on Dublin.  Everything possible must be done to bring any EU agency that is currently located in England to Ireland.  Locations outside Dublin must be considered in that context.  Cork is getting ready to face up to and meet the challenge presented by any new agency.  We need to focus on locations outside Dublin.</p> <p>I spoke earlier this week about the availability of respite care in respect of people with disabilities over the age of 18.  I recently met a parent who told me that the respite care which was available to them when their son was under the age of 18 is no longer available now that he has reached that age.  Long-term planning is needed in the disability sector.  A significant number of people with disabilities are being cared for by parents who are ageing.  In many cases, other family members will not be available to provide care and assistance after the parents have passed away.   Many parents are worried about the long-term care of their sons and daughters.  We need to have a debate in here on this matter.  I am calling for such a debate because we need to start planning for this whole area.  We need to put a comprehensive plan in place.  We need to assess what kinds of numbers we are talking about.  At this stage, we do not seem to know where we will be going over the next ten years.</p></speech>
