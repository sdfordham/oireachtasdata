The EU has a less than laudable record when it comes to dealing with conflict on and near its borders.  We hope that democracy and diplomacy will prevail on this occasion.</p><p>I welcome the debate today on job creation, but I would like it to be linked to the issue of emigration.  We know that of the 89,000 people who emigrated last year, many were in employment.  Some of them left jobs for which they were over-qualified or their qualifications were not suitable.  These people have gone to other countries to use their education.  When we hear about the creation of 61,000 jobs per year, we should bear in mind that those jobs are being created because people are emigrating.  When the Government refers to the target of full employment by 2020, is it taking into account the more than 300,000 people who have emigrated in the past five years?</p><p>As a member of the first party to propose the appointment of a Minister for the Irish overseas and the diaspora, I commend the Taoiseach on sending Ministers around the world for St. Patrick's Day.</p> <p>One will not hear the Fianna F&aacute;il Party complain about the practice, although the media appear to take great enjoyment in pointing out that Ministers are heading all over the world for St. Patrick's Day.  As I have stated previously, any country would be proud and privileged that its leaders have an opportunity to meet other Heads of State and Government and make a case for job creation, immigration rights and visa access.  With this in mind, I ask the Leader to ensure the Taoiseach raises the issues of the undocumented and immigration reform in the United States while on Capitol Hill.  Last year, when his speech was released to the Irish media it referred to the need to address immigration reform.  However, the transcripts of his meeting showed that the issue was not raised. </p><p>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business in respect of Nos. 7 and 8.  One quarter of the 28,000 ministerial orders issued since the foundation of the State were signed in the past ten years.  Ministers have too much power.  No. 7 on the social welfare dietary supplement and No. 8 on the pension of the Director of Public Prosecutions were not debated in the House.  As with many other regulations, these measures are being implemented by means of ministerial order, thus bypassing the Seanad, D&aacute;il and committee.  Too much power is concentrated in the hands of the few.  We cannot claim to be a functioning democracy in that regard. </p></speech>

One of my colleagues will propose the second amendment.  This issue is linked to the human tissue Bill, which I raised previously with the Leader.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Alex White, gave a commitment that the Bill would come before the House before the end of 2013.  It does not feature on the Order Paper and it is unlikely the legislation will be passed this year.  I ask the Leader to comment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-03-04a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1143" speakername="John Whelan" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014030400004#C00600"><p>As the Seanad commences its working week, the unfolding crisis in Ukraine may not seem to be the most pressing issue facing Irish people.  It is, however, one of the most serious threats to peace in Europe and one of the gravest crises facing Ireland and the European Union since we joined the European Economic Community in the early 1970s.  I commend the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, and his EU counterparts on their early intervention in the crisis and strong words of condemnation.  I hope the crisis will not require anything other than condemnation as Europe could be quickly sucked into a most murderous affair.  There is no question that Crimea has been annexed by Russia, which has launched a de facto invasion of a sovereign country.</p><p>  While Ukraine may appear remote, the country is on our doorstep.  Two years ago, thousands of Irish soccer fans attended soccer matches in Poland and Ukraine.  We cannot take this development lightly or turn a blind eye to it.  The last time such an event occurred in Europe, it had serious consequences.  We cannot allow the matter to escalate further.  I ask the Leader to invite the T&aacute;naiste before the House to set out what programme of action and which sanctions the European Union has in mind to send a message to President Vladimir Putin that what has occurred in Ukraine is an affront to democracy and freedom and not acceptable under any circumstances.  President Putin may regard the notice of the Irish Seanad in much the same way as the Tsar treated the attention of the <i>Skibbereen Eagle</i> all those years ago.  I doubt he is quaking in his boots.</p><p>  Ireland's proud role in peacekeeping under the banner of the United Nations stretches from engagements in Congo, Lebanon and Cyprus to the current deployment on the Golan Heights in Syria. </p> <p>Ireland has a role to play and has a credible voice in the context of peacekeeping and intervention.  It is vital that no mother's son, regardless of whether he is wearing a Russian or a Ukrainian uniform, be lost in the despicable series of events playing out on our TV screens.  What is happening is far too dangerous and we cannot take it lightly.  We cannot engage in cherry-picking in respect of the aspects of democracy which appeal to us.  I earnestly appeal to the Leader to invite the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to come before the House to set out his Department's stall and indicate the role he intends to play.  The T&aacute;naiste is due to meet the Russian ambassador this evening - he could also brief us on this matter if he comes before the House - in order to reprimand him and outline, in no uncertain terms, our opposition to the events unfolding in Ukraine.</p></speech>

Senators may have thought it was just a single day but this year an entire week is being devoted to celebrating women's significant achievements and highlighting all that remains to be done to ensure the full participation in and equality for women in the context of the workings of this State.  We need at least a week to mark these achievements and to begin to fill some of the holes on the road ahead.  As a former chief executive of the National Women's Council of Ireland, NWCI, I wish to ask if the Leader will make time available for a debate with the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, on the report on six ways to make the Oireachtas more women-friendly, which is currently being launched by the council.  I understand many of our female colleagues are currently attending that launch.  One of the suggested six ways to make the Oireachtas more women-friendly is the establishment of a 40% gender quota for Cabinet appointments.  That is one of the best ideas I have heard in a long time and it would lead to more women being seated at that big table.  Another one of the suggested ways relates to maternity leave for politicians.  What a radical idea.  The report recounts how, when she returned from maternity leave, Deputy McDonald was informed by one of her colleagues that politicians do not take maternity leave.  Another suggestion - perhaps an even more radical one - is that there should be paternity leave for politicians.  Will the Leader make time available for a debate on this matter?</p><p>I have two further questions for the Leader in view of the week that is in it.  We are still living in a State in which at least one maternity service in a regional hospital has been deemed to be neither safe for women nor sustainable.  We have all been obliged to listen to stories being recounted about a broken system - which the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, insists will be fixed - amid the context of the inestimable grief of the parents whose babies died.  There has been a debate about whether a reduction or consolidation of resources had anything to do which causing this crisis.  Will the Leader ask the Minister if he is going to take action in respect of the lack of midwives at Portlaoise hospital?  There is a need to appoint more staff to the maternity unit at the hospital in order that there will be a ratio of one midwife to 29.5 births, as recommended by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation.  If that ratio is to be met, then an additional 33 midwives will have to be employed at Portlaoise.  In such circumstances, how can the HSE inform women who are due to give birth that they are safe?</p><p>I have one final question, and I thank the Cathaoirleach for his indulgence.  In recent weeks the Government has noted its achievement of an increase of 61,000 in the overall number of jobs.  That is an achievement and I offer my congratulations.  When one drills down into that headline figure, however, one discovers that the level of employment among women under the age of 35 is down by a staggering 17,100 since last year.  Something is radically wrong here.  In that context, will the Leader ask the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to outline the specific programmes he is developing in order to facilitate the creation of jobs for younger women?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-03-04a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1136" speakername="David Norris" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014030400005#D00300"><p>I share the concerns expressed by colleagues with regard to the highly volatile and dangerous situation in Ukraine.  There seems to be no leadership at all there.  Situations of division are extremely dangerous.  We should remember the position which obtained prior to the First World War and the fact that people walked right into that conflict.  Lord Grey was in tears on the evening before war was eventually declared.  One shot started the First World War and in current circumstances a single shot could have a very dangerous impact, particularly if it hit the wrong person.  What Hitler did in respect of the Sudetenland prior to the Second World War also comes to mind.  Although Putin is a stinker, I would not equate him with Hitler.  I am merely seeking to outline some of the historical precedents.  The Russians have involved agents provocateurs in order to create problems, which is exactly what happened in the Sudetenland prior to start of the Second World War.</p> <p>International treaties involving various member states of the European Union and the Russian Federation have been clearly broken.  There is a very dangerous background.  One must also see it from the other side.  Imagine if one was Russian.  Crimea is part of Russia culturally, historically and linguistically.  They have one of the biggest Russian naval bases there.  Of course, they feel threatened.  It does not matter that Putin did nothing but lie at his press conference.  He should get the Ceaucescu award for international political liar of the year.  We in Europe are dependent on gas from Russia.  It is a highly dangerous situation and it would be right to discuss it.</p><p> Will the Leader draw the attention of the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht of a disastrous and craven decision by Dublin City Council?  I know that body is separate from us, but this involves a question of national heritage.  I can see from this building the roofs of Fitzwilliam Street.  The ESB disgraced itself 20 or 30 years ago by destroying the single longest Georgian streetscape in the entire world.  It put a heap of utterly modernist brutalist rubbish in place of it.  The council's plan means it is supposed to restore it to the 18th century facade.  That is what should happen.  If <i>The Night Watch</i>by Rembrandt was savaged by some lunatic, they would not hire Pablo Picasso or Matisse to finish it off, they would get a good restorationist.  That is what should happen here.  Dublin City Council should be utterly ashamed.</p><p> One other matter of shame occurs.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, to come to the House to explain to us why he told us in black and white terms on the record that there was no question at the moment of over-the-counter sales by Tesco.  Tesco is now selling petrol.  I do not know if it is selling coffins but it is selling everything it can get its hands on.  It is starting banking.  This here is a photograph of over-the-counter transactions in the form of post-and-pay customer services.</p></speech>

I support colleagues calling for a debate on what is happening in Crimea in particular and Ukraine generally.</p> <p>The press conference given by Mr. Putin today was bizarre.  He denied that the troops in Crimea are Russian.  He suggested that they might have bought their uniforms.  There is a serious background to this issue.  It is not all one-sided.  Baroness Ashton has spoken on behalf of the EU.  I do not think the EU is speaking with one voice on this issue.  The question of trade is involved.  I believe the EU acted provocatively by trying to negotiate an important deal with Ukraine without being conscious of the fact that Ukraine is supplied with gas and oil by Russia.  The EU authorities did not seem to be conscious of the offence they were causing to Russia.  The President of Ukraine was forced to resign or withdraw and he has since left the country.  It was noted that when Baroness Ashton greeted the release of the former president, in a sense she endorsed her as a future candidate.  Her record in government is not particularly good.  I think the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade should reiterate our position to Baroness Ashton, who represents the EU and not herself.  She should be very cautious before she embraces any candidate for the future presidency of Ukraine.  Other candidates are emerging at the moment.  It is in this context that I believe the EU is acting provocatively.  It is also worth mentioning that NATO is seeking for Ukraine to join NATO.  We should all be aware of what is happening.  I remind the House that Russia, which is a member of the Council of Europe, invaded part of Georgia and has held onto it without any repercussions.

We all have an interest in the matter.  I would like the T&aacute;naiste to brief us on the up-to-date position regarding the situation in Ukraine.  It is very tense and serious and could have far-reaching consequences.</p></speech>

The employment position has improved over the past 18 months.  Unemployment figures have decreased.  Given that the previous Administration, by contrast, oversaw 250,000 job losses, it is clear that this Government is doing a good job.  Some 5,000 jobs are being created each month.  The retail sector has expressed optimism for the year ahead.  The Government has provided &euro;1 billion for a new training and upskilling scheme, Pathways to Work.  For the first time, there is a further education and training strategy for the long-term unemployed.  The JobBridge scheme has created opportunities for many people to go through education.  Approximately 62% of those who have participated in the scheme have got full-time jobs.  Some 1,280 people have got jobs arising from their participation in the JobsPlus scheme.</p><p>I wish to bring one or two areas in which we could do some more work to the attention of the Leader.  I would like the Leader to ask the Minister for Social Protection to come to the House for a debate on these areas.  The Gateway project is designed to take 3,000 people off the live register by providing opportunities through local authorities.  This initiative has union approval.  It seems like a very good opportunity for the long-term unemployed.  To date, just 60 people have been taken off the live register and placed on this scheme.  Just three local authorities have participated in it.  Such a dismal return for this scheme needs to be examined and investigated.  There are great opportunities in the hotel and catering industry as well.  The head of the Irish Hotels Federation said today that 3,000 jobs are available in this country's hotel industry.  It is about time to knock heads together to see what training these people need, to provide that training and to ensure we can put a further 3,000 people back to work in this country's economy.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister, Deputy Burton, to come to the House for a debate on this matter as soon as possible.</p></speech>

We already have five zombie banks in public ownership - Anglo, EBS, AIB, Irish Nationwide, Irish Life and Permanent and acquiring another would be an extremely ill-advised investment.</p><p> I wish to express my concern about the article by Cliff Taylor in <i>The Sunday Business Post </i>last Sunday that AIB, which is about 98% owned by the taxpayer, paid over &euro;100 million in consultancy fees to PwC who were the auditors to Bank of Ireland which also needed to be rescued in 2008.  We need to have a thorough reform of financial services in Ireland, not just of the institutions I have mentioned but pension funds are in trouble, insurance companies require levies and even credit unions are in trouble.  A major obstacle to the future development of the country is our failure to reform financial services.</p></speech>

This progress has been hard won by the Irish people and has put the State in a position to broaden our economic recovery.  Debt sustainability has been vital to the restoration of our economy and will be important for future sustainable growth.  Our public finances are finally under control with out deficit below 5% of GDP.  The current cost of borrowing at just over 3% allows the State to spend less on servicing the national debt which, in turn, gives the Minister and the Government more flexibility to reduce taxes or increase spending on public services.  I remind Senator Daly - as Senator Landy did - that when his party was last in government, over 250,000 jobs were lost in the final three years of that term.  Ireland now outstrips all other EU nations with regard to job creation.  Last week's figures show that a net total of 61,000 new jobs were created in 2013-----</p></speech>

A Red C opinion poll published at the weekend shows that a majority of citizens are against the overhead power lines and are in favour of undergrounding.  This Government has set up a commission which is not really truly independent.

The Government should do the right thing and ask EirGrid to cease its planning application, to ensure an independent process and listen to the concerns of those who are opposed to EirGrid's plans.</p></speech>

We have exited a bailout programme and are creating jobs at a rate of 1,000 per week.  It is ironic that Sinn F&eacute;in is discussing opinion polls when the only opinion poll about which most unemployed people care is whether they have a job or are in receipt of social welfare.</p><p>I agree with my colleague, Senator Whelan, that we should have a debate on Ukraine.  It is one of the most serious issues facing the EU.  We have not faced anything like it since the break-up of the former Yugoslavia.  It merits a debate.  One of the saddest points was Sarah Palin being hailed as some kind of oracle on foreign policy because, some time ago from her home in Alaska, she predicted an invasion of Ukraine in the same way that the Russians invaded Georgia.  This House needs to hold a more serious debate on the matter.</p><p>Will the Leader arrange for a debate on the National Women's Council of Ireland's report, &quot;A Parliament of all Talents: Building a Women-Friendly Oireachtas&quot;, which is being launched as we speak?  The report contains many elements that need to be debated.  There has been a great deal of progress on legislating to encourage political parties, which are the main gatekeepers of the Oireachtas, to choose women candidates.  However, more needs to be done.  We in this Chamber need to examine the way we do business.  Through the Leader, we need to feed up the line that we do not want to have little to do for a couple of weeks, only to be snowed under with legislation at the end of the year.  Sitting until midnight or 1 a.m. is ridiculous.  I hate to say it, but we all have homes to go to.  There should be more reality when it comes to doing business.</p></speech>

I also hope our trainers, jockeys and owners have a successful Cheltenham.  There has been controversy of late regarding allegations of wrong-doing in stables.  That will be all unravelled in due course, but Mr. Willie Mullins issued a worrying statement yesterday.  As we all know, he is one of the leading national hunt trainers on these islands, if not the best.  He stated that he was concerned about the possible nobbling of his horses in the run up to Cheltenham.  He mentioned that it was a serious concern for other leading trainers as well.  There are suspicions that gentlemen or ladies are prowling around and interfering with horses to try to make money out of poor performances.</p> <p>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, should interest himself in this matter and look into it, and he should also send out inspectors to check that everything is in order in stables.  He should ensure, perhaps in conjunction perhaps with the Minister for Defence or the Minister for Justice and Equality, there is vigilance in respect of our leading racing stables in the lead-up not only to Cheltenham but to all other major festivals where there are nefarious people trying to make an easy shilling.</p></speech>

It highlights the level of progress that has been made in Europe during the past 50 years when we consider that in the first 50 years of the previous century, 67 million people died in two world wars, the vast majority in Europe.  One can travel from the Dingle Peninsula all the way to the Russian border without encountering any conflict and find that 500 million people are living in peace.  We can criticise Europe but that shows the level of progress that has been made in a very short period.</p><p>In regard to the situation in Ukraine, Europe needs to plays a very important part in ensuring there will not be increased hostilities resulting in people being killed.  I visited Georgia as part of an election observation mission in 2010 and I was struck by the fact that this country, which was at one stage part of the Russian Empire, is now totally isolated because it does not have access to the European market on one side or to the Russian market on the other side.  It shows how a country, even if is very large and has huge potential, can become isolated if it does not have access to markets.  Likewise, we may see something similar happen in Ukraine.  Therefore, it is important that Europe influences what occurs here and ensures it is the road of peace rather than road of war.</p><p>I wish to raise another issue regarding the use of State assets.  We have a huge problem in that many of our State assets are under-utilised, and I raised this matter recently at a meeting.  In 2003 when I was Lord Mayor of Cork I was told that by Christmas 2003 there would be major plans for 17 acres of land belonging to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann but now ten years on we are only seeing those come to light.</p></speech>

I raise this matter because in the past eight years only &euro;8.3 million has been raised from the sale of lands held by the psychiatric services.  A good deal of land owned by the HSE and by other State organisations is not being properly used.  It is important we have a debate on the proper utilisation of those assets now that progress is being made in the economy.  It is timely to have such a debate.</p></speech>

As others have said, we are at a very delicate moment.  We are hanging on to peace by our fingertips right now.  It is a moment when Ireland really needs to punch above its weight because the difference between war and peace is about real diplomacy and real leadership.  The T&aacute;naiste is meeting the Russian ambassador today but we need to work together with Europe to ensure we save this country from war.  It is absolutely on tenterhooks.  I know quite a few really good Ukrainian people living in Ireland.  I have seen how hard they have worked to set up lives here.  This decision now lies largely in the hands of a few men.  When we think that this is international women's week, it is a moment when we need to go for this and save it.</p><p>As the people leave the Gallery, I would like to welcome the visitors from Austria.

Next Tuesday 27,000 teachers will strike about the reforms to the junior certificate, particularly about the marking system because the Minister is going to return this to the hands of the teachers.</p> <p>Many teachers feel, as I do, that standards could be reduced if we do not have more objectivity and that the State role in marking should not be completely eradicated.  Will the Leader arrange an urgent debate on education standards and junior certificate reform, if possible, next Tuesday?  If he could fit that in, it would be very helpful.</p></speech>

I hope the trend of more than 5,000 jobs per month being created continues.  I agree with Senator Landy that there are more than 3,000 jobs available in the catering sector and that employers are having great difficulty filling these positions.</p><p>I was listening to a vox pop earlier.  There is definitely a myth that if a person gives up social welfare, he stands to lose too much.  Under the JobsPlus initiative put in place recently by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, an employer can claim half the social welfare payment if a person takes up work and that will enhance the wages the employer can pay to the employees.  I heard another myth from someone else to the effect that if a person takes up a full-time job he will lose his medical card, but that is not true.  A person will retain the medical card for four years.  There is another myth to the effect that if I take up work I will lose rent allowance.  Again, if a person opts to go on the rental assistance scheme he will not lose the rent allowance.  There is another myth to the effect that if I take a job on the minimum wage then I stand to lose too much.  The minimum wage is still greater than social welfare and if a person has children he can get a massive top-up through the family income supplement.  The fifth myth I heard was to the effect that if a person gives up social welfare and takes up a job, it will be 12 weeks before he will be able to get his social welfare back again, but that is not true.  It can be done in a matter of three days.</p><p>I welcome what Senator Landy has suggested.  We should bring the Minister for Social Protection to the House and discuss all this.  Perhaps we should consider the possibility of issuing a simple little booklet to people on long-term social welfare explaining all these things to them in order that their ill-founded fears can be addressed.  That might be a way forward.</p></speech>

Some months ago a young person died from a peanut allergy.  The person went into a chemist shop but was unable to get an anaphylactic pen.  One simple solution would be to ensure every restaurant in the country has at least one of these pens.  Pens cost very little and they last for at least a full year.  It could be done with a simple tranche of legislation, if we even need legislation, stipulating that among the conditions for every restaurant is that they should have one of these pens available.  The same pen will act as a solution to any allergy as far as I know although I am not an expert on it.  It would appear to be a simple solution and I do not know why someone has not grabbed hold of it and decided to do it right away to save lives.</p><p>Some months ago the death took place of a person from carbon monoxide poisoning.  One comparatively simple solution - it would not be immediate but it could be a simple solution - could involve a regulation that every new home should have a carbon monoxide alarm fitted.  That would not need new legislation.  It would simply need a change in the building by-laws.</p><p>These steps could be taken and they would save lives.  Certain things could happen more quickly than what is happening at the moment.  I call on the Leader to draw the attention of the Ministers responsible for these two areas to these proposals and to ask if we can move on them right away and see what can be done.  If it needs legislation then let us introduce legislation, but in the meantime let us see if we can save lives by a simple act.</p></speech>

I compliment the T&aacute;naiste and other EU Foreign Ministers on their quick actions in organising meetings to discuss the ongoing situation.  This crisis will demand real skill and diplomacy to bring about a resolution.  One thing we all wish to see is democracy preserved.  We support democracy in Ukraine.  I am pleased the T&aacute;naiste will come before the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade this afternoon to update the committee on developments in recent days.</p> <p> I welcome the fact that the EU Commission's innovation scorecard shows that Ireland has continued to improve its innovation performance, and has gone from tenth to ninth place among the 28 member states.  Ireland is now at 110% of the EU average.  Ireland is the overall leader in the economic effects of innovation, which captures the economic success of innovation in employment in knowledge intensive activities.  I also welcome the fact that in the same report, Ireland's HR performance is third best in the EU, after Finland and Sweden, which augurs well for the successful manner in which Irish businesses are being run and are positioning themselves to benefit from the improving economic situation in Ireland and across Europe.</p></speech>

This is a very worrying aspect, because the Government consistently stands by as the multiples dictate, in the interests of their own bottom line, the return of the people who reap the bounty of the land in all our interests. There have been changes to specification, with factory enforced movement criteria, where people selling cattle at the moment are being docked &euro;150 per animal purely on the basis of the number of movements the animal has had from farm to farm.  It seems that even attendance at a show counts as a movement.  That is a very worrying trend because it is capitalising on the farmers who are trying very hard to make a living, particularly the farmers in the north west, where 40% of the weanling population of the country is produced.  The Minister must address this because there are farm families in that part of the country earning well below the minimum wage.  They are well below the celebratory tones we have heard from the Government about the relative success of some of their policies in recent times.  The reality on the ground is that these people are living hand to mouth and we stand idly by and do nothing about it.</p><p>On a related issue, there is anecdotal evidence to suggest that Irish Water will insist that all farmers have meters that are not compatible with those the agency wishes to use, and will be expected to pay for these themselves, at a cost of up to &euro;250 per water meter.  That is simply unacceptable.</p></speech>

I suggest we wait for the facts to emerge before we start with the histrionics, but that is not the point I wish to make today.</p><p>The Cork Film Centre is a voluntary arts group based in Cork, providing support, training and equipment for a vibrant arts community in the city and county, especially among many community groups.</p> <p>Some of the groups deal with youth groups and areas of underprivilege.  The Arts Council announced yesterday that it intends cutting funding to the organisation by 50%, which requires the Cork Film Centre to let go its more experienced staff.  Without them, the centre will be unable to operate.  Next year, the Arts Council proposes to reduce funding to zero, which makes it untenable.  I ask the Leader for a debate on arts policy and cuts in particular.  We should invite the Minister to the Chamber.  Some cuts are necessary, unpalatable as they are, but others are counter-productive.  This is a case of the latter and I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to the Chamber to discuss arts policy and cuts.</p></speech>

The tragic loss of the parents in Portlaoise deserves our sympathy.  As a parent, I cannot feel how awful it must be to lose a child and particularly to lose a child in the circumstances outlined.</p><p>I am very troubled by one of the central messages from the report of the Department of Health, namely, that there was no linkage between this tragic occurrence and a deficiency in staffing levels.  Between 2000 and 2009, the population of the catchment area of Portlaoise hospital increased by 37%, mainly due to the development of satellite towns and quasi-suburban communities with a disproportionate number of young couples starting off in life.  The number of births increased from 1,000 to 2,000.  While the number of births nationally increased by 17%, the number in Portlaoise increased by 50%.  The increase in the number of consultant obstetricians, which stood at a ludicrously low three, was zero.  There were three at the beginning and three at the end of that period.  The logic of the Department of Health is as follows.  If there was no linkage between decreased staffing levels and these adverse outcomes, will the Department of Health and the Minister clarify whether the unit was overstaffed in 2000?  I think that is an absurd contention.</p><p>I do not accept it is appropriate for trainee doctors to provide medical care in a country with the highest number of medical schools per head of population in the western world.  What can we say about the numbers in Portlaoise?  None of the doctors occupying trainee positions, such as registrars in the hospital, was part of the recognised national specialist registrar training schemes.  During this time, there was a dramatic increase in the number of people hired as agency employees, as nurses and junior doctors and at other grades.  One can say it shows the investment made in the service but I suggest it shows the opposite.</p></speech>

I welcome the great news from the National University of Ireland, Galway, which has decided to reward students who excel in sport with the opportunity to gain an additional 40 CAO points in the leaving certificate results towards entrance to university.  Some students may be unable to play ball, jump higher or run faster and may not be happy with this move.  I suggest taking it one step further.</p> <p>I suggest those who participate in physical education in school should have an opportunity to be rewarded by achieving points, similar to those awarded for subjects such as English, mathematics, art and music.</p><p>Why do I make an argument for rewarding those who participate in physical education?  Yesterday the World Health Organization once again raised the epidemic of obesity facing Europe.  The WHO raises the issue of the high levels of fats, salt and sugar in our diet and the low levels of exercise.  Some 30% of 11 year old children are now deemed to be overweight.  It also suggests that half the population over 18 years will be obese by 2020.  Today University College Cork came out with the results of the Cork children's lifestyle study which confirms what we already know at local level.  It reinforces what has been stated through the national report, Growing Up in Ireland, which was undertaken for the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.</p><p>I ask the Cathaoirleach to bear with me.  If it ain't broke, don't try to fix it.  We need to fix it.  Some &euro;15 billion is being spent in the health service on sick people.  I know the Minister for Health is trying to cut costs as well as introducing universal health insurance.  I suggest that physical education, although a core subject in schools, is not taken seriously enough.  Some 52% of the teaching time is devoted to three subjects, English, Irish and mathematics</p></speech>

I think the situation is worthy of a strong response from the European Union, the United Nations and all international agencies.</p><p>When Senator Norris and I, among others, were elected to the Seanad for the first time in 1987, Ukraine was a province of the USSR, locked behind the Iron Curtain which divided the continent of Europe.  A short few years later, the Berlin Wall fell and there was a changed political and economic situation in Europe.  We all felt there was no going back to the bad old days of Soviet style pressure and bullying.  Tragically, what we are seeing in Crimea and the threat to Ukraine must indicate that some leopards to not change their spots.  The United Nations, the European Union and every member state must be very strong in its response to what Russia is attempting to do.</p><p>Tragically, we can now state with certainty that the lack of action by the UN and in particular by President Obama in respect of Syria has caused Mr. Putin to believe he can do what he wishes and there will be no significant or strong response.  President Obama and others must stand up to the bullying threat from Russia and stand by the people of Ukraine.  I look forward to listening to the response from the T&aacute;naiste.  Europe must stand strong and united on this issue or else the consequences could be quite terrible not just for Crimea and Ukraine but for the broader continent of Europe.</p></speech>

Today, Mr. Alastair Campbell and a few medical practitioners, who addressed the all-party Oireachtas group, gave us details of the crisis caused by the misuse of alcohol.  I am on record as having spoken about it on numerous occasions.  I think the problems caused by it are well known.  The measures in the alcohol strategy, including minimum pricing, restriction of advertising and change of certain measures on packaging need to be implemented.  Will the Leader say when it is proposed that the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Alex White will come to the House to discuss this matter?  I have requested on a number of occasions to have this issue debated.</p> <p>We have discussed the matter on a previous occasion but we need to discuss it again especially in the context of alcohol sponsorship for sports and other events.  </p><p>I was pleased to hear the good news this morning that Ireland has been awarded the accolade of the destination that offers the most potential for Chinese travellers at a ceremony in Shanghai today.  Over 3 million people were surveyed and Ireland had to compete with destinations such as South Africa, Dubai, Turkey, Sweden, Kenya and Queensland.  Ireland was the overall winner in the survey, which is great news.  The result is due to the work done by Tourism Ireland which has committed to increasing the amount of Chinese tourists from 17,000 up to 50,000 every year for the next five years.  </p><p>I wish to mention a related issue which was also raised by Senator Landy.  The Irish Hotels Federation has indicated that there are approximately 3,000 vacancies in the hotel and catering trade.  We must be ready for tourists on one level but the statistic begs the question alluded to by Senator Landy.  Why do these jobs exist in a country with high unemployment?  The matter also raises all sorts of questions in the social welfare area.  Therefore, I support the Senator's request to invite the Minister for Social Protection to attend here to discuss the matter.</p></speech>

I have spoken to people in the Euromaidan who told me that they have lost faith in Ukrainian politics, both the government and the opposition.  We need to support the reasonable efforts of the EU and all those who seek new free and fair elections in the Ukraine and we must impose economic sanctions on those who do not co-operate in that regard.  I do not want us to return to war in Europe and, therefore, I do not encourage President Obama to enter the region with American armed forces, for example.  I ask everyone to listen to the voice of reason.  I have spoken to Ukranian parliamentarians who do not speak to each other and told them that in Ireland we know only too well what happens when politics breaks down.  The Ukranians need to get together now to sort out the problem themselves.</p><p>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Education and Skills to attend here.  I have already requested such a meeting to discuss the new junior cycle reform plan.  It puts children at the heart of the education system and makes them the main agents in their education with its emphasis on literacy, numeracy and science.  I agree with Senator Eamonn Coghlan that physical education leads to good mental health which is most important.</p></speech>

There needs to be an element of external monitoring of the new junior certificate for the medium term.  If the problem was resolved we would have the support of teachers.</p></speech>

There was another amendment to the Order of Business regarding item No. 8 which I do not proposed to accept either.</p><p>Senator Daly made a point which I could not understand.  He said that 61,000 jobs were created because 80,000 people had emigrated.  I do not know how those facts are related at all.  The fact is 61,000 extra jobs were created in the economy which had nothing whatsoever to do with people emigrating.  I cannot marry his details or facts on the matter.</p></speech>

We have all been deeply disturbed by developments in Crimea in recent days and we urgently need to chart a way out of this crisis.  As the T&aacute;naiste has said, Russia's actions are a clear violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and independence and threaten to create a dangerous new division in Europe.  If the Russian authorities do not de-escalate this crisis, the EU will take consequential action, including the suspension of talks on visa liberalisation and on a new economic agreement, both of which are priorities for the Russian Government.</p><p>I join the T&aacute;naiste in commending the measured response demonstrated so far by Ukraine.  It was agreed at yesterday's emergency Foreign Affairs Council meeting that the EU will move swiftly to freeze the assets of those responsible for human rights violations in Ukraine, as agreed at the Council's meeting of 20 February.  The Foreign Affairs Council also agreed that the EU would lend its full support to an international assistance package to address the urgent needs of Ukraine, based on a clear commitment to reforms.</p><p>We are certainly confronted with an extremely dangerous situation and need to send a firm message to Moscow that its behaviour is totally unacceptable, while urging the authorities in Kiev to maintain restraint in the face of this provocation.  There must be immediate talks before the crisis deepens further.  The United Nations, the OSCE and the Council of Europe should all engage without delay.  Moscow's concerns about the position of the Russian-speaking population in Crimea can be peacefully addressed through various channels, including the OSCE.  This House would urge Russia to use the multilateral mechanisms which are available to find a peaceful solution.  We must remain firm in our commitment to Ukraine's unity, independence and territorial integrity.</p><p>The European Council is to meet again to address this issue on Thursday.  I will invite the T&aacute;naiste to attend the House to address this matter and provide an update.  I understand he is doing so at the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade today, but I will ask him to update this House also.</p><p>Senator Zappone referred to the celebration of international women's week.  Like Senators Hayden and Healy Eames, she called for the National Women's Council's report to be debated with the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  I will ask the Minister of State to attend the House for such a debate.</p><p>Senators Zappone and Crown referred to the situation at Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise.  The 11 recommendations in the report on that hospital have all been accepted by the Government and will be implemented.  The IMO's concerns were raised in 2006 and 2008.  A team from the Coombe Women's Hospital is taking over the maternity unit in Portlaoise hospital.  The Government has acted swiftly in this regard and has also ordered an audit of all staffing levels, including midwifery, in Portlaoise hospital.</p> <p>This has been welcomed by all the families involved.  I believe this can be seen as a robust and decisive response by the Government in this very serious matter.</p><p>Senator Zappone also raised the question of jobs for women.  She raised it on the right day in the right week because we have practically devoted this week to jobs.  We have statements on economic growth and jobs with the Minister for Finance today, we have a whole debate tomorrow in regard to apprenticeships with the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, and we also have a debate on the Action Plan for Jobs with the Minister, Deputy Bruton.  This is an opportunity for Members who have concerns and questions in regard to the jobs action plan to attend those sessions and to make their points to the relevant Ministers.</p><p>Senator Zappone also raised the question of jobs for women.

This is the time for people who have concerns and questions in regard to the jobs action plan to  those sessions and to make their points with the Ministers involved.</p><p>I note the comments of Senator Norris in regard to Fitzwilliam Street and the ESB building.  Of course, that is a matter for Dublin City Council to address.  I honestly do not believe the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, told any porkies in this House under any circumstances in regard to An Post.</p></speech>

I have asked the Minister for Justice and Equality on a number of occasions to come in to the House to address that matter, and I am sure he will do so soon.</p><p>Senator Landy spoke in regard to the increase in employment and the reduction in unemployment from 16% to 12%.  Again, I am sure Senator Landy will make the points he raised in regard to the catering industry with the Minister, Deputy Bruton, when he is here, and with the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, tomorrow.</p><p>Senator Barrett raised the possibility that the Government could be taking over Ulster Bank.  To the best of my knowledge, the Government is trying to free itself from bank ownership at this stage so I would not believe anything the Senator would read in the newspaper in that regard.</p><p>Senator Paul Coghlan referred to the great strides made by the Minister for Finance in guiding the economy and freeing us from the bailout.  That point was also raised by Senator Hayden.</p><p>Senator Cullinane raised the issue of the EirGrid proposals and gave his opinion that the commission set up to examine the proposals is not independent.  That is Senator Cullinane's opinion and I will not comment any further on it.</p><p>Senator Hayden spoke about getting back our economic sovereignty.  In regard to the business of the House, I made the points she has raised here today.</p><p>Senator O'Sullivan raised the situation in Ukraine.  He also referred to Cheltenham, in particular the question of the doping of horses and the point raised by the trainer, Willie Mullins.  I understand the Turf Club has made a strong statement that there are very stringent regulations in regard to the doping of horses.  However, I believe the trainer was highlighting the fact there are people who are out there to destroy the industry and there is a need for vigilance, as there always has been, in regard to horses, especially fancied ones.  I hope Senator O'Sullivan backs a few good winners in Cheltenham.</p><p>Senator Colm Burke raised the issue of the sale of State assets and their utilisation.  He can raise that point with the Minister for Finance when he is here.</p><p>Senators Healy Eames and Jim D'Arcy called for a further debate on junior certificate reform.  We had a debate on that very issue in the autumn and, to the best of my knowledge, Senator Healy Eames did not partake in that debate.  We will try to get the Minister to come in and address the very same debate that took place in the autumn.</p><p>Senator Kelly referred to jobs in the catering sector and outlined the many myths that relate to the loss of benefits.  I agree with him that there is a need to inform people of their rights in this regard, as there are many myths about benefits that are not true.</p> <p> Senator Feargal Quinn raised the need for restaurants to be prepared in case customers with peanut allergies suffer a reaction.  He also raised the issue of carbon monoxide poisoning.  I will bring both matters to the attention of the relevant Ministers.  </p><p>Senator Michael Mullins outlined welcome improvements in Ireland's performance in innovation and human resources.  </p><p>Senator MacSharry raised the plight of farm families and referred to beef prices.  The farming sector is in good hands thanks to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney.  The Minister gave a robust defence of his policies on farming only a couple of weeks ago.  On Senator MacSharry's comments on water charges for farm families, I do not deal in speculation.  Clearly, Senators on the other side must grasp at straws from time to time. </p><p>Senator Gilroy referred to the Cork Film Centre and arts policy.  The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, was before the House to discuss a different issue last week.  We will invite him to come into the House again to discuss arts policy.  The specific issue related to the Cork Film Centre should be addressed through an Adjournment matter.  I addressed the points raised by Senator Crown.  </p><p>Senator Eamonn Coghlan referred to the decision by the National University of Ireland, Galway, to award extra points to students who are involved in high performance sport.  He also noted the problem of obesity and the need for lifestyle changes and more physical education in schools.  All of us will agree with the sentiments expressed by the Senator.</p><p>Senator Noone referred to the cross-party group on the misuse of alcohol and the need to implement the recommendations of the alcohol strategy.  I have invited the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Alex White, to come to the House.  It is only a matter of scheduling a time at this stage and I will do so when the Minister of State finds a gap in his diary.  I also note the point made by Senator Noone on tourism figures and the welcome increase in the number of Chinese visitors.</p></speech>

O'Toole.  I call Senator Leyden.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-03-04a.125" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1140" speakername="Terry Leyden" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014030400019#U00700"><p>I would like to welcome the extended family of the late, great Martin Joe O'Toole, who was a former councillor, Senator and Deputy.  On behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il, I wish to pay tribute to the life and times of Martin Joe O'Toole - may he rest in peace.  He was born on 27 May 1925 and departed this life on 1 October 2013.  I would like to extend our deepest sympathy to his family and friends on the loss of a wonderful and charismatic politician, father, grandfather and great-grandfather.  I would also like to pay tribute to his late wife Breege, who was a stalwart and a wonderful woman.  I visited the O'Toole house in advance of Seanad elections.  Breege gave everyone who called a great welcome to their beautiful home overlooking the Atlantic Ocean.  I express my sympathy to Martin Joe O'Toole's family - his sons Padraig, Austin, Martin and S&eacute;amus, his daughters Marie, Anna, Breda and Gr&aacute;inne, and his sons-in-law, daughters-in-law, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.  I am delighted that so many of his family are able to be here today.  Martin Joe O'Toole would be very proud to think that so many members of his family are present for this tribute to one of the great politicians who ever entered this House.  I have spoken to people who were here with him.</p><p>I entered Leinster House in 1977, the same year as Martin Joe O'Toole.  He was a Member of the 14th Seanad and he was re-elected to the 15th, 16th, 17th and 18th Seanaid.  He became a Member of the 26th D&aacute;il in 1989.</p> <p>I served in the D&aacute;il with him at that time.  It was a culmination of years of commitment and work for the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and the people of Mayo that he achieved a great ambition.  He was very proud to be a Senator.  He was most intelligent and he had a deep understanding of the rules of the House.  He was elected to the other House in 1989 and I was also a Deputy at that time.  I asked him to speak about the difference between being a Member of the D&aacute;il and a Member of the Seanad.  He replied that a Deputy demands whereas a Senator requests.  That may not necessarily be the case but he used his position very effectively in the Seanad and in the other House.</p><p>He was a member of Mayo County Council, having been elected in 1955 and he served there for 44 years.  I am sure the Cathaoirleach served with Martin Joe on Mayo County Council.  He was chairman of the council on several occasions.  He was a great and loyal friend of former Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey, being a fellow Mayo man.  He had great support from small farmers in County Mayo.  He supported job creation, regional development, tourism development.  He was a great champion of Knock International Airport and fought for the re-opening of the western rail corridor.  When he was elected to the D&aacute;il he demanded services for County Mayo.</p><p>It was said about him that he had a twinkle in his eye.  Everyone who knew him - I knew him extremely well - was impressed by him, by his knowledge of politics and his knowledge of the affairs of state.  He was a people's person and a community worker.  He loved his own native area of Louisburgh and that region of County Mayo.  He was a great conversationalist with a great knowledge of farming as he was a farmer himself.  It is sad that he has departed this life but he lived to a good age and his great achievements are to his name.</p><p>His family is very proud of Martin Joe O'Toole.  Members of his family including his grandchildren are present today.  The tributes being paid in the House are genuine and sincere because we regarded him as a truly great friend, a great neighbour in his County Mayo, a great Fianna F&aacute;il man, a great parliamentarian and a very loyal man who stood by the party and by the country all his life.</p></speech>

He sadly passed away last October.  I wish to express my sincere sympathies to his family, to his sons and daughters, his wider family circle and many friends, some of whom are with us today.  Martin had a long and distinguished public life serving as a Deputy from 1989 to 1992 and as a Senator from 1977 to 1989.  He was also a member and cathaoirleach of Mayo County Council from 1955, serving on the council for over 40 years, making him one of the longest serving public representatives in Ireland and an example of his long-standing dedication to the people of Mayo.</p><p>Martin J. O'Toole was always keen to support projects for Mayo and his own community.  As a member of the Seanad agricultural panel and as a livestock exporter, Martin Joe was deeply committed to and passionate about agricultural affairs and the agricultural community throughout his public life.  He would never pass up an opportunity to speak in support of the cause of Irish farmers and the agricultural industry.  He had a deep understanding of the concerns and problems of farmers.</p> <p>While his commitment to the agri-sector was always his top priority, he was also a great advocate for regional development, various forms of job creation, tourism development and infrastructural development.  He was a great champion of Knock Airport as Senator Leyden mentioned and led the intercounty rail committee for several years, campaigning for the re-opening of the western corridor.  I am sure that he welcomed the advances in that regard in recent years.</p><p>A large crowd attended his funeral in Louisburgh last October, including many current and former officeholders and a wide circle of friends and family who he cherished deeply.  As such, I would like to express my sincere sympathies again to his family, who are with us in the Chamber today, to his Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues and, indeed, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, which he served with honour and distinction in his lifetime of public service.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</p></speech>

That is clear from what everyone has said.  We are celebrating a colleague whom we held in high esteem and affection.</p><p>It is great to see the extended O'Toole clan overwhelming the Visitors Gallery.  Its members are great people.  Martin J. used to be over there and I was very glad to serve with him, but on our side we had Joe O'Toole.  They were second cousins.  I do not know whether the family heard the wonderful broadcast that Joe did about the O'Toole clan on &quot;Sunday Miscellany&quot;, when he went through the enormously distinguished ancestry, The Book of the Dun Cow, the Annals of the Four Masters and so on back to the Battle of Clontarf when he encountered a bit of a hiccup.  He said that, yes, they had fought gloriously and valiantly but, unfortunately, on the wrong side.  My own Gaelic ancestors were much wiser - they fought on both sides so they could claim victory no matter what happened.</p><p>I remember Martin J. as a quiet man with a wonderful sense of humour and someone who I would call, without any disrespect, a wise old bird, but one had to go to him to get advice.  He would not spread it around all over the place.  A bit like our own Joe here, he played his cards close to his chest, but if one approached him, he had an innate political wisdom, courtesy and decency.  He was part of the old school of politics.  Although some aspects of that life have been criticised, there was a great deal that was good about it.  He represented that goodness.</p><p>He was a voice for the west and a voice for Mayo.  I remember when it was neither popular nor profitable to support Knock Airport.  &quot;Dublin 4-ites&quot;, as I was at that stage, were heaping scorn on it as hard as we possibly could, but he and the Monsignor, whose name I forget-----</p></speech>

He served in public service with great distinction over a long period.  Indeed, as Senator Cummins stated, he must have been one of the longest standing public representatives in Ireland, given the fact that his political career began in the mid-1950s and continued well into the 1990s.</p> <p>That is a lengthy and extensive career by any standard.  He served as a councillor, a local representative in Louisburgh in Mayo, as a Senator for 12 years between 1977 and 1989 and also as a Deputy, as a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  He was a champion of his community in Louisburgh in Mayo and also a champion generally for rural Ireland.  Others have spoken of his work in seeking to develop the western rail corridor.</p><p>On a personal level, although I did not know him, it is lovely to pay tribute to a Mayo man.  My maternal great grandmother was from a large family in Westport, many of whom are still in Westport - the Reillys of Westport.  Although it is not Louisburgh, it is nice to pay tribute to somebody who championed and represented Mayo for so long at so many different levels in the Oireachtas and also at local level.  </p><p>On behalf of the Labour Party, I express my sympathies to his family members and friends and particularly to those who are here today to join us in the Chamber for the paying of tributes to him.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-03-04a.136" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1149" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014030400022#X00200"><p>I join others in paying tribute to Martin J., an exceptional politician.  While I did not have the opportunity to serve with him in the Houses I certainly would not have been here without his advice, support and blatant canvassing on my behalf in 2002 to ensure that I got across the line, for which I will be eternally grateful to him.</p><p>Senator Norris touched on what he was also for me and that is a true champion of the west, a man who saw and grew up at a time when the west made a strategic and necessary contribution to all of Ireland.  Sadly, throughout most of our political lives we have fought to try to ensure that the west continues to be acknowledged for the strategic contribution that it can make and he was certainly a pioneer in that regard.  While he would have celebrated many achievements that he, with others, would have pioneered from an infrastructural perspective - some have mentioned Knock and the intercounty railway committee with Father Miche&aacute;l McGr&eacute;il and others - there were many others for which we all continue to fight.</p><p>Senator Norris referred to him as being old school in the best possible way.  The new politics could do with taking the good parts from the past and realising that people are what politics is and that people are what economies are.  Martin J. O'Toole epitomised that as somebody who knew about business, exporting, farming and the genuine needs of people who had less that he or that others may have had.  For that reason we should look to Martin J. and his contribution as an example.</p><p>To all the family, our sincere condolences.  Unfortunately, I was not in a position to attend at the funeral but I know his former colleague, my father, Ray MacSharry, would like me to again sympathise on behalf of all of us.  It would also be remiss of me - I am sure he would like me to say it when he is there - not to mention the great friendship between him and a former Cathaoirleach, Rory Kiely, who is in Visitors Gallery for the tributes today.  Rory, a former Cathaoirleach, was I understand the longest serving Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  He served throughout all of Martin J.'s term in the Oireachtas.  It is great to see him here today, another legend of his own time.</p><p>Sincere condolences to all.  I hope that all of us who are still here can learn honour in some way through our contribution the great contribution by Martin J. O'Toole at every level of political life.</p></speech>

O'Toole and sympathise and celebrate with his friends and family who are here today.  I did not serve with him, I was born around the time he first started in politics but I met and chatted to him in this House and, although we were on different sides of the fence, I recognise the work he did for Mayo and for the west.

I am pleased to have the opportunity to say a few words in tribute to the late Senator Martin J. O'Toole and to welcome his family to the Visitors Gallery.  I had the pleasure of serving with him in both the Seanad and the D&aacute;il.  Naturally, that makes me feel almost as old as Senator Noone.  I would describe him as a made-for-measure Senator.  He served three or four terms in Seanad &Eacute;ireann alongside people such as his friend Rory Kiely.  As far as I know they were both on the agricultural panel.  I imagine at election time both of them went around the country assuring the Fianna F&aacute;il councillors that the other man had enough votes and that they vote for him instead.</p></speech>

I recall in 1989 that he became almost an accidental Deputy and he would admit it himself.  Suddenly, the late Denis Gallagher decided not to contest the D&aacute;il election and Martin J, after being a lifetime councillor and Senator, had the opportunity of standing for the D&aacute;il.  He got great pleasure in achieving election to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for Mayo West.  Most of us in the House remember him as the Senator who presided in the House in a calm, gentle and genteel fashion.  Senator Norris summed him up well.  He always spoke with a smile on his face and he was certainly a very pleasant colleague to have around.</p><p>He was also one of the minority who, upon leaving politics, came back here regularly and that was something very positive.  I am disappointed that so few of our colleagues who have left politics, voluntarily or otherwise, come back to participate in the social side of Leinster House.  Martin J. was here regularly and always kept us up-to-date with the events from the west.</p><p>He made a Trojan contribution to politics.  He was, as Senator MacSharry said, of a different political era.  One would never associate press releases, Twitter accounts or Facebook with Martin J. O'Toole.  His politics was face-to-face, direct and people-orientated.  Whether a person was of his party or any other party he treated them with great respect and that is why he is remembered so fondly and kindly in the House.</p><p>It was an outstanding achievement to be first elected in 1955 and to still be active in public life until almost the turn of the century.  That shows a profound and deep commitment far beyond party politics, a commitment to community and people, and that is his lasting legacy.  His was a lifetime of commitment, decency and no cross words or bitterness or silly party-political argument.  He was a doyen of the House.  He was a tower of strength for his political party and, above all, to his county and family.  I assure his family that those of us who were privileged to know him have nothing but very pleasant memories of him.</p></speech>

O'Toole but I met him many times.  As a young person in Fianna F&aacute;il at the time, he was someone to whom I looked up greatly.  There were some great men in Fianna F&aacute;il in those days.  They had high standards and they were popular.  Martin J. was very popular in Kerry.  My cousin, Kit Ahern, served in the House with him.  I am unsure whether they served in the Seanad and the D&aacute;il at the same time or whether they overlapped but they were good friends.  He used to come to Kerry often.  What I always noticed about him, whether it was at a party convention or an Ard-Fheis, was that wherever he moved people seemed to be around him.  He always had people around him for he was exceptionally popular.</p><p>It is great to see all the family in the House today on this lovely occasion, especially the young boys and girls who will remember this in many years to come.  I am also pleased to see the great Rory Kiely, my old pal and neighbour, with them and back in the Seanad after the little holiday he had lately.</p><p>I have a little epiphany of Martin J. O'Toole.  The one I involvement I had with him personally was rather funny.  He had a good friend in Listowel, where I am from, a man called Patsy Walsh.  I decided to run for the Seanad in the mid-1990s and Patsy Walsh said there was only one man I had to see and that was Martin J. O'Toole because he knew everything and he would put me right.</p> <p>An appointment was made for me to meet him, and I did so.  I was wondering how to get around the country and how much I would have to canvass and so on.  I did not have a clue.  Half way through the conversation, he stopped me and asked if I had got my nomination yet.  I said that would not be a problem because I was after running for the D&aacute;il in north Kerry and helped to elect my party colleagues; my chest was out.  He said "If I were you, I would go away and get that nomination first and come back to me after".  About a week later, I went up here to the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary rooms where, just like every other upstart, I got well hammered and that was the end of that.  He gave me very sensible advice.</p><p>I have lovely memories of him and great memories of Fianna F&aacute;il in that period.</p></speech>

It is named after Louisburgh in Nova Scotia.  Not many towns in this part of the world are named after towns in the New World.  From there, Martin J. O'Toole served for 44 years on Mayo County Council, 12 years in the Seanad and three years in the D&aacute;il.  It is a fantastic record of public service and, like the other Senators, I welcome all his friends and relatives who have come from Louisburgh today.  He was described as a good Senate performer and a supporter of Knock Airport.  I am sure he would be very pleased that with the abolition of the travel tax, Mr. O'Leary expects hundreds of thousands extra people to go through the airport this year.  That was the arrangement he made in exchange for the removal of the travel tax in the budget.  That will happen and it will be a big boost for Knock Airport and for County Mayo.</p><p>He was Uachtar&aacute;n Fhianna F&aacute;il for several years, which is one of the hard jobs to acquire in Irish politics.  When he passed away, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin described him as a man who combined colour, conviviality, wisdom and wit during his time in Leinster House.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, also made a very nice tribute to him.  He said he was a great friend of his late father for many years and that he certainly did the State some service.</p><p>I thought it was touching to read in the newspapers that at his memorial service, he had presented, as gifts, a copy of the Constitution, a D&aacute;il report, a Mayo County Council annual report and a Louisburgh GAA jersey.  That shows us the kind of life he sought to live.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a ainm d&iacute;lis.</p></speech>

I had the privilege of meeting him on a number of occasions while he visited this House.  As Senators Norris and Bradford alluded, he visited this House quite regularly since his retirement.  I always knew when he was about, because I shared an office on the same corridor as the late, great John Carty, who just passed away a couple of weeks ago.   I always knew when Martin Joe was about because the laughter that was coming from John Carty's office would indicate that he was present.

I imagine it is always a bittersweet occasion for family and friends in the Visitors Gallery  - I said the same last week when we paid tribute to a former Senator who also died - because the sadness is still there with the loss of Martin, but it is also wonderful to come to Leinster House and to hear people who served with him and knew him well pay tribute to his work and his commitment to politics, to his party and to the people of Mayo as well.</p> <p>On behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in, I offer my sympathy to the people in the Visitors Gallery, his family, and those who hold Martin in high regard but were not able to be here.  He had a distinguished career, as Members of his party and the Government parties have said.  He was a great advocate for rural Ireland, rural development and the farming community.  This is a nice occasion for the family to listen to the tributes paid to Martin, which are a credit to him and his long achievement in political life.  I am sure the family is very proud.  I wish the family the best of luck for the rest of the day and I extend my sympathy on behalf of my party to his family and friends in Mayo and further afield.  They will miss him but they have fond memories of him.  I welcome them to the Seanad and I extend my sympathies to them.</p></speech>

I remember him as a nice and decent man and I would like to join in the expressions of sympathy.  He was a national figure at the time.

He was known by his first name and very few people in the country can be elected through being known by their first name.  It is a tribute to anyone who is known only by a first name.  He was a member of the 26th D&aacute;il from 1989 to 1992 but he was somewhat reluctant in running for the D&aacute;il.  He really liked the Seanad and he was a fabulous councillor.  I would say he was somewhat reluctant to run in the constituency of Mayo West, as it was.</p><p>He was a farmer and a cattle exporter.  He exported cattle mainly to Scotland.  The cattle he bought and sold the length and breadth of the country were mainly blue heifers.  He was somewhat of an expert on blue heifers and, along with his brother, he exported many of them to Scotland.  At county council meetings, he ventured to tell us that we should buy a horse to go racing and to win the Chester Cup in England.  The Moores of Moorehall in Mayo had a horse that won the Chester Cup.  He envisaged us having a horse that would win the Chester Cup but his judgment of horses was not as good as his judgment of blue heifers.  We forgot the name of the horse fairly quickly.</p><p>I knew Martin J. for a number of years, having served with him on Mayo County Council for 20 years.  We always went to him for advice and he had a very steady hand in the council chamber.  He was chairman of the council on a number of occasions.  It is an honour to be chairman of the council for one year but Martin J. O'Toole had the honour of being chairman of Mayo County Council for seven years.  It is a great tribute to him that he was elected on a number of occasions to the chair of Mayo County Council.</p><p>He was quite a character and he had a great sense of humour.  He was very entertaining and witty.  He was not the first person home from the pub at night time.  What a character.</p> <p>One would travel the length and breadth of the country to meet a character like Martin J. O'Toole.  He was respected by politicians of all parties, whether across the floor of the D&aacute;il, in this Chamber or in Mayo County Council.</p><p>I was very sad to learn of the death of Martin J. O'Toole, because I thought people like Martin J. O'Toole would live on forever.  He had a very distinguished political career; he was a member of Mayo County Council for 44 years and a Member of the Oireachtas for 15 years, serving in both D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  He left his mark, as Senators have said.</p><p>He was a great Mayo man.  He was great advocate for Knock Airport, as well as advocating in Mayo for major sewerage and water schemes.  He worked very well with various county managers over the years as well as with the Government and Opposition parties of the day to get the best for our county.  He will be missed by everybody in the county, but most of all by his family.  I would like to be associated with the expressions of sympathy to the members of his family who are in the Gallery, his sons, Padraig, Austin, Martin and S&eacute;amus, and his daughters, Marie, Anna, Breda and Gr&aacute;inne, and their extended family.  I believe Martin J. had about eight grandchildren.  The family is very welcome to this House today for these expressions of sympathy.</p><p>The late Martin J. left his mark on the Oireachtas and on Mayo County Council.  He left a mark on everybody he met, and none more so than his great pal and colleague, Rory Kiely, a former Cathaoirleach of this House who served with him on the agricultural panel.  He and Deputy Dara Calleary are in the Gallery.  I welcome the former Cathaoirleach, Rory Kiely, to the House.</p><p>Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.</p></speech>

When the Government took office in 2011, it had a clear strategy to restore stability to a country that was on its knees and get people back to work.  Those who have lost their jobs have been hit hardest by the crisis.  Over the course of the crisis, some 330,000 jobs were lost and unemployment reached a peak of 15.1% in 2012.  Getting these people back to work and creating jobs and opportunities for the younger generation is this Government's priority.  That is why a range of important policy measures have been undertaken since the Government took office.  They have provided a solid foundation for a sustainable economic recovery to restore the jobs that were lost.  Significant progress is being made.  Employment growing at its fastest rate since 2007.   Some 61,000 jobs were created in the last year alone.  Unemployment has fallen for 20 months in a row and now stands at 12%.  We must build on this level of job creation.  That is why the Government's medium-term economic strategy sets full employment by 2020 as its stated objective.  This will require the creation of a further 220,000 jobs over the next seven years, a task to which we are firmly committed.</p><p>It is fair to say that there is a growing sense of optimism in the country.  Following another year of growth in 2013, the economic recovery is set to further strengthen this year.  The publication of strong employment figures last week was followed by strong retail sales figures indicating that confidence is returning.  Due to our relatively small domestic market, Ireland's growth model must be export-oriented.  Exporting sectors are continuing to perform well and are supported by continued reductions in our cost base and improvements in the outlook of our main trading partners.  Encouragingly, we are seeing increasing signs of recovery on the domestic side of the economy.  We welcome this development because our strategy, delivered through various budgets and other Government measures, is to spread the economic growth evident in the exporting sector to the domestic sector.   Achieving this reoriented focus is vital as domestic demand is relatively more jobs-intensive.</p><p>The fact that our strategy is working is evidenced by the labour market recovery that is solidly under way.  The release last week of the quarterly national household survey provided further evidence of this.  Some 61,000 jobs were created in the economy over the year to the fourth quarter of 2013.  This represented employment growth of 3.3%.  This is evidence that sectoral policy initiatives pursued by the Government have begun to bear fruit.  It is not often recognised that a sectoral examination of the economy is undertaken in each budget to identify the scope for job creation.  This permits the implementation of targeted measures.  A &euro;500 million pro-jobs package was introduced in budget 2014, with targeted measures for the different sectors of the economy and a particular focus on small and medium-sized enterprises.  I will mention some examples.  Under the jobs initiative, the VAT rate was reduced for the hospitality sector.  The Government continued this measure in budget 2014.  The role of this measure in supporting job creation is clear, given that over 22,000 jobs have been created in the accommodation and food sector since it was launched.  The Government has introduced measures to stimulate increased activity in the construction sector and boost employment.  In budget 2014, the home renovation scheme was introduced, which provides home owners with tax relief on expenditure of up to &euro;30,000, excluding VAT, incurred on repair, renovation or improvement works on a principal private residence.</p><p>Our policies are working.  We have seen three consecutive quarters of annual growth in construction employment.  The start your own business initiative, which was introduced to support entrepreneurs, provides that an unemployed individual who starts a new business will be exempt from income tax on the first &euro;40,000 profits of that business for the first two years.  This initiative will give people a much-needed incentive to start their own businesses and reduce their dependence on welfare payments.  A new capital gains tax incentive has been introduced to incentivise entrepreneurs to invest and reinvest in assets that are used in productive trading activities.  The removal of the air travel tax, the aim of which is to support the labour-intensive tourism industry, will support Irish airlines in their bid to attract an increasing number of passengers to Ireland in 2014.  In direct response to this measure, Ryanair has committed to bringing an additional 1 million passengers to Ireland this year.</p><p>Following research carried out within my Department, I have further enhanced the research and development tax credit scheme by increasing the amount of qualifying expenditure to &euro;300,000.  This recognises the importance of maintaining firms that have invested in research and development here previously.  Supporting research and development increases the long-term potential of the economy and boosts supply-side capacity, thereby securing higher future employment levels.  To support small and medium-sized enterprises, which account for over half of total Irish employment, I introduced a ten-point plan aimed at supporting small and medium-sized enterprises in budget 2013.  Building on these supports, the annual VAT cash receipts basis threshold for small and medium-sized enterprises will increase from &euro;1.25 million to &euro;2 million from May 2014.  In addition, a new subsidised financial training programme for small businesses has been introduced and lending targets to small and medium-sized enterprises have been set to promote lending volumes in support of real economic activity.  Such a sector-by-sector examination of the economy, in addition to the implementation of targeted initiatives to support businesses in these sectors, has considerable potential to generate jobs.</p> <p>We are aiming to diversify the economy and achieve sectoral strength across it so that we will never be so dependent on one sector again.  </p><p>Exiting the EU-IMF programme was a key milestone in Ireland's recovery.  However, it is by no means the end in itself and my colleagues and I in government are determined to build upon the solid foundations that are now in place.  The medium-term economic strategy published in conjunction with the programme exit is the Government's strategy to support growth and job creation.  The strategy sets out the objectives to deliver a deficit below 3% by 2015, to eliminate the deficit by 2018 and to achieve full employment by 2020.  These are ambitious targets but the strategy shows that they are deliverable.</p><p>The strategy is based on three pillars: ensuring debt sustainability; financing growth; and supporting employment and living standards.  I would like to briefly talk about the importance of the work under way on each of these pillars.  The deficit is on a downward trajectory and the debt peaked in 2013.  At just over 120% of GDP, our gross debt levels are higher than the EU average so our strategy is, therefore, to reduce this to a more sustainable level.  The first important step here is to run a primary surplus so that we are not borrowing to fund the day-to-day expenditure of the State.  We will achieve this for the first time this year.  Second, we are working to maximise the value of what we own and offset the value against our gross debt levels.  The policy is that when market conditions and price are right, the Government's intention is to continue to dispose of our banking assets.</p><p>Pillar 2 is financing growth.  It goes without saying that every functioning economy needs an adequate and efficient flow of credit and financing to grow.  In Ireland, SMEs are the backbone of the economy across the country and the banking system must support these companies to grow and create jobs.  Targets are being set for the banks for lending to both SMEs and mortgage customers.  The Government's medium-term economic strategy builds upon the approach we have taken to grow the economy and create jobs.  Through future budgets and action plans for jobs, we will seize sectoral opportunities for growth.</p><p>Let me conclude by saying that things are now going right for Ireland.  Progress to date has been no accident.  Things are going right because we are implementing supportive policies.  We recognise this and we will not be complacent.  Although we have successfully exited the EU-IMF bailout, this does not mean that we will ever allow a return to past practices where expenditure grew to unsustainable levels alongside a tax base that was progressively eroded.  The job is by no way complete and the medium-term economic strategy sets out the plan to reach full employment by 2020, with the Action Plan for Jobs 2014 being another important step towards this.  The success of our approach will be measured against our ability to grow the economy and support business to create jobs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-03-04a.161" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1116" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="17:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014030400028#GG00200"><p>I thank the Minister for his statement to the House.  It is crucially important that we have this debate and that we in the Opposition keep challenging the Government in respect of commitments that were made and progress on those commitments because I am certainly willing to acknowledge progress but I am not willing to join in backslapping and self-congratulation.  The Government is in danger of that from time to time and I do not think that would be in the national interest.  The only congratulations that any party in government needs is a general election and the public will soon tire of self-congratulation.  I have not heard that too much in the Minister's speech but it is a recurring motif of statements from the Taoiseach and Ministers.</p><p>  There are a few areas that are not being properly addressed.  One crucial area is the reform of professions and the sheltered sectors of the economy.  The troika was very clear about this before it left.  The Irish economy is very open and much work on opening it up and allowing for the type of job creation we have was done by the previous Government, which must be acknowledged.  There are not too many sectors of the economy that need to be deregulated but there are some and they are key sectors.  By and large, we are talking about medical and legal professionals.  Little or nothing has been done in respect of them by this Government or indeed by previous Governments.  They have ridden out the troika and come out smiling at the end with nothing happening.  There was a suggestion some time ago in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> that the consultants' contract, which was the one good thing that happened under the previous Government, is not even being enforced by the Government.  Those areas where costs are higher are holding us and the economy back and need to be targeted.  However, they are not being addressed and indeed many commentators have said that.  My fear is that there are still vested interests who have the ear of certain people in the Government.  One particular party in government seems to have made a big play in respect of the legal profession, which is a pity.  </p><p>  The Minister mentioned the sale of State assets in his speech under the title of ensuring debt sustainability.  There was a huge debate a few years ago between the Government and the troika and between the parties in government over how much from the sale of State assets was going into the payment of debt - bringing down the debt is a good thing to do and I support the Minister on that - and how much was going into job creation, as it is called.  I suppose Government spending is the correct way to describe it.  In the Minister's speech today, he mentioned the sale of State assets and stated that he is working to maximise the value of what we own and offset it against our gross debt levels.  The policy states that when market conditions and prices are right, the Government's intention is to continue to dispose of our banking assets.  If there is a programme for job creation coming from the sale of State assets, I would like to know what that plan is because it is not spelt out in the Minister's statement.  That seems to be at odds with much of the commentary that took place over the troika period and various victories that were claimed.  We would say that Bord G&aacute;is was massively undervalued and that there was a keen political impulse to sell it and show that we achieved something.  Its sale was supposed to fund major infrastructural projects such as the national children's hospital, which is not really progressing.  The sale of the national lottery licence is another issue.  </p><p>  Health care is another key issue relating to economic growth and reform.  It is seen across the world as a matter that relates not just to the health of the public but to the growth of the economy.  The market for private health insurance is collapsing.  People are leaving it all the time, which makes it difficult for companies to provide insurance and to pay out when claims are made.  This costs the State more money because it will ultimately pick up the tab for people who cannot pay for their health insurance.  The Government seems to be at sea on this issue.  Again, we know only from media reports that the Minister for Health has presented a White Paper to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform that based on media commentary seems to have been ridiculed by the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.  I suppose the Minister is in a position to let us know what he thinks of it.  Certainly some of the figures that were played out, for example, the figure of &euro;1,600 a year per person for health insurance, would be pretty frightening to most people because at the moment, that would buy one a pretty substantial policy in the private market.  That has been made more difficult and I wonder about the Government's approach to this issue because it has been made more difficult by its changes to tax relief for health insurance.  I must say that when I heard that first, and it was described as affecting only the gold-plated policies, I said to myself that it was a master stroke.  It was a huge amount of money to be saved from the wealthiest but, of course, we found out that this was not the case and that it is really affecting a large proportion of health insurance policies, which is a pity.  It does not show a joined-up approach by Government.  There seems to be a lot of delay on the part of Government in respect of its plans that will affect not only health care but the economy.  </p><p>  The Insolvency Service of Ireland, which we supported, is up and running.  We have concerns about some aspects of it which we put on the record.  Very few cases have been dealt with by the service.  A citizen met with me on Friday who told me that he was considering going bankrupt.  The State fees alone are &euro;1,000 or close to it.  He went to professional advisers and was told that his costs would be &euro;8,000.  I know some organisations are doing it for &euro;3,000 or for free with the State costs.  The point is that it is extremely expensive for someone who wants to avail of bankruptcy or even the lesser options in the insolvency legislation.  That is a pity.    </p> <p>It needs to be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that it is doing the job expected of it.</p><p>I do not know what the plan is in respect of repossessions.  The banks were allowed to repossess properties last summer, since when there has been an avalanche of letters, threats and court dates.  I know one man who is in court next week.  Sustainable solutions have not been put on the table for such people.  This is dreadful for them, their homes and the economy.  It will not help us if people are left in limbo not knowing what they are doing.  In certain estates, there are a number of houses where mortgages are in arrears.  It will create a negative social impact if these houses are emptied out or banks move on them because people have stopped paying their mortgages.  It is not worth paying a mortgage if one is in serious arrears, as the chances are that one's house will be repossessed anyway unless one can come up with substantial amounts every month.  I know people who are paying two thirds of their mortgages per month, yet their banks do not deem that to be sustainable even though employment levels are starting to increase and there are some prospects.</p><p>We support the successes that the Minister outlined.  We are delighted that quite a number of jobs have been created.  However, much more could be done, yet there appear to be blockages in the system in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-03-04a.163" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1160" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="17:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014030400029#HH00200"><p>The Minister is welcome back.  He always gives us the benefit of his time.  I agree with Senator Byrne, in that none of us on this side or the other is here just to blow kisses and backslap.  Any time we can make a positive intervention, it can only be of benefit to many people.</p><p>We have made progress, but many challenges remain.  One of the largest has probably taken up more of the Minister's time than anyone else's, that is, returning the banks to a functional state for a functional sector.  How real are some of the banks' restructuring solutions?  Mr. Boucher stated that the Bank of Ireland did not do write-offs.  In that case, Bank of Ireland will not be in a position to resolve some people's issues.  For some, there must be write-offs.  On the other hand, AIB was the first to come to the table and agree to carry out write-offs under certain circumstances.</p><p>There is good news concerning the NAMA sector and its first cousin, the IBRC liquidator.  Some commentators and politicians claimed that NAMA would exist for 20 or 30 years.  Something similar was claimed about the IBRC liquidator.  Last week saw the sale of the Projects Rock and Salt portfolios for &euro;7.7 billion and the Project Sand sale of a financial instrument involving 13,000 or so mortgages for &euro;1.8 billion.  The latter is a cause for concern, though, as we expect the protection of the State to be available for those 13,000 mortgagors.  When a representative of the Department of Finance addressed our finance committee on this matter, she expressed the Minister's opinion that, if the Central Bank was not in a position to acquire the agreement of bidders for that loan book, the Department would move with legislation.  I support that approach.  This House has sat early and late and would be prepared to do so again to ensure protection for people.</p><p>There are some positives.  Motor sales have increased 8.9% year on year.  This is pushing in the right direction.  According to the Department's figures, &euro;2.1 billion in VAT was accrued in February, representing a 7.1% increase on the same period last year.  This suggests that people are prepared to spend.  In the past, nowhere did people spend more than on property.  There is a concern that some areas of Dublin's property market are heating up too much too quickly, but the drop in prices outside the Pale seems to have concluded.  The natural extension is that property prices will increase.</p><p>Ten of the 14 sectors analysed by the CSO have seen job increases, which is to be welcomed.  Agriculture saw the largest increase, followed closely by the hospitality sector.  The 61,000 new jobs year on year must be welcomed.  Unemployment remains too high at 12.1%, of course.  As the Minister stated, the unemployment rate was 15.1% when the Government took office, but everything is relative and I do not want to beat up the previous Administration.  The current level of 12.1% is too high and the objective is to reduce it further.</p><p>Nothing radical has been done in respect of rates yet, particularly for small to medium-sized enterprises, SMEs.  I do not suppose that the Minister or the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government can do anything about this until local authorities put their own houses in order.  It would be a pointless exercise until the cost of doing business with local authorities was reduced to its absolute minimum.  The Minister has the opportunity to reduce the rate overall.  While a small reduction for the SME sector would not make the difference between their staying in and going out of business, it would have an impact on the &euro;1 billion that is accrued from rates every year.  The largest ratepayer in County Wexford is Tesco.  Its profits are decreasing, but it remains the most cash-rich company.  We do not want to give such businesses a break.  Rather, we should consider something radical in respect of SMEs with three, four or five employees, perhaps a tiered system in which the large multiples paid more and the small units paid less.</p><p>The middle sectors of all societies never get a break.  They pay all of the high taxes.  VAT, employer taxes and income taxes are all at the maximum.  If they increased further, there would only be diminishing returns and a growth in the black market.  They rarely get grant aid of any nature, yet they drive the economy.  The Minister has discussed this matter previously, but if it was possible to give middle Ireland the benefit of tax reductions, we would get the money back.  More people would be hired in the process, creating a loop of employment that would benefit the Government's tax take.</p><p>I wish to touch upon where we are nationally.  Fitch Ratings upgraded us to BBB+.  We face challenges.  This year's deficit is 4.8% of GDP.  We will borrow &euro;10 billion, which will be paid back at some point, perhaps not by us, but by our children or grandchildren.  Our debt to GDP ratio was 124% at its peak.  We anticipate that, as growth in the economy resumes, it will be easier to reduce that ratio.</p><p>Senator Barrett has referred to financial stimuli around the country.  These projects must undergo cost-benefit analyses.  They cannot be the pork barrel projects of the past.  It happened in every jurisdiction.  Whatever money we have, we must ensure that it is well spent and employs the maximum number of people possible.</p><p>Nothing radical has been done in respect of rates yet, particular for small and medium</p> <p>I would like to see that cost benefit analysis done for every stimulus package.  We spoke about the children's hospital.  That must happen but there are other areas in which we are investing to employ people.  The VAT rate reduction was the right thing to do but more analysis must be done to ensure we create more jobs.  We would then be going in the right direction.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-03-04a.165" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="17:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014030400030#JJ00200"><p>I welcome the Minister.  I should congratulate him on his award as Minister for Finance<br />I should congratulate the Minister on being European Finance Minister of 2013.  As the Minister will be aware, in today's <i>Irish Examiner</i>, Oliver Mangan notes that there are 61,000 additional people at work in Ireland, which is a 3.3% increase in total employment, a 3.9% increase in full-time employment, and a 4.5% increase in private sector employment.  Given that the GDP was only up by 0.1% or much less, that shows we have implemented a section in the Minister's contribution, namely, achieving reductions in our cost base.  Those figures explain that.  Economists used to try to explain jobless growth.  Now we almost have growth-less jobs, but we are a small part of a world economy and if we can achieve those reductions in the cost base we get the good results that are evident.</p><p>  There is one problem, however.  Page 6 of the briefing document we got from the Oireachtas service states: <blockquote>Up to 2013, the cumulative decline in youth employment in Ireland was almost 60%.  That represented a drop of over 350 of 7,000 employed youth in the summer of 2007 to 148,000 at the beginning of 2013.  While there has been a modest increase in overall employment figures recently [the 61,000 was welcome] it has not materialised in the youth category.</blockquote>That is something we have to examine.  Employment programmes should get employers involved.  There should be a work element involved also, perhaps involving interning.  In that way we may get a better dividend on those programmes.</p><p>  The big ticket increases in employment have been in accommodation and hospitality, which is up 12.8% since 2011, and the professional, scientific and technical area, which is up 19.7%.  Irish tourism became bad value, and we discussed this with the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, during the boom period.  That area must be continuously monitored.  In some of the surveys Killarney is emerging as the high cost area for tourism bed nights.  If we are only just into a revival in tourism, we cannot neglect offering good value.</p><p>  On the travel tax, the Minister mentioned the extra 1 million passengers promised.  That was a very worthwhile project, and also the lower VAT rates for the sector.</p><p>  In regard to the professional, scientific and technical area, it has been my privilege over some decades to work with young people aged 18 to 22 years.  They are a splendid generation.  If we can organise the economy well in this country they will work here but they will be snapped up in Canada, New Zealand, the United States and the United Kingdom.  We owe it to that generation, therefore, to increase the number of places at second level, as the Minister for Education and Skills is doing, and perhaps at third level because that generation is increasing faster in numbers than we had expected.  The problems in mathematics and foreign languages are being tackled.  The Teaching Council, by having a professional teaching profession, will help to get more trained teachers and fewer untrained teachers in the system.</p><p>  We must keep order in the public finances because disorder made the economy uncompetitive.  Unattractive features included a very high cost construction sector that increased house prices in Ireland more than in any other country in the OECD - we got the unwanted gold, and Spain got the silver; a dysfunctional banking system and a bubble economy; an accountancy profession that signed for these banks; problems in pension funds; problems in credit unions; and problems in insurance.  </p><p>  One of the ways the economy will recover is by having a strong financial reform agenda.  We cannot operate without banks.  We have some Bills on the agenda on that area, and we have had discussions with the Minister's officials but I would opt for an 80% loan to value and two and a half times the income ratio.  We must get banking away from the mad era of massive multiples of people's incomes and massive multiples of the value of the property being loaned.</p><p>  On project appraisal in the public sector mentioned by Senator Michael D'Arcy and Senator Byrne, it is a pity the Comptroller and Auditor General brings his wisdom to bear only after the project has crashed.  We need to do that at the outset.  I would have the project appraisals done first and published for a year, and not published by the promoters of projects.  We will then see if they are good value for money.</p><p>  The Department of Finance is getting back into mainstream economics.  Two of the Minister's officials are reading a paper at the statistical society on Thursday night.  A gap did occur in that regard and it is important that the links between academic economics and the Minister's Department are as strong as they were in the days of Ken Whitaker and Louden Ryan, one of my previous bosses.</p><p>  We need to reform many of the financial services.  I am not satisfied that many of the banks we bought for &euro;64 billion had their accounts validated by senior people in the Irish accountancy profession.  We must tackle that as well as banking reform.</p><p>  Senator Byrne mentioned competition and the sheltered sector.  We had a measure to open up the general practitioners lists, which I believe was done in the early days of the troika.  Some time ago we asked the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy White, if there had been any opening up of those general practice licences and the answer given was &quot;hardly any&quot;.  Fewer than 100 new doctors joined the general medical service.  There was a very interesting section in the relevant legislation which provided that in looking at an application to provide that service, the Government would not take into account first, whether it was financially viable on the person making the application and, second, whether it was financially viable in its effects on other people who did not like the application being accepted.  In a market economy we must keep that emphasis on reducing the cost base and making it competitive.  </p><p>  In 2016, after 84 years of preventing competition in bus services, we deregulate 10% of the market.  That is, it has taken 84 years to get competitive bus services.  The strict regulation of taxis, including ruling out the use of GPS, means we have approximately 5,000 fewer people driving taxis now than when those regulations were introduced in 2009, and that was after the courts had deregulated the business.  We must keep the emphasis on competition.</p><p>  We need much greater quantification of policies.  We must cease to have an economy based on assets.  That is the reason I was happy to second Senator Quinn's motion on upward only rent reviews.  Everybody must be flexible and competitive and to have an interpretation of the Constitution that there is a duty on the courts to defend asset prices when wages, prices and welfare payments were falling does not help competitiveness.  We need to keep an eye on the sheltered sectors mentioned by Senator Byrne.</p><p>  I welcome the recent report on our ports.  People having long leases over wharfage prevents competition in ports because people are secure in their leases for 25 years or, in some cases, as many as 100 years.  That means they can block off the competitors.  We need competitive ports.</p><p>  There are many comments I could make on this area.  We need regulatory impact analysis with legislation.  There was no financial memorandum with the water Bill.  We also need a central office of project evaluation.</p><p>  I ask the Minister not to relent on the reform agenda.  T&uacute;s maith leath na hoibre.  We have a lot to do to make the economy as efficient as the Minister would want it to be in the next two years.  I ask him not to relent to pressure groups who do not like competition because the cost will be borne by very many unemployed young people.  Nobody wants that.  To convert 0.1% GDP growth into 4.5% growth in private sector employment is a major achievement.</p> <p>I compliment all those concerned with it.  However, it is only the start of a task we have inherited from the collapse of banking, accountancy, financial services and pension funds, all of which still need reform.</p></speech>

I know we have all asked for him to attend on a number of occasions.  I was particularly keen to address some of the issues regarding banking and mortgage arrears with him.  However, this is a more general discussion on economic growth and job creation.  While we have certainly seen the headline figures mentioned in the Minister's speech, certain aspects of the programme the Government is pursuing are worth mentioning in terms of their positive developments.  In particular I highlight the changes we have made to the tax code, equalising tax over income tax and capital taxes.  I regard that as a very positive development.  It is also very positive that we have initiated broader forms of tax in order that we will not be so dependent on certain types of taxation.  There are taxes that certain people can avoid by behaving like Cinderella and leaving the country on certain days of the year.</p><p>I do not believe we have done enough to bring the self-employed within social protection and giving them a floor below which they cannot fall.  I have never been a great believer of the ethos of Mr. Charlie McCreevy that people can make a trolley load of money when times are good, but when times are bad that is too bad for them.  I have always believed that the best thing we can do for the self-employed is to give them the kind of security they need to take the kinds of chances they want and need to be able to take for us to have an entrepreneurship economy.  I also feel we have not gone far enough in addressing what I see as a looming pensions crisis, something that will come back to haunt us.</p><p>As the events of the week in Ukraine have shown us, it is clear we are very much a small open economy.  Our recovery is momentous within the context of the economy, but within the context of the wider framework we are very much dependent on the European Union and what happens there.  The Government has been to some extent engaged in crisis management - very effective crisis management.  I give full credit to the Minister, Deputy Noonan, for that.  We now need to look forward and be judged on what we do.  A philosopher or historian once said that one should never waste a good crisis.  For example, in the 1960s Mr. T. K. Whitaker made incredible strides in the Irish economy by moving us in giant steps rather than in small steps.  Politically within Fine Gael, as the Minister knows, the &quot;just society&quot; document was important in moving the Fine Gael Party along a different trajectory in terms of a more equal society.</p><p>It is no longer business as usual.  While we have exited the bailout with top-of-the-class gold stars, the question is where we go from here.  I believe the eyes of the world are on us to see how we move forward and what type of country we build.  Within that, I wish to raise a few issues with the Minister.  The Taoiseach recently responded to a question on the right to housing that had been brought forward in the Convention on the Constitution by saying we needed approximately 30,000 units of housing a year but were producing fewer than 8,000 and it was all heading in the wrong direction.</p><p>As the Minister knows, homelessness is on a very significant upward trajectory, particularly in the Dublin region.  It is not just a Dublin issue, but is emerging in other urban areas, including the Minister's city of Limerick.  This is not just noteworthy because of the social distress it causes.  It is the first time we have seen this type of homelessness emerge because of a lack of affordable housing.  Although we have exited the bailout we are not in a position to stimulate investment in the economy to any great extent as previous governments could, for example in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.  The Minister has said we need a stimulus for the construction sector which at below 6% has fallen well below the level needed in a developed economy such as ours.</p><p>I welcomed the measures the Minister introduced in the budget when I spoke in October and again in January.  I am concerned we are stimulating a construction sector that is, in effect, creating greater demand in the economy without creating more housing, which is a very significant problem.  We need a very significant stimulus package of approximately &euro;1 billion to construct about 6,000 social housing units as a starting point to bring us up to having in the region of 15% of our overall housing stock in social ownership.  If we do not go in that direction, the shortage of housing will be the biggest issue the Government will face in 12 months time.</p><p>We have a major issue with mortgage arrears.  I accept the Government has set targets for the pillar banks.  However, I fear that the worst of this debacle is still to come.  I engage with lending institutions and clients dealing with those institutions every day of the week.  I have a serious concern about the level of repossessions I believe we will see in the next 12 months.  I have always had a very deep concern about the balance of power in the relationship between distressed borrowers and the banking institutions with which they are dealing.</p><p>There is a lack of expert service available to people in mortgage arrears which would allow them to negotiate real and sustainable solutions with their mortgage providers.  I do not believe it is enough to say we have insolvency legislation as if that addresses the issue, because I do not believe it does.  I do not believe people want to or should be forced down the road of insolvency or bankruptcy to solve the problem.  We very much need an expert service to assist people to come to a real resolution to their mortgage arrears.</p><p>I take this opportunity of the Minister being in the House to say there is a major issue with separated people or people who have suffered marital breakdown resolving their mortgage arrears.  If we do not have a change in the legal process covering separated couples or people who were never married in the first place but entered into joint mortgages, we will end up in a very difficult situation.</p><p>I know the Minister has a particular view about the buy-to-let market.  Figures produced at the end of the last quarter of 2013 show that a very significant number of receivers have been appointed to buy-to-let properties.  There is a very significant issue with the treatment of tenants in these properties when receivers are appointed, and the law needs to be changed in this regard.</p><p>I do not believe we will have banking as usual any time soon.  I thought the Minister had made some very positive comments about a third banking force.  I gather I might have misinterpreted them, but I think it will be necessary.  I could see us going back to a position where people would need to lodge their first Holy Communion money with a building society to get a loan.  I do not believe ordinary people will be able to avail any time soon of the kinds of banking services they have been used to for the past 15 or 20 years.  It behoves us as a nation to come up with a solution to that problem.</p><p>While I know this is unpopular with Senator Barrett, I would like us to use the tax code positively to benefit people on the lower end of the spectrum.  We should use the tax code to build housing for people who are less well off and not three bedroom semi-detached houses peppered all over south County Dublin when we know we will have a greater need for housing for single people and we will have an ageing population.</p> <p> I would like us to think really carefully about where we go from here.  I would appreciate it if the Minister came back to us for a specific debate on banking.  We could explore some of the options in the banking sector, not least what happened recently with Irish Nationwide Building Society.  As somebody who worked as a solicitor, I was shocked to discover the lack of contractual protection that was going to be given to those people on the INBS loan book.  I know we have all focused on the MARP and the protections in the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  Nobody has mentioned their vulnerability to mortgage interest increases.</p></speech>

It is good to have him here as always.  I was eight years old when he first became a Minister, and even though we all wish we were in government and so on, his experience and calm, assured approach has been a lucky benefit to this country at this particular time.  Regardless of what might politically divide us, the ambition is the same for both sides of the House.  Not too many people would be able for the job.  Notwithstanding the fact that he is not a Fianna F&aacute;il man, we are lucky that he is here at this time.</p><p>There are certainly relative successes.  We all welcome wholeheartedly the improvement in the employment figures that we have seen.  That has had an impact on our competitiveness.  Emigration has obviously been somewhat of a release valve, but it is too simplistic to say that explains it on its own.  We still have an issue with consumer demand.  To be somewhat political, the Minister presided over difficult decisions to take &euro;10 billion or more out of the economy.  His predecessor had to take out &euro;20 billion.  In the current Minister's own words, his predecessor was an &quot;excellent fiscal manager who got poor advice on banks&quot;.  While I do not accuse the Minister of this, it is frustrating to see the Government and the Taoiseach collecting accolades internationally for work done by Brian Lenihan and the current Minister, and then when returning home, to seek to blame problems exclusively on the actions of the former Minister and some of his colleagues.  There is no question that mistakes were made in the past.  God knows there will never be a member of Fianna F&aacute;il who will not readily acknowledge that or who will forget those mistakes.  Equally, it is only fair to acknowledge the positive contribution made in taking two thirds of the hole from the economy in recent times.</p><p>It is unimaginable to go back to 2005 and predict what we have all gone through.  Of course there were bears in the markets, but there were many more of us from all sides of the House, and from industry and civil society, who could not have predicted the pain, suffering and sacrifice forced on the Irish people over the past number of years.  I do not agree with the head of the European Commission, Mr. Barroso, that there was no European or euro context to this.  He is fundamentally wrong to say that, because there was.  However, as a father, husband and even as a politician, I welcome the exit from the bailout, the projected good fortunes for our economy, the positive ESRI outlook, and television addresses by our nation's leaders.  It sounds great, but what is in it for the people?  While we collect the accolades for being the poster boys for getting it together, there is a huge amount we need to try to do for people.  When will that job arrive?  I know we are making some progress there.  When we will have restoration of appropriate full social supports?  We all have anecdotal evidence of how medical card issues are being dealt with in the era of austerity.  How can we get over the mortgage arrears issue?  When can that daughter, son, niece or brother return from Canada or Australia?</p><p>We need to be very conscious of channelling the gains to the people who need it, and I do not think we have done that.  At times, we have taken the easy option and that will divide us politically.  We have focused far too much on the easier targets rather than on those who could afford it.  Those who have a stronger voice seem to go relatively unmolested in terms of what they could give.  Those earning more than &euro;100,000 could have given more, but we did not ask them.  They were conditioned to give more, but we did not go to them.  Of course they would not have liked it; none of us would like it but they are better placed to shoulder the burden than others who did so.  That is regrettable.  It should not be about those aged over 70 or the respite grants, or some of the harsher cuts we have seen.  Were they really necessary?  I would argue that they were not necessary and that we left certain people aside.  If we have truly turned the corner, we must focus on channelling those savings directly into the pockets of the hard pressed families.  That is best done with the help of transaction taxes, fuel rebates and so on, where people would see an immediate impact.  That will help consumer confidence and consumer spending, which sadly is down 1% yet again.</p><p>When business was being ordered this morning, I did not realise that we only had five minutes to speak on this issue.  That is far too little for this debate and it certainly does not do justice to the good efforts of the Minister or to what we might have been able to add to those efforts in this House.</p></speech>

The Government today published its report on being in office for three years.  If we look back three years, the economy was in a state of collapse, there was a fear that there would be a run on the banks and that we were going to fall off a cliff.  We all remember the headlines and the fear, but three years later, we are not in that position.  Things have stabilised and improved.  There is a confidence that we are on the right track and that we now know where we are going.  Most importantly, we have the headline figures to support that in terms of job creation measures.  Unemployment has fallen in the past 20 months to 12%.  It is still not where it should be, but we have fulfilled targets and we know where we are going in 2015 and 2016.  We have had a successful re-entry to the bond markets.  There have been no increases in income tax and no cuts to the basic social welfare rates.  I remind Senator MacSharry that the weaker sections in society have been protected.  When it came to power, the Government immediately reversed the decision to cut the minimum wage and restored it to its previous level.  We forget about those things three years later, but they were all extremely positive.</p><p>The Minister mentioned the value of the job action plan and how it is focused on particular sectors.  That has been very useful.  We have all seen the construction sector and the way it has been revitalised in the last few months, following the introduction of the home renovation scheme.  It has provided for a lot of activity in that area.  People are benefiting from the scheme and are doing small renovation jobs in their homes which have provided local employment.  Most importantly, it has moved all the activity out of the black market.</p> <p>Builders, painters, carpenters and plumbers who work on small schemes have said it has benefit and there is real activity in that area.  I congratulate the Minister on that initiative and on the retail sector.  The ICT sector is also booming.  I attended a conference on Friday which addressed the skills shortage in this area.  I know that is not the Minister's problem but I am sure he hears about it.  Much is also being done in the education sector and the technology visas are working in that area.</p><p>New supports will be provided in the agriculture and food sector which will be enormous in their effect.  In the tourism sector the retention of the 9% VAT rate is welcome.  Foreign direct investment will continue to be a major platform but the focus is on encouraging individuals to invest in their own businesses to try to create more jobs or to start up programmes.  Recently at the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation we had a presentation on the entrepreneurship report supervised by Mr. Sean O'Sullivan from &quot;Dragons Den&quot;.  The report has identified many areas where people can be encouraged to start their own business.  A strategy is needed right across the education system.  As we do not have a culture of business start-ups, we need to encourage it.  In terms of access to talent the report proposed the improvement of the employee stock ownership programmes to make it easier for companies to involve employees in their programmes and to make it more tax efficient for employees.  It also proposed improved access to finance and incentivised peer to peer lending.  It suggested that the first &euro;10,000 of investment income for start-ups be tax free to establish diaspora supports and that capital gains tax be at the rate of 20% rather than 33%.  As the Government will prepare a strategy at the end of this month I hope it will contain measures to help create jobs.  It is only by helping people to create jobs that we can move forward.</p><p>In the area of competitiveness we have come a long way in improving our competitiveness ranking mainly because of reduced wage costs and public sector reform.  Energy and energy prices will continue to threaten that competitiveness.  There is a need to keep labour costs down.  The introduction of tax relief measures is probably the way forward to keep wages at their present level to ensure the success we have had in that area continues.</p></speech>

I will break from tradition and will not launch any attacks on the Minister or play politics so people might be shocked.</p><p>I am 25 years of age and would have considered myself relatively in touch with young people and would have thought I knew the concerns and the issues of the day.  In recent months I have met many youth groups, youth organisations, people who work with young people and young people themselves and, my God, I live in a bubble.  I can just image what it is like for Oireachtas Members who may not be as young as me.</p><p>In the first page of his contribution the Minister said there is a growing sense of optimism in the country.  From what I have heard in recent months, there is not a sense of optimism, especially among young people.  I am not having a dig at the Minister but I will quote a number of comments I have heard in recent months.  Yesterday, I heard from a 24 year old man in Cork.  He is unemployed and cannot find any work.  He has been on numerous training courses and is leaving for Australia in August.  He said: &quot;We were told in school that you can do whatever you want.  You cannot do this any more.  The dream is gone.&quot;  That is a serious drainer of optimism from the country.  A T&uacute;s worker told me that the first thing people say when being interviewed for schemes is that they are emigrating.  A group of young people, when asked if they would emigrate, said they would.  I asked why they were still here.  They said they cannot get the money to leave but would leave if they could.  I met another gentleman and the gist of what he said was that he wanted to get out of this &quot;effed up&quot; country.  He said: &quot;I would do any job but I cannot get anything.  Some kind of job would be brilliant.&quot;  The same young man who said that the dream is gone said: &quot;At least you can afford to live when you emigrate, you make money and you can live in those countries.  You work hard but you get the benefits.  When I go there I will still be sending money home.  I just want to actually have a life.&quot;</p><p>The reason I mention this is that for many young people I have met, be they in Cork, Donegal, Belfast, Ballinamore and Dublin, they do not have any hope for the future.  They want to get out.  They do not feel there is anything here for them.  That is problematic going forward.  I am aware there has been much talk about recovery.  As people, we are ready for recovery but we have to question what form it will take.  We should not leave any person or family behind and there should not be any generational scars.  In his contribution the Minister mentioned that 61,000 jobs were created in the past year, that there was a fall in unemployment and that full employment is a stated objective by 2020.  What I am hearing from all the young people is that there are no placements and no jobs.  I have been to Gortahork where young people are sitting around and saying there is nothing here for them.  The courses available are not relevant.  I know this is not necessarily the responsibility of the Minister's Department but there is not that hope and they do not feel there are jobs.  I ask the Minister to address young people, not in a papal way - &quot;Young people of Ireland, I love you&quot; - or whatever, but to tell them when the green shoots of recovery are going to trickle down to these young people and what hope can he offer them.  That is the reason I am here, because young people are frustrated about when the recovery will come to them.  Perhaps the Minister would address that issue.</p></speech>

The topic is statements on economic growth and job creation.  There is no doubt the huge strides the Government has made to restore the public finances are incredibly commendable.  However, many people do not feel it.  While the Government is doing it for the country, it appears to be hurting too many people in the process.  It is a shame we do not marry up the public with the personal more.  I know that is the Minister's intention.</p><p>  That the Government is talking about broadening the tax bands is commendable.  My advice would be to slow down with the charges.  To introduce water charges, while it is a structural reform, is a mistake.  People are not feeling the progress the Government is making because there are too many outgoings and too many stealth taxes.</p><p>  On the issue of SMEs, we know that more than half the population is employed by the SME sector, even though that sector has been on the floor.  I am doing some work with SMEs and the biggest issue preventing people from employing more is employer's PRSI.  We must have an actuary out there who can work out the number of people for whom we need not charge employer's PRSI as long as they employ X number of people.  There must be a <i>quid pro quo</i> there.  Those are my two points.  There is much more I could say.  Perhaps I can ask the Leas-Chathaoirleach and the Leader to apportion more time to debates such as this.  I thank the Minister for his time.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-03-04a.181" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1117" speakername="John Gilroy" time="18:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014030400033#MM00800"><p>I had intended to discuss the conditions in the macroeconomy that led to a reduction in the unemployment register.  However, it is not every day we have the opportunity to address directly the Minister for Finance.  I wish to do so in respect of a topic in which I have a particular interest.</p> <p>I propose to take one element and examine it on a micro level.  In the <i>British Medical Journal </i>in 2013, a researcher called Kenneth Hawton examined the impact of recession on health, in particular on mental health, in 54 countries, in Europe and America.  He used suicide as the indicator.</p><p> Other international studies show that 1% increase in unemployment is related to a 0.79% increase in the rate of suicide.  Thankfully, that rate of suicide has not been evident in this country.  However, there are some startling and rather disturbing figures.  In 2011, when this Government came into power, it appeared the unemployment rate would breach the 500,000 mark.  That would have been an appalling disaster for the country.  Happily, the Government managed to turn the situation around and now the number is substantially below 400,000.  </p><p> Let us look at the correlation between the rate of unemployment and the suicide rate in the past couple of years.  The most up-to-date figures are for 2012 as the statistics are two years behind.  In 2006, the unemployment rate was 4.1% and the suicide rate was 10.9%.  It remained stable up to 2008, when the rate of unemployment increased to 6.1% and the suicide rate increased to 11.4%.  There was a noticeable increase in suicide rates when the impact of the recession was felt in the economy.  In 2009, we saw a major increase to 11.6% in the unemployment rate which was matched by a 12.4% rate of suicide.  Some 552 people died by suicide that year.  In 2012, some 554 died by suicide.  The unemployment rate remained just as high.  The recession has consequences.  It really affects people. The figures show it in the most dramatic form.  That is why it is absolutely vital, as the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Finance and other Minister have said, that we focus on a reduction in the unemployment rate.</p><p> A study in Cork in its first report on the Suicide Support and Information System examined 307 cases of suicide between 2008 and 2011.  It showed that 41% of all those who died by suicide had become unemployed in the construction and production sectors.  Lest there be any doubt of a link between the recession and suicide rates, the largest increase in the rate of suicide happened in the age cohorts where unemployment was greatest, that is, in the age cohorts of 15 to 24; 24 to 34; and 35 to 45.  I hope that when the figures for 2013 become available, they will reflect the decrease in the rate of unemployment.  It is important that we draw attention to the suicide rate in the context of the debate on the economy when the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, is in the Chamber.</p><p> I will conclude on that point as I do not have sufficient time to make further points.</p></speech>

I commend him on his work.  As other speakers have said, clearly the Government and Ministers' work has started to bear fruit.  I appreciate Senator Reilly's comments in that regard.</p><p>I do not think anybody thought the economy would recover overnight.  The economy was damaged when the Minister, Deputy Noonan, was appointed to his portfolio.  We are doing quite well, notwithstanding the fact that many in society are not yet experiencing the effects of economic recovery.  The Action Plan for Jobs 2013 was very positive.  It builds on the 500 measures already implemented through the Action Plan for Jobs 2012.  At the recent Fine Gael Ard-Fheis, everything related to jobs was to the forefront.  As Senator Gilroy said, it is the only show in town.  Unemployment, especially youth unemployment, is the central focus at European level.  Youth unemployment is the priority of the Greek Presidency.</p><p>I wish to comment on the hospitality and the construction sectors.  Research by Am&aacute;rach Consulting shows that 30,000 jobs will be created in construction by 2018, bringing total employment to 178,000.  It is still a fraction of the level in the boom, but I do not think anybody would want to go back to the level at that time.  According to a spokesperson for the Construction Industry Federation, their members are now raising concerns about future skills shortages.  Senator Clune alluded to the shortage of electricians and plasterers, which suggests there is a role for the VECs.  I appreciate it is not the Minister's direct responsibility but it is interesting from the point of view of the economy generally.</p><p>Clearly, the hospitality sector is thriving.  The Minister has played his part by creating the 9% rate of VAT for the services sector and maintaining it when asked to do so by the various sectors involved.  Since 2011, more than 23,000 jobs, both full-time and part-time, have been created in the hospitality sector.  As of today, there are apparently 3,000 unfilled positions.  That begs the question of how it is that 3,000 jobs remain unfilled in the hospitality sector.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's comments, although this is an issue for the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>Let me sound a positive note.  Ireland was voted the destination offering the most potential for Chinese travellers at a Shanghai ceremony this morning.  More than 3 million people in China made that decision and Ireland was competing against destinations such as South Africa, Dubai, Turkey and other countries.  This is a real sign of Ireland's potential as a destination as well as the potential of the market in the East.  There is a commitment by Tourism Ireland to build the number of Chinese tourists from 17,000 to 50,000 visitors per year.  We need to be prepared for all the people who want to come to our shores.</p></speech>

I too salute him for all he has done and the progress that has been achieved to date.</p><p>I wish to raise the issue of capital gains tax, CGT.  A company called Storyful sold for &euro;16 million.  It was a wonderful success story and very good for the Government because Storyful created 40 jobs.  It paid &euro;6 million in capital gains tax.  One of the investors in that company said he would not take that risk again.  It is a significant risk to invest in an enterprise as one is employing people and taking on all the work that comes with it.  That investor said that in the future he would invest in property as it is a much easier game.  The Minister gave entrepreneurs a boost in budget 2014 by changes in CGT, allowing companies to offset the profit from a sale of a company if it is reinvested in a company designed to create jobs.  As an entrepreneur, but probably not full of brain cells, I found the measure very convoluted and desperately complicated.  I still think I would prefer to invest my money in a house or building.</p> <p>I did not feel that it was an incentive.  As far as I am concerned it is a delaying tactic for paying capital gains tax because one does not have to pay CGT now if one re-invests.  However, we all know that if one invests in ten companies that five will fail which is the law of average in business.</p><p>Irish people want to be creative.  We talk about entrepreneurship in ourselves or our young people all of the time whether that in schools or here in Leinster House.  I do not think it is fair for someone who invests in property to receive the same CGT rate as a person who invests in business and creates jobs.  Perhaps the Minister thinks that it is good to give an entrepreneur an incentive for creating ten jobs.  For example, he will get &quot;X&quot; percent off his CGT eventually, more tax relief if he creates 20 jobs while the relief will increase on a sliding scale with further job creation.  I have spoken to many entrepreneurs who wonder what is the point in their investing.  What does the IDA say to potential investors when they can go to the Netherlands which has no CGT?  Since 2008, capital gains tax here has increased by 65% over four tranches, from 20% to 33%.</p><p>I hope that the Minister will say in his reply that we can do something about this matter, particularly for people who want to start businesses and create jobs.  We might lose a little in CGT rates and tax receipts for the Government but we will get many more people into jobs who in turn will pay income tax.  Such an initiative would lead to much happier citizens and, hopefully, the same for some of the young people that I am very worried about.  Senator Reilly spoke about people who live in rural Ireland.  We can sit here and clap ourselves on the board but she talked a great reality for us this evening. </p></speech>

However, I shall commence by saying that strong retail sales figures are a major indicator that confidence is returning.  People are starting to spend and exports continue to increase and are performing well.</p><p>The Minister introduced a &euro;500 million pro jobs package in budget 2014 which so far has been a great success, with particular focus on SMEs.  The hospitality sector has had a reduction in VAT.  That was the Minister's initiative as it was he who introduced it in 2013 and continued it in 2014.  The initiative has been a great success and I ask him to consider retaining 9% VAT in the next budget.</p><p>The removal of the air travel tax will support Irish airlines in their bid to attract an increasing number of visitors to Ireland this year.  As a result of the Minister's initiative, Ryanair hopes to bring in an additional 1 million passengers to Ireland this year which will greatly enhance tourism figures for the coming year.  I am told that every 15 visitors to Ireland creates one additional job.  That means we now have a major opportunity to create jobs and I anticipate a significant reduction in the number of people out of work this year.  </p><p>It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge - this is my personal opinion - the part that the Minister has played in bringing the country back to sustainability, stability and getting people back to work.  He does not get the recognition that he deserves. </p></speech>

It is always good to come to the Seanad.  It is very nice to hear people speak sincerely and address the problems without grandstanding.  I have found that people speak from the heart more often in the Seanad than in the D&aacute;il.  It is impossible sitting here to distinguish the political label that attaches to party members because Senators share the same concerns.</p><p>There is another common factor that goes with the nature of the work that we do.  One meets so many people in constituency clinics and one comes across so many problems in the course of a week that they tend to make the individual problem the general proposition.  Therefore, it moves from the individual to the general and very often, I respectfully suggest, the generality of taxpayers can be forgotten.  Nobody speaks for the generality of taxpayers because everybody speaks for some individual or group of people who are finding things very hard.  That is not to say that I disagree with a lot of what has been said here this evening.  How much time do I have?</p></speech>

The people who suffered after that were the families who lost their sons and daughters to emigration so the emigrants and their families have suffered.  Let us look at both of those categories when considering priorities.  That is the reason the Government is putting jobs first and foremost and says that the test is we have to create a lot of jobs because that is where people are hurting the most. </p><p>As Senators will know, the situation was very bad, businesses went bust, property prices declined, the banks went bust, hundreds of thousands lost their jobs, and others emigrated so we have a long way back to come.  We are out of the bailout but we have a huge amount of work to do yet.  I would hate if any kind of feeling emerged that because we were out of the bailout that we had succeeded or that we can fly without a map from now on.  We cannot.  We published a strategic economic plan immediately after the bailout but it got lost in all of the Christmas festivities.</p><p>There is a strategic economic plan for the medium term which the Government is now pursuing that is built on three pillars.  First, to control and reduce the debt and continue to make it more sustainable.  Making debt more sustainable means that the people who lent to us are sure that they will be paid back.  That is all that means but one must get it into that position.  </p><p>Second, we need credit to drive a growing economy and that means that banks and all of the things that we will do to the banks, including alternative banks, credit unions and so on.  We must also go for non-bank credit.  Let us look at the fact that 75% of credit used by the United States model comes from sources other than banks.  We have started that initiative here now.  We have the Silicon Valley Bank and it is giving equity to people.  We have the Chinese.  We have CIC, the big Chinese investment fund, which works in partnership with our investment and has another &euro;100 million.  The European Investment Bank came in last year and invested &euro;1.2 billion.  We have a number of private funds who are investing in industry.  We have to develop all of that side of things.  We must even develop the Irish Stock Exchange so that people can raise money on the stock exchange.  We need investment funds and working capital.  Some can come through the banks but a lot of the investment funds must come from sources other than the banks.  Therefore, we must work on the sector.  </p><p>The third pillar of the medium term economic strategy is to continue to grow the economy.  As I have often said to Senators before, the economy can be very complicated if one looks at it in its totality but if one breaks it down into sectors one can understand it very easily.  Let me give some examples.  The tourism industry was banjaxed so we reduced the VAT rate from 13.5% to 9%, we are abolishing the travel tax, we are getting the cost base down, we organised The Gathering and suddenly we have one vital sector moving again.  </p><p>In the agriculture sector there will be no milk quota after 2015.  The big tax job that I must do for the sector is to reduce the cost of transferring land to the next generation.  Therefore, I cut the stamp duty in order that the next generation of young farmers can take over.</p> <p>We will never build an industry on the elderly.  It is the dynamism, energy and imagination of youth that is going to drive that industry.  They are well on their way.  Any of the Senators who have a knowledge of rural Ireland knows the way farming is gearing up at present, so that is another sector.</p><p>Foreign direct investment is very important, and Members know what attracts people to Ireland.  There was a record year in 2012 and another in 2013, and the pipeline for foreign direct investment is going very strongly this year.  We have reinforced the financial services aspect of that.  Even though there were 12,000 to 15,000 redundancies across the banking system, there are more people employed now in the financial industry in Ireland, particularly in Dublin, than there were before the crisis hit and the redundancies came into the banks.</p><p>The strategy in the sectors is simple.  It is to repair the damaged sectors of the economy and to build on them.  The most damaged one of all was construction and development, as a number of speakers have pointed out.  Not only did it get damaged and hundreds of thousands of people lost their jobs, but it became the scapegoat sector, along with the banking sector.  It was very hard to do anything for the construction industry initially because the normal comment on the street was to ask, &quot;Why are you helping that crowd of chancers?&quot;  It became a scapegoat sector, yet every other OECD country has a very strong, dynamic construction and development sector.  We cannot get on without it because we need factories, houses and office blocks.  It is now coming back again and property prices are coming back again too.</p><p>Very often, the rules of the market are very simple.  If the price of something is below the replacement cost, nothing happens.  If the price of a house is below the building cost of a house, no houses are built.  If the price of an office block is below the cost of replacing it, nothing gets built.  For commercial property, if the rental income cannot service the borrowing and give a small profit, nothing gets built.  It is now back at a point, particularly in Dublin, where commercial property is moving again.  We see the cranes beginning to emerge on the skyline, and we will see a lot more of them between now and the summer.</p><p>Of course, the Senators are right that there is now a supply-side problem with housing.  If we were talking here a year ago, however, the Senators would all have been telling me about the ghost estates and all the houses that cannot be sold, and they would have asked me what I was doing about the overhang in the market.  It is amazing how quickly things switch around.</p><p>Youth unemployment is something I would seriously like to address and we need help from abroad for that.  There are approximately 12 million young people unemployed in Europe.  The statistic does not tell the full story, however, because the way it is calculated is as a percentage of the young people who are available for work.  Therefore, it excludes those in universities and third level education, which is a refined way of addressing it.  If we take it there is 25% unemployment among young people in Ireland, but that 60% or more are at third level, we are looking at an unemployment rate among the young not of 25% of 100%, but of 25% of 40%.  Therefore, we are actually looking at a 10% rate of unemployment among the youth in Ireland, whereas it is the other figure that is used across Europe.  The same is true when we see a figure such as that 40% of young people are unemployed in Spain.  That is 40% of people who are not in third level education or in schools and colleges, whereas we get a better view if we do it the other way.</p><p>That is not to say it is not a big problem.  Of course, it also then tends to be a problem of the less well educated and the less skilled.  That is why the Senators' experience of young people is quite correct, because the cohort and the individuals they are talking about tend not to be the people who were lucky enough to get third level education.  There is no doubt there are many very down and out young people who are depressed.  On the other hand, that is not the full picture.  If Senators leave the House this evening and walk a mile in any direction, even though it is early in the week, when they go into their favourite pub, they will find a lot of young people inside quite optimistic and quite happy, and this is even more the case on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights.</p><p>There are still 1.9 million people at work in Ireland.  I remember that when the recession came during the 1980s, employment went below 1 million and approximately 960,000 people were at work.  It is double that now, which makes a huge difference.  That is another theme I would like to develop.  Nonetheless, we certainly need to have a European scheme as well as national schemes to put young people back to work.  The scheme that says everybody is entitled to either a job, training or education, which is enunciated in Europe, is a great scheme, but they never put the budget under it to deliver it, so that is one of the priorities we would have in Europe.</p><p>Senator Darragh O'Brien asked about capital gains tax, which has increased very significantly.  The reason I put it up last was that there is hardly any capital gains coming into the Exchequer now but I want to position it so that, when the economy grows again, we will get a return on capital gains.  I want to quickly erode the accumulated losses of the tax code because, if there is a low rate, no one will pay capital gains tax for the next generation.  However, by raising the rate, that cuts into the carried forward losses, and we can work our way down through that.  However, none of these rates and taxes are fixed.  We have to review everything constantly.  I take the Senator's point that nobody would invest in property in recent years because it was a declining asset but many people now want to invest in property again.  Investment is risk all the time.</p><p>I would agree with Senator Gilroy about the connection between the recession and suicide.  It is not particularly a case of unemployment and suicide and is more a case of the recession and suicide.  We have all heard of people whose business went bust who committed suicide.  They had enough but it was the whole sense of failure, and was not directly due to being unemployed.</p><p>Senator Barrett referred to youth unemployment and Senator D'Arcy raised the issue of IBRC mortgage holders and so on.  The IBRC problem is straightforward enough.  The loan books are being sold to people who have given a commitment that they will honour the protocols from the Central Bank.  I believe they will because it is in their interest to do so.  The courts will not give them repossession orders, if that was what they were looking for, unless they have honoured the protocols.  We have seen that with the people who have already acquired mortgage books in this jurisdiction, namely, when they went to court, they could not get anywhere.</p><p>In any case, the people who buy mortgage books are trying to make money; they do not want repossess houses.  They are in a much better position to do deals with people who hold mortgages than the original holders of the books.  Typically, if one buys a mortgage book at a 30% discount, one has that 30% to restructure loans and to clean up the book.  That is what they do.  They clean up the book by using part of the discount to get people back paying again and then they resell the book.  It is not as dire as it looks and it is one way of solving the problem.</p><p>If I have to legislate, I will legislate, but I could not legislate while the sales were going on because the risk was that I would take down the value of the mortgage books by adding additional conditions, and I would be subject to legal challenge by other creditors, particularly unsecured creditors.  However, it changes when they go into new hands, and if I need to do so, I will do so.</p><p>Senator Byrne referred to the reform of the professions.  The justice Bill on the legal profession is winding its way through.  It has gone through Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il and it should be coming to the Seanad very shortly.  The Senator spoke about the sale of State assets.  In my speech, I was talking particularly about bank shares.  As the bank shares are sold, the proceeds will be put back into the investment fund and will be there either for further investment or reducing the debt.</p><p>Senator Hayden referred to a general reform of the tax code, which is very important.</p> <p>Protection of the self-employed and pension reform are other priority issues, and the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, is doing a great deal of work in those areas.  Mortgage arrears were also mentioned.</p><p>Senator Sean D. Barrett talked about youth unemployment and referred to a very low-growth economy generating a large number of jobs.  There is something wrong in the statistics in that the patent cliff has artificially reduced GDP figures, which makes life more difficult for me.  The pharmaceuticals sector accounts for some 5% of GDP and employs 25,000 people.  Several medicines went off patent in 2013 - Lipitor was one of the most prominent - which had an impact for the companies that manufacture them.  Nevertheless, output remains the same from these companies and there are still 25,000 people employed in the sector.  The issue has, however, affected GDP and growth figures.  In other words, GDP does not reflect the growth that is taking place in the economy.  We are not dealing with growthless job creation here; it is just that the growth is disguised.  I hope that situation will right itself as we work through 2014 and 2015, although there are more well known drugs due to come off patent this year and next.</p><p>I thank Senator Marc MacSharry for his complimentary remarks.  I also thank Senator Deirdre Clune, who set out a whole agenda.  The House will forgive me for wishing Senator Clune every success in the European elections.  It is a shameless political plug.</p></speech>

I will not go into too much detail on this issue as I have already supplied it to the Minister.  In my home town of Bantry, social welfare services are operating out of four buildings in different parts of the town.  This is most inconvenient for staff and for users of the services.  Where sensitive documents have to be transferred from one part of the town to another, it has to be done either by hiring a taxi or a courier.  When I was in the other House between 2002 and 2007, it was proposed that a one-stop shop be established in Bantry for all of these services.  I accept that the economic climate has changed, but surely something can be done, perhaps by way a short or medium-term lease or a new build, to resolve the logistical and practical difficulties the public is facing in the greater Bantry area.  Unfortunately, in these difficult times, significant numbers of people are obliged to avail of these particular services.</p></speech>

I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes.  I am pleased to have an opportunity to brief the House on the plans by the Department of Social Protection to integrate its services in Bantry, to which end it will be working closely with the Office of Public Works.</p><p>The OPW's role in assisting the Department to deliver this programme is to provide appropriate, modern and efficient accommodation that meets the Department's business requirements and allows it to deliver services to customers efficiently and effectively.  The new integrated service will be delivered primarily through the new Intreo offices, but also by way of consolidating services in a number of towns, such as Bantry, where traditional signing services are provided under contract by a branch office, rather than a local office, and where other services such as community welfare and employment services operate from separate locations.  The Department is also examining the role of branch offices with regard to job activation.</p><p>The Government has set ambitious targets to deliver the Intreo programme in 63 locations by the end of 2014.  Wherever possible, the OPW has been working within the existing portfolio of owned and leased buildings to modify those buildings to meet the requirements of the Department of Social Protection.  In some cases, it has been necessary to lease and fit out new accommodation to achieve that target.  This programme of works represents a very significant investment in terms of both funding by the Government and the allocation of administrative, architectural and technical resources by the OPW.  To date, 43 new Intreo offices have been opened and are fully operational.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, attended the official opening by An Taoiseach of a most impressive new office in Castlebar on 21 February, and he and his officials and remain firmly focused on delivering the rest of the programme by the end of 2014.</p><p>The Minister of State's officials are working with their colleagues in the Department of Social Protection to develop a programme, in so far as it is possible in the short term, to integrate services in towns such as Bantry, where there is a branch office.  This will likely result in a multi-annual programme of works for the OPW.  There may be contractual issues to address in regard to branch offices, which are a matter for the Minister for Social Protection, as well as other practical accommodation issues to be addressed.  It is a feature of the model of integrated services developed by the Department that the public-facing side of operations such as waiting areas, serving hatches, interview rooms and group engagement rooms are significantly larger when compared with traditional local social welfare offices.  This is a welcome development, but it creates its own challenges.  In some locations, particularly smaller regional towns, the size of existing office accommodation required to deliver the range of consolidated services may not be available at all, or may be in a less central and readily accessible location.  Where these larger offices do exist, they tend to be in retail or industrial parks on the edge of towns, which can make access for those dependent on public transport more difficult.</p><p>Another issue is that there may be several years left to run on existing leased accommodation.  In such cases, the OPW and the Department will try to balance the aim of consolidating services with the desire to avoid paying rent on premises that would be vacated prematurely if all services were consolidated in one location.  This is particularly relevant where there is no alternative requirement for the accommodation that would be vacated.  In circumstances such as these, the strategy may be to deliver services from two locations initially, with a view to further consolidation over a longer period of time.  These types of considerations, together with the underlying demand for services in the various towns, will feed into the prioritisation of individual projects within the developing programme.</p><p>The consolidation of services in Bantry is likely to be assigned a high priority and, as such, I expect progress to be made there this year.  The Senator has outlined the particular circumstances that exist in Bantry, where, in addition to the branch office on Bridge Street which is operated under contract by a third party, the staff of the Department of Social Protection deliver services from four other locations around the town.  It is unfortunate, however, that none of the existing OPW-leased properties in Bantry is big enough to support an integrated operation.  I am conscious of the Department's desire to consolidate services, as set out in the revised brief of its requirements for Bantry which it forwarded recently to the OPW.</p> <p>The Department recently forwarded a revised brief of its requirements for Bantry to the OPW.  This brief informs the search for and assessment of appropriate accommodation.  A search for viable accommodation is under way and officials from the OPW and the Department recently inspected a number of potential properties in Bantry.  Initial technical assessments of potentially viable candidate buildings is due to commence shortly.  This search process is, however, ongoing so if the Senator is aware of potentially suitable premises, he should inform the Department or the Minister of their existence.</p></speech>

Like him, I am interested in ensuring the continued integrity of the Irish beef industry.  I am also interested in providing assurance to farmers that their efforts and hard work are being rewarded.  It is in this light that I raise the matter before the House.</p><p>Last year, representatives from the Polish veterinary authorities visited Ireland at the invitation of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I understand they were invited but I do not know if that was the case and I stand open to correction by the Minister of State.  In any event, they came as a result of the horsemeat scandal and on foot of allegations that a certain amount of product had been sourced in Poland.  They took that matter very seriously and travelled here to investigate.  They visited Silvercrest Foods and requested that various pallets of meat be unloaded in order that they could examine them.  They took some photographs of the meat in question - I am sure the Minister of State is familiar with them - and included them in their report, which was recently made public.  The photographs to which I refer are extremely disturbing.  They suggested that some of the meat was old, rotten, dry and either green or brown in colour.  Some of the meat was also red, so it appeared to the representatives from Poland that horsemeat had been mixed with the meat.  This was not done in order to replace beef, which was what we first understood to have happened, but perhaps to cover up the use of what was very poor-quality meat in the first instance.  Within the industry this meat is deemed to be category 3 animal by-product.  In other words, it is substandard meat.</p><p>The veterinary inspectors from Poland observed what I have just outlined between 12 and 15 February 2013.  I presume they met and were accompanied by officials from the Department during their visit.  Again, I would welcome clarification from the Minister of State on this matter.  The issue I have raised here this evening relates to the report compiled by the departmental officials who accompanied the Polish veterinary inspectors.  I presume those officials would also have been alarmed by what they saw.  It has been reported that the Polish veterinary inspectors were given an assurance by the officials who were present that the pallet of meat that was opened for inspection had not been opened previously.  In other words, it was disassembled at the behest of our Polish visitors.  The pallet had not been defrosted previously and no one knew what it contained until the packaging was removed.  The Polish veterinary inspectors are very concerned with regard to what is shown in the photographs they took.</p><p>I do not know what happened which allowed the meat in the relevant freezer lorry to deteriorate, as is suggested by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The Department's version of events is that the meat deteriorated because it had been loaded onto and taken back out of the truck several times, tampered with, drilled into, etc.  I am not a specialist in how food is frozen, rather I am a food scientist.  However, the specialists have said that if the temperature in the truck was incorrect, all of the meat would have been putrid.  They also stated that it ought to have been properly kept in the truck.  I am sure there are procedures for detaining meat that is under question.  Perhaps the Minister of State knows what are the relevant regulations in this regard.  If so, perhaps he might share them with me.</p><p>A number of matters of concern arise in respect of this matter.  For example, there were 22 pallets in the truck to begin with but there were only eight when the representatives from the Polish authorities carried out their inspection.  Where did the other pallets go?  We have been given an assurance to the effect that meat from the truck did not enter the food chain but I am struggling with that.  I am extremely concerned that the meat did enter the food chain, particularly as meat from the truck had never been examined until the Polish veterinary inspectors made their visit.  In their report, the inspectors state that the labels which were claimed to be Polish had either been reused, photocopied or faked.  As far as I understand it, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has indicated that this is the Polish authorities' problem.  I would have thought it is our problem.  If labels were faked in our jurisdiction, then perhaps they are our responsibility.</p><p>People have expressed their concerns about this matter to me.  They want to know if it could happen again and what are the implications for the industry.  In the interests of ensuring the integrity of the industry, I would welcome it if the Minister of State could clarify the position.</p></speech>

That investigation was carried out by the Department's veterinary inspectors, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, and the Garda National Bureau of Fraud Investigation.  It was initiated as a result of initial findings from a food authenticity survey by the FSAI.  The matter was brought to the attention of the EU authorities and information arising from the investigation was shared with the authorities in a number of other member states.  The report was clear and unambiguous.  The Irish authorities highlighted unacceptable practices along the supply chain, including the presence of horse DNA in meat which was labelled as being of Polish origin.  This problem involved long and complex supply chains and was international in nature.</p><p>In the context of the references to meat from Silvercrest Foods made in the subsequent report compiled by the Polish chief veterinary officer, it should be understood that this material was detained and removed from the food chain once positive DNA samples were received on 25 and 28 January 2013, almost three weeks before the Polish inspectors arrived in Silvercrest on 13 February 2013.  During their visit, the Polish inspectors were accompanied by departmental officials and representatives from both Silvercrest and Food Services Poland.  The pallets in question, which contained frozen blocks of meat pieces, had already been removed from storage, manipulated and sampled by the Irish authorities on more than one occasion.  Such manipulation involved the removal of wrapping and labels, the partial disassembly of pallets and some drilling and sampling of the frozen blocks of meat.  This would have lead to deterioration in the quality and appearance of the meat.  Once the meat had been detained, there was never a question of it entering the food chain and, therefore, there was no requirement to store it in conditions or to a standard required of food grade material.  Seven of these pallets remain under official detention and one has been destroyed.</p><p>My Department, the HSE and the FSAI have jurisdiction in relation to labelling and mislabelling issues in Ireland.  Rules on the labelling of meat and meat products are laid down in EU legislation.  For beef, the current rules require compulsory origin labelling, with place of birth, rearing and slaughter specified.  In the context of the European Union Single Market, trade between member states in beef is, of course, permitted but mandatory country-of-origin labelling rules apply.  In this regard audits of imported products are carried out in meat plants approved by my Department.</p> <p>Such audits include physical identity, labelling and documentary checks and cover products originating both in EU member states and third countries.  In addition, labelling and documentary checks form part of the routine checks conducted by officials from my Department.</p><p>Checks are also conducted by the local district veterinary offices in smaller meat plants and by the HSE at retail level, working under the aegis of the FSAI which has an overarching supervisory role in relation to labelling matters.</p><p>The conclusion of the Polish report indicates that there is a doubt about the participation of Polish companies in potential adulteration of beef with horse meat and that there is no concrete evidence that beef was replaced with horse meat in Polish plants.  It does not indicate where mislabelling may have occurred.</p><p>My Department is not in a position to comment on the findings of the Polish investigation relating to the origin of the labels on meat labelled as having been supplied from Poland.  If mislabelling occurred en route to Ireland, then that is a matter for the Polish authorities or the authorities in the jurisdiction or jurisdictions where it occurred in the first instance.  When allegations are made in respect of the placing of meat which is mislabelled in the Irish market, my Department investigates the matter thoroughly and takes the appropriate action. </p></speech>
