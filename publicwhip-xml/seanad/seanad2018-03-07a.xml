From made-up figures to the smear campaign against whistleblowers, it is frankly becoming an issue that even the Government cannot spin its way out of.  Crime is rampant and people are suffering, including the ordinary garda on the street.  It is within that context that I have asked for the Minister to be present and to comment on the shocking cut of 136 garda&iacute; in my area of Dublin South-Central.</p> <p>I will start with some information I collected from a constituency-wide survey I carried out last year.  When asked what was the biggest issue for the area, 20% of people said anti-social behaviour.  Crime, dumping, drugs, gangland activity and murder accounted for 36% of answers.  There is no doubt those issues have not been dealt with because of the lack of garda&iacute;.  When asked what people would change about the area, one constituent referred to anti-social behaviour and a lack of Garda presence.</p> <p>The nitty-gritty of the cuts the Minister has imposed on Dublin South-Central are as follows.  Kevin Street station has lost a massive 52 garda&iacute; in the past seven years.  Crumlin and Sundrive Road stations have lost 24 garda&iacute; over the past seven years, and the number of garda&iacute; in Ballyfermot station has reduced to 16.  Last year the acting Garda Commissioner said that Ballyfermot would be one of the areas where a new Garda station would be opened rather than the suspect decision to reopen Stepaside Garda station.  What possible justification is there for such cuts?  There simply is not one.  Saving money to spend on a Government spin unit is not of equal worth to the safety and security of people.</p> <p>The details of the cuts to the number of garda&iacute; is as follows.  Dublin South-Central has lost 31 Garda sergeants since 2010.  A newspaper ran a story only last week about the predicted crisis nationally from the delay in recruiting new Garda sergeants.  Why should that be imposed on the people of Dublin South-Central?  What about community garda&iacute;?  Nationally, the number of community garda&iacute; in the force has fallen from 1,112 in 2010 to only 691 in 2017, a decrease of 38%.  That shows the Government has no interest in investing in community policing although that is the future.  Community garda&iacute; are at the front line in tackling anti-social behaviour and creating good community relations.  Having community garda&iacute; can be transformative for communities.  A good community garda can make connections, build relationships and work with the people in a community.  In spite of that, Dublin South-Central went from having 99 community garda&iacute; in 2011 to only 30 last year.  That  is a significant drop and the community is paying for it.</p> <p>The effect of the drastic lack of numbers means garda&iacute; experience fear on the streets.  It is dangerous for the force not to know whether backup is needed in dangerous situations.  Sinn F&eacute;in submitted a comprehensive document on the future of policing last month.  I wonder whether the Minister read it.  In it, we made more than 50 recommendations for the reform of policing.  Those included reversing cuts to community garda&iacute;, but there were also measures to strengthen accountability and protect whistleblowers.  I urge the Minister to read it if he has not already done so.</p></speech>

As Minister for Justice and Equality, I have no direct role in the matter.  I am informed by the acting Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors, including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda division, including the Dublin metropolitan region, south-central division, with a view to providing an effective and responsive police service.</p> <p>I am further informed by the acting Garda Commissioner that the overall strength of the DMR, south-central division, as of the 31 January 2018 was 612.  When appropriate, the work of local garda&iacute; in the south-central division is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the armed support unit, the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p> <p>Senators will be aware that the closure of the Garda College in Templemore in 2010 and the moratorium imposed at that time had a negative impact on Garda numbers across the country in all divisions.  Since the Government reopened the college in Templemore in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties across the country.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charles Flanagan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Of those, 719, or 45%, have been assigned to Dublin, of whom 141 have been assigned to the south-central division.</p><p>Senators will appreciate that the challenges presented by gangland crime in the Dublin area have necessitated additional investment in the specialist units to enhance their capacity to support the fight against this scourge.  I am advised by the acting Garda Commissioner that extra garda&iacute; have been assigned to the specialist units over recent months, including the drugs and organised crime bureau, which is particularly active in the fight against organised crime in the Dublin region.  In addition, a dedicated armed support unit for the Dublin metropolitan region, DMR, was established at the end of 2016 to enhance armed support capability in Dublin and free up the resources of the emergency response unit.  I understand that the allocation of resources to these units has affected disproportionately the number of divisional garda&iacute; in the Dublin region.  This will be one of the factors taken into account by the acting Commissioner when considering the allocation of new Garda recruits.  I am pleased to say that 200 new garda&iacute; will pass out of the Garda College next week and be assigned to locations around the country, with a particular focus on the Dublin region.</p><p>I assure the House that the Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country, including on the streets of our capital city, to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, including 15,000 Garda members.  Real and tangible progress has been made towards this goal.  Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017, a net increase of more than 600 since the end of 2016.  I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce.  This year, a further 800 new Garda recruits will enter the Garda College in Templemore, with 200 having already entered since 29 January.  In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, with 200 due to attest next week.  Taking account of projected retirements, Garda numbers are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of this year.  Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities, enhance visibility within our communities and enable the acting Commissioner to provide additional resources across the DMR, including the south-central division, as new Garda recruits come on stream.</p></speech>

As an elected Deputy and someone who has been appointed to the position of Minister for Justice and Equality, though, surely he should take a more hands-on approach to the root-and-branch reform of the Garda, especially given the scandals.  He needs to have a more direct role.  We have seen the skewed and inappropriate behaviour at some levels within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Perhaps the Minister should have more of a guiding input into how the reform is undertaken.  It is doubtful that the scandals of last year can be put to bed at this stage, but I call on the Minister to be more proactive with the Garda after the necessary root-and-branch reform.  In the meantime, we need to invest in the Garda in Dublin South-Central, which has increased in terms of its population and, unfortunately, crime levels.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-03-07a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018030700002#C00300"><p>"Hands on" one day is "political interference" the next.  I assure the House that the Government's focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of the Garda.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the acting Commissioner with the appropriate level of resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of garda&iacute; across divisions, including the south-central division.  In addition to the Government's plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000, the investment in personnel is complemented by a substantial investment in resources across the board.  A total budget of &euro;1.65 billion has been provided to the Garda this year, an increase of 2% on 2017.  Some &euro;98.5 million has been provided for Garda overtime this year, representing an increase of &euro;10 million on 2017's initial allocation.  It should be noted that the Garda allocation continues to benefit from the significant additional funding that was provided in 2016 and maintained in 2017 to fund a sustained response to gangland crime and the continuation of Operation Thor and measures to prevent international terrorism.</p> <p>Some &euro;342 million, including &euro;217 million in additional funding under the capital plan, is being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021.  This investment will continue under my watch and facilitate the provision of more effective policing services.  I expect that the south-central division, like all other Garda divisions, will continue to benefit from the new resources that are now becoming available.</p></speech>

I warmly welcome the Minister of State with responsibility for local government and electoral reform, Deputy Phelan.  To get to the kernel of this Commencement matter, there has been media coverage in recent days relating to the proposal or suggestion of an elected executive mayor for the Dublin area, including the commuter belt towns of Kildare, Wicklow and Meath.  That this has been reported is not to say it is fact, but it was published in the media.  There was also the suggestion of a directly elected executive mayor for Cork city and county.  Will the Minister of State outline the facts of this case?</p> <p>I wish to hone in on the question of devolving powers.  It is a great idea, but from whom are we taking those powers and to whom are we giving them?  With devolved power comes devolved responsibility.  Who are we taking responsibility from and to whom are we giving it?  With devolved power comes funding, with the implications of that for the local property tax and commercial rates.  Who are we taking the funding from and to whom are we giving it?  To whom will these people be accountable?</p> <p>I would appreciate it if the Minister of State shared with us his vision in this regard, throw some light on the facts and tell us how the Government intends, if it intends at all, to proceed with having elected mayors.  Will they be figureheads of executive elected mayors?  There is a subtle but important difference.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-03-07a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1265" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018030700002#C00800"><p>I apologise for being late.  Traffic on the Naas Road is unpredictable at the best of times and chaotic at the worst.</p> <p>I thank Senator Boyhan for raising this matter.  A Programme for a Partnership Government sets out a number of requirements in terms of local government reform, some of which we have discussed previously.  In particular, it envisages the submission of a report to the Government and the Oireachtas on potential measures to boost local government leadership and accountability, and to ensure that local government funding, structures and responsibilities strengthen local democracy, all of the issues that the Senator referenced.</p> <p>Proposals to address a number of the programme for Government requirements have been the subject of consideration by the Government, most recently last week, in light of which it is envisaged that the matters involved will be referred to the Oireachtas for consideration.  Among the issues being addressed in this context is municipal governance, including the questions of town or borough status and local electoral areas, as referenced in the programme for Government.  Pending referral of the matters involved to the Oireachtas, I am not in a position to provide full details on them, but I am prepared to have a further discussion.</p> <p>The Department is preparing a report on the programme for Government commitment on directly elected mayors for Dublin and Cork.  This paper will examine the range of functions that might be assigned to a directly elected mayor and the governance structure that would underpin the role.  Of importance is the geographic area relevant both to the mayoral role and the electorate that would vote for it.  Consideration must also be given to potential impacts on existing local government structures following on from the establishment of directly elected mayors in those city areas.</p> <p>At its meeting on 26 September 2017, the Government agreed as part of an indicative schedule for a number of referendums over the next 18 months that a plebiscite on directly elected mayors could take place in October 2018.  The Department is drafting the legislation required to give effect to this decision and it is included in the Government's legislative programme as a Bill to be published in the first half of this year.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy John Paul Phelan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2004"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2004&amp;amp;pid=JohnPaulPhelan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I also note that proposals brought to the Government and the Oireachtas on directly elected mayors will need to be cognisant of the new national planning framework and its strong focus on sustainable unpacked development of Ireland's cities and urban areas.  Work on the report on directly elected mayors for cities is at an advanced stage in the Department.  I thank the Senator for his interest in the matter.  </p><p>Local government performs a wide range of functions and delivers a broad array of services.  Any change must strengthen it and ensure it will remain fit for purpose.  I also take the opportunity to thank the staff and membership of local authorities across the country who responded so effectively in the past few days to events during Storm Emma.  </p><p>In the case of Cork city and in respect of the newly expanded boundary which has not yet been provided for in law but which will, it is hoped, come into effect in the middle of the year with a local government Bill, it seems pretty clear, based on the geographic area, where a directly elected mayor will operate.  In Dublin some people believe a directly elected mayor should just be for the city; others believe he or she should be for the four Dublin authorities, while others believe the area should stretch to include the three neighbouring authorities in counties Meath, Wicklow and Kildare.  There is the question of whether such a role should slot into a similar pattern as in the case of the existing local government heads rather than have executive power.  In the case of Dublin and Cork, that would mean a change in the role of the chief executives in these organisations.  A directly elected mayor would have these powers and carry out these functions for the term for which he or she was elected.  All of these matters are being considered.  It will be another month before the report goes to the Government and it will include the options.  The Government will make its decision and there will then be a discussion in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

There is still a lot more work to be done, from which I am not taking away.  The Minister of State used the term "plebiscite".  Whatever decision is made, there has to be change.  We should never be afraid of change, but it is important that, in respect of local democracy and government, we initiate a plebiscite.  There is now a connection with local property tax and for the first time people believe they are putting their hands in their pockets.  It is to be hoped there will come a time when all taxes gathered locally will be retained locally, but we are a long way from that happening.  Where I live, money is being handed the other way.  Empowering people through a plebiscite is a very important aspect of any change.  I again thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply.</p></speech>

I also commend the work of the Department and the HSE which have committed to the provision of additional resources for the clinic which should help to make an impact on waiting lists.  However, there is currently only one full-time public endocrinologist who is based in St. Columcille&rsquo;s Hospital, Loughlinstown with expertise in hormone replacement therapy, HRT, who serves the needs of adult transgender people in the State.  The number of posts will soon be increased to two.  There is also a part-time clinic in University College Hospital Galway, UCHG, with very limited hours.  Owing to HSE policy, HRT is only administered to trans people at these two clinics, despite the fact that HRT prescribed for cisgender people or in any other instance can be administered and monitored by a local GP.</p> <p>In the clinic in Loughlinstown there is a two-year waiting list.  The waiting time has been attributed, not to service users but to the cancelling of clinics by consultants and the enforcement of the medical and diagnostic model by the HSE.  The additional resources can be largely offset as the lead consultant within the clinic, Professor O&rsquo;Shea, takes on the role of clinical lead for obesity.  While I hope waiting times will improve, all of the indications point to the fact that the clinic will continue to be stretched beyond capacity.  It is also worth noting that those aged 16 or 17 years who wish to apply for a gender recognition certificate must have supporting documentation from the clinic which will only accept referrals from certain psychiatrists who also have strained waiting times.  </p> <p>The model of a full-time Dublin-centric clinic meeting the needs of a community spread across the State is one that contravenes international best practice, namely, the World Professional Association for Transgender Healthcare, WPATH, guidelines which are the standard for most developed countries and also in keeping with the European Social Charter.  It is not viable for a Dublin-centric clinic to support the needs of our island-wide trans community.  It is fair to say the current position has led to a spike in mental health issues and the incidence of suicidal ideation among vulnerable persons and a rise in unmonitored self-treatment where individuals are forced or opt to buy hormones online.</p></speech>

This information is available on <i>ntpf.ie.</i>The most recent figures published by the NTPF for January 2018 indicate that there is a total of 38 people on the national inpatient day case waiting list for endocrinology and a total of 9,339 on the outpatient waiting list for endocrinology.  Of this figure, almost 1,900 are on the waiting list at St. Columcille&rsquo;s Hospital.  Figures show that 42% of these patients have been on the waiting list for 12 months or less.  Almost 40% have been on it for 18 months or more.  However, I am advised by the HSE that urgent referrals are usually accommodated within four to six weeks.  It is important to highlight that the NTPF waiting list data are extracted from the overall waiting list figures for the specialty and do not differentiate specific procedures for transgender patients from procedures for other patients on waiting lists.  Reducing waiting times for the patients who have been waiting the longest is one of the Government&rsquo;s key priorities.  Consequently, in budget 2018, &euro;55 million was allocated for the NTPF.  This significant increase in funding almost trebles its 2017 total allocation of &euro;20 million.  </p><p>  To date, the transgender service in Loughlinstown has developed on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis and all referrals are managed within general endocrinology OPD clinics.  The service is operated between the psychiatry services, primarily in Cluain Mhuire, and the endocrinology service in St. Columcille&rsquo;s Hospital.  Patients who require an endocrinology assessment must have been initially assessed and referred by a consultant psychiatrist.  The psychiatry clinics are held weekly in St. Columcille&rsquo;s Hospital and can accept only one new referral per week.  </p><p>It is welcome that the HSE has, as part of its 2018 budget, allocated funding of &euro;100,000 to St. Columcille&rsquo;s Hospital which will ensure dedicated funding for transgender services and see increased capacity within psychiatry and psychology services.  This will increase the capacity of the clinic to see additional referrals.  The HSE has advised that recruitment to fill the additional new posts at St. Columcille&rsquo;s Hospital will commence in early 2018.</p><p>The existing care pathway for transgender people in accessing HRT follows international best practice.  The guidelines were devised by experts in transgender health care, with members of the international transgender, transsexual and LGBT community, and supported by TENI.  The care pathway generally begins with an approach by an individual to his or her GP.  The GP may refer the person to the local community mental health team for support and a diagnosis of gender dysphoria by a psychiatrist or a clinical psychologist.  A thorough assessment is a prerequisite to commencing hormone suppressers.  This is to ensure the correct path is being taken for the individual and comorbidity issues are identified and addressed.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Jim Daly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2328"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2328&amp;amp;pid=JimDaly&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It would be inappropriate for me as Minister to comment on the assessment process as this is a matter between clinical personnel and the individual concerned.</p></speech>

I accept that the waiting list data are extracted and do not differentiate specific procedures for transgender patients.  However, if we accept that there are 1,900 people on the waiting list and compare that figure with the number of people who have availed of a gender recognition certificate in this State, which would be about 300, although I do not know the number off the top of my head, those numbers are staggering in comparison with those who have availed of a gender recognition certificate, so that is a concern.  As I said in my opening speech, it is not international best practice for a service to be so Dublin-centric and to not be available around the State.</p><p>Will the Minister of State commit to working with the Department and the HSE to ascertain if we can broaden access for hormone replacement therapy?  What medical professionals would be able to administer and monitor the treatment?  Will the Minister of State request that the Minister meet TENI and the This is Me campaign?  The need to meet the Minister results from the fact that all the correspondence that TENI, the community or we get is from the Loughlinstown clinic itself.  There is a bit of silence on the part of the Department, so that is a concern given that there were hundreds on the streets of Dublin at the beginning of this year.</p></speech>

This involves one consultant endocrinologist, one social worker, one speech and language therapist, two senior psychologists, one clinical nurse specialist and one grade five.  Some of them will be whole-time equivalents and some will be part time.  That should help the waiting lists but I will certainly pass on the Senator's concerns to both the Department and the HSE.  I will also pass on to the Minister the Senator's request that he meet TENI at the first opportunity.</p></speech>

I very much appreciate it.  My Commencement matter relates to the proposal in the national development plan, Project Ireland 2040, for a new hospital in Cork.  The priority is not long fingering it and leaving it as just a proposal.  I want action to be taken.  The population of Cork has increased from 410,000 to 542,000 in the past 30 years.  It will continue to grow under Project Ireland 2040.  Cork city and county will be the fastest growing area of the country.  Therefore, there is a need for improved medical facilities and one of those facilities is a new hospital.  The first job is identifying a suitable site and then starting and proceeding through the planning process.  The first priority is identifying a site.  What action has the Department and the HSE taken with regard to progressing that matter?</p></speech>

The health service capacity review, which was published on 23 January 2018, identifies additional capacity requirements in our health service and also makes it clear that, in the absence of major reforms, the demand on our hospital system in particular will become unsustainable.  The review clearly states that, together with reformed models of care, we need extra capacity across acute hospitals and primary and social care.  It concludes that acute hospital bed capacity will need to increase by 2,600.  I am delighted that the very significant increases in capital funding in the health service as a result of the national development plan will allow us to deliver on this capacity as well as on a range of other health capital projects and programmes across acute, primary and social care.</p> <p>Under the national development plan, capital funding for our health services will be 165% higher for the next ten years than it was for the past ten years.  This is a sea change commitment to capital investment in our health services.  A total of &euro;10.9 billion over the next ten years provides a real, long-term opportunity to improve our services, drive down waiting lists, increase bed capacity, reform pathways of care, and modernise how we deliver health services.  The new hospital for Cork is one of the major investment projects promised in the national development plan.</p> <p>It is important to recognise that the national development plan is a long-term plan.  It provides for a large number of health developments throughout the country, including both national programmes and individual projects across acute, primary and social care.  Many of its proposals are at an early stage of development, including the new hospital for Cork.  Further planning to progress the investment in a new hospital for Cork will now be undertaken.  This will include full evaluation of local capacity and infrastructural needs as well as a framework for decision-making on the optimal location from a clinical and population needs perspective.  For all projects, we must ensure that we carefully plan the use of all capital funding using robust methods of appraisal, assessment and selection to meet population needs and achieve value for money.  In this way, the unprecedented health capital investment of &euro;10.9 billion over the next ten years will allow the health services to provide the necessary infrastructure and equipment to support the Government's vision for a high-quality, safe, accessible and sustainable health care system into the future.</p></speech>

The question is quite specific.  I just asked what process has been put in place to identify the site.  It is important that we establish a group or that a process is clearly identified to identify this site and move forward with this project.  I suggest that I be allowed to raise this issue again to allow the Minister of State to get further information so that we can find out whether this is just on paper at the moment, whether some process has started, if one has not started, when it will start, and the target date for identifying a site.  This is important information for me because I do not want to be raising the same matter in 12 months with nothing done.</p></speech>

If the Cathaoirleach is happy to allow the matter to be raised again in the House, I am happy to come back and get more detail for the Senator.  I have some knowledge of it as a Minister of State from the area and had some discussions with the hospital group on the future of this hospital before the national development plan was announced.  One thing I remember being struck by at that meeting was that one of the difficulties and challenges faced by the HSE, and I appreciate that this is a separate debate, was having to deal with two separate local authorities when discussing issues of infrastructure, sites and support services.  Be that as it may, there is nothing we can do about that in this forum.  I am happy to get further information for the Senator on the specifics of the process involved in identifying a site.</p></speech>

Both relate to shortages, the first a shortage of water and the second a shortage of blood.  Regarding water shortages, we have learned from the Kennedy analysis that we have a 57% leakage rate in Dublin.  We know that Dublin's pipes are ancient, corroded, full of holes and generally not fit for purpose.  We also know that in London, which has leakage rates of less than half of what we have in Dublin, they are replacing their old Victorian water mains.  To date, Irish Water has no such plans.  Instead it is planning on a mega project to pump water 172 km from the River Shannon to Dublin.  No doubt this is a great plan which would give us a sustainable water source into the future, but surely we need to start replacing our old water mains and Victorian pipes at the very least.  What is the point in pumping water into leaky pipes?  It does not make any sense.</p> <p>Dublin 12, 8 and 6W have some of the oldest pipes in the city, which corresponds with the fact that Dublin 12, 8 and 6W have some of the oldest and most beautiful homes in the city, and they have been most affected by the water shortages to date.  Local shops in Dublin South-Central have literally run out of bottled water, a sight one would not see in Third World countries.  There has been some confusion of late in the media regarding the use of the word "demand".  People are not using more water.  On average, Irish people use less water than households in the UK.  The term is being used interchangeably with the term "leakages".  The recent weather and the result of freeze-thaw action has seen a further deterioration in old Dublin pipes and drains.</p> <p>I call on the Government to make a commitment to this House to replace the old Victorian mains in my beloved city.  I also want to echo a call made by my party colleague, Councillor Paul McAuliffe for Irish Water to publish daily information on treated water levels in our capital.  As our former Taoiseach used to say, "Paddy likes to know".</p> <p>The second issue I wish to raise is that of the blood supply in this city.  With people confined to their homes during the storm, blood donations fell and that has put serious pressure on blood supplies.  Many cancer patients know, as do their family members, the importance of blood donation and blood supply for cancer treatment.  My father, over the course of his 15 years of illness, would have had to receive litres of blood from generous blood donors throughout the country.  The Irish Blood Transfusion Service stated on Tuesday that it has three days' supply of common blood types of regular blood and only two days' supply of blood group O.  Its aim is to collect 7,000 donations between now and St. Patrick's Day.  If people are suitable donors, I ask that they make their way to their local blood donation clinic.  It is very important that we increase our supply, especially in light of the fact that we have 600 people waiting on trolleys to be treated around the country and there is a bottleneck with respect to supply due to the storm.  I request the Leader to call on the Minister to make this happen.</p></speech>

I will deal first with the issue of D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour.  For those who may have read today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>, they would have seen pictures in it of decimated, bashed up, collapsed concrete in D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour as a result of the recent storms.  That sets the context in terms of other political and financial storms that have affected this harbour.  To set the context for this, D&uacute;n Laoghaire is one of the biggest harbours in Europe and one of the best harbours in the world, and is recognised as such.  It comprises 250 acres within the harbour walls.  The piers are each a little less than a mile long and that represents 100 ha.  It is an enormous national asset for this country but particularly for sailing.</p><p>There has been no commercial activity in the harbour.  It was the subject of much debate with respect to the ports policy, at which time the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport - our harbours come under that Department - was the current Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar.  A decision was taken to transfer control of small ports of regional significance to the local authorities.  It was decided that control of this harbour would be transferred to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  Yesterday a very extensive meeting took place with the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown county councillors to consider an independent due diligence report on the liabilities that would come with that transfer of control.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The transfer is mandatory.  That is covered in the legislation.  There is no choice.  As a result of an independent due diligence, validated by the Department, the council is now faced with a cost of &euro;34 million to cover the liabilities, of which &euro;1.4 million relates to liabilities concerning a pension fund for employees that are on the books.  The sum of &euro;34 million is an enormous amount of money.  I call on the Government to have a debate on the matter, in particular with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, to whom I will speak in the coming days if I can.  The Government must set aside a capital reserve to assist the local authority in taking on this asset.  It cannot just wash its hands of a State company by handing it to a local authority while it has &euro;34 million in liabilities.</p><p>To provide some context, the local authority was informed yesterday that if it were to take on those liabilities the impact would be an increase of 4% in commercial rates and an 8% increase in local property tax next year right across the county, to have regard to the harbour.  The harbour is unique and special.  I appeal to the Leader to arrange to have a debate or perhaps I need to raise the matter as part of the Commencement debate.  The issue is an important one and I have been asked by local authority members to raise it, which is why I speak about it this morning.</p><p>Could the Leader inform the House whether he has any knowledge of the intentions of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government this week - not next week - to sign and trigger the order to give effect to a by-election to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of the outgoing Senator Denis Landy on the agricultural panel?  I understand such an order is imminent and I think we should know.  If the Leader does not know perhaps he could find out and tell the House later or tomorrow as the information is important and we should know it.</p></speech>

I ask that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine would come to the House to discuss what emergency plan he has put in place, in particular to deal with the fodder crisis, which has been ongoing for some months but because of the weather we have had in the past week the crisis has escalated and it needs an immediate response.  The Minister must look north of the Border to examine the funds that were put in place there when farmers experienced hardship.  The crisis is not confined to fodder.  Sheds have collapsed and people have had to destroy milk.  An emergency package must be put in place for farm families which form the backbone of many rural communities.</p> <p>I also wish to speak about yesterday's meeting of the finance committee which was attended by Commissioner Oettinger who spoke about the EU budget.  He told us about the proposed reduction in Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, funding to meet the &euro;5 billion gap that will be created following Brexit.  The Commissioner said he has travelled around many member states and the people to whom he has spoken have referred to reductions of up to 30% in the CAP budget.  That is absolutely unacceptable.  The Commission must look beyond CAP in terms of the gap that will be left by Brexit.  It can look, for instance, at reducing the EU militarisation programme.  The average income of a farmer in the west of Ireland is perhaps a little more than &euro;3,000 a year and it is not acceptable to expect his direct payments to be reduced while increasing the budget for EU militarisation.  That is not what the EU talks about in terms of incorporating the views of all member states and being all-inclusive in its approach.  We must stand up for agriculture and agricultural families in this country and for the role they play in rural areas.  In terms of food security, we will not know how valuable farmers really are until they are gone.  Too many family farms have been destroyed because of Government policies and due to inaction by the EU.  We have an opportunity to address that during the CAP review.  Currently, 80% of CAP payments are directed to 20% of the highest earners in agriculture and that wrong must be righted in the CAP review as well.</p></speech>

I also welcome the Supreme Court decision announced today reversing the decision of Mr. Justice Humphreys in the High Court in so far as he ruled on the rights of the unborn extending beyond Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution.  I listened with great interest to the Chief Justice, Mr. Frank Clarke's summary of the judgment and I look forward to reading the lengthy judgment in more detail, but it is clear from the summary that the judgment does provide the necessary legal clarity to enable us to move forward swiftly to bring in the legislation necessary to hold the referendum to repeal the eighth amendment.  I look forward to the referendum legislation being before us in this House in early course.  If he can, I ask the Leader to provide a suggested timeframe.  I accept it is early days yet as the judgment has only just been delivered but it does provide the necessary legal clarity and I welcome the ratio, the key aspect of the judgment.</p> <p>I also welcome the Leader's scheduling today of a series of statements on women's suffrage to mark the centenary of women's suffrage.  The statements will commence at 2.30 p.m. today and I look forward to taking part in the debate.  It will give us all an opportunity to reflect on the series of events being run in the Oireachtas to mark what we are calling V&oacute;t&aacute;il 100, the 100th anniversary of women obtaining the right to vote.  It is a very significant year and clearly a very significant centenary and we have a number of very important events of which colleagues will already be aware and will support throughout the year.  I welcome the opportunity to have that debate.  I think we should also use it to mark the necessity of ensuring that we have increased numbers of women representatives in the Oireachtas in future years and to look at ways in which we can increase women's representation in politics.  That is very important.</p> <p>I have emailed leaders of other groups the draft text of a cross-party motion on Syria.  I spoke about this in the House yesterday.  The intention is to note the appalling, barbaric bombardment of civilians in east Ghouta at present.</p></speech>

In October 2016 we in the Seanad led the way in agreeing a cross-party motion condemning the bombardment of Aleppo, which we brought to the attention of the Russian ambassador, given the complicity of the Russian regime in Bashar al-Assad's brutal regime in Syria.

The court, the highest court in this area, has found that the rulings of arbitration courts to award compensation are incompatible with the European treaties.  The specific case on which it ruled this week involved a decision requiring the Slovakian Government to pay more than &euro;25 million to a private company.  This is the third significant ruling on this matter.  The European Court of Justice ruled previously that the European Commission was wrong to believe it could bypass national state ratification of trade deals.  It has also ruled that the Commission was wrong not to engage with a large-scale citizens' petition in respect of trade deals, specifically the investor court system that has been found to exercise a chilling effect in important areas of health, environmental, social and equality regulation in many countries. </p><p>Belgium has lodged a case with the European Court of Justice related to the investor court system, which is a new version of the investor state dispute mechanism proposed as part of the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA.  These mechanisms are clearly not working.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on alternatives to trade deals such as CETA and TTIP, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.  The House should discuss how we can move past this failed model for doing trade and ensure we have trade that works for citizens and not only corporations. </p><p>The House will later discuss the issue of suffrage.  I am proud to have been part of the V&oacute;t&aacute;il 100 committee.  Will the Leader indicate when the committee on Seanad reform will meet?  The committee deals with another important area of democracy.  Will it meet before the Easter break?</p></speech>

Before raising a couple of other significant historical events we should also remember, I find it astonishing and highly ironic that Fianna F&aacute;il Party Senators have complained about leaking pipes and water shortages in Dublin.  I remind them that the purpose of establishing Irish Water was to invest in water infrastructure and modernise the water network.  What did Fianna F&aacute;il do during the general election campaign?  It undermined all the progress made in this area in the interest of populist politics.  It is a little rich, therefore, to hear Senators from that party complain during a crisis when all of these matters were meant to have been addressed by now.</p><p>I raise a significant event and an important person in Irish history.  This day 180 years ago - on 7 March 1848 - our national flag, the tricolour, was flown for the first time at the Wolfe Tone Confederate Club at 33 The Mall, Waterford City, by the Irish patriot, Thomas Francis Meagher.  In April 1848, Meagher stated: &quot;The white in the centre signifies a lasting truce between Orange and Green, and I trust that beneath its folds the hands of Irish Protestants and Irish Catholics may be clasped in generous and heroic brotherhood.&quot;  The Seanad should pause and reflect on these significant words which are as relevant today as they were in 1848.  This Republic should respect all traditions and religions and we should remember the legacy of Thomas Francis Meagher, a Waterford man. </p><p>Another significant point in history was the centenary yesterday of the death of the great Irish parliamentarian, John Redmond.  This week a number of commemorative events will be held in Dublin, Waterford and Wexford to mark Redmond's death.  As Senators will be aware, Redmond was the leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party for more than 18 years and made a significant contribution to politics in this country.  He was involved in negotiations with landlords to transfer land ownership to tenant farmers.  This legacy endures and should be recognised.</p><p>Redmond was often criticised for his interest in the British war effort.  In modern Ireland, we have a better understanding of the reasons Irish people fought in the First World War and we must respect those reasons.  Whether we agree or disagree with Redmond's views, we should remember and mark his legacy both in Parliament and the country.  His life will be marked in Waterford this weekend in a conference featuring a number of important speakers who will do his memory justice. </p></speech>

To the Garda, ambulance service, fire service, Defence Forces and other front-line staff rightly received much praise but an entire army of other people, who I would describe as good neighbours and great citizens, also deserves praise.  Many people were left on their own, cut off entirely from the family and friends who normally visit but were unable to do so.  After four or five days, the solitude and sense of confinement and isolation will have been overwhelming.  Let us imagine how those who experience this every day, with no end in sight, must feel.  Last year, as part of a campaign to highlight the impact of loneliness a young man, Joseph Lindoe, spent a week alone at home in the United Kingdom to find out what it was like for the thousands of people who go this long without speaking to anyone.  Mr. Lindoe did not have access to the Internet or a telephone and did not have any means of communicating with other people.  He documented this time on video and in his own words he felt &quot;truly trapped&quot;.  Mr. Lindoe was able to count down his days until freedom but for many people who are lonely or isolated, there is no light at the end of the tunnel.  I will post his harrowing video on social media later and I urge all Senators to take a moment to watch it.</p><p>I echo the sentiments expressed by Mr. Se&aacute;n Moynihan, chief executive officer of the Alone charity, with whom I worked on the loneliness task force.  Mr. Moynihan has asked all of us to maintain the community spirit evident in the past week.  We all have a better understanding now of what it is like for some people all year around who cannot get out, do not have company and lack some of the supports and services they need. </p><p>On behalf of my party, I welcome the St. Brigid's home school liaison team and members of other teams from the Coombe area who are visiting the Seanad today. </p></speech>

As everyone knows, we cannot fix the wrongs that led the country on a trail of destruction from 2008 until 2012 or thereabouts.  The problem we have is that the salary available will not entice people to enter education.  The cost of training has gone through the roof because the period of training has increased to two years and the State provides no assistance.  In many of the English newspapers, we see advertisements enticing people to move to England, have their teacher training costs paid for and receive a salary that provides a reasonable living standard.  We must do something in education because we are losing the best as the system bites.  While I acknowledge the problem cannot be fixed overnight, a clear indication must be given to teachers that better times lie ahead.  I ask the Leader to organise a debate on the issue.</p><p>On the matter of women's suffrage, as the brother of eight sisters, a husband and a father of one daughter and grandfather of one granddaughter, it is great that we will celebrate women's suffrage today.  It is also great that we have seen some degree of equality.  While I do not like to generalise, it is great that the general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is a female and that women are making serious inroads into society.  The one area of life in which they are not making inroads is politics.  To make it in politics a woman must be better than the best.  If we are discussing women's suffrage one hundred years after it was introduced, we should have a look around both Houses of the Oireachtas because we are not there yet.  Unfortunately, I will not be present for the debate one women's suffrage as I must attend a committee meeting.  We need to start at the top and work our way down, as has been done in the trade union movement where a number of general secretaries are now female.  Unfortunately, the number is still not half enough.</p><p>Another problem I experienced in my previous role in the trade union movement is that we do not create an environment that makes it easy for women to enter trade union politics or politics in general.  I recall women resigning from the national executive of my union because all meetings were held in Dublin and they had to get home to their children by a reasonable hour.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

I very much welcome the decision made by the Supreme Court this morning.</p> <p>I wish to raise the issue of a decision last Monday by the board of Trinity College Dublin to introduce a flat fee of &euro;450 for supplemental exams, also known as repeat exams.  The introduction of fees for supplemental exams was always going to cause some upset but I do not believe anyone could have expected the outrageous figure of &euro;450.  To put it into context, UCD charges &euro;230 per exam, while UCC caps its charge at &euro;245, regardless of how many exams a student resits.  Some students already fail exams because of financial uncertainty and instability in their lives as they juggle long hours and part-time jobs.  This is a cruel further pressure upon such students.  The introduction of the charge will disproportionately affect the students already most at risk of dropping out for financial reasons.  When one considers that Ireland has the second-highest third level fees in Europe and that students fork out more than &euro;10,000 for accommodation during the academic year, it is clear this new financial cost will price more students out of an education.</p> <p>The decision was made against the will of the students' union.  In a preferendum held earlier this year, 80% of students voted to oppose fees for supplemental exams.  Their voices have been ignored and they have been disrespected in the name of financial gain for the university.  I understand the students' union is now considering strike action, boycotting services, protesting in front arch-----</p></speech>

The House has dealt with issues related to their work.</p> <p>People in Ireland may have to wait up to two years to see a neurologist.  We have 34 neurologists but should have approximately twice as many.  Things have improved over the years but we still have quite a way to go in this area.  Specialist nurses is another area in which there are significant deficits.</p> <p>The brain awareness week campaign is looking for an investment in neurology, which must happen because it would lead to better outcomes for people and a reduction in cost and the suffering endured as a result of the debilitating nature of these conditions.  I commend those organisations and groups on organising the awareness week and bringing it to the attention of Members and I request that the Leader organise a debate with the Minister on the matter.</p></speech>

Public services such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Civil Defence and medical services did a fantastic job but in many ways communities rallied together to ensure older or younger people were safe, which must be acknowledged.  I particularly acknowledge the farming community for clearing the roads.  In my part of the world, there was snow of up to 2 m in depth and we would be still entrenched in it were it not for the farming community becoming involved.</p> <p>I wish to raise what is a very important issue in Cork, which is going through a major process of the consideration of an extension of the city boundary.  We have also had the 2020 vision for Ireland and must consider what it is we want for Cork.  However, the lack of joined-up thinking between the two local authorities in Cork is a major issue which has again been highlighted in publications in the past week in respect of a planning application for a major development in a county council local authority area that is being processed through the strategic housing development route to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and to which the city council has lodged a four-page objection.  Where is the joined-up thinking?  What is the future for Cork if one local authority is objecting to an application for planning permission in another local authority area?  This development of more than 600 units is badly needed in that area and has been put forward for strategic funding for social housing by the Government, yet the local authorities are playing petty politics, which is inappropriate.  Local authorities in Cork need to work together rather than object to each other's proposals.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland has no issue with the development but the city council is objecting to its planning permission.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, must get involved in such issues in Cork and ensure he knocks heads together in order to avoid situations such as this, where one local authority is objecting to planning permission in another local authority area.  Action is required.  In many ways, it is important that the Minister should intervene so that something can be sorted out in this scenario.</p></speech>

I was very happy to accept the invitation extended by my very good friend and colleague, Senator Ivana Bacik.

I wish to discuss a new line of crime that came to light as a result of the storm and was highlighted on radio this morning, namely, the large-scale theft of home heating oil.  One lady who spoke on radio told of how, after running out of fuel, she had ordered more from her supplier.  He arrived at 2.30 p.m. with 700 litres which cost her &euro;500.  Her plumber arrived at 4.30 p.m. to bleed the heating system to get her back up and running, but the tank was dry.  There was a two-hour window.  It is said people are following fuel lorries around.  It is a major problem.  I highlight a good initiative being taken for the first time this year by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, under which people can claim fuel allowance in two lump sum payments, with a view to giving them some buying power when buying home heating oil in bulk, which is more economical than buying it weekly.  Owing to bulk buying, however, they are vulnerable to thugs.  When the Department makes lump sum payments, it is important that it inform its clientele of the risks involved.  The oil tank of the woman in question was located in a remote area well hidden behind her house, but someone only needs to click on Google Maps to be able to see into everyone's backyard and find out where the oil tank is located.  The perpetrators have vans with pumps and long hoses.  The vans which might be marked can be parked 50 yd. up the road.  A houseowner could even be talking to the perpetrators in the van while oil is being sucked out of the tank through a long hose.  In the case in question, the tank would have been empty had the perpetrators arrived two hours earlier and they knew exactly when to take it.  They had followed the lorry and knew who was receiving a delivery that day.  We need to get the message out that people need to be conscious of this issue.  Being able to receive fuel allowance in two equal payments during the year in order that people can buy kerosene is a great initiative, but it has led to people being made vulnerable.</p></speech>

In an interview which was published online, subsequently removed and republished in a toned down form he accused the Football Association of Ireland, FAI, of employing sectarian tactics and poaching players from the North.  It causes me deep concern, in the first instance, because it pertains to issues related to equality of citizenship, identity and our right as fellow citizens to be full and equal participants in the life of Ireland.  It is for the FAI to speak for itself and I would not presume to do so, but I imagine that one of its first comments will be that many of the players from the North who will ultimately end up playing for the FAI do the approaching in the first instance as opposed to it poaching them.  I do not understand the rationale behind it and do not know how to take it, as sport should not be brought into the political domain.  Focusing solely on the issues of identity and citizenship is concerning.  We must ensure we stand and act as guardians of the right of citizens in the North to be full and equal participants in the life of Ireland, including playing for the national soccer side unhindered and without the incessant and relentless abuse that, for example, has been levelled at people from the city of Derry who have dared to pull on the green jersey and do what I contest is an exceptional job for Ireland on the field.  It is not up to Mr. O'Neill or anyone in the FAI to impose a perceived citizenship on anyone else.  An easy solution would be something for which we have called in this Chamber, namely, the creation of an all-Ireland soccer team in line with what happens in boxing, rugby, hockey, cricket and every other sport.  Another way around it would be for the FAI to engage with young people in the North from an early age in order that these problems and issues will not present in the later stages of people's careers.  In many instances, it is not young people's fault that they have to go through the Irish Football Association's structures in the North.  That is the system in place.  Let us talk about how to resolve this issue and open up participation in FAI sports to citizens across the country.  The reality is that for very many young people in the North, going to play at Windsor Park under the defunct flag of the old unionist regime and having to stand and observe "God Save the Queen" as an anthem is a cold house.  They do not want to do it.  Many others have an affinity with it.  Fair play and good luck to them and more power to their elbow, but we must collectively acknowledge that a growing number of people do not have that affinity and should not be forced to go through these structures.  When such a prominent and eminent sports figure like Mr. O'Neill presumes to say people playing for Ireland is somehow sectarian, as guardians of Irish citizenship, we must call it out for what it is.</p></speech>

The weather conditions carried a significant cost for the industry in lost sales, employee wages and clean-up costs.  It amounted to hundreds of millions of euro and retailers have been left to pick up the pieces, as was evident when listening to Ms Lorraine Higgins of Retail Excellence Ireland on radio this week.  She outlined the advertising costs retailers would incur to eke out their losses from last week.  I have an issue with the non-existence of cash in post offices, which exacerbated retailers' losses during the extreme weather event.  It was reported that post offices in counties Dublin, Louth and Offaly and some in the midlands had been emptied of cash as social welfare recipients queued to collect payments.  This posed an additional challenge to retailers who were already facing extreme weather conditions and lost opening times.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Aidan Davitt:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2475"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2475&amp;amp;pid=AidanDavitt&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Given that no similar problems surfaced at ATMs and banks, did the Government properly plan for the doubling of the fuel allowance?

Were cash logistics de-risked to ensure that such threats to cash supply would not happen?</p><p>We are all aware that this matter had an impact on social welfare payments because many people did not receive what they were told were their entitlements.  Unfortunately, the situation will continue this week and it will continue to have impact on retailers for the coming weeks.  We need to debate this issue and ensure that small independent shops in towns do not suffer in this way again.  I urge consumers to continue to support their local shops which are key stakeholders in their communities.  Only for local shops in many areas, people would have been left high and dry. </p></speech>

He was the last man in Ireland to be sentenced to be hung, drawn and quartered.  Prior to sentencing the judge asked him if he had anything to say, to which he replied: "Well your honour, I give you my word as a gentleman that if you do not sentence me to death, I will try again."  The judge obliged and sentenced him to death but the sentence was commuted to transportation for life to Australia.  He escaped from Van Diemen's Land and travelled to America where he joined the 69th regiment of the Union Army in the American Civil War and went on to become the Governor of Montana.  As befits a man who had an extraordinary life, he had an extraordinary death.  One evening he was on a paddle steamboat on the Missouri River but the following day he was gone never to be seen again.  He was only 43 years of age when he died.</p> <p>It is important to note that Thomas Francis Meagher gave us the flag and his aspirations for the flag.  He said: "I trust that beneath its folds the hands of the Irish Protestant and the Irish Catholic may be clasped, in generous and heroic brotherhood."  His message is as true today as it was 170 years ago.  I ask the Leader to make a few comments on this historic occasion.  Let us bear in mind that this House formally adopted, for the first time ever, protocols for the national flag.</p></speech>

I wish first to recognise, as Senators Coffey and Mark Daly rightly said in their contributions, the importance of the flag and what it symbolises.  I commend Thomas Francis Meagher on giving us the Tricolour.  As Senator Coffey has said, we should reflect on what the Tricolour represents.  It is important that we remember Thomas Francis Meagher on this day and, equally, as Senator Coffey has said, the role played by John Redmond.  As the country celebrates a decade of commemorations, it is important that we recognise all parts of this country, all sides, all denominations, all people, all religions, all colours and all races.  We may be an island nation but we are at the heart of Europe and not on its edge, which gives us enormous credibility across the world.  Last week, President Trump designated March the Irish-American month in the United States.  Next week, An Taoiseach will travel across America and will represent all of us.  It is important that we stand strong as a nation and remember the sacrifices and heroism of so many people who got this country to this point.  Like Senators Coffey and Mark Daly, I urge people to remember what Thomas Francis Meagher did today so many years ago and I wish Senator Coffey well when he attends the commemorative events in Waterford.</p> <p>I join Senators Swanick and Ardagh in welcoming the St. Brigid's home school liaison team from the Coombe area who do Trojan work in this city.  I wish to highlight the importance of home school liaison and the significant role that it plays not just in the Coombe area but across the county.  The scheme is a vital and important part of the education system.  I thank Senator Ardagh for welcoming the delegation to the House today.  </p> <p>In terms of the contributions made during the Order of Business, I started on a positive note and I am reluctant to commence a discordant attack on Senator Ardagh.  However, it is ironic that Senator Ardagh unfortunately lamented the fact that water is a challenging issue in the capital city and in some parts of the country when her party played absolute populism with Irish Water.  Her party played Molly Bawn with the Irish people in 2016-----</p></speech>

Yesterday, the Minister for Health appealed to people to donate blood and made a very strong statement on the matter.  The Irish Blood Transfusion Service has requested people to donate.  I ask Members of the House to encourage people to donate blood through social media and other means.  Senator Ardagh is 100% correct when she said people require blood for a variety of different reasons.  It is imperative that we, through this Chamber and our own offices, appeal to people to donate blood.  As much as one in four people will require a blood transfusion at some stage of their lives.  As Senator Ardagh has said, many people need blood donations now because the blood supply has been severely depleted due to the storm.  It is important that blood donors, and those who would like to become blood donors, donate now.  I urge people to visit donation clinics.  There is information available on this matter.  It is important that Senators support the call to donate blood, and I join Senator Ardagh in doing that.</p></speech>

We should all support that call.  I appeal to Members here to support that too.</p> <p>Senator Boyhan raised the issue of D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour.  I know a meeting was scheduled for yesterday in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  It is an amenity and an asset of huge importance to the State.

I am sure the Minister, Deputy Creed, and Commissioner Hogan will always fight for the Irish farmer and put Ireland at the heart of Europe.</p> <p>With regard to the issue of Storm Emma, the Department and Teagasc are working with the farming organisations to ensure that farmers have access to information, advice, support and help, whether with fodder or payments.  The Minister has committed that his Department will monitor and work to ensure that any difficulties which emerge will be addressed.  Information is available from a variety of sources.  It is important, as Senators Lombard, Daly and Davitt referred to, that farmers in rural Ireland during Storm Emma were at the forefront in helping people.  We should thank them most sincerely.  There are huge issues for farmers with regard to collapsed sheds, farming, fodder, being able to get back to the land and getting cattle out of houses and onto the land.  That will take time.  The Minister is vigilant and aware of that and will work to ensure that we do the best for Irish farmers.</p> <p>I congratulate Senator Bacik on the role she plays with others in the House, including Senators Noone, Higgins, Conway-Walsh and Ardagh, in V&oacute;t&aacute;il 100.  I welcome the events this week in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is important that we recognise the movement we have made and the journey we have to go on.

Like Senators Noone, Higgins, Gavan and Norris, I welcome the decision of the Supreme Court today relating to the issue of the rights of the unborn in our Constitution.  It is significant that the seven judges agreed.  Senator Norris' comments are well-made.  There is much information from Senator Norris that we can listen to, reflect on and act upon.  I know the Leas-Chathaoirleach has said we will have that debate as part of the Bill.  I assure Senator Gavan that, as Leader of the House, I will not delay passage of the Bill.

At the same time, as Senator Gavan will appreciate, given that we sat on the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, there is a need to allow others who have not participated to have their voice heard as part of that debate, which may present a different viewpoint from ours.  That will be a tricky balancing act and may require creativity by group leaders of different groups in the House to ensure that we have ample time to debate the Bill rather than rushing it through.  I am sure we can work together on that.  The point the Senator makes is that we should not, as a House, be seen to be an impediment or a delay.  I entirely agree with the Senator.</p> <p>I have not seen Senator Bacik's motion yet, but as part of the statements on foreign affairs today, perhaps the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade might have a conversation with the Senator.</p> <p>In response to Senator Higgins, I have not had a ruling on the European Court of Justice investor-state dispute settlement system come across my desk just yet.  We will have a debate with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade today.  I know it is not necessarily linked to that but it could be part of it.  We will try to have the debate in the coming weeks.</p> <p>Seanad reform is a matter beyond the remit of my office.  It is up to the Taoiseach to decide the composition and chair of the committee.  Work on that is under way.  As with the eighth amendment, there will be diverging views on the reform of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  Perhaps the two shall meet.  Senator Higgins has one view.  Others have a different view.  We must try to achieve a balance.</p> <p>I covered Senator Coffey's contribution with regard to V&oacute;t&aacute;il 100 and Irish Water.  I acknowledge the symposium that took place yesterday for John Redmond.</p> <p>Senator Swanick has been a champion of and advocate for those who are lonely.  He has done so again this morning.  I echo the words of Se&aacute;n Moynihan that it is not just about last week but an ongoing issue for some people.</p> <p>I agree with Senator Craughwell about pay restoration.  There is a need to see accelerated pay restoration for teachers.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, has accelerated the pace of recruitment and I welcome that.</p> <p>Senator Noone, who excellently chaired the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, contributed regarding the eighth amendment.  We need to see an informed debate not just in this House but throughout the country, and not just on people's opinions but on fact rather than fiction.</p> <p>I was not aware of the supplementary examination fee at Trinity College Dublin but I agree with Senator Gavan that we should not be putting in place an impediment or barrier to people participating in higher education or further education.  While I am not aware of the situation in Trinity College Dublin, as an educator myself and having gone to college, to increase the fee the level the Senator speaks about, &euro;450, for those students who have to do repeat examinations does not make good sense.  Even if it is done for economic reasons, it puts a hardship on people who are struggling already.  There is mental pressure, and the physical act of having to come back and repeat examinations is not a very happy one.  I hope that Trinity College Dublin will review that situation.  I would not agree with it personally.</p> <p>I congratulate Senator Dolan on raising the issue of brain awareness.  This week is brain awareness week.  I congratulate the Neurological Alliance of Ireland which is hosting a conference this weekend.  It is a very important issue.  I chaired the Joint Committee on Health and we had a number of significant debates on that.  I echo the Senator's point that further work needs to be done on the issue of brain awareness and neurology as an entity in our health care system.</p> <p>Senator Lombard raised the issue of new local government arrangements in Cork.  He referred to a particular case, and while I will not get into that, there is a need for joined-up thinking by both authorities.</p> <p>I join Senator Paul Daly in condemning the theft of oil from numerous homes throughout the country.  He is right that there is an issue with thugs and thieves coming on to people's property to steal fuel.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There needs to be away around that to ensure people are protected.  We cannot have a garda at every corner of every townland or other part of rural Ireland but the Senator is right.  Perhaps the Department of Employment and Social Protection and others should have a mechanism where we can ensure we raise awareness of this problem through the community alert programme or through the Department of Justice and Law Reform to alert people to this issue.  Such theft is disappointing and upsetting for people.  The case the Senator cited of the person who had got a fill of oil at 2.30 p.m. and it was gone by 4 p.m. is disgraceful.  There is more work to be done in that regard.</p><p>I will not get into a row with Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill about the issue he raised.  Michael O'Neill was being protective of his own players rather than having players lost to the Football Association of Ireland, FAI.  The FAI has remained silent on it.  Michael O'Neill is a Catholic.  He was referring to Catholic players being signed up for the Republic.  I do not believe he was being mischievous other than looking out for his own players.  We are all involved in sport and we must protect our own, but I would certainly hope he was not being sectarian.  I will not get into a row on it but it is important that we allow for players to choose whichever side they want to play for.  </p><p>The irony of Senator Davitt's contribution is that some of his colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il were criticising the fact that we did not announce the double week for the social protection fuel allowance earlier.
