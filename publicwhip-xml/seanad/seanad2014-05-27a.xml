It is important that people of all ages, from all backgrounds, all parties and none participate in the democratic process.  In particular, I wish our colleagues from all groups in this House who are still waiting for seats to be filled in the European Parliament every success.  As an Oireachtas we must have a serious think about the establishment of a permanent electoral commission.  That we are the last country in Europe that is still counting votes and trying to fill seats in the European Parliament, which is a very important parliament, shows the system is not fit for purpose.  Far be it from me to speak about electronic voting - I am not going there-----</p></speech>

What I would say is that we need the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, to come to the House, before he goes to Europe, to discuss whether the Seanad can do a job in this regard.  We need to move forward with electoral reform.  I have often asked for a permanent electoral commission.  I finished at a count in one of the electoral wards in Dublin this morning after 76 hours.  That is not acceptable.  I am not casting any aspersions on the staff there but the process is wrong and we have to look at how we can streamline it.</p><p>In the local and European elections, many issues played out.  Yesterday, there was a Government mid-term election but I will not speak about certain successes or otherwise of parties or whatever but I will speak about the discretionary medical card issue.  Some 55,000 medical cards plus have been removed from people who need them, the sick, the elderly and the young.  The issue has been raised time and again here not just by me, but by many colleagues on the Opposition and Government benches.  I was surprised at the weekend that certain Ministers appeared to be surprised that this was an issue.  My party and its leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, and our health spokesperson, Deputy Billy Kelleher, have been raising the issue and specific cases for two years.  I am aware the Leader has endeavoured to have a debate in this House with the Minister for Health.  I ask the Leader to ask him again to come to the House.  The Taoiseach has indicated there will be a review.  Is that a review of a review?  What are we going to do?  They are all mixed messages.  While this is happening, people with terminal illnesses and long-term illnesses and people with special needs and disabilities are losing medical cards.  He really needs to come to the House to tell us what he is doing.</p><p>If I may, I will conclude on one particular issue, that of the multiple sclerosis drug, fampyra, which I am glad received some public prominence from RTE last week.  I raised the issue in the House four months ago.  This is a trial drug for multiple sclerosis patients about which people in my area have written to me.   It allows them get their mobility back and to go back to work.  The HSE and the Department of Health, to whom I have written on numerous occasions, continue to say they will not approve it after July for the purposes of the drugs payment scheme.  I have sent correspondence to the Department of Health and the HSE with specific cases of people who have been able to go back to work.  Do we want these people to be in hospital?  This drug costs &euro;240 per month for those patients' independence and quality of life.  The Department of Health and the HSE continue to say that the HSE assessment process intends to arrive at a decision on the new funding of new medicines that is clinically appropriate, fair and consistent and sustainable.</p> <p>In these circumstances, why has the HSE not approved the reimbursements of Fampridine under the GMS or other community drug schemes?  It is not right and it should do so.  I would ask the Leader to use his good office to raise the matter with the Minister again.  I have covered the point, but I cannot understand that decision.</p></speech>

I would agree with him that the way in which the counts have played out has shown again the need for a review of the system of counting votes.  I would agree also about the need for an electoral commission.  I was struck by something Mr. John Bowman said late on one of the nights on RTE about the visible way in which counts are dealt with here and in which transfers are made, and that people see how their votes are going in the PR system.  I agree that is a valuable part of the democratic process.</p><p>Senator Darragh O'Brien mentioned the length of some of the European counts.  In a D&uacute;n Laoghaire ward, for example, a count has been adjourned until tomorrow.  When one is looking at counts going into a fourth day for some candidates, one is talking about Wednesday or Thursday before people know.  We saw candidates in my area being elected at 3.30 a.m. and 4 a.m. in the morning.  That is not an appropriate way to do business.  Those who were involved in the counting worked extremely hard, but it is not reasonable to expect people to work under those conditions or to expect candidates to be hanging on for such long hours in count centres.  We need to look again, without going to electronic voting, at how we can make our counting more efficient.</p><p>I will comment a little further on my party's result.  The Labour Party received a clear message from the electorate, as we saw our vote &quot;collapsing&quot; - there is no other word for it.  I wish to pay tribute to my former party leader, Deputy Gilmore, who, as everyone will be aware, resigned yesterday with great dignity and took responsibility for the poor result of the party and the poor showing.  People from all sides were respectful of that decision in the commentary since then.  We are now in a contest for the leadership in the Labour Party and that will play out.  It is certainly also time-----</p></speech>

That is also something that is universally acknowledged.</p><p>It is important the business of government goes on and that we do not see anyone feeling that this is a time that the Government is in any way a lame duck as a result of this.  We are going to continue with the business of government.  I am glad we are taking the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Bill 2013 this evening.  It is an important Bill which has been a long time in preparation.  We are also taking the Companies Bill 2012 next week.  The latter is a very important reforming Bill that has been a long time in preparation.  It is important that we would progress all of those measures.  Once we have a new leader in place within the Labour Party, it is also important that we would have a debate in this House on renewal of the programme for Government, on reviewing the programme for Government and the great progress that has been made on many of the commitments in that, but also on what needs to be done.  An electoral commission is one of the matters that is in there.  We need also to look at matters such as discretionary medical cards.  I agree that this was the huge issue on the doorstep with people fearful of the situation, even if they had not seen a removal of the card after review.  The way that has been dealt with has been very problematic.  If possible, we need to hold that overarching debate during the month of July.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-05-27a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1176" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="15:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014052700005#D00700"><p>Reports in the media over the past couple of weeks have brought to our consciousness the fate of many families with young children that are facing homelessness.  These families, some with working parents and some with parents who are looking for employment, are bravely standing up to the stereotypes about the homeless.  Stereotypes rarely serve any positive purpose and the negative stereotypes have been leading us to a false belief of homelessness as being self-inflicted and, therefore, somehow deserved.  Adequate housing is a human right vital to human dignity, security and well-being.  No-one deserves to be homeless, least of all a child.</p><p>We should remember that homelessness is not an isolated issue from the overall economic situation in Ireland due to the banking debt crisis and austerity measures.  Our society has been polarised even further.  Is not this a core part of the message of the Irish people when they exercised their vote on Friday last?  The level of income inequality in Ireland is one of the highest in Europe and the situation of low-income families, those families which depend on social welfare and middle-class families in negative equity has been untenable as they are being pushed into poverty and consequent homelessness.</p> <p>The Government has published its implementation plan on the State's response to homelessness, which I welcome.  I reviewed it thoroughly in consultation with TASC and many of its incentives are good.  Moreover, I understand the Minister updated the Cabinet today on these issues.</p><p>However, the Government strategy does not address adequately one core issue at the heart of the crisis, namely, the unaffordable private rental market.  The relative lack of residential housing available for renting is driving up rents and forcing close to 100,000 households onto social housing waiting lists, as they are unable or are struggling to stay in private-rented accommodation.  One response is that the Government is committing more funds for rent supplement but this is bound to drive rents even higher and the main beneficiary of this investment will be the private landlords.  Consequently, I do not believe this is the best use of our resources.</p><p>While there is an urgent need to construct social housing, the private-rented housing market should not be allowed to become out of reach for Irish families.  A regulated accessible private-rented market would be the best partner to have in the endeavour to facilitate adequate housing for all.  Hence, I ask the Leader to ask the Minister of State with special responsibility for housing and planning to establish an expert task force to outline a national strategy to develop the market for residential leasing and renting, as well as to strengthen tenants' rights as a sustainable housing strategy and a key aspect of solving the homelessness problem.  I ask the Leader to ask the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, to come to the House to consider this proposal.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-05-27a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="15:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014052700006#E00200"><p>I echo the sentiments of the previous Senators on those who contested the election and extend every good wish to the successful and unsuccessful candidates, who perform a major function in our democracy.</p><p>I welcome the Leader's statement that the debate on the State Airports (Shannon Group) Bill 2014 will be adjourned and not completed.  A new book was published just today on low-cost airlines and their relationship with airports.  The report from the Commission for Aviation Regulation on terminal 2 in Dublin Airport, the cost overruns and their implications for the charges, is due to be published on Thursday and the regulator also will step down on Friday.  Consequently, a lot of events associated with aviation are happening and I am glad the debate will be extended to facilitate this.</p><p>In addition, I wish to thank personally - and presumably on behalf of the House - the T&aacute;naiste, who stepped down yesterday.  By coincidence, I was watching the presentation of the results on BBC Northern Ireland when Mr. Mike Nesbitt, the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, paid a most fulsome tribute to the T&aacute;naiste and his work in Anglo-Irish relations.  While Members sometimes were critical of him for not being in the country, that was his portfolio, namely, foreign affairs.  Mr. Nesbitt said his address to the British-Irish Association in Cambridge last September was most inspiring and stimulating.  The T&aacute;naiste invited Mr. Nesbitt and Ulster Unionists to attend in Dublin when the centenary of the Easter 1916 Rising was being commemorated and Mr. Nesbitt said on that programme that he valued that invitation immensely.  Moreover, he stated that in the same spirit, he would extend an invitation to President Higgins to visit Stormont.  I believe the T&aacute;naiste's record in Anglo-Irish relations was paid a very warm tribute on that occasion by the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party.  I add to this the T&aacute;naiste's courtesy to this House and when Members met him around the corridors of Leinster House and so on.  One wishes the T&aacute;naiste well in his future career.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-05-27a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1172" speakername="Aideen Hayden" time="15:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014052700006#E00300"><p>I also echo the remarks of Senator Darragh O'Brien on the setting up of an electoral commission, as well as Senator Bacik's comments.  As somebody who sat through a count from Saturday night until 7 a.m. on Sunday morning and who is returning tomorrow morning to a count in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, it is not acceptable either to those who work on these counts or to the candidates themselves.  The individual councillor concerned, Jane Dillon Byrne, has been a councillor for 40 years and it is outrageous to find oneself in an electoral system in which one is subjected to that type of endurance test.</p><p>I also add my voice to the other voices that have paid tribute to the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore.  It is important to remember that he has been the leader of the Labour Party for seven years, has led the Labour Party to its best ever electoral performance and to the election of President Higgins, who has done this country nothing but proud.</p> <p> History will be very kind to Eamon Gilmore.  His key role, particularly in our very successful EU Presidency at a time when our reputation was, not to put too fine a point on it, in the toilet is something that will always be remembered.  I also believe that he acted with dignity in stepping down when he did and that he did not subject this country to weeks and months of uncertainty.  As a Labour Party Senator and the party Whip in this House, I thank him for that dignity and consideration he paid to the members of the Labour Party and to the people of Ireland.</p><p>I thank Senator Zappone for her intervention in regard to housing.  It is a matter of urgency that we have a more fulsome debate on the Construction 2020 programme.  There is a good deal that needs to be said regarding the housing crisis here.  In regard to rent supplement, I have a letter from a lady whose rent has been increased to &euro;1,300 and she is in receipt of &euro;880.  She has an autistic child and another child with special needs.  We have reached a point where it is imperative that we deal with the whole issue of rent supplement and, as many Members will know, I have personally called on a number of occasions for the introduction of legislation to control rents.  I echo Senator Zappone's call for the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, to come into the House in order that we can have a more fulsome debate on this matter.  We will be speaking to the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, tomorrow on the rent supplement issue.</p></speech>

It always gives us pause for thought when we see so many good councillors from different parties lose their seats, sometimes through no fault of their own, and on this occasion it seemed the tide was out for the Government parties.  We on this side of the House are aware of how quickly the tide can go out at certain times.  I pay tribute to all those who fought a brave fight but unfortunately did not make it and to congratulate those who did make it.  In the case of our party, particularly at local authority level, we have made some significant gains and that in itself is pleasing to somebody like myself who has run the Seanad trail.</p><p>I endorse what our leader in the House, Senator Darragh O'Brien, said with regard to the medical card issue.  I would also like to have a debate on that issue in the House as soon as is practicable and if one is not forthcoming I will move an amendment to the Order of Business not today but early next week to ensure that we have a debate on it.  It is mind-boggling that with regard to a number of medical card applications I have pursued for people who have a genuine reason for having one, there has been a demand for information such as home insurance details.  I do not know what that has information has to do with an application for a medical card.  I have come across three or four such demands.  Also more information has been sought in respect of people in receipt of a disability allowance who have been means-tested.  I am also surprised by the number of documents that have been submitted that have been lost or mislaid.  People in receipt of farm assist who have been means-tested in the past 12 months, and whom the Department of Social Protection has acknowledged are entitled to farm assist, or people who are long-term unemployed, are being scrutinised again by the medical card central office.  The Minister and his Government colleagues do not seem to realise the dreadful pedantic approach that is being taken in this respect.  The Department was described by somebody previously as being in Angola and the approach to dealing with medical cards is so unprofessional and incoherent that those working in this area need to be given a kick where it would hurt.  </p><p>Housing is a major problem not only in Dublin but nationally.  In my county and home place of west Cork there is a great demand for housing and the number of people on housing lists has been the highest in the past decade.  It is bewildering to think that this should be the case when there seems to be a huge surplus of houses throughout the country and that a great number of houses are now under the control NAMA.  There might be a problem in terms of the number of houses and apartments in Dublin but somebody should rethink a national strategy to get people into houses that are currently idle and that cannot be sold.</p></speech>

I hope that many of them will return to public life.  I congratulate our four colleagues in the Seanad who contested the European elections, namely, Senators Clune, Byrne, Higgins and Mullen.  All of them performed admirably.  It was a worrying development to hear Senator Higgins speak on radio this morning about the awful personal abuse she received on social media during the course of her campaign.  This is a matter we need to discuss in future.</p><p>I join my colleagues in thanking the T&aacute;naiste for his outstanding contribution to rebuilding our country and restoring our reputation abroad.  I have known the T&aacute;naiste since our secondary school days in Garbally College in Ballinasloe.  He is a man of great integrity and ability, and he put the country first.  Every person in this country owes him a debt of gratitude.  History will be kind to him.</p><p>I join the calls for a debate on the medical card situation.  Now that the people have spoken, they have given a wake-up call to the Government.  The people are impatient with the pace of recovery and, while they recognise that the country was in an appalling state when this Government took over, we need to redouble our efforts to grow the economy.  I welcome that significant numbers of additional jobs were announced today for Galway and Athlone by SAP and Ericssons.  The Government has been seen to be somewhat uncaring on the issue of medical cards.  Some of the questions that people are being asked defy logic.  We need to examine this entire area.  I question the quality of the management team running the medical card system.  Is it fit for purpose?  I suspect it would not survive in private enterprise.  I urge the Leader to organise a debate on the medical card system at the earliest opportunity because some of the decisions taken in recent times are not right.</p></speech>

What happens within the Labour Party and other parties in terms of changes in Ministries and elsewhere is not my call and I am not here to criticise.

However, Ministers have come into this House and ignored warnings from Senators across all parties, Government and elsewhere.  They have ignored disagreements expressed by Senators, as well as amendments, judgments and suggestions from Senators.  Everybody in the House speaks about the one or two amendments we got through but what about the hundreds or thousands of amendments that were ignored?  I have a feeling that since the Seanad was given a reform agenda by the Irish people we have been ignored even more.</p><p>I offer some examples of how we have been ignored across all parties.  The respite grant for carers should never have been cut.  The cuts to the funeral grant and the telephone grant should never have happened.  The cutting of community workers' portfolios should not have happened.  Upward-only rents should never have happened.  There has been a lack of attention to means testing as opposed to universality across medicine, education, health and social welfare.  The Seanad has a great deal to offer across all parties and none.  I would go so far as to suggest to the Government that some Senators should be considered as junior Ministers.  I say that from the perspective of a politically independent Member.</p> <p>I wish to make the case that we should have a special session in this House and invite Garda Wilson and Sergeant McCabe to address us.  These are two men-----</p></speech>

It is not plausible to me that the list of complaints and irregularities which were brought to bear by these two men over a long period of years were not known to many other people.  A very limited number of people have had responsibility apportioned to them and have either taken their own course of action or have had it forced upon them, but the culture within the public service indicates to me that what happened to these men and the reaction which occurred when they brought serious matters to light, was not an isolated occurrence.</p><p>This is the way our public service works routinely: I have seen it in the health service; I have seen it in the enforcement arms of the health service; I have seen it in State-funded institutions; I have seen it when health professionals have pointed out problems; and I have seen administrators try to blacken the name of individuals who have pointed out real and genuine discrepancies.  I am afraid that the fact that it is so widespread and so widely tolerated, speaks to something within our national culture.  I think we have a tendency to form tribal divisions and that this is the only possible explanation one could have when after the last elections, two broadly similar political parties with broadly similar sets of policies and a third party which had very different policies, re-arranged themselves into a coalition where one of the major parties and one of the other parties that had the different perspective, came together, the reason being that we tend to form clubs, cliques or tribes.  Anyone who breaks ranks will be criticised.  Anyone informing on problems will be considered to be a tout or an informer.  This is what has happened.</p><p>We need to give great air play to what these two men did.  There is much that we could learn and there is much that the public service could learn and there is much that our broader society could learn about the importance of telling the truth, even if it is inconvenient for those who identify themselves as being our allies.  </p></speech>

In addition to repaying debt, I believe it is using its cash reserves prudently to add further value to its portfolio.  This is providing benefits for the wider economy which are very welcome.  NAMA has been in part responsible for a resurgence of activity in the Irish property market and it has made assets available in line with the market's absorption capacity and it is now in a position to accelerate asset disposals - thanks be to God - because of the improvements, as well as repaying senior bonds, which is most important and is in the taxpayers' interests.  As we have noted recently, it has managed to dispose of a number of very fine hotels, the attached loans of which had been on its books.  I wish to acknowledge the marked pick-up in all markets, thanks be to God.  Long may that work continue in the best interests of taxpayers.</p></speech>

Over recent months the State has lost the Garda Commissioner, the Minister for Justice and Equality, the T&aacute;naiste and the Government parties have lost MEPs and council seats up and down the State.  In my view the Government parties have been given a very clear message by the electorate who are sick and tired of the unfairness of many of the policy choices which have been made by this Government.</p> <p>One of those policies relates to the provision of medical cards.  It is not so long ago that Senators on this side of the House, including Sinn F&eacute;in, Fianna F&aacute;il and some Independent Members, pointed to the cut in funding for medical card provision contained in the budget.  Fine Gael and Labour Party Members voted for that cut.  For Senator Mullins and others in the Fine Gael Party to seek now to place responsibility for the current fiasco on the shoulders of the management and staff of the medical card processing unit, who are, after all, overseeing Government policy, is absolutely outrageous and despicable.  Colleagues opposite should take responsibility for their own actions.  They and their party voted for these cuts and are therefore responsible for carers, people with disabilities and sick people losing their medical cards.  They should man up and, instead of blaming staff, take responsibility themselves.</p><p>I am in agreement with Senator O'Donnell regarding all of the Government failures she listed.  However, the Senator has a brass neck to claim to be independent given that she has stuck with Fine Gael through thick and thin in this House.</p></speech>

In fact, there was an acknowledgement before the elections that the system is not working well.  It is an issue that requires a great deal of careful attention in the coming weeks.  We as a Government must show that we care for and have empathy with people who are vulnerable.</p><p>The comments that have been made regarding my friend and colleague, Senator Lorraine Higgins, are outrageous.  Unfortunately, we have all become too used to that type of negative commentary.  When I had a harmless enough article about sugar published in a newspaper some time ago - I realise that I probably bore everybody by going on about the health effects of alcohol and sugar - I was subjected to a large number of very negative personal comments.  I do not know why I read them.  There is a growing view that it is unacceptable for people sitting at home in their armchairs to conduct themselves in this way on social media.</p> <p>As Senator Mullins suggested, it is something we should debate in this House in the near future.

I do not think it required an election campaign for all of us to accept there is a housing crisis, but the Government's response will be key.</p><p>We will require a housing solution and not a developer solution.  The outgoing T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Gilmore, made an interesting comment last week, which I would like fleshed out further, that he would view the Government's proposal as one which would be supportive of builders and not developers.  We must concentrate on that particular phrase because, tragically for this country, our construction policy over the past two decades has not been people-led, Government-led or homeless-led but has been developer-led.  A small clique of people have forced decisions on Governments, or have induced Governments to take certain housing policy decisions, which have visited chaos and rack and ruin on this nation.  We must ensure Construction 2020 or, one hopes, a variation of it will come into being to look after the genuine housing needs of the people of this country, the homeless and young people who cannot find houses, and not be a plan to suit the so-called construction industry.  I hope the debate requested by Senator Zappone and supported by Senator Hayden, as is often the case, will take place and that it will be an open debate where Senators are free to express their views on how housing policy is designed in this country.</p><p>On the local election issue, I pay tribute to all the winners and commiserate with all the losers.  We must also reflect on the fact that almost half of the people did not vote, which is probably the biggest political statement of all.  We are all political anoraks in this House but I watched much of the television coverage and listened to much of the radio coverage and what struck me was that the various party spokespersons spoke about the elections in terms of what they meant for the parties.  They made no reference to what the elections meant to the people and what the people actually said.  It should not be about whether one party is up or another party is down and what it means for the future plans of political parties or Governments.  We must reflect on the message from people and what policy measures the public is asking us to reflect on.  That is really what the debate is about.</p><p>I support Senator Cullinane's request.  I have said this on a number of occasions, not only in this Seanad but in the previous two Seanaid.  Each Minister should come to this House to debate their departmental programmes.  As Senator O'Donnell said, many of the problems Ministers are only now seeing have been reflected on and debated in this House over the past two years but one would wonder if anybody has been listening.  This should be a House of debate and we need Ministers to come to the House regularly.  We will make positive suggestions and it is to be hoped they will listen.</p></speech>

When we went into government, people were willing to pay so much to address the finances of this country, but I do not think they have the capacity to pay for everything.  I do not think we can ask ordinary people to pay completely the bills for bad banking and so on.</p> <p>I congratulate Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan on an extraordinary result in the elections for the European Parliament. </p></speech>

That has become evident to everybody, including those in his own party, at this stage.  I concur with Senator Bacik's comments about the T&aacute;naiste, as he handled his exit from the leadership in a very dignified way.  I had many differences with him over policy but I acknowledge his courtesy and assistance in the many representations we made to his office over the past three years.</p><p>Will the Leader arrange the debate I previously sought regarding the Dublin and Monaghan bombings?  I attended the commemorations at Talbot Street and I listened to the fine words of the Taoiseach and subsequently noted the comments of our President regarding justice for the victims.  Those fine words will be of no consequence if they are not backed up by strong action, particularly with the British Government and authorities, in finding the truth.</p><p>There are lessons to be learned from the recent election and these must be taken on board by everybody in these Houses, and particularly the Government parties which control policy.  The medical card issue is not the only matter, and it would be a major mistake to focus exclusively on it, although it is certainly a major problem.  Other issues include the drugs payments scheme, which we noted on the campaign trail is putting pensioners in a position where they must cut back on the drugs they need because they cannot afford to meet their cost.  That is a scandal.  There are also people on waiting lists who are having difficulty accessing necessary services.  Piling public hospital bed costs on private insurers on behalf of people who have for their entire lives paid social contributions is driving those people from the health insurance market because they cannot afford to pay the premia.</p><p>This is only a small part of a range of issues we must acknowledge, including the taxing of pensions, homelessness and the aces given by a former Minister, Deputy Shatter, to bankers.  People who have borrowed money and are the drivers of this economy - if they can extricate themselves from difficulties - have been left to the tender mercies of the bankers which caused this collapse.  It is no wonder that people feel disaffected, and I support the call made for a rolling debate in this House that should involve the Ministers in Departments responsible for much of this disaffection.  Across the party lines Members should not be afraid to concentrate on and criticise policies which have gone against the interests of our citizens and our people.  The Seanad is the place to do this.  We should forget the tight control of Whips and look to represent the people, as that is what they want us to do.  The public does not feel represented at this stage, which is the real message of the recent elections.</p></speech>

There is a trauma in losing an election and in my area, one man lost by the swing of one vote after two and half recounts.  It is very difficult for him and his family to deal with that.  Much has been said about the leadership of the Labour Party and how Sinn F&eacute;in performed but it is time somebody mentioned the leadership of Fianna F&aacute;il and our organisation throughout the country.  A major marker has been put down for the future revival of our party, and this is a very important staging-post in our renewal.  We are the leading party in the country at local authority level and we have the majority in many of the councils in the country.  We are getting this back slowly but surely because we have proven to be an Opposition party of responsibility.</p><p>Now that we have so many Sinn F&eacute;in councillors and anti-austerity candidates - fair play to them for being elected fairly and squarely - I challenge them to step up to the mark.  They should not sit back in Kerry, Cork, Dublin or Galway and wait for Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Labour to put together a majority group with the responsibility of running a council for the next five years.</p> <p>It is time to step up to the mark and get involved, to take it on and pass a budget for the people and stop fooling them that they will get everything for nothing.</p><p>The Leader will be delighted to hear what I have to say as I am sure he thought I was a broken gramophone record the number of times I raised the state of Charleville railway station and the fact that elderly people have to climb a rickety steel stairs to get from one side of the platform to the other.  I came to Dublin by train this morning and noted that work has just commenced on a state-of-the-art, spanking new lift for the public.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-05-27a.108" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1145" speakername="Feargal Quinn" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014052700014#N00400"><p>I am aware that every time I raise anything to do with the budget the Leader says it is a budgetary matter and discussion on it will take place at a later stage, but it is fair to mention that we live in an economy in which we do not have the freedom to tax people without realising that they have the opportunity to go abroad for goods or services, in particular with the Internet.  My attention was drawn to something of which I was not aware.  I do not attend horse racing meetings but I note that it has been estimated that &euro;1.5 billion of betting money goes offshore because no tax is paid on it when one gambles on the Internet or one does it abroad.  I take independent Irish bookmakers as an example, but one could as easily take grocers or others who face the same challenge.  If one puts a tax on an Irish company, one cannot enforce it if one is able to buy things abroad, in particular on the Internet.  The Minister for Finance should be reminded of the point, although I am sure he is well aware of it.</p><p>Many years ago when the former Minister, Charlie McCreevy, announced in this House that he was reducing the betting tax from 20% to 10%, there were howls of protest and it was said that he was looking after his friends in the horse racing industry.  The following year he revealed to the House that he had made more money from the tax being at 10% than he had when it was 20% and he was going to reduce it to 5%.  He again made more money on the 5% tax than he had made on the 10% tax.  That is a real reminder to us, and it was before the advent of Internet betting.  It is important to remind the Minister that every time one taxes something in Ireland, if it is capable of being avoided by going on the Internet, we will lose out.  Let us ensure we are aware of that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-05-27a.109" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1130" speakername="Maurice Cummins" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014052700014#N00500"><p>Like many Members I join in the congratulations to all those who were successful in the various elections, both local, national and European, and commiserate with the people who lost out, many of them having given 20 years or 30 years of loyal service to the people they represented.  We should think of them as well today.</p><p>Senator Darragh O'Brien raised the question of an electoral commission.  My understanding is that it is in the programme for Government and should and will be delivered.  The point was also raised by Senator Bacik.  I will try to get an update for the House on the creation of an electoral commission.</p><p>Several Members also raised discretionary medical cards.  The issue has been raised in this House on a number of occasions.  I agree that in many instances the communications that have been sent to pensioners and people with long-term illnesses have been less than acceptable.  Surely there is something wrong with a system that asks for such information from people in their 80s and 90s who have a discretionary medical card and who were reviewed last year.  Such people should not be asked again for information when they were given a medical card that is valid until 2018.  That is the type of thing that is going wrong for which there is no explanation.  I do not stand over such practices.  It is bureaucracy gone mad.  I agree that the matter stops with the Minister.  He must take action to ensure this does not continue.  The Government will respond and the matter will be dealt with in early course.</p></speech>

Any drug that improves the lives of people should be paid for.  I will certainly raise that matter with the Minister.  A cost of &euro;240 a month is not an extraordinary amount to ask if it improves the lives of people significantly.</p><p>Senator Bacik and other Labour Senators raised the matter of the resignation of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore.  He and the Labour Party have been very courageous on making collective decisions that have pulled this country back from the brink of economic collapse and put it on the path to recovery.  We realise more than anyone else that it is just the path to recovery and that there is much more to go.  Over the next two years, we will prove to the people that we were worthy to be elected and will be worthy for re-election on two years&rsquo; time.</p><p>Senator Zappone raised the publication of the Government&rsquo;s implementation plan on homelessness which has many positive aspects.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, made a presentation on this issue to the Cabinet today.  I have asked for her to attend the House on numerous occasions.  Now that the process is complete on homelessness, I hope she will address the matter with the Seanad soon.  I am sure Senators can make suggestions on dealing with the problem too.  Senators Zappone and Hayden also raised the need for regulation in the private-rented accommodation sector.  That is another matter on which I have asked the Minister of State to address in the House.</p><p>Some Members always raise the matter of Ministers not attending the House.  I can only ask Ministers to attend the House; I cannot compel them.  I am doing my best to get those Ministers requested to come here.</p><p>Senator Barrett lauded the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore, and referred to the tributes paid to him by the Unionist leader, Mike Nesbitt, for his work on Anglo-Irish relations in particular.  I also agree with Senator Hayden that history will be very kind to him.</p></speech>

A new scheme is already in place for local authorities with &euro;20 million allocated for such social housing units to be repaired for much-needed rehousing of people.</p><p>Senator Mullins and Noone raised the issue of personal attacks on social media against our colleague Senator Higgins.  Such attacks are deplorable on any individual.</p><p>Senator O&rsquo;Donnell asked if the Government would listen more to what Senators have to say.  I regret the subsequent attack from Senator Cullinane about her voting record as an Independent.</p> <p>While I would prefer if Senator O'Donnell would vote with this side of the House on all occasions, she is an independent person and votes according to her conscience, as I am sure she will always do.</p><p>Senator Crown raised the Garda whistleblowers and, as the Cathaoirleach said, it is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and the Senator's representative.  The two people in question have already appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts.</p><p>Senator Paul Coghlan raised the progress of NAMA in many areas in the interests of the taxpayer.  I agree with Senator Cullinane that this Government has been given a clear message by the public, to which it will respond positively.  Positivity is not, and never has been, in the vocabulary of Sinn F&eacute;in.  It thrives on the misery of others and hopes that people would be like that.  We will respond positively to what the people are asking us to do.  We have two more years and, much to the disappointment of the other side of the House, we will deliver over the next two years.</p><p>I mentioned Senator Noone's points when I responded to Senator Cullinane and she also mentioned social media.  Senator Bradford raised the housing crisis debate and said the response should not be developer-led.  I agree with him on this and I have commented on the availability of Ministers.  Senator Kelly spoke on a disconnect between the Government and the people.  For a minute or two I thought he was Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan, MEP's election agent, but I note his points.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 2, 10 and 11 relate to re-registering Shannon Airport as a plc rather than a limited company.  Essentially, the Shannon Group itself will be a plc but its subsidiaries will be limited companies.  That is standard for other semi-State companies, such as Bord G&aacute;is and Irish Water.  It is designed to reduce the administrative and accounting burden on those companies.</p><p>Amendment No. 2 is a technical amendment to the definition of the Shannon Airport Authority in the definitions section of the Bill.  It allows for the application of either the name, &quot;Shannon Airport Authority, public limited company&quot;, or the name, &quot;Shannon Airport Authority Limited&quot;, depending on whether the re-registration of Shannon Airport Authority to a private limited company has taken place or not.</p><p>The purpose of amendment No. 10, the substantive amendment, is to put an appropriate and symmetrical administrative and reporting structure in place to match the new ownership arrangements.  The Shannon Group, as the holding company, will be the main reporting body for the group.  It will be the nexus of decision-making and direction for the group and will produce a full annual report, etc., and report in detail to the Minister as set out in the legislation.  It is normal that the subsidiaries of Shannon Group, as the holding company, be registered as private limited companies.  As I mentioned, other State bodies, such as ESB, Bord G&aacute;is and Bord na M&oacute;na, use the same approach.  Shannon Development is already a private limited company and no change is required to its status.</p><p>Amendment No. 11 is a technical consequential amendment to reflect the name change of the Shannon Airport Authority and amendments Nos. 12 to 14, inclusive, are mainly corrections of references to the name DAA plc in earlier legislation.</p></speech>

I understand that the Commission for Aviation Regulation will publish on Thursday the report on cost overruns in terminal 2 in Dublin Airport and the implication for pricing.  In addition, the airports regulator's term of office ends on Friday.  There are contemporaneous issues and they are important for us to consider.<br />The Bill states that the Shannon Group shall, on formation day, prepare and submit to the Minister, for approval by the Minister with or without amendment, a strategic plan for the next period of five years from that anniversary, and I seek in my amendment to involve the Commissioner for Aviation Regulation in that decision.  The history of airport regulation in Ireland indicates that we need an independent regulator.  Indeed, that is the problem the Minister is addressing.  I refer to an airport, as the Minister stated on the last occasion, which lost 61% of its passengers in a short period of time.</p> <p>I refer to an airport which, when the commissioner did regulate it, was found to be an inefficient user of capital and an extremely low-productivity user of labour.  The problem of the history of airport regulation in Ireland is that Shannon and Cork airports were taken out of the regulation in 2004 but the productivity problem in Shannon was not addressed.  The Minister now seeks to do this and has my support in that regard.  Cork Airport, which had good labour and capital productivity, acquired an unnecessary terminal about which the airlines warned at the time and Dublin went on a spending spree that will be reported upon this Thursday.  This was done with Shannon and Cork airports being removed from the remit of the Commission for Aviation Regulation.  Effectively, this is also what happened in Dublin because the then Minister, Noel Dempsey, issued a directive to the Commission for Aviation Regulation to proceed with terminal 2 regardless of the economic advice.  Charges increased by 40% at Dublin Airport, by more in Shannon and there was a huge decline in traffic. </p><p>Consequently, independent regulation is needed lest one has a repeat whereby it is left to the discretion of the Minister.  Moreover, that order by the then Minister, Noel Dempsey, was never published by the Department.  The commission published it on its website and people like Paul Gorecki from the ESRI, who deal in competition matters, have pointed out that this was an example of the capture of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, in this case by Aer Rianta.  I overheard the Minister state on RTE last week that his Department used to be called the &quot;downtown office&quot; of Aer Lingus but in this case it certainly became the downtown office of Aer Rianta.</p><p>The record of carelessness in capital investment and low productivity - the numbers are available for all three Aer Rianta airports - shows the need to have the regulator involved.  Shannon had extremely low labour productivity and there was an unnecessary level of construction there.  It must start to sweat the assets and this information must be published.  When the Commission for Aviation Regulation was first set up, within months it had been sued by the body it was attempting to regulate in the public interest.  The court cases ran on for years and a large part of the expenses of the Commission for Aviation Regulation pertained to the legal fees it incurred defending itself against the body it was founded to regulate in the public interest.</p><p>In these amendments, I am proposing that transparency be reintroduced into this area and that we opt for openness and independence.  This relates to some of the voting decisions people made last Friday, in that these areas must be openly evaluated.  When the directive went ahead in respect of Dublin, one was told the protection was that there would be consultation with the users.  I have attended some of those meetings at the request of airlines and the people at the top table dictate, they do not consult.</p><p>As for independent verification of the final specifications and costings for terminal 2, that never happened and the independent regulation of airport charges did not happen either.  This is part of the kind of construction industry that got Ireland into so much trouble and it needs independent appraisal.  This is necessary to ensure that empire building within the airport sector does not take hold again because it has done serious damage to the sector and to the public finances.  The realisation must be that since we now have fiercely and furiously competing airlines, the same kind of assessment of efficiency must apply to airports.  Perhaps in the past it did not matter because the airlines did not compete and the airports knew they did not compete and consequently could pass on whatever charges they wished.</p> <p>The theme music was something like "I Dreamt I Dwelt In Marble Halls" but there was an edifice complex, and it must be controlled because I would be afraid it would happen again.  In particular, I am waiting to see what the regulator makes of the cost overrun.  One estimate is that the cost overrun for terminal 2 was fivefold - that the cost of it, which came in at &euro;1.2 billion, should have been &euro;200 million.  There is a largely empty terminal in Cork as well and Shannon is similarly burdened.   </p><p>We need to impose efficiency on this sector.  I regret that a former Minister, Noel Dempsey, was apparently captured, perhaps due to pressure from people such as the chambers of commerce and IBEC, as I recall, to build a terminal.  There are airports the size of Cork and Shannon throughout the UK and two in Northern Ireland, one of which is about the same size and the other is a little bigger, and they operate as businesses doing business with airlines.  We have not had that tradition.  We have had wasteful capital expenditure and a seriously low productivity problem in Shannon in particular.  One of the estimates for Shannon is that ratio of passengers to staff members is nine passengers per each staff member per day - 3,500 passengers per year.  That number is unacceptably low.  We must make sure, through independent regulation, that such low productivity and inefficient use of capital can be ground out of the system. </p><p>That is reason I want the proposals in amendments Nos. 3 and 4 to be independently assessed as well as submitted to the Minister.  The Bill provides that the &quot;Shannon Group may, in consideration of the performance of its functions, make such charges as it considers appropriate, to its subsidiaries or any other person, other than the Minister, for services rendered by it and the carrying out by it of activities.&quot;  It is interesting that the Minister is exempt from that and that the charges the Shannon Group wishes to impose are what it considers appropriate, not what the airlines consider appropriate and not what would be in the wider public interest.  Given what has happened, including what this Bill seeks to address, to make Shannon an efficient airport, an asset to the region it serves, there is a role for independent regulation.  That is the reason I put forward amendments Nos. 3 and 4.  </p><p>It was A mistake in 2004 to remove the regulator with regard to Cork and Shannon Airports and it was also a mistake when terminal 2 was permitted to do so by the ministerial directive, ordering the independent regulator for the sector to finance, through a 40% increase in airport charges, the construction of a terminal which the independent advice said was not necessary.  It does not give me any great satisfaction to show that the critics were in fact right.  I believe that is what will be vindicated when the commissioner's report on the cost overrun on terminal 2 comes out on Thursday.  </p><p>Airport operation and construction may be too important, and certainly too expensive, to be left to airport operators.  The trend in Europe is towards independent and commercial operation of airports.  We do not have that here yet but we need to bring the efficiency of Irish airports far closer to the international average.  That is what the independent research showed us.  Ours is not at the international average.  The costs are borne by wider society.</p><p>My amendments propose that there should be a role for the Commission for Aviation Regulation.  The role of the commission should not have been bypassed by a former Minister, Noel Dempsey, in 2007 when the decision was made not to have competing terminals because other people wanted to build competing terminals at Dublin Airport.  In 2004 its role was removed from Shannon and Cork and its role could have been of value in that Cork might not have an unnecessary terminal at this stage and Shannon could have tackled its labour productivity problem, to which the commissioner drew attention in his earlier reports.</p></speech>

I have not seen the report that is being issued on Thursday.  I think it is a draft determination on the charges for the next quinquennium.  I am not sure that it deals with cost overruns in terminal 2 but if it does I will be interested in studying its findings because obviously I have an interest in the matter.  The Senator's comments in regard to the former Minister, Mr. Dempsey, are correct.  It is not a letter that I would have signed and in the three years I have been in office I have made no such directions to the regulator because I favour independent regulation.  In the fullness of time people will see terminal 2 as a good investment but perhaps it might have been built much more cheaply or operated differently.  However, I think it was the right decision to build a second terminal.  The high cost of the terminal in Cork has certainly made matters difficult for that airport because its operating costs are extremely high.  In many ways, this is why Cork cannot now be separated.</p><p>I appreciate the motives behind the Senator's amendments are strong but I do not propose to accept them.  I see exactly where the Senator is coming from in theory but I do not want add to the bureaucratic burden of this new airport when there is no need to do so.  As he pointed out, regulation of airport charges at Shannon and Cork by the Commission for Aviation Regulation ended with the State Airports Act 2004.  That was probably the correct approach because these airports are very small, with only 1 million of the 24 million or 25 million passengers travelling through the State's airports going through Shannon, fewer than 3 million going through Cork and fewer than 1 million going through Knock.  These are small airports and I would rather see them compete freely and independently than fetter them by regulation.  Regulation makes sense in regard to Dublin Airport, which dominates with its more than 20 million passengers.</p><p>As part of the draft aviation policy document published recently, an independent review of economic regulation will be carried out.  I will give consideration to the Senator's ideas in that context.  Subject to what may emerge from the review, my view is that Shannon Airport should not be subject to such regulation or oversight and should be allowed to compete freely.</p><p>The draft aviation policy also makes reference to making key aviation statistics available in one repository.  The indicators that the Senator suggested will be considered in that context.  The Senator's amendment No. 22 is a good amendment.  These kinds of statistics need to be made readily available to us and a Government body should have the power to collect them.  We are doing something similar on land transport.  For the first time, we are collecting statistics on passenger numbers from private operators.  Several months ago I signed a statutory instrument giving the National Transport Authority the power to collect that information.  I would like to see something similar in aviation but I am not sure that the CAR is the correct body.  Perhaps the CSO, the IAA or my Department should carry out this work.  While I accept amendment No. 22 in principle, I would like to return to it on Report Stage when I have determined which is the right body to collect these statistics.  I agree, however, that they should be collected and published by a Government body.</p><p>Shannon Airport wants to stand on its own two feet.  It has never sought Exchequer support.  It wants to demonstrate that if it is free from DAA control, it will be able to turn Shannon into a successful business.  This is where the financial discipline the Senator has in mind should arise.  This discipline will come in part from the fact that it will have to compete with other airports and, therefore, need to control its cost base in order to compete.  Shannon has made a good start on that road and, at this stage, we should leave it at it to see how it proceeds.  If anything, the indications are that since it became independent it has been able to reach deals with airlines to reduce airport charges in return for growth.</p> <p>They have been able to do that without having to deal with a regulator.  The solution in this case is competition, not regulation.  In my view, prices need to be regulated if there is no competition but this is less necessary where there is competition and, in particular, when the competitor is a very small body, it makes more sense to allow that competitor to compete freely but to put in place price caps on the dominant body, which in this case is Dublin Airport.  </p><p>The Senator made a good point about how airline competition rather than regulation of air fares has brought down air fares.  There is a free market resulting in a range of choices for passengers.  In many ways we are hoping to achieve this by allowing competition among the airports.  For those reasons I do not propose to accept the amendments but I welcome amendment No. 22 and I would welcome the opportunity to consider it further and perhaps bring it to Report Stage.</p></speech>

I wish Shannon Airport every success under this regime.  It is essential that it thrives and comes back to where we all want it to be.  I would value the role of the commission.  Like the Minister I look forward to what the commission will say on Thursday.  I will not press amendments Nos. 3 and 4.  I thank the Minister for his comments about output measures for airports which will be dealt with in a later amendment No. 22 proposing a new section 50.</p><p>As we get to this stage there needs to be much better protection for the customers and the airports.  We went through a decade of low productivity and rampant investment which may, in time, as the Minister said, be worthwhile, but in the meantime the debt runs up.  One of the problems in the public finances is that we need new criteria for the assessment of all investment across every Department.  Spending Departments become agents for projects which very often seem to outnumber those of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or the Department of Finance.  Investment for short-term stimulus on all sorts of projects without long-term benefits results in an increase in the debt mountain.  This is a problem we face with a debt to GDP ratio of well over 100%.  Therefore, stricter controls are required on investment.</p><p>The kinds of measures proposed in my amendment and to which the Minister referred, are to show whether we have efficient use of existing assets such as terminals and runways.  There is significant evidence to show that we have not been good in that regard, that our passenger numbers per square metre of terminal, air traffic movements per runway and passengers per terminal are well below international standards.  That gives a feel-good factor in the short term when the terminal is opened and a plaque is unveiled but it piles up debts.  We will need lean and hungry airports.  Some of the information published shows that passenger numbers per departure gate at Dublin Airport are two thirds of the best performing airports and passengers per square metre of terminal are one third of the best performer, and air traffic movements per runway are one quarter of the best performer.  As the Minister said, if we have the lowest cost airlines in Europe, we need to have the lowest cost airports, otherwise airport charges as a percentage of the airline ticket will keep on going up.</p><p>I thank the Minister for his consideration.  I will not press amendments Nos. 3 and 4.</p></speech>

Having reviewed the text and consulted with the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, I am proposing that this provision be removed from the list of grounds for disqualifying directors in subsection 16(9).  The term is considered to be obsolete and is being dispensed with in company law generally.  I am also taking the opportunity to update subsection 16(9)(a), which deals with bankruptcy as grounds for disqualification.  The amendment mirrors what is contained in the Companies Bill 2012, which was passed recently by the D&aacute;il, and makes clear that disqualification will only apply for the duration of the bankruptcy process and cease to apply once the bankruptcy is discharged.</p></speech>

As we already discussed, the difficulty that arose in the past had to do with the directive that was given in writing regarding terminal 2 at Dublin Airport.  I am dissatisfied with this form of provision in general, an issue which also came up during our debate on the legislation to establish Irish Water.  The practice of Ministers giving directions seems to be an attempt to bypass the Oireachtas.  I am proposing, therefore, that if the Minister wishes to give a direction, it should be notified to the appropriate Oireachtas committee.  Facilitating this type of secret activity is not what we came into this House three years ago to do.<br />The Minister has acknowledged that he would not have written the letter his predecessor did in regard to terminal 2.  In fact, he has never issued such a direction during his term of office, which I welcome.  Many of the difficulties that have arisen in respect of the water issue could have been alleviated if the proposals we brought forward in this House had been incorporated into that legislation.  Ministers should seek to bring the Oireachtas in such matters with them by communicating openly.  Unfortunately, what happened with terminal 2 set a very bad precedent.  This amendment seeks to address the issue by requiring the Minister to notify the relevant committee of any proposal to issue a direction.</p></speech>

The Minister has not given any such directions since coming to office, but that is not to say that any future Minister will take the same approach.  In the interests of transparency, Senator Barrett's proposal should be included in this important legislation.  Members of these Houses should be clear on decisions and directions being made in these matters.  The amendment refers to the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications and would apply to any future committee assuming its functions.</p> <p>The committee should be notified should any direction be given from the relevant line Minister.  It is a sensible suggestion and an amendment which will get our support.</p></speech>

The power of direction granted to a Minister in respect of State bodies for which he or she is responsible is a normal provision of any legislation establishing a State body.  In this Bill, the power is constrained in two ways.  The Minister can only make directions to the Shannon group in respect of the performance of its functions and directions can only require it to comply with the policies of Government.  Obviously, the Minister could not direct the Shannon group to act in contravention of Government policy.  It is the primary responsibility of the Minister to oversee and, as necessary, direct the operation of any State bodies under his or her control.</p><p>Before making a decision on this amendment, I have a few thoughts, or a few questions, on which the Senator might expand.  When he said &quot;notify&quot; the Oireachtas joint committee, what would that mean?  Would it just be a letter of notification telling the joint committee what is happening?  Is he suggesting the joint committee would have to hold a hearing on it or have rescinding powers or approval powers?  Would an alternative be that any direction should be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas or just put in the Oireachtas Library as a potential alternative so that at least there is transparency in regard to the directions rather than going by letter to the Clerk?  What would happen if it was a matter of urgency, for example, or, in particular in regard to an airport, it related to State security?  There could potentially be issues about putting a direction before the House, publishing it or making it available to the public if it related to a security matter.  I do not want to recall the Arms Trial, etc., but I think Senators will know what I am thinking about.  I would be interested in the Senator's thoughts on how that might work in practice and what unintended consequences might arise.</p></speech>

That has been of immense use to all sides.  It is one of the innovations introduced in recent times that has worked.  I think there has been a very strong welcome for the people whom the Minister has sent before the joint committee and there has been useful dialogue between the members and the appointees.  I missed the Minister's last nominee, as I was in Belfast with some constituents, but Michael Cawley, his tourism nominee, appeared before the joint committee recently.</p><p>As the Minister suggested, I would have to think about the other ramifications of notification.  Notification would be sufficient, subject to thinking about it between now and Report Stage.  The complaint previously was that there was never notification, except when the commission directed it on its website.  The Department did not put it on its website, so the fact the directive had been issued kind of leaked out, for example, when people like Paul Gorecki of the ESRI were doing research.  I will think about it between now and Report Stage.  I thank Senator Darragh O'Brien for his support.</p><p>The amendment is in line with the Minister's general approach of openness, which is the spirit in which it was put forward.  Government behind closed doors is not a good idea.  It would take the secrecy out of it because members of the committee could tell people.  It would no longer be a secret and would probably lose its value as the term &quot;top secret&quot; would not be on the document.  The wisdom the joint committee would have would be able to respond to the directive.</p><p>As I said earlier, I was hoping the era of secret direction of State companies by Ministers when security of the State is not a concern would end.  There is nothing to be lost by involving people in the decision.</p> <p>For today I will withdraw this amendment and consider an appropriate form to achieve what we want on Report Stage.  This has been an interesting review of it.</p><p>As Senator O'Brien said, this Minister has a philosophy that we like but he may not be in his post forever.  His successor may have other thoughts on the need to keep things secret, in which case we would like to constrain him with our amendment.</p></speech>

Laying the letter before the Houses in the Oireachtas Library would be sufficient.  The amendment could be revised before Report Stage to exclude anything that relates to airport or national security.  It would send out a good message.  It is not my intention that any Minister would have to come in with any direction given to the Shannon group and explain it to a committee, but it is important that it be published and that the structure and process for doing so is clear.  Placing it in the Oireachtas Library would be sufficient.</p><p>An amendment could be tabled on Report Stage to exclude security, not just at Shannon but also national security.  Some of our international friends have used Shannon Airport for the movement of military into Iraq and Afghanistan.  That may happen again in the future.  This affects international security too.  Any future government might deem it necessary to allow Shannon to be used for that type of operation.  I will be interested to hear the Minister&rsquo;s remarks on this point.</p></speech>

It is best to deal with this again on Report Stage when either the Senators or departmental officials may come up with a revised amendment that allows for transparency without any unintended consequences.  In my three years in office I have never issued a direction to a State airport.  There is no secrecy in that regard.</p></speech>

The committee shall report to the Minister within 12 months of the passing of this Act.&quot;.</blockquote>We table this amendment in a positive way because the Bill affords an opportunity for the Minister to reflect on how best to improve linkages and transport connections to and from Shannon Airport which, despite its success and the fact that it is an international airport, is somewhat cut off and depends mainly on bus services and private taxis.  The success of most of the main international airports around the world is predicated on being linked to a major rail network.  In many cases the railway terminal is under the airport building.  We suggest that the Minister consider establishing a group within the next six months to inquire into the feasibility of this proposal, involving members of the Department, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, the Shannon group and any other sectors that he believes could make a positive input to this.</p></speech>

I do not propose to accept the amendment for two reasons.  It is not necessary to legislate to establish a committee.  Were that desirable we could do that in any case.</p> <p>Nonetheless, this has provided an opportunity to discuss the matter.</p><p>In 2006 and 2007, a committee was established representing the local authorities, local development interests and others.  It examined the feasibility of a rail link from Shannon Airport to Limerick and the report concluded that for the link to provide a good quality rail service between Limerick, Shannon and Galway, the cost at 2006 prices would have been &euro;633 million, with an annual operating subsidy of &euro;6 million per annum.  That would be required for approximately 20 years, even if 1 million passengers used the line.  When the project was assessed, it had a negative net present value and a benefit-to-cost ratio from 0.138 to 0.179, even in high-growth scenarios.  For a capital project to be considered, it must have a benefit-to-cost ratio of more than 1, and to be considered for European funding it would need a ratio of more than 1.</p><p>As a result of the poor outcome of that economic evaluation, a decision was made at the time not to pursue it.  Since 2006, the public finances have worsened and we are now tied to particular spending ceilings, so I could not justify approximately &euro;660 million in cuts and tax increases to fund the project when it has been assessed negatively with regard to the benefit-to-cost ratio and net present value.  For those reasons, I ask the Senator to withdraw the amendment.</p></speech>

The figures are not optimistic but we have moved on since 2006.  Although the coffers are not as full as they appeared at that time, there is a new reality in the construction sector and people are getting major projects over the line for sums that are much more realistic than the figures received by the Minister at that time because of certain financial attitudes.  Perhaps it may be the time to have another look at the potential project.  The old argument we have is about where cost and benefit comes in when we try to promote rural Ireland, or in this case the mid-west and the west.  Tourists coming to Ireland through Shannon provide enormous benefit when they go to Galway or Limerick, as opposed to renting a car and heading straight for Dublin.  In the west we seem to be coming out at the wrong end of all this, with matters gravitating towards the east coast.  I will not press the amendment but I may revisit it on Report Stage.  Perhaps we could have a fresh look at those figures.</p></speech>

It does not in any way answer the major uncertainty hanging over the future of the Cork facility.  As it is so vague, it has added to the anxieties that the business community and the people of the south west have about the future of their airport.  It seems as if continuing to have the airport operating as it does, attached to the Dublin Airport Authority, puts it at a major disadvantage to Shannon, which is having its status changed.  We welcome the promotion of Shannon and the investment there, as well as the clearing of the debt.  Nevertheless, we must look to Cork as well.</p><p>The Bill provides for the dissolution of the airport authority in Cork on a day to be appointed by order by the Minister.</p> <p>Cork Airport appears to have been the loser overall in the reconfiguration of the State airports.  We have seen the dramatic fall in passenger numbers, which are down by 28% or 2.35 million in the past five years.  We must see how we can shore that up and protect and enhance the future of Cork Airport.  It seems that Cork Airport is highly unlikely to meet its previously stated target of breaking even on a cash basis by the end of this year.  Its owners remains focused on returning the airport to growth but the Bill does not give them any solid basis in terms of outlining the Minister's plans for the airport.  The latest annual report and accounts from the Dublin Airport Authority, published at the start of May 2014, show that passenger traffic at Cork declined by 3.5% to 2.3 million in 2013.  There were some major factors involved in the decline such as the general weakening in traffic on routes to Britain.  Traffic was also considerably affected by the decision of the Hungarian carrier, Wizz Air, which had operated six routes from Cork to Poland and Lithuania, to cease operating from Cork Airport due to competitive pressures.  Our view is that Cork Airport is suffering due to its position as the DAA's second airport, with Shannon Airport's new independent status making it more competitive in seeking new business.  We propose that the section should be deleted and revisited.</p></speech>

It also provides for the Minister to re-establish the Cork Airport Authority again in the future.  In the interim, provision is made to protect the name &ndash; Cork Airport Authority &ndash; from being registered by anyone else.  Certain consequential amendments to the State Airports Act 2004 are also contained in the section.<br />Two years ago, in connection with its earlier decisions on State airport restructuring, the Government decided that ownership of Cork Airport by the DAA would be maintained for the present but that the matter would be kept under review.  The position has not changed and any proposal to separate Cork Airport from the DAA is not likely to arise in the short term.  The airport would have to be much closer to breaking even in terms of its costs and revenues and there is also the very large debt attached to the terminal, which I do not see being resolved in the near term.  If and when the airport is separated, we will need to have a Cork Airport Authority <i>in situ</i>to receive the business from the DAA and we will re-establish it again at that stage.<br />For the past ten years we have had what I consider to be a rather ludicrous situation, which is a company that is a fully fledged plc under the Companies Act, established for the purpose of owning, managing and operating the airport in Cork, but the company has no airport, staff nor business.  It was a little surreal to have CAA plc in place under those circumstances and it is not a good idea to continue that.  What section 30 does is bring a degree of common sense to the situation and we intend to wind up the company until it is needed.  The Bill makes provision to re-establish the company at a future date if it is needed.<br />In the meantime, rather than having a surreal, phantom company, I have tried to do something a bit more practical that might help the airport grow and develop.  That is why I established the Cork Airport Development Council as a stakeholder body which is multi-sectoral and is designed to boost the development of the airport.  The council had its first meeting in March and I hope to meet it in June.  The council is chaired by the DAA chairman, P&aacute;draig &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, who is from Cork, and contains representatives from the business sectors, including nine external members.  For example, there are representatives of F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Conor Healy from Cork Chamber of Commerce, the airport managing director, John Mullins from the Port of Cork, Michael Murphy from UCC, Eric Nolan from the DAA, Anne-Marie O&rsquo;Brien from Ballydoyle racing stables, Emma O&rsquo;Brien from Clonakilty Chamber of Commerce, Joe O&rsquo;Flynn from SIPTU, Ann-Marie O&rsquo;Sullivan from the board of the DAA, Bob Savage from EMC, Kevin Toland, chief executive of the DAA, Jim Woulfe from Dairygold and Gerry Walsh from the DAA.</p> <p>This is a much more practical way of doing what the Senator wants us to do, namely, grow and develop Cork as an airport and destination rather than having a phantom company run it.  The proposal is to wind that down but allow us re-establish it in the future should it be possible to separate Cork.</p></speech>

Section 30 provides for the dissolution of Cork Airport Authority plc on a day to be appointed, by order, by the Minister.  It also provides power for the Minister to re-establish Cork Airport Authority in the future.  Cork would be in the top 20 airports in the UK and has been affected much less by the recession than Shannon.  I support the Minister&rsquo;s plans for Shannon.  So, why can Cork not have its independence?</p><p>I am slightly biased by the fact that I was born in Cork.  However, I think we are quite capable of running an airport about the same size as Belfast City Airport, Cardiff, Leeds-Bradford or East Midlands.  There are many UK airports the same size as Cork which run themselves.  It is almost like sending down colonial governors from the Dublin Airport Authority to give the benefit of their knowledge to the running of Cork.  Cork Airport should be making its own decisions.  I do not like the idea of the airport run as a colony of Dublin.</p><p>I accept there was an unnecessary terminal built costing &euro;180 million.  The receipts from the sale of the Great Southern Hotels, a sale for which I compliment the Department and others involved as they were sold at the top of the market and the taxpayer and society did well from them, came to &euro;265 million.  That money could have been used to write-off Cork&rsquo;s debt and set it up as an independent entity.  It is the second city in the State and the airports in many European cities are not run by their national airport authorities.  My first forays into writing about this were to persuade the UK Government to abolish the British Airports Authority which it ultimately did.  Having airports compete would be beneficial rather than having Cork in this dependency state with Dublin.</p><p>Who was responsible for the terminal at the airport?  Some future economic historians will point out from the Cork point of view that free capital was distributed from Dublin and it seemed like a good idea at the time.  We know when Cork and Dublin were connected by motorway, car and bus travel became more practical and attractive, meaning bookings for flights between the cities plummeted and now no flights are provided.  There is still, however, a role for Cork to connect the southern province to the UK and mainland Europe.  I would like to see the governance of the airport devolved to its own airport authority and the people of Cork.  It is much more in line with how we think about these things than to have it as some kind of appendage to the Dublin Airport Authority.  I am opposed to this section.</p></speech>

I accept the Minister&rsquo;s point that the situation at the airport is not correct and it is somewhat anomalous to have a company in place where there is no effective work for it to do.  That is, however, what should be addressed rather than winding up the company.  We should also equalise arrangements between Dublin, Shannon and Cork.  Cork is the poor boy of the three and the people there do not accept that.</p><p>The Minister established the forum in question.  Is it a statutory board or just a big quango talking shop?  Does it have powers and responsibilities?  It appears to be a large board to me.</p> <p>We must move on.  The Minister must outline the plans for Cork.  We cannot put this off until another Bill comes before this House in another year or two but should address it under this Bill.  For that reason we oppose this section, which we want deleted.</p></speech>

It has been set up to work with the interests in the area to help us develop the plan for Cork of which the Senator spoke.  Much of what needs to be done there is to increase the number of people visiting Cork.  People do not go to a city to visit its airport, but pass through the airport to reach a city or region.  We need more people to visit Cork.  Unfortunately, it is largely an outbound airport, as the Senator mentioned, with people flying Ryanair or Wizz Air to eastern Europe or going to the Canaries.  We need more people to visit the southern region through Cork.  As the money from the sale of the Great Southern Hotels is long gone, unfortunately, that solution is not available and the net debt of the DAA is still approximately &euro;600 million.</p><p>It is possible for a future Government to take the decision to separate Cork Airport and make it independent and the legislation provides a mechanism by which it could be done.  However, it can be done only when it is right for Cork and the DAA.  It is not right for the DAA now because it carries a debt of &euro;200 million as a result of the new terminal.  If this debt stayed with Cork Airport it would crush Cork while if it stayed with the DAA it would severely damage its balance sheet at a time when it needs to deal with pension issues.  Over time, passengers using Dublin Airport will have to pay down the debt for the terminal.  Unlike Shannon Airport, Cork Airport's operating costs substantially exceed its revenues.  Were it separated now it would immediately be loss-making.  To operate on a commercial basis it would require significant redundancies and-or pay cuts, which nobody is proposing.  While it is not the right time, unfortunately, for Cork Airport to become independent, it could be done when the time is right, and this legislation allows a mechanism for it.</p></speech>

I take the Minister at his word that it could be re-established in the future.  The Minister mentioned that the Cork Airport Development Council committee met in March.  Was that its first meeting?  Is it mandated to have four meetings a year?  How often does it meet?  It is not on a statutory footing.  What role has it been asked to carry out?  How often has it been asked to meet and could it fizzle out?  If we are serious about developing the airport as a hub for the south-west region, I would like the Minister to expand on it.  Was the March meeting the first one?  Is it due to meet again this year and what is the structure of it?</p></speech>

Although I do not know when the next meeting is scheduled, the council is supposed to meet at least quarterly and I intend to meet it when I visit Cork next month.  Its remit is to pull the interests of the region together, try to develop the airport and give people more reasons to visit the region and use the airport.  There is no question about the airport's viability.  It is the second biggest airport in the State in terms of passenger numbers.</p></speech>

Senators will be familiar with the Dublin Airport Authority, or DAA, which is to be renamed "daa", using the lower case.  What is the logic of this change?  I do not have an issue with the use of "DAA" to describe the Dublin Airport Authority.  Will the change to the lower case version be an expensive rebranding exercise that results in new signage, letterheads and so forth?</p><p>The lower case &quot;daa&quot; title is used on the terminal 2 building.  It is legitimate to point out that while the change may appear reasonable, it may be costly and unnecessary if it is made in legislation.  The Bill proposes to change all references to the Dublin Airport Authority to &quot;daa&quot;.  Will this result in all paraphernalia and literature, including brochures, headed paper, compliment slips and business cards, as well as e-mail domain names, websites and signage in the airport, on approach routes and in offices, being changed to reflect the new title?  If so, has such a rebranding exercise been costed?  What expenditure will be incurred to reflect this minor change in name?</p></speech>

There are rebranding merchants at work who cost a fortune and I am not sure they provide value for money.</p><p>I am concerned about the following reference on lines 20 and 21 of page 23: &quot; 'State Airport&rsquo; means an airport in the State, managed and controlled by a company;&quot;.   There must be a word or words missing between the words &quot;a&quot; and &quot;company&quot; as under this definition all airports are declared to be State airports.  Something appears to be missing from the definition of &quot;State Airport&quot;.</p></speech>

I do not know what they accomplish.  They are concerned with images and logos, whereas the efficiency indicators to which the Minister referred relate to realities, which are much more important than images.  I hope the change will not result in the airport incurring the expense of rebranding every sign or piece of paper in the airport, as Senator O'Brien pointed out.  I tend to discount the argument that it will present a more modern image.  The country must address real problems, rather than issues such as nomenclature, image and stationary.  </p></speech>

The Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, was a misnomer from the day the new body was established.  It was given this name because it was intended at the time to separate Shannon Airport and Cork Airport almost immediately and sell off Aer Rianta International, ARI, the retail element which consists of shops, duty free operations and other activities in which ARI engages around the world.  This is no longer the plan and the Dublin Airport Authority title has become a misnomer as it involves Cork Airport and businesses all over the world, especially retail outlets in airports, consulting and shareholdings in other airports.  The Dublin Airport Authority is not solely involved in airports.  Further, it is a company rather than an authority and the use of the word "Authority" in its title gives the impression that it is a State agency.  The title was wrong from the beginning.</p><p>The original cost of changing the name from Aer Rianta to the Dublin Airport Authority was &euro;4 million.  The company investigated what it would cost to rebrand the authority and considered a number of new names as well as the option of reverting to Aer Rianta.  My preferred option was to use the name, Rhiannon, as it recalls the original name of Shannon Airport, Rinneana, and Aer Rianta.  However, the estimated cost of such a rebranding was &euro;3 million, a large sum in the current circumstances.</p><p>The company also carried out consumer research with passengers and business customers.  The response to a proposed name change was firmly negative and considered to be unnecessary, unwarranted, a waste of money and potentially damaging to the reputations of the Dublin Airport Authority and Government.  It was decided, therefore, not to engage in an expensive rebranding exercise and to use instead the existing acronym, DAA, in lower case.</p><p>As Senator Darragh O'Brien noted, the word &quot;daa&quot; is already used on signage and so forth.  The change will not give rise to any costs to the Exchequer, although it may result in a nominal cost to the company as and when letterheads and so forth are replaced.  The point of this change is to avoid an expensive rebranding.  </p></speech>

While the change will not give rise to any costs to taxpayers <i>per se</i>, as it does not involve the expensive rebranding that would have occurred if any of the other proposed name changes had proceeded, the Minister also referred to a nominal cost to the Dublin Airport Authority.  Does the Department know precisely what the DAA must do to comply with this measure if the legislation is passed?  If the only action required will be to change a few letterheads, I will not be unduly concerned.  However, some companies view these types of changes as an opportunity to replace everything, across the board.  In my view, this will not be necessary, although costs of &euro;80,000 or &euro;100,000 may be incurred.  While I do not have an issue with a legislative change to clarify the position regarding the name of the Dublin Airport Authority, I require greater clarity about what costs, if any, will arise for the airport, even if none will arise for the taxpayer.</p></speech>

The Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Bill 2013 is landmark legislation which provides for the establishment of a DNA database.  The database represents a very significant development in the criminal justice system in Ireland.  There are a number of reasons this is the case.  The database will assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the investigation of serious crime and in identifying serial offenders across a broad range of areas, including homicide, rape, sexual and other serious assaults and burglary.  It will play a crucial role in the investigation of so-called cold cases.</p><p>The database will also assist in exonerating the innocent in cases of miscarriage of justice, as has been the case in other jurisdictions.  The database will be an important new tool not only in regard to crime but also in finding and identifying missing or unknown persons.  This capability should serve to provide significant assistance, reassurance and comfort to the families of people in these situations.  In summary, this measure will provide crucial assistance to the Garda and members of the public in vital areas for decades to come.</p><p>The experience in other jurisdictions shows what an important contribution DNA databases make to criminal investigations where crime scenes are examined and produce forensic material.  For example, the UK's national DNA database had a match or hit rate of 61% in 2012-2013.  While hits simply place a person at the crime scene and are not necessarily followed by prosecutions, such a high rate points to the level of intelligence a DNA database can generate.  We should, however, be realistic and not expect such high rates in the early years of our database as the rate is partly dependent on the size of the database and will grow as the database grows.</p><p>The UK database was established back in 1995 and contains more than 6.5 million DNA profiles from individuals.  The establishment of the DNA database is long overdue.  Ireland is almost alone among EU member states in not having such an investigative tool.  Crime, in particular organised crime, is an international phenomenon that transcends national boundaries and there is a greater need than ever for co-operation between police forces to combat it effectively.  The passage of this Bill will facilitate the State in meeting its obligations under EU law and any international agreements which require the State to maintain DNA and fingerprint databases for criminal investigation purposes and facilitate the searching, on a reciprocal basis and under strict conditions, of other states' databases.</p><p>I draw Members' attention to Schedules 2 to 4, inclusive, which contain the texts of the Pr&uuml;m Council Decision, the agreement between the EU, Iceland and Norway applying aspects of the Pr&uuml;m Council Decision, and the Council framework decision on the accreditation of forensic science laboratories.  I mention that the Pr&uuml;m Council Decision is required to be implemented by us by 1 December next.</p><p>It is worth recalling that this Bill is the product of analysis, debate, scrutiny and the observations of numerous interested parties over many years.  The Law Reform Commission published its report on the establishment of a DNA database in November 2005.  The last Government published a DNA Bill in 2010 while this Bill was published by my predecessor last September, and I pay tribute to the work he did on it.  During its passage through the other House, a number of new issues were addressed and further changes were made to the  Bill.  It is now comprehensive legislation which balances the need to have a world class DNA database with the human rights of those whose profiles may be put on that database.  The Bill achieves that balance and I am pleased to note the Irish Human Rights Commission, in its most recent observations on the Bill, has acknowledged that many of the issues it had raised in regard to the 2010 Bill have been addressed.  I am aware that the Irish Human Rights Commission and the Law Society have raised other points concerning the Bill, and I will touch on some of these issues as I go through it.</p><p>The Bill comprises 13 Parts, 172 sections and four Schedules.  Given the size of the Bill and the limited time available, I propose to focus on the key elements in the legal framework for the taking, use and destruction of samples.  There will be an opportunity on Committee Stage to discuss any other aspects of the Bill which Senators would like to explore.</p><p>Part 1 deals with preliminary and general issues.  Sections 2 and 3 provide key definitions and interpretations that are central to understanding the overall framework.  Section 7 covers the necessary transitional arrangements between the existing regime and the commencement of this legislation to protect, for example, proceedings under way based on biological samples taken under the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act 1990 or under common law powers.  In essence, samples taken under the 1990 Act may be put on the database but must be removed in accordance with the provisions of that Act.  Samples taken with consent under common law powers may continue to be used in regard to the purpose for which they were taken but cannot be put on the database.</p><p>Parts 2 to 7, inclusive, contain important provisions as they set out the powers to take samples of various sorts from different categories of persons.  Part 2 is concerned with the taking of samples from persons in Garda custody.  It is important to note, however, that not all suspects in Garda custody will be subject to the Garda powers to take samples under sections 11 to 13, inclusive.  As is the case under the 1990 Act, the powers only apply to those who are in Garda custody under one of the existing detention powers listed in section 9.</p> <p>Subject to a limited exception, the effect is that only those suspects detained in connection with serious offences, by which I mean offences attracting a maximum prison sentence of five years or more, may be required to provide a sample.<br />Section 11 provides for the taking of samples from persons in custody for the purposes of the database.  There is no requirement that they assist in the particular investigation at hand.  Samples taken under this section will be instrumental in populating the database and ensuring its effectiveness as a source of intelligence.  Bearing in mind the non-intrusive nature of the procedure for taking the sample, the consent of the suspect is not required.  However, children under 14 years of age and protected persons are excluded from the provisions in section 11.  Section 11 is the core of the Bill.  It is what will give the database the critical mass that will drive its efficiency and effectiveness.  We have set a high threshold for the taking of samples for the purpose of the database and we have tightened up the destruction regime considerably.  However, it is vital for the functioning of the database as a powerful aid to the investigation of crime that the profiles of those who are convicted of serious offences are retained on the database.<br />Sections 12 and 13 provide for the taking of intimate and non-intimate samples respectively for use in evidence.  Intimate samples include blood, urine, swabs from the genital regions and dental impressions and, due to their nature, require the consent of the suspect and this consent may be withdrawn.  In the event that a suspect refuses to give consent or withdraws consent, adverse inferences may be drawn from this in certain circumstances in subsequent proceedings.  The Bill makes clear, however, that a person cannot be convicted solely or mainly on the basis of such negative inferences.  I am satisfied that these adverse inference provisions are proportionate in all the circumstances.<br />Section 24 provides for the use of reasonable force where a suspect refuses to allow a sample to be taken under section 11 or a non-intimate sample under the other sections.  The use of reasonable force must be authorised by a Garda member not below the rank of superintendent and it must be carried out in the presence of a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of at least inspector rank.  The section does not apply to the taking of a sample from a<i></i>child under section 11 for the purposes of the database but is available for the taking of non-intimate samples from child suspects and protected persons where they are required for evidential purposes.  The Bill applies additional safeguards for the use of reasonable force <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>such persons.  Finally, the taking of samples under reasonable force must, in all cases, be video recorded.  I am aware that concerns have been raised about the use of reasonable force.  As I have explained, these provisions are circumscribed but to my mind must be available to garda&iacute; where required.  Reasonable force is not a novel concept in our law.  It is well understood by garda&iacute;, the legal profession and the courts.  I am satisfied that the provisions in this regard are necessary and proportionate.<br />Part 3 contains provisions covering the taking of samples by consent from volunteers and for mass screening.  Mass screening, or perhaps more accurately, intelligence-led screening, involves inviting a group of individuals, determined by reference to particular characteristic such as age, gender or the geographical area in which they reside or work, to provide samples for the investigation of a particular offence.  The decision to carry out such a screening is essentially an operational one requiring authorisation by a chief superintendent.  Under no circumstances will the DNA profile of a participant be entered in the database.  However, in the event that the screening identifies a potential suspect, he or she may be arrested and detained in connection with the investigation, in which case the sampling powers contained in Part 2 will apply.  Similar provisions to these have been of assistance to police forces across Europe in solving crimes where there was no evidence to directly link a suspect to the crime.<br />Part 4 is an important part of the Bill in terms of populating the database and ensuring that it has the capacity to generate intelligence.  It provides for the taking of samples for the database from offenders and former offenders.  In the case of offenders the following are required to provide samples: all offenders subject to a sentence of imprisonment for a serious offence on the commencement of the Bill, whether they are in prison or living in the community on licence, temporary release or subject to a suspended sentence; those sentenced to imprisonment after commencement in respect of a serious offence; those transferred to prisons in the State following conviction abroad in respect of a serious offence; and those who, on or after commencement, are subject to the sex offender registration requirements.<br />This Part also provides for the taking of samples from former offenders, in other words, those who have served sentences for serious offences or have been subject to the sex offender registration requirements and who continue to be of interest to garda&iacute;.  The Bill provides comprehensive guidance to garda&iacute; to assist them in identifying which former offenders should be requested to provide a sample for the database.  In some cases an application to a District Court judge will be required.  The power extends to former offenders who are now ordinarily resident or have their principal residence in Ireland, regardless of where they were convicted.  It is important to be aware of the risks posed by mobile former offenders and I believe that giving garda&iacute; the power to require such persons to provide samples for the database goes some way towards mitigating those risks.  It is worth saying that these provisions relating offenders and former offenders are expected to be largely transitional as once the Bill is fully operational, the profiles of all persons convicted of a relevant offence will be on the database from the time of their arrest.<br />The provisions in Part 5 arise from the expansion of the use of DNA technology.  It is necessary to provide for the possibility of accidental contamination of a sample by a person who, in an official capacity, attends at a crime scene or who handles a crime scene sample at any stage.  If such accidental contamination is not identified it may lead to garda&iacute; wasting time and effort investigating unidentified crime scene profiles which in fact relate to a garda who investigated the scene or a member the staff of the Forensic Science Laboratory who examined items taken from the scene, or perhaps a scientist or pathologist dealing with the case.  The Bill therefore sensibly provides for the taking of samples from such persons.  The profiles created will then be available to be searched against unidentified profiles from particular crime scene stains for the purposes of elimination from any further consideration in the context of the investigation.<br />Part 6 of the Bill is somewhat different to the previous parts of the Bill which were focused on the taking of samples for the purposes of crime investigation.  This Part is concerned with the use of the database to assist in finding and identifying missing or unknown persons, alive or deceased.  Samples may be taken, for identification purposes, from blood relatives of persons who are missing, from the belongings of the missing person, from living persons who are unable to identify themselves due to injury or illness, or from the remains of unidentified persons.<br />Part 7 deals with the taking of certain samples under Parts 3 and 6 from children or protected persons.  It contains detailed provisions relating to the issue of consent in this regard and on the provision of information to children and protected persons prior to the taking of samples from them.<br />Staying with the taking of samples for a moment, section 157 in Part 13 of the Bill requires those bodies empowered to take samples, namely, the Garda S&iacute;ochana, the ombudsman commission, the Irish Prison Service, the Irish Youth Justice Service and the Forensic Science Laboratory, to prepare draft codes of practice for ministerial approval.  These codes will provide practical guidance as to the procedures for the taking of samples and are intended to ensure proper adherence to the statutory framework and consistency in approach.<br />I wish to turn now to Part 8 of the Bill which deals with the structure and purposes of the DNA database.  Responsibility for the database will rest with the Forensic Science Laboratory, which already has a distinguished record in providing independent expertise in the area of forensics and is well placed to become custodian of the database.  The Forensic Science Laboratory is being renamed Forensic Science Ireland or FSI under section 172 of the Bill.  <br />Section 60 stipulates that the database may be used for two purposes only, namely the investigation and prosecution of criminal offences and the finding or identification of missing persons and the identification of unknown persons.  The database is accordingly divided into an investigation division and an identification division.  These divisions are subdivided into relevant indexes, reflecting the purpose for which the DNA profiles were generated and are held.</p> <p>The DNA database will clearly be a powerful tool and will contain sensitive personal information.  All Senators will, like me, be conscious of the need to ensure the integrity and security of the database is maintained.  Part 9 provides for the establishment of an independent DNA database system oversight committee which will oversee the management and operation of the system.  The committee will review the practices and procedures employed by Forensic Science Ireland in the operation of the database.  It will report at least annually to the Minister and these reports will be laid before the Oireachtas.  Schedule 1 sets out in detail the structure and procedures of the oversight committee, which will be chaired by a judge or former judge of the High Court or Circuit Court, and one of whose members will be nominated by the Data Protection Commissioner.<br />Part 10 deals with the circumstances in which samples and profiles may be destroyed or removed from the database.  This is an important part of the legal framework and marks a significant departure from the approach taken in the 2010 Bill.  The key changes relate to the retention arrangements for samples and the circumstances in which the DNA profiles of persons who are not proceeded against or are acquitted may be retained on the database.  The changes to the proposed retention arrangements for samples and profiles are aimed at ensuring the approach to retention is constitutional and meets the standards of the European Convention on Human Rights, with particular reference to the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of S and Marper <i>v.</i>the United Kingdom.<br />Part 10 provides for: the destruction of samples taken for the purpose of generating a DNA profile for the database as soon as the profile has been generated or within six months of the taking of the sample, whichever is the later; a presumption in favour of removal from the database of the DNA profiles of suspects who are not convicted subject to the commissioner having the power to authorise retention on the database where he or she determines that this is necessary, this decision is appealable to the District Court, the retention periods allowed will be six years in the case of adults and three years in the case of children; and revised arrangements for the retention of samples taken for evidential purposes, including a presumption in favour of destruction of samples relating to suspects who are not convicted, subject to the commissioner having the power to authorise retention for 12 months, which will be renewable, where he or she determines that this is necessary.  This decision is also appealable to the District Court.<br />A statutory review of these arrangements is required within six years, and subsequently whenever the Minister considers it appropriate.  The Bill provides that the six and three-year retention periods mentioned earlier may be revised downwards only by ministerial order following such a review.  I welcome the fact the Human Rights Commission has acknowledged the substantive changes made to this aspect of the Bill when compared with the 2010 Bill.<br />Part 11 was inserted on Committee Stage in the other House.  It deals with the destruction of fingerprints, palm prints and photographs and aligns those provisions with those applying to DNA samples and profiles in the Bill.  The main provisions relating to the taking of fingerprints, palm prints and photographs are contained in the Criminal Justice Act 1984.  Most of Part 11 is concerned with amending that Act to provide for the new destruction arrangements.<br />Part 12, dealing with international co-operation, has been expanded to address international obligations in a more comprehensive manner.  It provides for the reciprocal searching of DNA databases and automated fingerprint identification systems maintained by states for criminal investigation purposes.  In particular, the provisions of this Part are aimed at giving effect to the Pr&uuml;m Council decision, the implementing Council decision and to the subsequent agreement between the EU and Iceland and Norway.  The Bill also covers bilateral agreements that the State may enter into, as it has already done with the United States.<br />Part 13 contains several miscellaneous provisions, a few of which I touched on earlier.<br />This Bill, in establishing a DNA database system, represents a significant step forward in criminal investigation in this jurisdiction.  It makes good on the Government's commitment to provide the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the resources it needs to fight crime and to bring the perpetrators of crime to justice.  DNA evidence is only one element in crime investigation but it is potentially a vitally important one.  It should also be remembered that not only can the database assist in detecting perpetrators and bringing them to justice but it can also help to exonerate the innocent and lead to better, more targeted use of police resources.<br />As I indicated earlier, I am acutely aware of the need to strike an appropriate balance between the use of the DNA database in the investigation of crime in the public interest and of the individual's constitutional right to fair process, privacy and his or her good name.  I am confident this Bill, with its many safeguards, achieves that balance.  This truly is a landmark Bill and this is a historic day to bring it to the House.  I am pleased as Minister for Justice and Equality to commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

I wish her good luck in this difficult brief and hope she will have a successful tenure.  It is a proud indication of the Seanad and those who have served here that she was the former Opposition leader in this House.  It bodes well for those who serve here that there is a future after Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il supports this Bill which is an important part of creating a strong framework to protect ordinary citizens from re-offending criminals.  An effective DNA database forms a critical facet of the modern toolkit for police forces in tackling serious crime.  This legislation builds on the earlier Bill laid out by the former Minister, Dermot Ahern, in 2010.  I also want to acknowledge the significant work done by the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor, Deputy Alan Shatter.  Those proposals drew from the work of the Law Reform Commission and input from various stakeholders, notably the Human Rights Commission.  The proper use of DNA evidence will help identify culprits but will also assist in confirming the innocence of suspects.  DNA evidence will help to exonerate those accused or indeed convicted in the wrong.</p><p>This Bill amends the law to authorise the taking of bodily samples from persons suspected of certain criminal offences for forensic testing.  It also contains provisions to provide for the taking of certain bodily samples from persons who volunteer to have such samples taken from them for the purpose of the investigation of offences or incidents that may have involved the commission of offences.  It will provide for the establishment and operation by Forensic Science Ireland of the Department of Justice and Equality of a DNA database system.  It will provide for the taking of certain bodily samples from persons suspected or convicted of certain criminal offences for the purpose of generating DNA profiles in respect of those persons to be entered in the investigation division of the DNA database system.  It also provides for the taking of certain bodily samples from certain persons for elimination purposes, as well as providing, in certain circumstances, for the destruction of samples taken under this Act and the destruction, or removal from the DNA database system, of any DNA profiles generated from those samples and to repeal the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act 1990.</p><p>Laws mean little if there are not the resources to back them up.  Fundamentally for this Bill to be implemented in full, it will have to be fully resourced.  A poorly resourced and demoralised Garda force will not uphold the law of the land regardless of what databases are available to it.  We are well aware of the current low morale in the Garda.  I hope the Minister will make it a priority to restore it as well as people's trust in the force.  The Minister stated she has adequately prepared the Forensic Science Laboratory for the creation of the DNA database and that it has been allocated substantial resources, as well as the capability to adequately deal with the new database.</p> <p>It is vital that the laboratory be provided with ongoing support and assistance as the level and scope of the work develops and extends with the new database.  If the legislation is in place and there are insufficient resources to operate it on the ground, it will be shackled, despite the significant effort that has gone into this very important Bill.<br />The creation of a DNA database touches on a number of delicate human rights issues.  In the seminal Ryan <i>v.</i>Attorney General judgment of 1965, the Supreme Court found that the right to bodily integrity was among the unenumerated rights in the Constitution, and this significant judgment must be respected.  The right to privacy is an internationally recognised human right and is another unenumerated personal right in our Constitution.  Therefore, the Bill must tread carefully to respect and uphold the high standards of human rights which we have set ourselves.  We must also be cognisant of our responsibilities to the standards set by EU directives on this matter.<br />In broad terms, the Bill has set a fair balance between the demands of constitutional necessity and the needs of confronting criminality.  The time limit on keeping information and restrictions on extracting information from volunteers are adequate safeguards.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties has raised specific concerns on the international exchange of DNA information.  It is imperative that we maintain public trust in the new system and the human rights standards we have raised for ourselves.  Therefore, it is critically important that we ensure other states with which we exchange information are held up to the same standards we set for ourselves.  We cannot allow such highly sensitive information to be exposed and to reduce standards that undermine our efforts to protect the data involved.<br />This substantial Bill is a significant milestone in criminal justice legislation which I broadly welcome and which I demanded many years ago.  From reading the explanatory memorandum, I feel that, by and large, the right balance has been struck, although time will tell.  This side of the House welcomes it.  The issues I have raised are primarily concerned with resourcing, the unenumerated constitutional rights established in the Supreme Court judgment in the case of Ryan <i>v.</i>Attorney General, and the need to ensure international best practice is maintained when we exchange database information.  Hopefully, it will be a further tool for the State, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and international bodies to combat crime.  Given that crime has become very sophisticated and criminals sometimes seem to be one step ahead of us, we need such legislation to ensure we have a very modern, scientific database to fight crime, particularly organised crime.  It is a great Bill, by and large, and I wish the Minister success with it.  Subject to some amendments we may table, I wish it a successful passage through the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-05-27a.225" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1158" speakername="Martin Conway" time="19:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014052700035#MM00200"><p>I, too, congratulate the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, on her elevation to the critically important post of Minister for Justice and Equality.  As the Fine Gael spokesperson on justice in this House, I look forward to having a very strong, positive working relationship with her regarding what we can do here to make the justice system better for all our citizens.  It is ironic that the Minister's first visit to the House as Minister for Justice and Equality is related to this Bill because it will bring our criminal justice system into the modern era in terms of best international practice.</p><p>It is appropriate to acknowledge the work done by the former Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, to ensure this Bill was put on the &quot;A&quot; list of critical legislation.  Given that most countries have already established effective DNA databases, we are behind.  As has been said, crime is very sophisticated and international, and requires an international response.  We need to ensure all methods of dealing with crime, all available information and infrastructure are put in place.  While this is long overdue, it will put us in a proper position in terms of co-operation with our international colleagues.</p><p>Some of my colleagues have asked me to highlight the importance of ensuring human rights are respected and proper safeguards are in place.  I note from the Minister's speech that much work has already been done and many amendments have already been accepted in the D&aacute;il, to such a degree that the Irish Human Rights Commission is satisfied that all necessary safeguards are in place.  My colleagues will be very happy to hear that.  As this Bill passes through the Seanad, if there are worthwhile amendments that ensure the legislation is even better, I am sure the Minister will be very happy to examine them.  Despite recent controversies, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been successful in dealing with certain aspects of organised crime.  This database will equip it to focus and target its resources on the significant levels of organised crime that still exist.</p><p>It is very appropriate that the Forensic Science Laboratory is to be properly resourced because we have seen many pieces of legislation over the years that would have achieved much had the resources been put in place.  While Senator O'Donovan's concerns are correct, the Bill is so important that we have little choice but to ensure the resources are provided.  I am looking forward to hearing what people have to say on Committee Stage and Report Stage on what else can be added to it.  Significant work has already been done.  I wish the Minister well with the passing of the legislation and I hope that the infrastructure can then be put in place very quickly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-05-27a.226" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="19:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014052700035#MM00300"><p>I welcome the Minister and wish her well in her new appointment.  I echo the sentiments of Senators O'Donovan and Conway in welcoming the Bill and the Minister.  It is unfortunate that it has taken a long time for this to happen.  We received the report on this from the Law Reform Commission in October 2005.  As a new Minister with a new broom, the Morris, Smithwick and Guerin reports highlighted issues with how we organise justice in Ireland which we must bring up to date.  I wish the Minister well in that regard as I commend her predecessor who was also a reformer.</p><p>The measures should help reduce the cost of crime investigation, policing and prosecution and will bring Ireland into line with many of the partner countries, as the Minister mentioned.</p> <p>I commend the work of the Forensic Science Laboratory.  We had a discussion about bodies changing their name.  I do not know why the laboratory wants to become Forensic Science Ireland because the word &quot;laboratory&quot; is perfectly acceptable in scientific circles.  We had hoped, in regard to some other bodies changing their name, that there would not be a vast number of image consultants and so on involved.  Perhaps the Minister might deal with this matter.  This may seem a small point but trusted, tried and honoured names should not be changed because of fashion, managerialism or whatever.<br />There will be difficulties.  Noel Whelan, in his article in <i>The Irish Times </i>in August 2012, referred to the use of forensics to investigate burglaries.  Having spoken to people who live in areas that have a high number of burglaries, it seems that the criminals are, unfortunately, well prepared.  I do not know if we will have many DNA samples.  That said, I appreciate what Noel Whelan had in mind when he wrote his article.<br />The Bill is wholeheartedly welcome, coming a long time after the Law Reform Commission reported.  A DNA profile is a valuable tool in the hands of the Garda and other police forces when dealing with crime.  The role of the Forensic Science Laboratory and its director, Dr. Sheila Willis, is held in high regard by the people who work in the field of genetics with whom I have discussed this Bill.  The legislation is a valued step forward.<br />There are concerns about whether the database is secure and that there should be no electronic access from any site which is physically outside the database.  All information received by or given out by the database should be carried on devices such as memory sticks.  I raise this matter because there is concern about problems with the PULSE system, such as people accessing and changing PULSE.  The security of this database is important, as is the recommendation that it should be administered independently by the Forensic Science Laboratory, and I hope its security will be protected.<br />The involuntary taking of samples was mentioned.  One would hope that would not be necessary.  Perhaps saliva and hair would be sufficient.  The intimate and non-consensual taking of samples was also mentioned.  It will be interesting to see how much we can substitute in terms of what people would be reasonably expected to comply with and issues where there may be aggression, and between those conducting the investigation and the suspect.<br />In regard to promoting better relationships between the Garda and the citizen, I am concerned about some UK policing programmes.  Some quasi-documentaries from the United Kingdom which have been broadcast in this jurisdiction have shown what appeared to me to be an unnecessary level of aggression by police against citizens when dealing with traffic and public order offences.  I am afraid we might suffer from spill-over effects.  I hope the old image of the Garda as a friend of the community and valued member of society would not be supplanted by one based on the spill-over of what has frequently appeared to me to be unnecessarily violent behaviour by policemen in other jurisdictions.  I would prefer if all the compliance regarding what the Minister has proposed in this welcome Bill were voluntary.<br />I am assured by the scientists that what we are doing is very reliable and that the DNA profile is a unique identifier, with the exception of identical twins who share a DNA profile.  I commend the Minister on bringing the Bill to the House.  It seems by all accounts, from human rights considerations and from the amendments taken in the D&aacute;il by the Minister, to be a good Bill which will assist in the investigation of crime.  I join other Senators in welcoming the Minister to the House and welcoming her legislation.</p></speech>

This is our first opportunity to welcome her here as Minister for Justice and Equality.  We are all delighted that she has the portfolio, particularly me having worked with her in this House under the previous Government.  I very much look forward to working with her in the future.</p><p>I have already paid tribute to her predecessor, Deputy Shatter, who brought through much reforming legislation and initiated much of it in this House.  I very much hope and expect that the new Minister will continue in a reforming vein and will also initiate in this House Bills from the Department of Justice and Equality.  We have had some very good debates and good Committee Stage debates, particularly on justice Bills, in this House since 2011 and I hope that we will continue to do so.</p><p>The Minister is very welcome, and the Bill is also very welcome.  It is long overdue, as others have pointed out, and it has been widely welcomed generally.  Others, along with the Minister, have spoken about the genesis of the Bill.  It was developed from Law Reform Commission recommendations and is, in effect, a redraft of the Bill introduced in 2010.  It is a greatly improved redraft, and this has been acknowledged widely, particularly by the Irish Human Rights Commission.  Others referred to the commission's most recent observations on this Bill, which were produced in March 2014, in which it pointed out that many of its recommendations on the 2010 version of the Bill have been incorporated into this Bill.  The Irish Human Rights Commission, very importantly, acknowledged the significance of the amendments made, particularly in respect of Part 10 regarding the destruction of samples and the removal of profiles.</p><p>The Minister's predecessor commented, when he introduced this Bill, that the really significant change was that the presumption is now in favour of the destruction of samples and profiles where previously it was in favour of retention, and that the onus has shifted from the person from whom samples were taken to the Commissioner in some instances.  That is a very important improvement which we all welcome.</p><p>We also acknowledge the difficulty in achieving a proportionate balance between the rights of the person who is the source of a DNA profile or the subject from whom samples are taken, their rights to bodily integrity, as Senator O'Donovan has said, and to privacy, as against the wider public interest in preventing crime and in detecting and investigating offences.  We acknowledge the difficulty in achieving that balance and also the fact we are doing it in the context of international law and Court of Human Rights judgments, notably the Marper judgment of 2008, to which the Minister referred.  We must be mindful of all those factors.</p><p>Happily for us, other jurisdictions have moved to legislate before now.  The British database has been in place since the mid-1990s.  This is something we need to have in place.  We need a statutory framework for the Forensic Science Laboratory.  I know that Dr. Sheila Willis and other staff from the laboratory are present in the Chamber.  The laboratory is going to be renamed Forensic Science Ireland.  I acknowledge the great work the forensic scientists have done and will continue to do in the service of the State.  They will be very much facilitated in their work with this new statutory framework that they and many of us in the criminal justice system have sought for some time.  It is very important to have a framework in place.</p><p>I want to look a little more at some of the provisions that are particularly welcome and to comment on some on which we wish to review further.  Senator Conway referred to the welcome the Irish Human Rights Commission gave to the framework.  It is fair to say that it also suggested some changes it felt would improve the Bill even further while acknowledging the changes that have been made, both since 2010 and on Committee Stage in the other House, where a number of changes were made.  The commission made other recommendations it would like to see in place and we can discuss them further on Committee Stage in this House.</p><p>The complex structure of the Bill is inevitable given the very many different scenarios the legislation tackles.  Trying to get an overview of it from a practitioner point of view, it is important to say that Parts 2 and 4 will be of huge practical significance to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and criminal justice practitioners.  Part 2 relates to the taking of samples from a person in custody in Garda stations, which refers to anyone who goes into custody from the commencement of the Bill.  Part 4 refers to samples from offenders for the reference index of the DNA database system.  That refers to people who may already be serving sentences in prison or who have been convicted.</p> <p>Those are two particularly important Parts, and we must ensure intense scrutiny of the balanced reached in those provisions, particularly sections 11 to 13, inclusive, and sections 31 and 32 relating to the taking of samples.</p><p>There are also very different scenarios where samples are taken.  Part 3 provides for the taking of samples from volunteers to generate DNA profiles, with the provision on mass screening in section 29.  That is one area the Human Rights Commission has pointed out the implementation of which section must be scrutinised carefully to ensure, for example, that it is not used for racial profiling.  We all would be mindful of the need to ensure safeguards there.</p><p>Part 5 refers to a specific and different scenario, the taking of samples for elimination purposes, largely from members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure that they can be excluded from suspects at a crime scene.  In Part 6, there is an important provision of samples for identification purposes for the DNA database relating to missing persons, etc., which is also a different sort of scenario.</p><p>The other Parts relate to how the taking of samples are carried out.  I welcome the fact that in Part 7 there are such specific provisions relating to the taking of samples from protected persons and children.  I also particularly welcome the provisions in Part 9 on the introduction of an independent DNA oversight committee to be chaired by a judge and which will have the duty of laying annual reports before the Oireachtas.  On the justice side, we are already in the practice of hearing from the Minister for Justice and Equality, with the annual reports on the implementation of the provisions of the Offences Against the State Acts.  Those reports are always useful because in them we get data as to how many times each provision of the Offences Against the State Acts has been used.  I hope we will see that level of detail in the annual reports laid before the Oireachtas from this independent oversight committee.  I note one recommendation from the Human Rights Commission which is that the committee would include one member with human rights expertise.  One would expect a judge would have that to start with, but it may be that it would be worth looking at some specific provision for that.</p><p>Part 10 is hugely significant.  This is where, as the Minister stated, the significant changes were made compared to the 2010 Bill.  I note that in respect of Part 10 the Human Rights Commission has made few recommendations.  I welcome the provisions for review of the time periods for which profiles may be retained because there was concern of the length of time.  On the idea of six years and three years, there were questions raised.  I spoke with colleagues when the Bill was first introduced and there was a question as to why were the periods this long and should the Commissioner have to seek permission of the court to retain samples, particularly where a person is not convicted.  These are some of the questions asked.  I understand the review provisions deal with that.  It is good to see that section 96 provides, as the Minister stated, for downward review only.  The Minister is tasked with looking at the different retention periods, but only with a view to reviewing them downward rather than upward.</p></speech>

We can go into this level of detail at Committee Stage.</p><p>As I stated, Parts 2 and 4 are hugely important.  In Part 2, there have been important amendments made which have been welcomed by civil liberties groups, particularly in regard to the negative inferences.  As a former defence practitioner, I do not like these provisions around the drawing of negative inferences.  I am glad to see that convictions cannot be based wholly or mainly on the drawing of such inferences.  However, it is something that we may look at in the context of section 157, which deals with the codes of practice.  As the Human Rights Commission has said, there may be a case for a specific warning to be given.  There are provisions for information to be provided to persons from whom samples are to be taken, but should we go further?  Should we look at a code of practice at setting out a wording specific wording?  There is a more specific wording provided for where samples are being taken from children and protected persons, but all persons in custody are in a vulnerable position when samples are being taken from them, particularly where there are provisions, as the Minister stated, authorising the use of reasonable force.  We need to look at the appropriate safeguards in terms of the language used, particularly where persons may be subject to the drawing of negative inferences at a subsequent trial when samples have been taken from them while in Garda custody.  We can deal with all of these issues in much more detail on Committee Stage.</p><p>I again welcome that we are at the stage of having this Bill before us.  The forensic science laboratory is glad to see as well that the Bill will become law without too much more delay.  As to the timeframe, I am sure we will be able to process Committee and Report Stages before the summer.</p></speech>

Ach an oiread le mo chomhghleacaithe ba mhaith liom gach rath a ghu&iacute; uirthi ina r&oacute;l nua mar Aire Dl&iacute; agus Comhionnanais.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go n-&eacute;ireoidh go geal l&eacute;i.</p><p>Since the early 2000s, a number of attempts have been made to establish a DNA data bank in Ireland and such attempts faced a number of obstructions.  For example, in 2008, the European Court of Human Rights held that the retention in England and Wales of DNA samples and profiles in circumstances where there is an acquittal or where proceedings are dropped or not proceeded with, disproportionately violate a person's right to privacy as protected by Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in believes the lawful and effective collection and use of forensic evidence from crime scenes is crucial in obtaining sound convictions that are not based on confession evidence.  The use of forensic science to solve criminal cases is growing globally.  A multidisciplinary field embracing chemistry, physics, botany and zoology, and medicine, forensic science includes the identification of human bodies or traces.  Traditional methods, such as fingerprinting and trace analyses, are still used assisted by computers.  In addition, forensic dentistry, voice and speech spectrograms, blood analysis and DNA analysis are increasingly applied.  A wide range of powers and procedures are now available to enable the Garda and the PSNI to take, compare and retain crime scene evidence as well as the taking of intimate samples for evidentiary comparison.</p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in acknowledges the need for collection and analysis of forensic evidence.  However, we are also aware that forensic science is constantly evolving and that its accuracy is a source of continued debate.  For example, in 2007, Mr. Se&aacute;n Hoey was acquitted in the Omagh bombing case as a consequence of the judge's rejection of the validity of the LCN DNA profiling technique that has been used in more than 21,000 serious crime cases in the British jurisdiction and internationally, particularly in cold cases.  These are two of many situations where the use of forensic science is at the very least uncertain and could potentially lead to perversion of justice.</p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in is of the view that ongoing research is needed in a variety of areas where forensic methods and definitions, both newly emergent and established, are being used in court with a view to prosecution.  However, in spite of this, most methods of forensic evidence gathering are accepted by Sinn F&eacute;in as being necessary methods of criminal investigation where applied to the appropriate standard by trained personnel and under appropriate supervision and monitoring.</p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes the main thrust of the Bill but we have several concerns which we would like to raise and on which we may seek to include amendments.  At the core of this debate, we must remember that any prejudice to the presumption of innocence must be eliminated.  We cannot move to a situation where we treat persons without criminal records as potential suspects for future crimes.</p><p>One of the main objections I would have to the Bill is the fact that it provides for the taking of samples from former offenders who are no longer subject to sentence.  Does this mean the Bill will not have due regard for the Good Friday Agreement and Weston Park Accord, and is it compliant with these?</p><p>The Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, has highlighted another concern in the form of international co-operation, specifically around how samples and-or DNA profiles generated from such samples may be transmitted to other states, including outside the European Union, and we would welcome clarification on these issues.  Will the role of the proposed DNA database system oversight committee extend to reviewing the appropriateness of the date protection safeguards in place in the dates to which samples or profiles may be transmitted?  I agree wholeheartedly with the ICCL that as a matter of principle profiles or samples should never be transmitted to states that cannot guarantee they will be protected by appropriate privacy safeguards.</p><p>On a practical level, I ask the Minister whether the laboratory is built, ready, fully equipped and staffed.  There is no point in passing this legislation if the proper resources are not in place.  Function creep is another important issue of concern with this Bill.  We do not want to see a situation where there is a gradual widening of the database beyond the purposes for which it was originally intended.</p><p>I reiterate Sinn F&eacute;in's support for the spirit of this Bill.  The crux of this debate is to get the right balance between protecting civil rights and liberties without interfering with people's human rights.  I will finish by warning that although there are many positives to a DNA database, we must keep in mind that it can put innocent persons at risk also.</p> <p>This is particularly so as technology has developed to allow the generation of DNA profiles from the tiniest of DNA samples.  In the Omagh bomb case, low copy number, LCN, DNA evidence produced a partial match to a six year old schoolboy in Nottingham who was on the British database.  While he was quickly eliminated from the investigation, had he been an innocent man in his 20s living in the Border counties, would he have been disregarded so quickly?</p><p>T&aacute;imid ag tac&uacute; leis an mBille i bprionsabal agus t&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go dtiocfaidh s&eacute; chun cinn go tapaidh.  B'fh&eacute;idir freisin go gcuirfimid roinnt molta&iacute; chun cinn ar Ch&eacute;im an Choiste.  Ar&iacute;s, go n-eir&iacute; go geal leis an Aire ina r&oacute;l nua.</p></speech>

I look forward to working with her in her new role.  This Bill is very important and will greatly aid the Garda in its already sophisticated and important work.  A Bill such as this has been a long time in coming and I believe there have been three previous legislative attempts to create a DNA database.  While I support the Bill and welcome the assistance it will provide to the Garda in its work, one must be cautious lest we overstep the mark in respect of privacy and individual rights.  I am aware of other jurisdictions internationally that have operated a DNA database for some time and how these have evolved from the original set parameters.  It is no surprise that the largest DNA database is in the United States and is an example of the evolving role such a database could have in society.  I believe its original purpose was to store profiles for serious crimes but profiles now have been created for misdemeanours.  Our nearest neighbour, the United Kingdom, also operates a DNA database that has evolved repeatedly.</p><p>An important balance must be struck when considering the profiles, the rights of individuals, privacy and the appropriate length of time for destruction of samples.  I am keen to hear the Minister's views and further details regarding the consent processes for those with a mental or physical disability.  I understand that people who do not have the capacity to understand the general nature of the effect of taking a sample or who cannot indicate consent to the taking of a sample will not be sampled for the database.  I seek further details on the process, especially on how capacity will be assessed.  I welcome the general principles and the inclusion of this aspect in the Bill but wish to be sure it is not overlooked and that individuals will be afforded the appropriate assessment and level of support in this process.</p><p>On a separate matter, I welcome the provision in the Bill whereby the DNA profiles of prisons convicted of serious crimes will be held on the database indefinitely.  I also welcome that the DNA database will be overseen by an independent committee which will be chaired by a judge or former judge of the High Court or Circuit Court and the membership of which will include a nominee from the Data Protection Commissioner, which is important.  I understand that much work has gone on behind the scenes by the Forensic Science Laboratory in preparation for the enactment of this legislation.  I believe all Members are in favour of appropriate methods that aid the Garda in preventing crime and making the country safer.  As the legislative arm of the State, the Oireachtas has the responsibility to create structures that help to keep citizens safe and their rights intact.</p></speech>

I thank Members for their contributions, in which many important points were made.  This unquestionably is landmark legislation that makes good on the Government's commitment in the programme for Government to establish a DNA database system.  It is great to see this level of support for the Bill, which as quite a number of Senators remarked, is essential for policing today.  It is necessary that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should have access to the most modern policing tools, techniques and technology.  These bring their own challenges, and quite a number of Senators have pointed out the essential need to have the appropriate balance between human rights and having this database and the various techniques its use will determine.  This has been a consideration throughout the development of the legislation.</p><p>The power of DNA technology is at the forefront of modern policing and can be seen in every country in the world.  It is very important to develop the skills that are necessary to manage the database in the most professional way possible.  A number of Senators made the point about the exchange of data with other countries and I assure them this obviously will be carefully monitored.  Moreover, exchanges will only take place under the mutual assistance provision with countries where the standards are similar to those which obtain here.  There is no question in this regard.  I am confident that in the years to come, people will be behind bars in Ireland for the commission of serious crimes who would not have been apprehended or convicted but for the DNA database.  This legislation under discussion will have a quantifiable and immediate impact on the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of crime.  I mention prevention because I believe the increased risk of apprehension may itself have a deterrent effect on those who are likely to commit certain crimes.</p><p>The Bill addresses the highly restricted statutory framework in place at present on this issue in which the sample is required for the investigation of a particular offence.  As I have outlined, the new regime will change this and will mean those convicted for an arrestable offence will be put on the database and will be available for subsequent matching with crime scenes, which is important.  I reiterate that as the database grows, the hit rate effectively will grow as well.  The Bill places all the State's DNA legislation on a statutory footing, meaning that all the provisions will be found in primary or secondary legislation.  This unquestionably will benefit the Garda and brings clarity and certainty to the taking, storing and transmission of DNA data, which is very important.  The Garda will be clear as to its powers and duties under the legislation and citizens will know their rights and obligations.</p><p>I take the point that has been made by the Senators present in respect of protected persons.  As the Bill moves towards Committee Stage, I again will carefully examine precisely the protections that are in place.  There may be some suggestions that could be taken on board from the Irish Human Rights Commission regarding further protections of those who are vulnerable, such as children and more vulnerable groups.  I will continue to examine this issue as the Bill moves towards Committee Stage.  If improvements can be made, I certainly would be open to that because I am aware the proposals contained in the Bill potentially can have quite an impact on the rights of citizens including, as Senator O'Donovan mentioned, the rights to bodily integrity and privacy, which are critical.  However, this balance has been very much to the fore and I believe the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, was sensitive to this issue in the development of the legislation when he was taking it through the D&aacute;il.  Some amendments that were accepted in that House give stronger and greater protection on that issue.</p><p>Senator O'Donovan also mentioned the question of resources, which clearly is important.  I welcome Dr. Sheila Willis and Dr. Maureen Smyth who are present in the Gallery for this debate.  Clearly, the question of resources with regard to storing the database and its use is important.  A number of Senators, including Senator Barrett in particular, spoke on the voluntary taking of samples.  Obviously, this is always the preference and it is important that training be made available to the Garda.  While samples are being taken in respect of offences at present, in the context of the development of the database, ongoing training clearly will be an important element in the future.  Moreover, training on human rights also will be important.  I note the point made by Senator Bacik about the recommendation from the Irish Human Rights Commission that someone with expertise in human rights might be appointed to the monitoring committee, and I certainly can examine that proposal.  The question of the Good Friday Agreement also was raised by a Senator and while this issue was addressed during the D&aacute;il debate, I certainly will consider any amendments that are tabled on this issue or overall.</p><p>I again thank Members for their contributions.  I will consider the points made in the debate and will examine them on Committee Stage.  I conclude, however, by noting my goal in this Bill is to strike the correct balance between the public interest in the investigation, detection and prosecution of serious crime and the human rights of citizens.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-05-27a.242" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1147" speakername="John Crown" time="19:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014052700039#QQ00700"><p>The topic before us may seem arcane but it is actually very important.  Vasculitis is an overall term for a group of life threatening diseases characterised by widespread inflammation of blood vessels, often throughout the body.  Inflammation of these blood vessels may lead to blockage or rupture of the vessels, death or bleeding in the affected organs and catastrophic consequences for the health and, sadly in many cases, the lives of affected patients.  Early diagnosis and effective treatment is critical in preventing death, organ failure and disability.  While highly effective treatments are available, patients may deteriorate rapidly, often within months or even weeks, unless effective therapy is commenced.</p><p>How common is this problem?  There are more than 15 types of primary vasculitis, which is defined as vasculitis for which there is no known precipitating cause.  There are also many forms of secondary vasculitis relating to illnesses with which Senators will be familiar.  While individually many of these diseases are rare or, in some cases, exceedingly rare, collectively the entity of vasculitis is relatively common.  It affects a significant number of patients, with estimates that more than 50,000 citizens on the island of Ireland will experience vasculitis at some point in their lives.  Due to the widespread nature of the inflammation in vasculitis, affected patients may present with symptoms to a variety of doctors, including eye doctors, ENT specialists, skin specialists and gut specialists.  As individual forms of vasculitis are rare, the diagnosis may not be recognised even by a competent physician.</p><p>In early stages, doctors may not be familiar with the fact that certain symptoms are due to vasculitis.  As a result, delays in diagnosis and, indeed, misdiagnoses are common even in good and competent hands, potentially leading to inadequate or inappropriate treatment.  This clearly increases the risk of disease and treatment-related complications.</p><p>Current European guidelines recommend that patients with suspected vasculitis should be evaluated in a centre of excellence.  Failure to diagnose and treat the disease appropriately not only has significant health consequences for patients but also significant economic consequences.  A case in point is kidney disease.  Many patients with vasculitis will develop kidney disease, which if treated early can be prevented from developing into chronic kidney illness.  If, however, the diagnosis is missed or the treatment is delayed, these patients may develop chronic renal failure with the result that they require renal replacement therapy either through dialysis or transplant.  We are all aware of the personal and societal health and economic costs of dealing with kidney failure.</p><p>It is proposed that a system of centres of excellence be developed throughout the island of Ireland.  This would accord with European guidelines and EU recommendations for the management of rare diseases, as well as being consistent with the national rare disease plan for this Republic.  A network of specialist clinics to diagnose and manage patients with vasculitis is required to provide streamlined rapid access for patients with suspected vasculitis to an appropriately resourced clinic where prompt diagnosis and judicious treatment, potentially without the need for hospitalisation, may prevent complications and reduce health care costs.  The HSE should also attempt to increase awareness and educational activities in this area.  There should be one specialist clinic in each of the newly-defined hospital groups, which would be staffed by an appropriate array of medical specialists and supported by clinical nurse specialists.  There should be rapid access to outpatient diagnostics to keep people out of hospital and enable them to get the appropriate treatment that saves their health and the health system's money.  There should be access to appropriate therapy, disease registries and international collaboration.  It is essential that a high priority be given to setting up this network, which offers huge cost savings as well as considerable benefits for the health of individual patients.</p><p>I will bore the House for one more minute by outlining some of the conditions that can cause secondary vasculitis.  Many of the primary disease are rare, such as giant-cell arthritis and polyarthritis nodosa, but some of the disease that are secondary causes of vasculitis will be familiar to the House, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, inflammatory bowel diseases and sarcoid ulcers.  These disease are relatively common in Ireland.  I hope action will be taken on providing more appropriate treatment of these conditions.</p></speech>

I thank Senator Crown for raising the issue of vasculitis, in its many forms, and for the opportunity to outline the approach which the Department of Health is taking to address these and rare diseases in general.</p><p>Vasculitis is a general term that describes blood vessel inflammation.  As Senator Crown has alluded to, it can be caused by a large number of conditions including cancer, rare inflammatory diseases, infections and adverse drug reactions.  Treatment of vasculitis depends on the organs involved and it can be mild or life threatening.  Treatments often involve medication to reduce the inflammation.  A number of specialty services provide treatment, including nephrology, rheumatology, otolaryngology, paediatrics, ophthalmology, neurology and respiratory care.  As primary and secondary forms of vasculitis manifest across so many specialties, it is a condition that neither fits neatly into a single national clinical programme nor into a single care setting because its treatment may require either or both acute specialist care and primary care.  </p><p>In regard to rare diseases, an EU Council decision of 8 June 2009 estimated that there are between 5,000 and 8,000 rare diseases.  It defined the specificities of rare diseases as a limited number of patients and a scarcity of relevant knowledge and expertise.  The Council's decision recognised these specificities when it recommended that member states adopt a plan to guide actions in the general field of rare diseases.  It is with this in mind that the Department of Health is finalising a generic plan to apply to the 8,000 rare diseases estimated to exist.  This plan is being prepared for publication at the earliest opportunity and its recommendations refer, among others, to the following areas: information systems and registers for rare diseases; rare disease research and access to clinical trials for patients with rare diseases; prevention of rare diseases through healthy lifestyles and nutritional supplements as appropriate; access to diagnostic services and how this could be improved; a national clinical programme for rare diseases, to include an office for rare diseases which will support the HSE in the development of appropriate treatment programmes, accessing relevant clinical trials, designation of centres of expertise and provision of information for patients; development of criteria for the reimbursement of orphan medicinal products and technologies; patient empowerment and the support of patient organisations; establishment of monitoring and reporting mechanisms to be defined within the rare disease plan; and activities such as the mapping of current resources on rare diseases, potential designation of centres of expertise and the establishment of monitoring and reporting mechanisms which will take account of the reporting requirements under the national service plan, the EU key performance indicators relating to rare diseases, the requirement to participate in European reference networks and the cross-border health care directive.</p> <p> At this juncture, the HSE has established a national clinical programme for rare diseases.  A national clinical lead has been appointed and a programme manager is in place.  Part of their work will address care pathways for patients with rare diseases and will link with the other specialist clinical programmes.</p></speech>

I wish to state that vasculitis illnesses are not particularly rare when taken as a collective.  There is a good imperative for giving priority to getting the specialist designation for centres of excellence within the hospital groups and to put in the resources which will enable patients to go through the system quickly for the benefit of their own lives and health as well as for the benefit of their families.  We must remember that these patients, who require serious levels of medical care as a result of the disability caused by this illness, may also bring one or two family carers with them.  It is good and humane medicine and social practice to get these systems up and running.  It also makes good business sense.</p></speech>

As stated earlier, the HSE has established a national clinical programme for rare diseases and a national clinical lead has been appointed.  I suggest that the aforementioned appointee should speak to Senator Crown about specialisation within the hospital network, particularly in the context of the effects of vasculitis diseases on so many different areas of health.  This must be addressed through the centres of excellence to which Senator Crown alluded.</p></speech>

Caring for a child who is classified as having a severe or profound disability is a 24/7 job but caring for a child with a high level of care needs becomes significantly more difficult if one is a single parent.  Single mothers and fathers caring for their children still have to pay their mortgages or rent and their utility bills, as well as providing clothing, food and the other essentials that every family needs.  A parent of a child with a disability who does not qualify for a medical card or has had a medical card removed must also pay for trips to the doctor, special orthotic shoes, additional therapies, accessible transport and minders or carers to look after the child while he or she is at work.  These parents must also cope with the same stresses as other parents and carers.</p><p>I am aware that single parents can avail of certain payments aside from the carer's allowance to assist them but we need to do a better job in terms of payments to parents and families generally.  I ask that the Minister for Social Protection give consideration to the fact that the situation of a single parent carer of a child with a disability is completely different to that of a couple.  I received a representation recently from a single mother with a disabled child in the severe-profound category who has been refused carer's allowance on a number of occasions and has appealed that refusal.  She feels that she is being victimised for going out to work while also trying to care for her son.  If she had a partner in her house then her bills, mortgage payments and so forth would be shared.  As it stands, she must pay all of the bills, including her mortgage, herself as well as meeting the additional costs of caring for her disabled son.  I ask the Minister to recognise the fact that single parents incur additional costs in caring for disabled children and consider whether this could be taken into account in the context of applications for carer's allowance.</p></speech>

The national carers' strategy signals the Government's commitment to recognising and respecting carers as key care partners and to responding to their needs across a number of policy areas.  By setting out a vision to work towards and an ambitious set of national goals and objectives to guide policy development and service delivery, the strategy seeks to ensure that carers feel valued and supported to manage their caring responsibilities with confidence and are empowered to have a life of their own outside of caring.</p><p>Acknowledgement of the key role played by carers is reflected in the range of significant supports provided by the Department of Social Protection to support carers in their caring role and ameliorate the financial burden of caring.  Indeed the income supports that carers receive from the Department are among the highest rates in Europe.  Carer's allowance is the principal means-based income support payment for people who are providing full-time care and attention for certain older people or people with a disability.  However, there are people who fall outside the net and these must be dealt with.  </p></speech>

Senator Moran has just mentioned an exceptional case and I would be very happy to pass on the details of same to the Minister.  The challenge for the Government is to deal with exceptional cases effectively and I am sure the Minister will examine the case referred to.</p><p>Persons who are in receipt of this allowance also receive the annual respite care grant of &euro;1,375, the household benefits package and the free travel pass.</p><p>Where a child under the age of 16 requires full-time care and attention, a domiciliary care allowance of &euro;309.50 per month may be paid to the parent or guardian.  This payment is not means-tested and is to provide for the additional costs involved in providing care and supervision that is substantially more than that normally needed by a child of the same age.  The parents may also be in receipt of the carer's allowance.  People in receipt of a social welfare payment, other than carer's allowance or benefit, who are also providing someone with full-time care and attention, can retain their main welfare payment and receive a half rate carer's allowance.  Similarly, people currently in receipt of a carer's allowance who may have an underlying eligibility for another social welfare payment, can transfer to that other payment and continue to receive up to a half rate carer's allowance.</p><p>The estimated expenditure on carers in the Department of Social Protection in 2014 will be almost &euro;806 million, made up of &euro;557.2 million on the carer's allowance, &euro;21.5 million on carer's benefit, &euro;122 million on the respite care grant and &euro;105.1 million on the domiciliary care allowance.</p> <p> The Department is guided by the strategic direction of the national carers' strategy and is committed to the goals and specific objectives identified in the strategy.  The strategy recognises that the financial resources available to the Government during the lifetime of the strategy will reduce and that this will mean focusing expenditure on those who need it most and who will benefit most from services and supports.  In framing budgetary adjustments, the primary concern has been to protect primary social welfare rates, and against that backdrop, I was pleased that in the 2014 budget, the core rates of payments available to carers were maintained, as were payments made in addition to other social welfare payments, such as the half-rate carer's allowance.</p><p>I mentioned exceptions and the derogations.  There is a very complicated mechanism for payments, with entitlements and eligibility and switching from one payment to another one.  Getting all the information together, visiting the social welfare office and going through how best a person can avail of the payments can be very worthwhile.</p></speech>

Additional recognition should be given in applications for carer's allowance to single parents of children with a disability.  In this particular case, there is no incentive to go out to work.  I am afraid people who are just outside the net will say that if they do not work, they can stay at home and get the carer's allowance and maybe more benefits.  We want to encourage people to go out to work or to stay at work, but they need that little bit of assistance.</p></speech>

It is very good for people to get out of the home and go to work.  Incentivising them to do so is a very valid point and it would enhance the quality of life of both the parent and the child.  That anomaly exists.  If the Senator sends me the file, I will raise it with the Minister, Deputy Burton, because we all want to get people back to work, especially single parents.  If a single parent is at a disadvantage in this situation, a special derogation should be given.  It should be considered if it is for the health and well-being of the parent and the child.  I am delighted the Senator has raised this point, of which I am fully supportive.</p></speech>
