The article stated:<blockquote><br />Eamon Timmins, head of advocacy at Age Action Ireland, [...] said that many elderly people in society were feeling more isolated than ever before.  &quot;We have just finished a national consultation and it is a listening exercise where we go around the country.  There is a lot of anxiety out there.  Anxiety about the future, new charges, and people's ability to pay them on fixed income and fixed pensions.</blockquote>A schedule of expenditure released by the Irish League of Credit Unions for 2013, entitled What's Left, outlined the average spend of an individual per week.  With a weekly State pension of &euro;230 per week, older people have an average residual amount of only &euro;34 for other items after their living expenses, taking into account cutbacks and other new charges.<br />The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, has started a discussion on the easing of austerity, saying that he intended to widen income tax bands to take more people out of the higher tax bracket as soon as the State could afford it.  Immediately after Deputy James Reilly became the Minister for Health, he promised to abolish the 50 cent prescription charge.  Three years later, he has increased it five times from the original 50 cent to its present value of &euro;2.50.  Surely to God our priority for the elderly should be to restore the telephone allowance, reduce prescription charges and waive property tax and the future water tax that is coming down the line.  That would prove we were a decent society.<br />In the Visitors' Gallery are seated good friends of mine, Nancy Moran, Mary McEntaggart and Imelda Harding from Sandymount.  Also seated there are senior citizens from the Lucan-Palmerstown area who are led by the local election candidate Caitr&iacute;ona McClean.  I have heard their stories and I am disgusted that the sickest older people in our society are being targeted.  The Irish people do not realise that approximately 55,000 people over 70 years have had their medical cards taken away by the last two budgets of this Government.  Common sense would tell one that the removal of medical cards from older people will not save money in the long term.  Instead, it will stop older people from taking vital medication and going to the doctor.  If they end up in hospital as a result of this measure no money will be saved; quite the opposite.  These cuts have been made by a heartless Government.<br />Finally, I wish to refer to the serious issue of how older people are treated in society.  The subject has been spoken about by the revolutionary Pope Francis, who felt compelled to intervene.  Last November, he said at a mass: <blockquote>We live in a time when the elderly do not count.  It's awful to say, but they are discarded.  Because they are a nuisance to us.</blockquote>He also called on the faithful to remember those elderly who live in retirement homes, especially those who have been abandoned by their families.  I reiterate that these cuts were made by a heartless Government.</p></speech>

He is here as a guest of Senator Barrett and it is good to see him.  He might be one of our nearest residents, or one of the people who lives closest to Leinster House.</p><p>Last night I was a guest of the Lord Mayor in the Mansion House.  I attended an excellent event to celebrate the village of Ranelagh, which formed part of his Vibrant Villages series.  Other colleagues from Dublin may have attended other events.  The events are an excellent means of updating traders, local business people, local residents, and people involved in community groups on the work that Dublin City Council is doing to improve amenities in particular areas.  It is also an opportunity for officials from Dublin City Council to hear the concerns of local people and the improvements they seek for their areas.  Last night's event was excellent and I thank the Lord Mayor for the invitation.  I did not think I would have an opportunity to thank him publicly on the Seanad record today but I am grateful for the opportunity to do so.</p> <p> I ask the Leader for a debate on penal reform.  I have mentioned previously the report of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality of 2013 on penal reform and measures to reduce the use of imprisonment.  I seek a debate to address the concept of introducing an independent prisons authority since we have the very welcome commitment by the Government to introduce an independent police authority to act as a buffer between the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It would also be worth considering the establishment of an independent prisons authority.  The director general of the Irish Prison Service, Mr. Michael Donnellan, is doing an excellent job.  Recently I had the opportunity to visit the D&oacute;chas Centre, the women's prison, in north Dublin to see at first hand the improvements which had taken place.  Conditions have greatly improved, as they have in Mountjoy Prison and in other prisons, which is welcome.  However, we should look at the governance of prisons in a debate in the House.</p><p>A strong debate took place yesterday on the Merchant Shipping (Registration of Ships) Bill 2013 with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, in which he outlined that the new legislation would provide for the first time for a centralised online system of registration of all shipping craft, including small pleasure boats, jet skis and small fishing boats.  We heard also the very worrying statistics for maritime accidents and the need to improve maritime safety measures.  Clearly, central registration will greatly assist enforcement and in the prevention of accidents.  What was of great concern was that at the end of the debate the Minister said it might take a couple of years to roll out the new registration system, even when the legislation was in place.  We should urge him to take all possible steps to ensure the system of registration is introduced more swiftly.  In this House we can ensure the legislation goes through quickly, given that it was welcomed by all parties.  It is very important legislation, but it is a matter of concern that the Minister said it could be a couple of years before the system was in place to enable the legislation to be fully implemented.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-04-16a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1136" speakername="David Norris" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014041600004#C00200"><p>I refer to a little spat that has been ongoing about writers, on whether they are Irish or British.  I notice, for example, that great offence was taken when James Joyce was listed as a British writer in <i>The Telegraph</i>; unfortunately, the plain fact is that he was.  He was born in and wrote about nothing but pre-revolutionary Ireland.  He received a grant from the privy purse during the First World War which kept him going.  He steadfastly refused to take an Irish passport and until the day he died was a British citizen with a British passport.  That might have had something to do with his quirky nature, but it is a fact.  On the other hand, of course, Myles na gCopaleen is probably spinning at 98 rpm in his grave at the idea of being described as Irish, but it is important that we look at these subtleties.<br />I am a big fan of the health service with all its defects.  I would not be here today without the excellent service I receive from the staff and surgeons at St. Vincent's University Hospital.  I cannot speak highly enough about them, as without them, I would be dead.  Again, we have to face facts.  There is a very worrying report on MRSA, of which there are 50 strains.  We know that a certain amount is being done.  Every time one visits somebody in a hospital or goes into hospital there is fuzzy material with which to wash one's hands and so on.  The problem is that once one gets in to the hospital, having rinsed one's hands in foam, everything changes.  The corridors are usually spotless, but once one gets into the rooms, whether private rooms or public wards - I have had occasion to visit people in both and be in them myself - they are not spotless.  I remember one case in which a male patient was admitted and for a full day the sanitary bin provided for the previous female occupant which was full was not removed.  Recently I came across another case in which somebody was in hospital for a major operation and put in a ward in the public hospital where another patient had become incontinent.  The floor was mopped with a towel which was left sopping in urine and hanging behind the door the entire night.  There was lavatory paper on the floor, the walls were scuffed, the shower seat was badly stained, wrappings from various medical instruments were all over the floor and post-operative patients were going to be brought to this ward.  To my mind, the risk is probably greater inside the hospital.  I would like to know about all of the highly paid administrators in hospitals.  I am not against administrators, as they are necessary in a modern hospital to chase up patients if they do not attend their appointments and, by and large, they do a very good job, but what are they and board members paid?  Why can we not have proper hygiene standards inside hospitals and, particularly, lavatories?  It is outrageous that this should happen.  I am aware that there are terrible staffing problems and do not like being critical of any aspect of a hospital service with which I have reason to be not just satisfied but delighted.  In the old days there were nuns in the Roman Catholic hospitals and there was a matron in the Adelaide Hospital, of whom people were terrified.  If there was some dust in it, there would be murder.  In every hospital there should be a hygiene supremo responsible for dealing with hygiene issues.  If it means getting rid of an administrator or a board member, so what?  Hygiene is the most important issue, as otherwise people will die and hospital bred infections will continue to spread.</p></speech>

In her contribution she mentioned the cuts that had to be made in the past three budgets, but she forgot to remind the House of the reasons all of those cuts were necessary and the appalling mess left behind for the Government to tidy up.  I welcome the update published yesterday on Ireland's stability programme and ask the Leader for a debate on it after the Easter break.  It contains some encouraging figures which indicate that GDP is expected to grow by 2.1% in 2014, increasing to 2.7% next year and 3.5% by 2018.  Employment is projected to grow by 2% every year to 2018, which would see unemployment levels falling to below 8%.  Given that 61,000 jobs were created in 2013, we hope that figure will continue to increase.  Inflation is likely to remain low and projected to be at a figure of 0.5% for 2014.  We need the Minister for Finance in the House to tease out some of these figures in early course.  While the signs are encouraging, we need to remain cautious in our budgetary planning for the coming year.  It is projected that &euro;2 billion will have to be cut from our expenditure in budget 2015; therefore, it is a case of a lot done but still a long way to go.  We need to discuss the roadmap with the Minister for Finance after Easter.</p></speech>

In my 12 years I think it is the first time our nearest neighbour and resident has come to visit us.  It would be appropriate for me to say that, having been at school with him, I know him very well.  It is good to see him here.  His contribution and that of his family to enterprise and public service is second to none and one senses there is an air of inevitability about his participation in the Houses.</p> <p>Despite having had a debate in Private Members' time last week, I join with my colleague, Senator White, in raising the care of the elderly.  In response to Senator Mullins, while there are good news items from time to time, as well as positive developments in respect of the statistics now available regarding economic recovery, what divides us politically is how these were achieved.  There were choices, irrespective of troika involvement, the involvement of the European Union and so on.  As was noted in the debate last week and as Senator White has been highlighting clearly in her own work - she has produced a detailed paper on the matter - while going about these cuts, we have not covered ourselves in glory in respect of the care of the elderly.  That is the key message.  As was reflected in Labour Party policy, although it did not manage to get it included in the programme for Government, it is and was possible to have collected approximately &euro;300 million from people earning more than &euro;100,000 per year.  However, we chose not to do that.  The aforementioned &euro;300 million could have left certain people over 70 years of age with their medical cards and could have retained the bereavement grant for families.  It could have left in place a variety of measures.  Despite the pride of Senator Norris and all Members in the health professionals who work in the health services, the reality is that if one has an elderly relative, one should not put him or her into hospital unless one can be in there with that person for 24 hours a day, because there are not enough front-line staff available to take care of such relatives in a scenario where a single nurse must deal with ten people.</p></speech>

A vomiting bug prevented a lady from visiting her husband, who unfortunately was terminally ill and was going to die.  When she was allowed to return to the hospital after a three-day absence, she found him in the same pyjamas, which were stained and to be frank, she found him sitting in his own urine, which was and is completely unacceptable.  While the statistics and the bottom line may be coming right - of course all Members celebrate that - the reality is that choices were made in achieving it that were unnecessary.  Choices were made that were not in the best interests of elderly people or the less well-off.  That is sad and is something of which Members on both sides of both Houses can be ashamed.  Members must begin to do something about it.</p></speech>

I wish to put on record how much I enjoyed my most recent visit to the Mansion House, when the Lord Mayor launched a book written by our colleague, Senator Whelan, entitled <i>The Buddha of Ballyhuppahaun</i>.  A most enjoyable evening was had with the Lord Mayor on that occasion.<br />I welcome the publication last Monday of the report on the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA.  The commission was headed by former football great, Pat Spillane, and held 100 meetings across rural Ireland.  The commission also met Oireachtas Members a number of times and I was privileged to be part of that process.  The fact that this report was commissioned jointly by the Departments of the Environment, Community and Local Government and Agriculture, Food and the Marine is testament to the interest the Government has in tackling the difficulties of rural Ireland.  It is a comprehensive and insightful report that has 34 recommendations on how to create employment and to revitalise rural Ireland.<br />I have outlined in this Chamber many times the problems faced by rural Ireland and how the brunt of the economic crisis fell on it.  This has been highlighted in the report, which provides the grim statistic that unemployment in rural Ireland is at 192% of the 2008 figure, compared with an equivalent percentage of 108% for urban Ireland.  Moreover, the Teagasc rural index report published last week also brought this issue to the fore.  An opportunity has arisen for the Government to move on this issue.  I welcome the comments of the Taoiseach at the publication of the report last Monday when he stated the Government will address this issue shortly.<br />Earlier this morning, I attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht, which was addressed by Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  He indicated clearly that steps would be taken in the roll-out of the next Leader programme to incorporate part of the CEDRA report and to bring forward recommendations and actions to tackle this problem in rural Ireland.  In view of the short time available to me today, I request the Leader to ask the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, who has direct responsibility for this area, to come into this House after Easter for a full debate on this important report that was published earlier this week in order that Members can have an input into how this problem in rural Ireland is tackled.</p></speech>

I had the privilege of being a guest of the Lord Mayor of London at the Guildhall banquet and accompanied the President to the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-upon-Avon on Friday morning.  It was extraordinary and for everyone, the big winners were the Irish in Britain of all classes, successes and ages and of diverse backgrounds.  An extraordinary, deeper connection has been made to the diaspora in Britain, thanks to our wonderful President's visit there and I congratulate everyone concerned.</p><p>Arising from that is a debate on commemoration and whether members of the royal family should visit and be a part thereof.  I would consider this to be a constructive debate and irrespective of whether my views necessarily are in tandem with those of others in respect of such a visit, a debate should be held on it.  I call on the Leader to have such a debate in this House and perhaps to invite the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht or someone who is in charge of the national commemorations - perhaps even the Taoiseach - to have a sophisticated, diverse debate on the commemorations.  It is only two years away and one is reading about it more in the newspapers rather than actually having a debate in this House, that is, on how citizens should commemorate both the rebellion of 1916 and the Battle of the Somme on 1 July.</p><p>In one further point, I wish to alert my fellow Senators that the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill is coming before the House today.  Senators van Turnhout, Zappone and I are proposing an amendment to the Bill that seeks a plebiscite for the citizens of Dublin to have their say on whether they wish to have a directly-elected mayor of this city.  We are making a proposal as it is an opportune moment to so do.  The aforementioned Bill is timely because of the Godsil case against the Attorney General.  This legislation constitutes swift action on the part of the Government and I believe there also should be swift action to enable the citizens of Dublin to have a say in whether they would wish to have a directly-elected mayor.  It is an opportunity for the Government to show leadership and to illustrate its stated appetite for political reform by having a debate-----</p></speech>

He has made available his home in the Mansion House to Members many times for different events.  I attended the function for Senator Whelan's book launch, at which people had a most enjoyable evening.  Consequently, it is only proper that Members would welcome him to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</p><p>I am sure the Lord Mayor and other Members will agree with me that the racist attack that took place recently on O'Connell Street, Dublin, against staff working in a Spar shop was absolutely appalling.  It is reflective of racial attacks on non-national workers, better known as the new Irish, which are taking place in the city and around the country.  I call on the Leader to make known to the Minister for Justice and Equality, Members' displeasure at these attacks and that something effective must be done to deal with them.  It is completely unacceptable to think something like this could happen on O'Connell Street, the main street of the capital.  I seek an end to such behaviour, which does not belong in a modern society.</p> <p>I hope that the people who were victims of this assault are making a recovery.  Racial discrimination and attacks are totally unacceptable.  It is not the type of message we want to send out from modern Ireland and the great city of Dublin which this city is.</p></speech>

The post dates back to 1229, which is 15 years short of 800 years.  I welcome the Lord Mayor's interest in programmes such as the vibrant villages series, to which Senator Bacik referred, and his support for a plebiscite for a directly-elected Lord Mayor.  I thank him for being a generous host to Senator Whelan and other Members of the House.  It is appropriate we should return his hospitality today.</p><p>Some Ministers may be interested in meeting the Lord Mayor.  One of his predecessors, Mark Rainsford, was the founder of St. James's Gate Brewery.  The Minister of State, Deputy White, is tackling the problem in that area and he may want to know if there are any files covering that area in the Mansion House.  The Minister, Deputy Shatter, will undoubtedly want to talk to the Lord Mayor about Bartholomew Ball, who was Lord Mayor from 1553 to 1554.  We can read from the history of the office that his widow was martyred by their eldest son, Walter.  There should be some exciting files covering that in the Mansion House and the Minister, Deputy Shatter, might like to take a look at them.</p><p>I welcome what Senator Mullins said about the economic report launched last evening.  We are creating 50,000 jobs currently and 61,000 were created last year, which was a bonus.  There are some warning signs in the report.  On the view that inflation would erode the debt and that a little more inflation would be good, I point out that inflation would also erode jobs.  Therefore, it is a route which should only be embarked upon with caution.  Table 7 in the report shows that tax revenue between now and 2018 will go up by &euro;10.3 billion and the expenditure reductions will be &euro;3.3 billion.  There is a very heavy tax burden coming down the tracks which we hope will be covered by economic growth.</p><p>The section on the reform agenda was not published last night.  It comes from the Taoiseach's Department and it might be a topic for debate in the House.  There is also the suggestion, with which I believe most people would agree, that income tax is too high and that it can be solved by increasing the universal social charge, but the universal social charge is a form of income tax.  That would be a bit of a three-card trick and such an approach would need to be very carefully analysed before we go down that road.  There is a problem with people on an income of &euro;32,000 a year going to the 42% tax band, as the Minister said, but it should be tackled without any secret routes about reducing income tax and increasing the universal social charge.</p></speech>

It is great to see him here.</p><p>I would like to raise some concerns that have become increasingly more prevalent and have received increasingly more representations concerning people with an intellectual disability being refused medical cards or having their medical cards taken from them.  I firmly believe that people with an intellectual disability should have an automatic entitlement to a medical card.  It is well known that people with an intellectual disability and a physical disability will have greater medical needs both in terms of medical care and appliances.  In some cases items as simple as a pair of shoes can cost more than &euro;900.</p><p>I have had representations recently from parents who have had no additional aid or grant to help them adapt their houses or part of their houses, or to cover any apart of the medical costs for their child because their medical card has been refused.  Free GP care is being introduced for those under the age of six - with which I do not have a problem - regardless of their parents' income.  We need to examine that area.  I call on the Leader to arrange for an urgent debate with the Minister on the entitlements of people with an intellectual disability to address this situation which is becoming more urgent on a daily basis. </p></speech>

There have also been major cutbacks in spending in the area of health and education, which have impacted on front-line services in hospitals, primary care centres and schools across the State.  We have fewer services and front-line staff across the board.  We are paying more taxes than ever before.  If we learn anything from the lessons of the Celtic tiger years, it must be that an economy has to be there to serve the citizens, all of the people, not the vested interests, the elites, the wealthy and the bankers.  If there is economic growth, we need to see that used to benefit the people of this State.</p><p>We have not heard a whimper from a single Government representative in this Chamber in about a year about the fact that we had the biggest transfer of wealth in the history of this State when we transferred billions of euro of taxpayers' money into the banks to pay back the debts of bondholders, speculators and gamblers.  We were promised by the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach that we would get a retrospective deal on banking debt but we have not got it.  </p></speech>

What we are getting from the Government at the moment is leak after leak, pardon the pun.  That is all we are getting.  We were told the standing charge will be &euro;100 and now we hear it will be &euro;50.

As a former Lord Mayor of Cork city, it is a huge honour to hold that office, whether one is Lord Mayor of Dublin, Cork or Belfast.  Those are the only three local authorities that have and office of Lord Mayor.  It is ten years ago since I was Lord Mayor .  One of the programmes we have in Cork city is that the Lord Mayor visits every school in the city, of which there are 102, during his or her term in office.  That was the tradition in Cork dating back to when Tom&aacute;s Mac Curtain was Lord Mayor back in the 1920s, and he died in office.  The Lord Mayor gave a half day to the schools on the day they called to them.  The then Minister for Education, the former Deputy Dempsey, wrote to tell me that I could no longer use my role as Lord Mayor to grant that half day.  I want to thank the former Minister, Deputy Dempsey, because as a result of the letter I got 15 television and radio interviews and a huge petition was taken up by the students in Cork city to tell the then Minister that we do not take diktats from Dublin down in Cork.</p><p>With respect to some of the issues that were raised, especially in regard to medical cards, there is a good deal of misinformation.  It was sad to see a newspaper carrying a headline that there has been a 30% reduction in medical cards.  That is not true.  The correct position is that there has been a 12.5% increase in the number of medical cards issued, available and being used since January 2011.  The total number of additional medical cards is 218,000.</p> <p>Some 1.95 million people have medical cards or GP-only cards.  However, there is misinformation.  Alarm is being raised about the review of medical cards.  When Fianna F&aacute;il was in government, it gave medical cards to persons earning &euro;5,000 a week.  Anyone over 70 years of age and earning &euro;5,000 a week was entitled to a medical card.</p></speech>

It is a shame that people with disabilities and others are being deprived of necessary services, for which they cannot afford to pay.  I mention the ludicrous position of the Government, which it has taken for purely propaganda purposes, in providing free GP care for those under six years of age, while removing services from elderly people who are in difficulty in trying to meet the increased costs being imposed on them by the Government, including for health insurance.  I cannot understand why members of the Government parties criticise these moves in the House but do not raise them at their parliamentary party meetings.  When we were in government, backbench Deputies and Senators constantly raised issues of concern to the public and created quite a fuss at parliamentary party meetings.  That is what needs to happen.</p></speech>

It is essential we have a strong, analytical and informed debate on the issue.  Recent reports have shown that young people who have the opportunity to pay into pension schemes because their employers are making contributions are not doing so.  As a consequence, they will find themselves disadvantaged in later life.  Last night I spoke to somebody who was in receipt of a pension from the Houses of the Oireachtas and paying tax at 53%.  There is a need to look at this issue.  Part of the debate should revolve around the appointment of a Minister or a Minister of State with responsibility for pensions because somebody should focus on pensions solely.  It is clear that the Minister for Social Protection who covers a wide-ranging area with many challenges cannot put the focus that is necessary on this area, especially if we are to meet the huge demographic challenges which will arise in the coming decades.  I appeal for a debate on this issue.  The State pension will be inadequate to provide for people in old age because of the fiscal position.  We must, therefore, encourage and incentivise people to participate and providing for themselves in old age, which means having a proper, well thought out and coherent pension policy, which is not in place.</p></speech>

This is a time bomb.  We have some time, but we need to start to plan because the demographics speak for themselves, as the Senator said.</p><p>The time bomb about which I wish to speak and which I mentioned yesterday is home repossessions.  We know from the banks, the representatives of which attended the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform last week, that thousands of home repossessions are imminent.  One's second highest right after the right to life is the right to property.  Currently, the Government provides &euro;250 for a person in difficulty to visit an accountant.  I have been talking to MABS, the staff of which essentially are accountants, and its service is free.  It would be better if the &euro;250 was given to a legal person, a solicitor, because people are worn down as a result of having to deal with huge difficulties, for which we all know the reasons.  Many of them are in difficulty not because of anything they have done but because of the recession, job cuts or perhaps a family illness and they need legal advice.  Let us not disable them anymore.  I would like the Leader to convey my recommendation to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, that the &euro;250 being provided for accounting advice be provided for a solicitor to advise before people relinquish their family homes, if they have to do so.  We must protect the people concerned.  We need the Minister to come to the House to consider more creative solutions to enable people to hold on to their family homes rather than have them repossessed.  If that means the State has to take an equity stake in the family home to allow a family to rent at local authority rent rates, let us do it.  We know there is a housing crisis; therefore, what is the point in putting the people in question, for whom we cannot find homes, out on the street and having them draw rent allowance?  I will continue to raise this issue until we find a solution because to lose one's home is the last straw for a family.  It causes stress for everybody, including children.  One cannot parent properly when one has to endure such stress in one's life.</p></speech>

I am not naive; water is not free and, ultimately, comes from nature.  The provision of infrastructure to deliver it safely to people's houses incurs a cost and society must tackle the issue.  Currently, directly or indirectly, the cost is met from the taxes we pay to central government and the money is given to local authorities to arrange for water to be delivered.  We are, therefore, paying for it from the public purse.  Reports in the past few days suggest there will be a large fixed charge of between &euro;250 and &euro;500 per household to meet the infrastructural costs of delivery, with additional costs being based on usage.  That is fine and I have no problem with it, if there is a complete 100% write-off of the fixed charge against the other taxes we already pay.  If we are now paying the money to the Government and it is using it to provide water for us and if we will now provide it directly for whatever water authority will provide water, what will happen to the money we pay in tax which is going to the water authority?  I can tell Members right now that unless we have some clear-cut evidence that some part of the redundant public service - I am not referring to essential public services - will actually be curtailed and that the money will be saved, to me the logical conclusion is that whatever one will pay in water charges, there should be a 100% write-off against tax.  That is the only fair way to do it and the debate needs to be started.  </p><p>Similarly, in the case of universal health insurance which I have been espousing for 21 odd years - sometimes very odd years in this country - I was delighted that the Government parties had assumed the mantle of reform prior to the last general election when they stated they would bring forward such an initiative.  However, I am troubled by some of the ways it is being described.  There is talk about a new system which will prevent people from skipping queues, but under that system there should be no queues.  There is a matching of resource with demand which will have to be policed or appropriately regulated.  In systems which provide for this kind of health insurance people do not face queues anymore.  Similarly, having regard to what I said about water charges, if there was a mandatory insurance charge, the money currently given to the central Exchequer to fund the health service should be written off 100% against whatever one would pay for universal health insurance.  That would mean that there would be redundancies and people in the Civil Service would seek alternative employment because currently they are channelling money from the general Exchequer into the health service.  The vast bureaucracy which does this would instead find the money going directly to insurance companies, I hope in most cases to not-for-profit social insurance companies but in some cases to private insurance companies.</p> <p>The idea that people would pay twice for the same service is absolutely irrational and it shows me that this process is not being thought through at the highest level.</p><p>I had occasion recently to hear a number of presentations from Indian cancer specialists and I was horrified to hear that the second largest cause of cancer death in women in India is cancer of the cervix, a disease which is almost completely preventable - 80% preventable with the widespread application of a vaccine - but they cannot provide it because of cost.  I did the arithmetic and there is an exact, neat correlation between what we paid every year to bail out Anglo Irish Bank and what it would cost to eradicate cervical cancer for one year in India.</p></speech>

I ask the Leader to give consideration to inviting the Minister for Finance to the House because, yet again, in his own way as a blunt and straight speaker, he has dismissed the notion that has been growing among government candidates knocking on doors that somehow there will be a tax break for middle Ireland.  The Minister has disabused them of that notion in recent days.  He has made it quite clear that there will be at least another &euro;2 billion taken out of the economy, and that loss of &euro;2 billion will filter down into people's pockets.  The word coming from our side of the House is that people can give no more.  I hope everyone entitled to vote will vote.  I was disappointed to hear this morning on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; some people in Galway saying they had no interest in voting.  I wonder if they are living in the real world.  People should vote when they have the right to vote.  There are people dying as we speak because they are looking for the right to vote.  I hope that those who do vote will take account of the reality of the situation - that we are far from being out of the woods, economically speaking.  In that context, I ask that the Minister for Finance come to the House to give a statement on the true economic situation, not the spin that is being put out by the very efficient government spin doctors, but the reality of the economic situation and his plans for the forthcoming budget.</p><p>I ask that the T&aacute;naiste or his Minister of State, Deputy Joe Costello, come to the House to give a statement on the continuing, evolving and dangerous events in Ukraine, which are beginning to have an effect on business.  Ireland is a trading nation and we have a real interest in the situation.  Some people might ask why we should care about Ukraine.  It reminds me of the quote about Czechoslovakia prior to the Second World War, that it is a far-off country of which we know little.  That is not the case in this instance, because Ukraine, Eastern Europe and Russia are key components in our continuing struggle to increase our export markets.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to come to the House to provide an update on the situation and the Government position.  Such information would be very useful for this House and for the country in general.</p></speech>

We had expected the report a number of months ago.  I would have expected more concrete proposals as to how to deal with the issues affecting rural Ireland.  There seems to be a great deal of hullabaloo about the publication of the report but very little detail and substance in its recommendations.  I spoke to rural communities during Sinn F&eacute;in's consultation process about the cutbacks in post office services, the closure of Garda stations, the need for revitalisation of rural towns and villages, tackling the issue of emigration from rural areas, youth unemployment, cuts in the provision of health services, the decimation of the fishing and farming industries and the lack of infrastructure.</p><p>People came in their thousands yesterday to demonstrate in Molesworth Street about the wind farm issue.  They believe the creation of wind farms is privately driven, without input from local communities.  It is disappointing that the report does not deal with these issues.  The report recommends that more research is needed on how Leader funding might be used.  This issue has not been raised.  Every rural community I visited was concerned about the changes in local government and how the local development companies will have their powers taken over by the county and city councils.  We need an urgent debate after the Easter recess on the CEDRA report and its recommendations.  If it is to have any impact in rural Ireland it needs to be amended and to be more specific.  Resources need to be provided.  All Ministers with a rural remit must be asked what they will do to revitalise rural Ireland and save it from the decline resulting from the economic disaster into which the previous Government led us.  It is also the case that this Government is not doing enough for rural Ireland.</p></speech>

When the House debated the legislation to introduce water charges, we questioned the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, about the proposed cost.  If the economic cost of the water charges was to be borne by every house in the country, the average charge would be in the region of &euro;750, but we learned this morning in the media that our worst nightmares are coming true, with the proposal for an introductory charge of approximately &euro;240, together with a standing charge that every household will have to pay.  The Commission for Energy Regulation is responsible for the charges and it is inevitable that in time the full cost will be brought to bear on every household.  The House must debate this issue this morning.  Clarification is required.  The local elections are imminent and Ministers are saying the charges will not be that bad.  That will not wash with people after 24 May.  At the moment Fine Gael and Labour candidates are looking for votes and telling people on the doorsteps that the charges will not be that bad because their Minister says so.  The promise that the charges will not be that bad will not pay the water charges when the bills are sent out in the latter half of this year.</p><p>We need a debate on this issue, which is affecting people across the country.  The Government pressed ahead with water charges without any allowance for ability to pay, and many households will be unable to pay them.  The Government has failed to make a submission to the Commission for Energy Regulation under the consultation process.  We may learn more this morning after the Cabinet meeting, but this House should have a debate on the issue today, given that it is a matter of national importance.</p></speech>

I agree that the organisation does excellent work on behalf of the elderly.  The House had a consultation group on the elderly and a very good report was commissioned.  I will not discuss what Fianna F&aacute;il did for the elderly as opposed to what this Government is doing.  The reason for the cutbacks over recent years was the state of the country after Fianna F&aacute;il's time in office.</p></speech>

The Government has made the right choices.</p><p>Senators Denis Landy and Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh referred to the CEDRA report which was referred to yesterday by Senator Sean D. Barrett.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, is willing and available to discuss the report.  He will come into the Chamber after Easter for a comprehensive debate on the topic.</p><p>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail called for a debate on national commemorations.  The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, was in the Chamber last year to discuss the ten years of commemorations.  We had a good debate on the matter, but if there is a need for a further debate on it, we will arrange it.  I am sure the Minister would be willing to come to the House to discuss it.</p><p>Coming from the oldest city in Ireland, Waterford, we are celebrating 1,100 years.

It provides for the repeal of the bankruptcy disqualifications for election to and membership of the D&aacute;il and of the European Parliament.  By virtue of the provisions in Article 18.2 of the Constitution the bankruptcy disqualification for membership of the Seanad will also be removed.  The bankruptcy disqualification has been in place in Ireland since 1923 and it was there before that under the Westminster Administration.  This disqualification was removed for local elections in 1974.  My Department has made inquiries of other EU member states and confirmed that it is not a disqualification for elections to the national or European Parliament in at least 18 member states.  Anomalies exist under the current legislation whereby an Irish citizen adjudicated bankrupt in another jurisdiction is eligible for election to the D&aacute;il, or to the European Parliament to represent Ireland, but an Irish citizen adjudicated bankrupt in Ireland is not eligible for election to either.<br />Similarly, where a Deputy or an MEP is adjudicated bankrupt in Ireland they cease to be a Member but if a Member was adjudicated bankrupt in another jurisdiction a vacancy in the D&aacute;il or the European Parliament would not arise.  The same anomalies apply to membership of the Seanad.  It is difficult in the 21st century to identify a valid reason for retaining this disqualification.  When the provision was originally introduced, well over 100 years ago, there would seem to have been valid reasons.  That is not the case now having regard to recent insolvency legislation in Ireland and having regard to the altered view of bankruptcy as a protection or remedy rather than a punishment.<br />The commitment in the programme for Government was to reform our bankruptcy legislation to bring us into line with best international standards.  This reform has been delivered in the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 which amended the Bankruptcy Act 1988 to provide for a more enlightened, less punitive and costly approach to bankuptcy.  Those amendments continued the reform of bankruptcy law which was started in the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011.  We have now taken a 21st century look at the relevant parts of our electoral law and decided that it needs to be changed too.<br />In the past the disqualification from election to or holding elected public office by dint of being an undischarged bankrupt partly reflected a concern that a person in such circumstances could be more susceptible to inappropriate influence.  This might have had some validity when the provision was originally conceived in a previous era, in another century.  However, we need to consider the disqualification provision in the present day taking into account the legislative framework that exists to guard against corruption, to uphold ethics in public office and to restrict the potential for inappropriate influence of private and corporate political funding.<br />Between 1889 and 2010 seven separate Prevention of Corruption Acts were brought into force, along with a range of other criminal justice legislation that addresses corruption.  Further significant reforms are planned.  When enacted, the Criminal Justice (Corruption) Bill being developed by my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality, will not simply be a consolidation of the existing legislation, it will clarify and strengthen the main corruption provisions and offences.  Head 18 of the general scheme makes provision for the courts to remove from office Irish public officials who are found guilty of corruption.  That includes Members of the Oireachtas and of the European Parliament.  The Bill is currently being drafted and it is hoped that it will be ready for publication in the coming months.  We have an ethics framework covering public office holders.  This is set out in the Ethics Act 1995 and the Standards in Public Office Act 2001.  The requirements of this legislation are overseen by the Standards in Public Office Commission.<br />There is a comprehensive legislative code covering political donations which has been substantially strengthened by this Government through the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act in 2012.  Corporate donations are now restricted.  The maximum political donation that an individual can receive was reduced to &euro;1,000 and every donation above &euro;600 must be reported, with details of the donor published.  Cash donations above &euro;200 are now banned, as are anonymous donations above &euro;100.  Experience in the past has, unfortunately, shown that some individuals are willing and capable of circumventing the rules, and that bankruptcy is no predictor for such behaviour.  No system will guard against every possibility and there is a constant need for us all to be vigilant in reforming our laws and regulations to appropriate and proportionate effect.  However, in this day and age an absolute ban on bankrupt persons standing for election can be regarded as a disproportionate measure with questionable justification.  There are better and more targeted ways of dealing with concerns about the inappropriate influence of office holders.  These should apply whether the person happens to be bankrupt or not.  This approach is reflected in the range of necessary laws and regulations dealing with political funding, ethics in public office and anti-corruption measures.  In these circumstances, it is right and reasonable that the bankruptcy disqualification be repealed.<br />I will take the opportunity now to outline the main provisions in the Bill.  Section 1 - amendment of the Electoral Act 1992 - provides for the removal of the disqualification of bankruptcy for election to the D&aacute;il by repealing paragraph (k) of section 41 of the Act and for removal of the disqualification of bankruptcy for membership of the D&aacute;il by repealing section 42(3) of the Act.  Section 2 - amendment of the European Parliament Elections Act 1997 - provides for the repeal of the bankruptcy disqualification for election to the European Parliament by removing the reference, in section 11 (2)(<i>a</i>), to paragraph (<i>k</i>) of section 41 of the Electoral Act 1992.<br />No amendment is required to remove the bankruptcy disqualification for membership of the European Parliament because section 11(5)(<i>a</i>) of the European Parliament Elections Act 1997 simply provides that a person shall cease to be a member of the European Parliament if they become subject to any of the disqualifications referred to in subsection (2)(<i>a</i>) of section 11.<br />Section 3 contains standard provisions dealing with short title, construction and collective citations.</p> <p>The bankruptcy disqualification also applies to Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  However, the Bill does not provide for an amendment to Seanad electoral law.  Article 18.2 of the Constitution states, "A person to be eligible for membership of Seanad &Eacute;ireann must be eligible to become a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.&rdquo;  Section 16(2) of the Seanad Electoral (University Members) Act 1937 provides that &ldquo;No person who is for the time being disqualified from or incapable of being elected as a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann shall be a candidate at an election in a university constituency.&rdquo;  Having regard to these cross-references to the D&aacute;il provisions, the bankruptcy disqualification will, therefore, be removed for the Seanad as a consequence of the amendments in the Bill.</p><p>As I noted earlier the bankruptcy disqualification was removed for local elections in 1974, 40 years ago.  We are only now removing it for general elections and European elections and, as a consequence, for membership of the Seanad.  This could and probably should have been done long before this.  The Government is now taking action to repeal a provision that is disproportionate and no longer necessary in this day and age.</p><p>I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-04-16a.94" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1159" speakername="Mark Daly" time="11:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014041600012#M00200"><p>I support this Bill and the change to the electoral laws that disallowed a bankrupt to be a Member of Parliament.  As the Minister pointed out, that disqualification was removed for local authority elections some time ago and is an anomaly in the EU in this regard.  Whereas bankruptcy could end in the debtors&rsquo; prison, society has moved on in its views on bankruptcy.  We have 100,000 mortgage holders in arrears and many people have gone to the UK seeking redress from bankruptcy under UK law.  It must be treated as an everyday occurrence rather than a matter for which someone must be punished.</p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il supports the Bill.  While it is being rushed, the cut-off for nominations for candidates in the European elections is coming soon and we want to ensure this legislation is enacted before then.  The provision has been in place for local authority elections for the past 40 years.  It is unfair that a hardworking Member of this House could be precluded from running for elected office because of bankruptcy during the downturn.  This is an issue of fairness and that is why we will support this legislation.</p></speech>

The Bill amends the European Parliament Elections Act 1997 to allow a person who has been declared bankrupt to run for the European Parliament.  The Government has already changed bankruptcy law to ensure it does not stigmatise individuals as it did in the past.  Small businesses might fail the first time but may be successful the next time.  That is not to say that the bankruptcy law should be taken advantage of by people.</p><p>As the Minister said, no amendment to the electoral laws for the Seanad is required because what pertains to the D&aacute;il pertains to the Seanad.  There was the anomaly that one could be declared bankrupt in another jurisdiction but run for election in Ireland.  This Bill will deal with this anomaly by removing the disqualification of undischarged bankrupts.  European, local and by-elections will be coming up soon, so this legislation is necessary.  The Minister also pointed out what the Government has done for the accountability and transparency of funding of political parties accountability.</p><p>The provision on bankrupts goes back to the 1832 Reform Act which substantially extended the franchise.  It was not until 1867 that many categories of working people were given the vote.  The Representation of the People Act 1918 extended voting rights to women in a limited way.  The Minister has introduced 30% female quotas to encourage more women to run for election.  He has been advocating change and advancement throughout the electoral system.  Disqualification due to bankruptcy was removed for local authority candidates in 1974.  Hopefully, we will see this legislation enacted shortly.</p></speech>

I support this common-sense Bill.  It is a perfect example of the Government being practical and reasonably swift in dealing with a historical anomaly and out-of-date prohibition on citizens standing for election in European and general elections.  It also proposes to remove the clause to allow Members who might become bankrupt from losing their position.  Article 16 of the Constitution defines eligibility for D&aacute;il membership.  Article 18 makes eligibility for membership of the Seanad the same as that for the D&aacute;il.  Article 16 allows the Oireachtas to prescribe that certain categories of persons will be ineligible for membership of the D&aacute;il in accordance with the fundamental norms of the legal order as set out by the Constitution.  On that basis, section 41 of the 1992 Electoral Act sets out that certain categories of people who are ineligible for candidacies or membership of the D&aacute;il.  Section 41(k) states &ldquo;a person who is an undischarged bankrupt under an adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction in the State&rdquo; shall not be eligible to run in a D&aacute;il or European Parliament election.  Section 42(3) sets out the procedure for disqualifying an elected Member from the D&aacute;il if he or she is declared bankrupt.  This Bill proposes to repeal both sections.</p><p>We have Ms Jillian Godsil to thank for this amending legislation.  Her High Court case against the Attorney General is due to be heard in July.  She is arguing, quite rightly, that the exclusion of bankrupts from standing for election breaches the constitutional principle of equality, as well as interfering with her right to a free choice as a voter on her own behalf and on behalf of the electors in the constituency in which she wants to run.  It also constitutes discrimination on the grounds of social and economic status.  Ms Godsil was declared bankrupt in February this year.  Under current law she cannot stand for election to the European Parliament in May.  Ironically, she could stand in the local elections because the disqualification of an undischarged bankruptcy was removed by the Local Elections (Petitions and Disqualifications) Act 1974.</p> <p>Without going into Oireachtas Members' private financial circumstances, the Bill also means that should an existing Member of the D&aacute;il or the Seanad be adjudicated as being bankrupt, he or she will not be disqualified as a Member of the Oireachtas.  Ireland is one of only five countries in Europe, including the United Kingdom, France, Malta and Turkey, which prohibit bankrupt persons from running in parliamentary elections.</p><p>I am dismayed that there is no plan to arrange a plebiscite in the city of Dublin to deliberate on whether its residents would like to have a directly elected mayor.  It would show great leadership and be an example of swift political reform were the Minister to offer an opportunity for the electorate in the Dublin metropolitan area to have their democratic say in how their city should be administered.  There is a democratic deficit in the capital city which hinders its full economic, social and cultural development.  I look forward to the Minister's response and will raise the issue in more detail on Committee Stage.  While some of our amendments may be ruled out of order, I will challenge this and look forward to the Minister's response on Committee Stage.</p></speech>

Where a few words suffice, I will not use too many.  </p><p>This Bill is welcomed by both sides of the House.  I read the transcripts of the speeches made in the Lower House.  Although one colleague of mine expressed some reservations, it was fair comment.  The Bill seeks to update dated legislation.  I did not know until I read the legislation that a bankrupt person could stand for election to a local authority but not to the D&aacute;il, the Seanad and the European Parliament.  I wonder if there are statistics for the numbers of bankrupt members of local authorities.  We are coming into line with best international practice.  As the Minister outlined in great detail, we have many checks and balances in the system such as the Standards in Public Office Act 2001, the corporate donations restrictions and new regulations under the Criminal Justice (Corruption) Bill which will further strengthen the system to ensure those who engage in corrupt acts are not allowed to stand for national office.  It is very important that we close this loophole.  I welcome Fianna F&aacute;il's positive response to the Bill.  I also read that Sinn F&eacute;in had supported it in the Lower House.  Are candidates waiting in the wings and will this legislation be passed before the closing date for nominations to run in the European elections campaign?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-04-16a.99" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="12:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014041600013#N00300"><p>I, too, welcome the legislation.  The Minister has summarised it very well that there is an alternative view of bankruptcy as a protection or remedy rather than a punishment.  We had many late-night discussions on the issue of insolvency with the Minister for Justice and Equality and it was interesting to see how the matter had evolved.  We must question what caused the bankruptcy.  Was there reckless lending by financial institutions?  Why should the odium and criminality be borne only by the person who accepted a loan which might have been irresponsible?  We need legislation for the regulation of banking regarding loan-to-value and loan-to-income ratios.  Reckless lending rather than reckless borrowing may have caused people to go bankrupt.  We have developed subtlety and nuance in how we respond, for example, having attachment orders, conciliation, negotiation and community service as options.  These are welcome developments as part of a reform agenda and the Bill deserves the support of the House.  It is a modernising and forward-looking measure.</p><p>With such a heavy debt-to-GNP ratio, having some people in public life who have personally experienced the problem could assist the Cabinet and Ministers to explain from personal experience what it is like.  It is the personal expression of what has happened to the country.  We have all had to live in grim negotiations with the people who loaned us the money.  The country and public representatives will be in harmony in dealing with the problems of debt with a certain fellow feeling.  Perhaps they might resolve to have better lending institutions and better recognition by the country and citizens that those seeking to lend money are not always out to do one the best of favours, as the advertising people maintain, and that old-fashioned thrift might have much to recommend it.  I compliment the Minister on the legislation which we will support from these benches.</p></speech>

I was delighted to meet him earlier.  </p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il supports this important Bill.  I pay tribute to Ms Jillian Godsil who brought the case arguing that legislation banning her from contesting the forthcoming elections was in breach of her constitutional rights.  I very much agree with her.  I also agree that the legislation is long overdue and should have been brought forward many decades ago.</p><p>Unfortunately, debt is not a new concept.  Sadly, during the past six or seven years it has marred and tortured the lives, minds and families of many ordinary, decent people who did nothing wrong when they borrowed money in an open lending culture to improve their homes or create or expand businesses, thus creating employment.  They also borrowed money to better the lives of their families and, often, the wider community from which they came.  Bankruptcy should not be a punishment, as it still is, despite our recently amended legislation compared to the legal protocols abroad, to some of which the Minister alluded.  Bankruptcy should focus on assisting the two main parties, namely, the creditor and the genuine debtor.  It is remarkable that as far back as 1934, 80 years ago, the American Supreme Court ruled that bankruptcy &quot;gives to the honest and unfortunate debtor ... a new opportunity in life and a clear field for future effort unhampered by the pressure and discouragement of pre-existing debt&quot;.  That is a very enlightening and important quotation from 80 years ago that is very relevant to this day, especially here.  In Ireland, as some speakers have said, although we are on the way to changing our attitudes to bankruptcy, we are not there yet.  We now see it as a fresh start for people who are, by and large, creators of wealth and jobs or ambitious home-makers.  Bankruptcy must be a starting point for new opportunities.  How could it be fair that parliamentarians with commercial skills and ambitions used in good faith should forfeit their careers because of honest endeavour?  I very much welcome the legislation and congratulate the Minister on bringing it forward.  There are other anomalies regarding other professions and callings where it is mandatory or inferred that being judged a bankrupt demands resignation or disbarment.  Legislation should also be brought forward in this regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-04-16a.101" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1136" speakername="David Norris" time="12:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014041600014#O00100"><p>I had not thought about the question of judges, which I think requires a bit more consideration by people like myself who had not thought about it, because one expects judgment from judges and one expects them to be of good judgment and so on.  They should live within their means and if they go around spending money on property speculation, then I would not have a huge amount of sympathy for them.  It is probably a dangerous thing to say since I am often in court myself but, at the same time, I am afraid I would have to think about that.</p><p>The idea of not allowing bankrupt people to stand for Parliament, or ejecting them from Parliament if they become bankrupt, seems to be undemocratic, particularly in these circumstances.  I congratulate the Minister on his introduction of this legislation, because in this time of very considerable financial difficulty, with large numbers of people facing financial ruin as we speak, theirs is a voice that actually needs to be heard, so I would quite welcome somebody who had been bankrupted by the mess this country got itself into.  I will not divide the blame between any party, Government or otherwise, because I was here when the whole mad Gadarene rush was going on, and very few people have clean hands in this, so it is a waste of time dividing the blame.  Blaming is a waste of time anyway, but I think this is a voice we need to hear.  I would have to think a bit more about the judges and I might very well come around to the side of Senator Wilson, but I simply had not thought of it, so I do not know.  I do not think there is any point in pontificating in this House when one simply does not know.</p><p>However, I would like to indicate to the Minister a related situation in which people are bankrupted or eviction orders are served against them.  I will bring a Bill before the House, so I would like the Minister to take note of this.  One of his colleagues will probably take the Bill, which Senator Barrett has very kindly agreed to support.  It is a very short Bill called the enforcement of court orders (amendment) Bill 2014.  As the Minister may or may not be aware, it is one of these esoteric areas of law, but it actually has a very strong impact on people.  The Enforcement of Court Orders Act, which has not been changed since 1926, permits people who are placed in this situation of financial vulnerability to be entitled to a certain value of clothing and bedding, that is, &pound;15 sterling.  That is ridiculous in this day and age, and our Bill will raise it to the very small amount of &euro;2,000.  Since the Act was enacted in 1926, it was long before the advent of computers.  People who go bankrupt or people who are evicted should be given a second chance.  With computers, they can start another business.  They also have personal data stored on computers.  It is important that this very small Bill should be allowed to go through.</p><p>I do not admire everything about America.  For example, I do not particularly admire the complete abrogation of international human rights legislation when it uses drones to kill civilians.  However, in terms of its financial life, it is aggressively positive and it is not a badge of shame to go bankrupt; nor, as far as I know and to follow on from Senator Wilson, is it a crime.  Perhaps people should be put out of Parliament for criminal activities.  If there is a criminal element to the bankruptcy, such as fraud, stealing from company funds or even irregularities, then they are unfit to be Members of Parliament but not in the case of ordinary bankruptcy, so I will support the Bill.  </p><p>I look forward to having something to say about the amendments put down by my colleagues about the matter of the Dublin mayoralty.  Since I did not welcome the first citizen of this great city to the House on the Order of Business, I do so now.  I am very glad he is taking such a considerable interest in the affairs of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</p></speech>

It also redresses the anomaly where people can contest local elections if they are bankrupt but not D&aacute;il or European Parliament elections.  The law regarding local elections was changed in 1974, so this Bill is timely and should be supported.  I suppose at one time bankruptcy was seen as a fairly exotic condition which was rare in Ireland but, unfortunately, when the so-called Celtic tiger collapsed, many people found themselves bankrupt, often through no fault of their own.  For those people not to be able to contest elections because of that was unfortunate and the fact we are correcting that is a step forward.<br />However, we must also be conscious that there were undoubtedly cases where certain individuals and institutions were to blame for much of the collapse and a number of cases relating to that are proceeding currently.  It could also be argued that it was expedient for certain people to declare themselves bankrupt in this jurisdiction or in other jurisdictions in order to save some of their assets.  That should be put on the record because it is an unsavoury practice.  We saw some people go to the UK, the US and elsewhere to declare themselves bankrupt, taking and hiding their assets from the State and banks.  Essentially, it is the taxpayer who must then foot the bill.  <br />I think we would regard some of those individuals and institutions, such as Anglo Irish Bank, in a different light from someone who finds himself or herself bankrupt from causes which were not really of their own making or brought about because of circumstances beyond their control.  We all know people who found themselves in that situation in recent times.  Many of them have lost their businesses and homes and have found themselves bankrupt as a consequence.<br />This legislation is motivated by the case taken by Jillian Godsil whose home was repossessed and who has expressed an interest in contesting the forthcoming European Parliament elections.  It would surely be unjust to deny her the opportunity to contest the European Parliament elections or, indeed, anybody who has found himself or herself in the same position as her, especially as I understand the reason she wants to run is to highlight the plight of people who have had their homes repossessed as part of the fall-out of the financial crisis. <br />The issue at stake here is whether people who have been declared bankrupt should be denied exercising one of the fundamental rights of any citizen in a democracy, which is to stand for election.  Those of us who might question the sanity of anyone who would want to subject himself or herself to that, given that we have travelled that road several times in local, general and European Parliament elections, is a different story.  Obviously, it is a matter and a right for those individuals and for any citizen to put themselves forward for election.  <br />It was also not right that someone who was bankrupt was denied the right to run in elections while former prisoners were rightly not denied such a right.  Had that been the case in this State, a large number of people on all sides of the House over the years would not have been allowed to run and would not have been elected.  There are many anomalies which still could be corrected in regard to the franchise and voting rights for citizens.  The Minister has been in the House several times and has been part of debates on Seanad reform.  All sorts of issues have come up in regard to voting rights for the diaspora and citizens in the North in Presidential elections.  We still have a long road to travel in many of these areas.<br />However, this Bill is very simple and short and its intent is very simple but it is important none the less.  It corrects an anomaly and for that reason, I support it. </p></speech>

We wanted the amendments to be within the scope of the Bill which is why we proposed a change in the Title of the Bill to hold a plebiscite on whether an office of a directly-elected mayor with authority for the Dublin metropolitan area should be established.  On that basis we oppose section 1.</p><p>Dublin has four mayors, none of whom has any real powers.  The offices are rotated between the dominant political parties.  I am probably one of the last of the Members of the Seanad to formally welcome the first citizen of Dublin, Lord Mayor Ois&iacute;n Quinn.  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an ardmh&eacute;ara.</p><p>The rationale for the office of a directly-elected mayor relates to the need for strong coherent local government and accountability for the Dublin metropolitan area.  Such an office is critical to the lives and well-being of Dubliners and Ireland as a whole.  There are currently four Dublin local authorities and a multiplicity of national and State agencies.  The system of governance for this city is not sufficiently robust to make strong, clear and accountable decisions as required by a modern city region.  In particular, not only do many members of the public not have a clear sense of who is responsible for many of the decisions that affect the way the city and county is run, many councillors are at a remove from these decisions, particularly in areas such as transport.  Clear, strong, robust and accountable leadership is needed-----</p></speech>

I can understand the reason Senator Mac Conghail and others would wish to amend the Bill on a very important issue which the Government supports.  Regrettably, the manner in which the forum came to its conclusion did not include a consensus from all four local authorities in the Dublin region.  Local elected members are close to the people and understand the people better than anyone.  They were given the opportunity to bring forward a consensus through this forum and failed to do so.  They failed to get agreement from the four local authorities.  I will not hold a plebiscite on 23 May 2014 but I will look at the situation immediately after the elections to see if the proposals which the local authorities did not agree to can be revised.  The Government is very committed to the notion of a directly-elected mayor of Dublin but it is back to us to come up with an initiative because the democratically-elected people in the four local authorities were unable to reach a consensus.</p></speech>

I am very glad that this is being put through quickly by means of a motion for early signature meaning that these people will be allowed to stand for election.</p><p>I thank the Minister for very clearly opening up the discussion on the question of a plebiscite by way of his reply to Senator Mac Conghail.</p> <p>I would welcome a strong mayor in Dublin with real power, as is the case in London.  At the moment, a plebiscite would be a slam dunk and a foregone conclusion.  If the people were given the opportunity, there is no question they would go for it.  How democratic is it?  We are talking about the city, but Fingal, for example, is not part of the city.  It is a rural area and they have special interests and special problems.

Ninety-eight percent of people in Fingal voted against it; where is the democracy there?  Why not let them develop organically in their own way as a small unit?  It might be a template for allowing more local democracy, of which we see very little.  Let the people of Dublin decide, but if the people of Fingal want to stay out of it, let them do so.  They will probably do a hell of a lot better on their own than they would if they were meshed with Dublin, as their interests do not automatically coincide with the urban area of metropolitan Dublin.</p></speech>

I accept the ruling on this but my concern is not so much about the councillors but that the citizens, residents and electorate of the metropolitan area have a direct say in how their city is run.  Some may disagree with the idea of a directly elected mayor, but a plebiscite would resolve that point.  On that basis, I will oppose section 1 on the basis that we have not had an opportunity to debate the important point, but I am supportive of the overall Bill.</p></speech>

We are all in unison about its importance and the pragmatism in swiftly enacting such a Bill.  We are proud to have been a part of it.  We thank a citizen who moved the Oireachtas to introduce a Bill that will enhance the democratic right of a citizen to become a Member of this House or the European Parliament.  I do not know her, but I commend Ms Jillian Godsil for her enlightened role in inadvertently forcing the Government's hand through the case she took.  I assume it will now be struck out.  She rightly argued against discrimination on socioeconomic grounds, particularly bankruptcy, and is to be congratulated.  The Bill is being passed in her honour.</p></speech>

The speed with which it has been enacted shows that the Government does listen, see where change is needed and promptly make changes.  The Government can be noted for this.  In my contribution I mentioned the changes made by the Minister and the Minister of State.  Who said women do not matter in politics?  Of course, they do.  Ms Godsil's name has just been mentioned.

As the Minister of State indicated in the opening statement, this is something which should have been done years ago.  We can only do this when in government but it is important that the Opposition has supported the Bill.  I support what Senator Mac Conghail was trying to do earlier and perhaps it could be the subject of further legislation.  I acknowledge that the Minister of State is prepared to revisit the subject, and I hope there will be a resolution to the issue.  It would represent an opportunity for the public to have a say in the matter in the not too distant future.</p></speech>

Like other colleagues, I welcome the swift passing of this legislation.  As the Minister of State and other colleagues have already stated, this legislation is long overdue and should have been completed many decades ago.  The attitude to bankruptcy in this country is slowly changing and if somebody falls on hard times and must go down the road of bankruptcy, it should not prevent him or her going for election to this House, the Lower House or local authorities.</p></speech>

It is a good and brave step forward for democracy that anybody who wishes to stand can do so despite having a financial issue like bankruptcy.  An existing public representative may become bankrupt and it is important that he or she can continue in the work as well, as the people should ultimately decide on their representation.

As far as I am aware, there is no connection or relationship between them.  I read what I had said and I never mentioned heroin.  The point I made was that I am aware of a number of teachers who are single parents and who had their children while teaching and I am also aware of a number of teachers who are homosexual or lesbian.  It is a matter of fact that is the case in some our schools, and I am actually talking about Catholic schools.</p><p>While this does not apply to either the orientation or the family circumstances of any individual teacher, it is imperative that a teacher is not allowed to promote either a lifestyle or an ethos which is contrary to the ethos of the school, if it is a Catholic school.  It is also very important that nothing we do in legislation impedes the removal of a teacher where that teacher is failing in his or her responsibilities to give proper education to the children.</p><p>I would like to give absolute clarity where teaching capacity is affected with an example from my primary school days, which was a decade or two ago now.  We had a teacher in second class and in fourth class who would arrive in the morning, in particular in the winter, with a hangover.  We all knew we were in for some difficulties.  He would use the side of the ruler on cold hands.  His teaching and his attitude to the classroom were seriously affected by his drinking.  At the time we were too young to appreciate the effects of the disease of alcoholism.  Unfortunately, that poor man went on to suffer grievously from the alcoholism and subsequently committed suicide, which was very sad.</p><p>All I am saying is that anything we do in these circumstances should not, in any way, result in a situation where people can hide behind what might appear to be discriminatory and where the school has great difficulty prioritising the children and, if necessary, taking whatever action is necessary against a teacher.  It is important that is the case.  Parents have a greater right than we have to an input into the quality and type of education their children receive.</p><p>The Eileen Flynn case is often mentioned in these debates.  Invariably, I find it is mentioned by people who really do not know anything about the case.  All they have are the headlines.  I knew Eileen and I know her partner.  Eileen was a very fine person who I, and many people locally, liked and her untimely death was very sad.  Eileen's issues were not so much about the fact she was pregnant but about the parents intervening because of concerns for their children and where they threatened to remove their children if the school failed to act.  I will not go into the difficulties involved, which local people know.  However, what I will say is that in 1985, I was running in the local elections and RTE sent a crew to New Ross to cover them.  It selected New Ross because her partner was running, I think, for Sinn F&eacute;in.  I recall going to a local establishment, which we usually frequented after our meetings, one evening and I was told the RTE crew had been there earlier that evening before it left to go to Wexford.  It said it was never as ashamed of its profession as it was following what it discovered about the situation in New Ross, which was totally misrepresented in the national media.</p><p>On a positive note, about which I think everybody was very pleased, Eileen subsequently overcame whatever difficulty she was having and ended up teaching in the Christian Brothers school in New Ross and was a very effective and good teacher and a very fine person.  If people use scenarios, they should at least go to the trouble of properly researching them.</p><p>We have received much representation from different groups, in particular, Atheist Ireland.  I said in the past that I think atheists, like people of belief, are people of faith.  It takes faith for somebody to believe there is a God and, equally, it takes faith to believe there is no God.  In many ways, I feel reassured by Atheist Ireland because if there was no God, there would be nothing in particular to &quot;atheiate&quot; from.  </p><p>I think the Minister of State's approach to this is correct and I acknowledged that the last day.  There is the issue of religious freedom and the right of religious schools to preserve their ethos, in particular where the parents involved want to send their children to schools with that ethos.  That must not be interfered with and it is imperative that is protected.  There is also the right of people who work in any working environment but, in particular, in schools to be safeguarded against any discriminatory action by their employers where the quality of the job they are doing is good or where their teaching is good.</p> <p>The challenge for all of us is to find a route that does not discriminate against the employees or against schools with a religious ethos.</p></speech>

This is an important development as the report has clarified what is required in amending the legislation, in particular, what is required of us under European law which is superior to all Irish law, including the Irish Constitution.  The report addresses the concerns raised by the Ministers, Deputies Shatter and Quinn, about the legality of the Bill I put forward in 2012 on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il group.  The Ministers expressed concerns about the constitutionality of the Bill and whether it met our obligations under European law.  We have been vindicated in that respect by the report because it makes clear that what is required of us is quite ambitious and we have a long way to go from our current legal position to ensure that we are living up to our obligations under European law.</p><p>The report also addresses the concerns raised by Senator Bacik when publishing the current Bill last year.  On that occasion she explained to the House why the Bill was so conservatively drafted.  She informed the House that she would have liked to go further but had been advised that the European Directive No. 78 of 2000 required a conservative approach.  I do not for a moment doubt Senator Bacik's bona fides in that respect.  I hope she will now be empowered by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission report to push for a more ambitious equality-based amendment of section 37.</p><p>That report makes it clear that both our existing law and the Bill before the House fall foul of our obligations under European law.  The blanket distinction between public and privately-funded institutions is not consistent with the European directive because the directive makes no such blanket distinction between public and private institutions.  The report also makes it clear that under EU law it is not permissible to use religion as an excuse to discriminate on the basis of gender, sexual orientation or any of the other protected grounds and the protected grounds cannot be interfered with.  The exception to the religious ground will be very narrowly interpreted and any discrimination must meet the test set out by the European courts.  There are no circumstances where action is permissible on the basis of the protected grounds.  Fianna F&aacute;il has put forward Committee Stage amendments to address both those issues.</p><p>The report proposes that discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief should only be permissible where adherence to a particular religious belief is a genuine, legitimate and justified occupational requirement.  Those words are included in the provisions of the Bill.</p><p>There has to be a connection between the specific role and the requirement to be of a particular belief.  Case law from other European member states indicates that a strict test will be applied by the European courts to any exemption.  For example, the courts would be very unlikely to allow discrimination against a groundsman on the basis of his faith because there is no clear connection between the role and any religious requirement.  There is a need for greater clarity with regard to the different types of employment in religious organisations and in schools and hospitals under religious patronage.  There are different layers of employment, the first layer being ministers of religion, priests, rabbis, imams and other religious officials.  Very few would argue that churches should not enjoy almost complete autonomy in selecting such people.  Anti-discrimination legislation should not require the Catholic Church to recruit or train women - I wish this were the case but I appreciate that it is not our place to force it to do so.  I do not think anyone would make an argument that it should be forced to do so.</p><p>However, the second layer of employment may contain people who may not be ordained but who perform tasks that are closely related to the religion, religious mission or church.  It should be noted that in the UK when similar legislation was being tested, a man who had been refused employment as a youth worker by a religious organisation on the basis of his homosexuality, won his challenge and was awarded compensation because the court was not satisfied that there was a clear connection between the role and the requirement to be of a particular religious faith.  The third layer of employment contains a wide range of other employees who occupy non-religious posts such as a groundsman, cleaners or administrators.  Those type of positions have not been the subject of controversy.  There has been debate in other countries such as the UK about employing homosexual people as youth workers and about workers in the second category of employment.  Religious organisations might argue that such workers are not working as ministers but they are working for a religious organisation and therefore that they should share the faith in question but other rights come into play such as the right to earn a living.</p><p>There is likely to be a considerable clash of views in this country during the time this legislation is being discussed and amended, and thereafter, about such interpretations.  There is likely to be a clash of views as, for instance, between myself and Senator Walsh, on the question of ethos and what the respect for ethos requires.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission report makes clear that we need to be more specific on the question of ethos as there will be very different interpretations in particular in the area of education.  For example, the INTO represents teachers and the Catholic Primary Schools Management Association and other associations represent schools of a particular faith.  There may be different opinions about the type of behaviour that would constitute an active undermining of an ethos.  We must take care when using in legislation terms such as &quot;actively undermining&quot;, &quot;ethos&quot; and &quot;genuine legitimate occupational requirement&quot;.  There is a need to ensure clarity as to their meaning.  As legislators we cannot be overly-specific when drafting legislation but equally we cannot abdicate our responsibility and allow words to be put in legislation which are deeply controversial and then leave it to the courts to provide the definition.  We have a long way to go to produce legislation that meets the requirements of the report of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission which stresses the need for clarity and legal certainty.  It is in the interests of everyone to have that clarity, as much in the interests of the employer as the employee.  There needs to be a shared understanding of what is required and the circumstances in which action can and cannot be taken against an individual.  This is a requirement under European law.</p><p>The commission's report highlights the fact that the Irish Government has not released a recent opinion from the European Commission which expressed concern about our legislation because of the view that it would fall foul of European law.  However, we have access to the recent opinion from the European Commission to the UK Government which was made public.  In that opinion the European Commission stressed that the European Court of Justice has consistently held that directives must be implemented with sufficient clarity and precision to satisfy the requirements of legal certainty.  In my view, neither the current legislation nor this Bill meets that test.  We have a long way to go.</p><p>I am glad the Bill is not being guillotined.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission report sets out a clear framework for how we should proceed.  It states that this Bill would not meet our obligations under EU law and that it could possibly need to be amended out of all recognition before it is enacted.  The amendments we have tabled anticipate some of the issues referred to by Senator Zappone in her amendments about religious grounds and my amendments deal with the public-private distinction and other protected grounds.  I suspect the Government is reserving its right to bring forward a whole host of amendments on Report Stage.  I suspect there will be a book full of amendments on Report Stage.  I refer to my original intention when we discussed this issue two years ago.  </p> <p>I would like to see us work on this from a cross-party perspective where we can put all of our heads together and come up with legislation we are all happy with.  The best way to do that is to bring forward new legislation on foot of the IHREC report.  This Bill has only gone to Second Stage and we should produce new legislation to pass Second, Committee and Report Stages.</p><p>There is a lot of goodwill, knowledge and interest in this issue in the House.  Some Members were here when the original legislation was passed in 1988 and objected to it at the time.  Some people take a great interest in it but the Bill will not receive the same level of interest or contribution when it goes to the Lower House.  As much as I want to see legislation passed as soon as possible and I wish we could have done it earlier, I want to see the right legislation passed.  With dozens of Report Stage amendments all trying to do similar things with different wording, our final reading of the Bill will be on Report Stage and I am concerned that we will not have sufficient scrutiny of the final wording of the Bill.  I would prefer to start afresh so we can produce acceptable legislation and work together to conclude it as soon as possible.</p><p>Each group made submissions as part of the IHREC process but, unfortunately, they have not been published.  I ask the Minister to talk to the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, about that.  In the education sphere, most submissions are published on the Department of Education and Skills' website so that everyone can see where other groups are coming from.  It helps us to have an informed debate and to see the extent to which we can reach consensus on some issues and understand the concerns of other groups.  That has not been done in this case and I have only seen a handful of the 61 submissions.  I urge the Department to put them forward.</p><p>It is essential the two Ministers respond formally and publicly to the IHREC report.  I understand they will want to consult the Attorney General first but it is essential there is a proper formal response that everyone has access to so that we are not listening to a ministerial speech whenever the Minister comes into the House and responding straight away.  The issues are more complicated and more important than that.</p><p>At the education committee meeting, which I have just come from, I proposed having a hearing on it and the committee agreed to do so in the first week of July.  That is quite close but sufficiently far away to allow the groups to prepare for it.  It will not add any great delay for us to do it.  We used that procedure for the Gender Recognition Bill, the Bill dealing with school admissions and for other issues.  I can see Senator Bacik talking to the Minister.  For the most part, this is justice legislation but it is of particular interest to the education community and there is nothing to stop the education committee having hearings on the Bill.  There is nothing to stop it having hearings while the legislation is in this House.  We have hearings on issues of general concern, not just on Committee Stage.  We bring in groups to hear their points of view.  We must find a way to bring everyone around the table and come up with proper legislation that is as detailed as it needs to be and that provides the legal clarity required.</p><p>The IHREC report makes it clear that people cannot discriminate on the grounds of sexual orientation under European law, which shows us that we must deal with concerns of LGBT teachers about their identity in the classroom and in religious-run hospitals.  In the past week, teachers have asked me whether, if we introduce legislation that provides that people cannot actively undermine the ethos, it means a female teacher in civil partnership getting married, going back into the classroom and responding to a question on why she is wearing a wedding ring by saying she married her wife at the weekend, is actively undermining the ethos.  Senator Zappone has made this point.  If a teacher, gay or straight, intervenes in a case of homophobic bullying and says that people cannot bully others because they are gay, that being gay is not grounds for discrimination and that everyone should be treated equally regardless of sexual orientation, is it actively undermining the ethos of a religiously-run school?  Is it actively undermining the ethos of a religious-run school if someone is photographed at a marriage equality rally over the coming year?  We need clarity on these issues and it is important we do so before finishing the legislation by teasing it out and making sure the legislation we end up with is fit for purpose.  I want us to do so as quickly as possible and we will facilitate it on the Opposition side but I also want us to do our job correctly.</p></speech>

I am glad that, in the interim, we have had the publication of the IHREC report on the issue of section 37(1) and how to address it in the context of the directive.  I am glad the paper has been published and it is important to maintain the momentum.  Maintaining momentum in the legislative process has a knock-on effect in other ways and this has seen the report published more quickly than it otherwise might have been.</p><p>I am wary of suggesting that we should wait for the publication of a new Bill because I know the kind of delay that can occur when we are talking about the Government putting a new Bill on a legislative timetable and having to get Cabinet approval for that new Bill.  We have a Bill before us and it is not perfect.  I said on Second Stage and again last week that it was drafted somewhat conservatively, in accordance with legal advice.  I hope it can be strengthened and made more robust.  We now have a pretty clear blueprint from the IHREC lawyers, Marguerite Bolger and Claire Bruton, who I commend for their work.  We have a clear blueprint and it gives us a clear indication of the kind of amendments required for the Bill, which are not extensive.</p><p>The recommendation paper sets out options and rules out all but the option taken in the Bill.  It is helpful for all of us to see that it deals clearly with the issue of deleting section 37(1).  A number of trade unions suggested section 37(1) could be deleted in its entirety.  In a perfect world, that would be my view too but many of us were conscious the approach would not stand up to legal scrutiny.  That is made clear in the recommendation paper, which also says that the best and most legally desirable manner in which to deal with the issues in section 37(1) are to amend it.  They set out six issues that must be taken on board in drafting legislation amending section 37(1).  A number of them have been incorporated into the text of the Bill before us.</p><p>Some amendment will be necessary and I am delighted that paragraphs 41 and 42 of the recommendation paper give the clear view that we should provide the same protection to those employed in institutions that are privately funded.  There are models in other European countries, such as the Netherlands, where there is a distinction between private and public institutions.  It is not the case that making the distinction falls foul of European law but we do not have to make the distinction and a more progressive way of amending section 37(1) is to delete the distinction.  I am glad to see it and it will provide more robust protection to employees.</p><p>It also makes clear that the burden of proof must be on the employer, which is included in the Bill.  No discrimination should be permissible where it constitutes discrimination on another ground.  There are some areas in which the recommendation paper is somewhat less prescriptive than it might have been.  On page 15, it refers to the genuine, legitimate and justified occupational requirement test, which is in the Bill.  It says that consideration should be given as to whether this applies only to access to employment and whether this would be sufficient to satisfy the proportionality requirement.  Clearly, that is a more progressive drafting and I would welcome the idea that it applies only to access to employment and, beyond that, there is less room for exemption for religious bodies.  The report then goes on to say that to allow the discrimination beyond access to employment could be overly broad, although some consideration may need to be given to an employer's requirement to maintain numbers of employees of a particular religion at a particular level within an organisation.  A decision will have to be made on that point and we should work constructively to do that where the report does not clearly give us guidance.</p> <p>In paragraph 45 it raises a point, which I think Senator Zappone raises in an amendment, that there is a narrower provision in the equivalent Australian legislation saying that discrimination &quot;in an educational institution can only arise in the context of &ldquo;<i>doctrines, tenets, beliefs or teachings of a particular religion or creed</i>&rdquo; &quot;.  It takes the view that this would be a suitable standard.  Perhaps we could consider incorporating that into the Bill.  That would give employees greater protection because it would further narrow the grounds of allowed discrimination.<br />There are several issues which require work but that will not require extensive amendments.  Many of the six recommendations at the end of the paper have already been met.  We need to amend the provisions on public and private institutions and I am glad about that.  In general the position in the Bill is vindicated.  It is the right legal approach.<br />There is a useful analysis of the directive and of Article 4(2).  Last week we spoke about the language in the directive.  Some of the language in Article 4(2) is permissive, for example, it uses &ldquo;may&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  It is important to note the proviso at the end of Article 4(2) which is in prescriptive language that the directive &quot;shall thus not prejudice the right of churches&quot; etc. &quot;to require individuals working for them to act in good faith and with loyalty to the organisation&rsquo;s ethos.&quot;  The authors of the recommendation paper have quite rightly pointed out that the language of the directive overall means that in any amending legislation, &quot;There is a need to balance conflicting rights between employers and employees, the interests of the religious institution, the protection of their ethos and the rights of all individuals to a workplace free from discrimination.&quot;  It is important to get that balance right.  We are well on the road to doing so.<br />I am very glad to have received communications from the teachers&rsquo; unions, particularly the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, which said they would welcome a little more time to consider the report.  They are not pushing for Committee Stage to be concluded at this point.  I am very grateful for that.  I am also glad that we are adjourning rather than concluding Committee Stage today because the teachers&rsquo; unions recognise the need for a little more time.  I stress a &quot;little&quot; more time.<br />I welcome the representatives from the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network, GLEN, who are in the Visitors' Gallery.  They take the same view, namely, that we need a little more time now that the report has been published.  Let us keep the momentum.  Last week, we all agreed that if possible we should seek to have the Bill become law in time for the next school year, in September 2014.  The Attorney General will have to scrutinise the Government amendments and there is some uncertainty about the time that would take.  Here in the Seanad we should be able to keep the legislative pressure up by scheduling Committee Stage for soon after Easter, and to have Government amendments, if not drafted by then, at least begun so that we have them for Report Stage and keep the momentum up.<br />I am not a member of the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection and that committee is entitled to do as it wishes but hearings that might delay the Bill&rsquo;s progress through the Oireachtas would not be a good idea at this stage.  There has been extensive consultation.  It would be very helpful to see all the submissions, to which the recommendations paper refers, published.  It would make reading the IHREC recommendation paper much easier if one could see the submissions.  I made a submission, as I am sure many of us did.  It refers to some submissions from unions of which we are all aware.  It would be helpful to know what was the balance of submissions, the views taken and see some of the points made.<br />It is important to reflect on the paper, to welcome it and focus our minds between now and the resumption of Committee Stage after Easter, on how best to amend the Bill, to ensure it meets the standards set out in the recommendation paper and that we can ensure as extensive protection as possible for employees against discrimination in the workplace. <br />I am very familiar with the judgments in the Eileen Flynn case.  Like many here I have read them several times over many years and know exactly the issues involved, as does the Minister of State.  We would all want to make sure nothing like that could happen again to an employee and that employees would be protected in the future in the workplace against discrimination on the grounds of sexuality, sexual orientation or their marital or family status.</p></speech>

So much that is excellent has been said by my colleagues on all sides of the House that I welcome it and do not want anything I say to be redundant.  I very much agree with Senator Bacik that it is important that this Bill be in place for the autumn school term, if at all possible.  If we can amend it and make it better, so much the better.  We must concern ourselves with what one of my colleagues continuously describes as "the chilling effect" of this, that and the other.  I am always on the other side to him but there is a chilling effect because even though these clauses have not been activated, as far as I know, in this jurisdiction to permit discrimination, they are there, latent and dormant, and do create fear particularly in a minority that has been so discriminated against over 2,000 years.</p><p>I remember and was in this House when the Eileen Flynn case occurred.  My recollection of it is vastly different to Senator Walsh&rsquo;s.  I very much regret that he is not here to listen to my remarks but I am sure that he is somewhere listening to them or somebody will tell him about them and I hope somebody does.  It was first suggested that the parents objected.  So bloody what.  The parents should have been put in their box very firmly, if they made these objections.  If, for example, they objected to black students being in the class, said they did not like it, that it was not good for their children, some of it might rub off on them, that would have been an ignorant, stupid and unchristian attitude and they should have been slapped into their place.</p><p>I have heard of hearsay evidence and things overheard in pubs and &quot;d&uacute;irt bean liom go nd&uacute;irt bean l&eacute;i&quot; but this is the first time I have heard of an RTE television crew being overheard in a pub by third parties who said to a fourth party that they were more ashamed of this than of anything else.  This is nonsensical stuff and would be immediately dismissed in a court of law as being hearsay of the most remote and nonsensical kind.</p><p>If this woman, Eileen Flynn, was fit to teach in a Christian Brothers school &ndash; and one wonders about the standards required when one considers the history of what occurred in these institutions &ndash; what made her unfit for the first position?  There is an obvious lack of connection there.  I am very ashamed of some of my middle class, bourgeois, professional colleagues.  I do not refer to those in politics but in the law.  I recall saying to friends of mine who are lawyers that this was an absolute outrage and they said &quot;What about it?  She is married to a Provo.&quot;  I do not know whether she was.  I do not care.  It does not bother me.  I do not care if she is married to a gorilla.  She has rights inherently of herself.  I thought that was a most outrageous attitude.</p><p>This is an interesting Bill.  Senator Bacik says it does not go quite as far as she would like it to go.  I have heard this argument so many times.  I heard it 20 years when Mervyn Taylor made the point that it was impossible for the Government to go any further than it did.  I have always liked to push and it is easy for me as an Independent to do so.  That is part of the role of the Independents and I hope this Government does not manage in its efforts to extinguish Independents in this House which it is trying to do.  It is part of our role to push even those of our colleagues who do good work, set the bar higher and say we must go as far as possible because eventually we have to reach a completely satisfactory situation. </p><p>Senator Power has been a great champion, with other people, and I note that it is largely women such as Senators Power, Bacik and Zappone who stand up for the rights of gay people, including gay men.  I am happy that they are in the forefront because possibly that makes me look moderate.</p> <p>I do not know.</p></speech>

I thank the Senator.  Senator Power gave me a document which I have just read, as I can speed-read, and certain elements interest me.  It indicates section 37(1)(<i>a</i>) of the Employment Equality Acts 1998 to 2011 permit positive discrimination in certain circumstances by allowing more favourable treatment of employees or prospective employees, etc.  It is arguable that this is not so offensive.  Section 37(1)(<i>b</i>) is the really nasty and dangerous provision but even in the earlier part, the concepts of religious education, medical institutions or religious ethos are not defined.  How can we operate legally in a position where the criteria upon which a court is expected to judge are not defined?  There could be some difficulty in defining &quot;ethos&quot;, &quot;religious ethos&quot;,&quot;religious education&quot; or &quot;medical institutions&quot; but perhaps there could be a list.<br />I am very worried by the reference to paragraph (<i>b</i>) on page 4 of the Bill, and I hope to amend it by deleting it.  It states: &quot;Notwithstanding paragraph (<i>a</i>), where an educational or medical institution of the type mentioned in that paragraph is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants provided out of public funds&quot;, before giving a list of how these bodies can be exempted.  I am fed up paying my tax euro to be discriminated against.  If these bodies want to discriminate, they should hump off on their own and fund themselves.  I do not want a red cent of my money being used to discriminate against me or anybody else on the basis of religious beliefs.  It happens that I am a regular church-goer and I have a strong belief, for which I am very grateful.  Others have very different views on this and the views of agnostics, atheists and everybody else should be protected.<br />Religious institutions of any kind, including those of my own church, should not be exempted because of some vague, fuzzy notion of ethos.  As I have stated for the past 30 years, if people want to know about ethos, they should not look at some holy Willy prayer book or wishy-washy religious tract from any of the religions.  The Bible stated &quot;By their deeds shall ye know them.&quot;  I am not specifically targeting the Roman Catholic Church but considering the record of this country, all the churches - perhaps with the exception of Quakers - have had their ethos categorised by subterfuge, cover-up and massive dishonesty on the subject of human sexuality.  That is what ethos is about in the real world; it is about not telling the truth and frightening people.  I hope Members will excuse a slight vulgarity - I will tone it down slightly - but they knew damn well from the Middle Ages that if one has people by the goolies, one really has their attention and can do whatever is required.<br />Like other colleagues, I have put down some amendments for Report Stage.  They may be supplemental to those tabled by my colleagues, Senators Zappone and Power.  For example, I want to replace the phrase &quot;religious&quot; with &quot;religious or belief-based&quot; as I see atheism as a belief.  It is quite a strong belief in defiance of much of the evidence out there.  I can argue that philosophically some other day.</p></speech>

It would be morally bad and intellectually disgraceful, as well as imposing an incorrect burden on teachers and pupils, for example, to have somebody who is a committed atheist trying to teach the New Testament if he or she does not believe it.  Children are not fools and will smell that straight away.</p><p>I have heard a little about the rights of parents from the type of people who used to say that they heard much about rights but what about obligations?  If parents are so worked up about religious ethos, why is it not being given to children in the home?  That is where I got my religious ethos, and I sure as hell did not get it from any of my schools.  Parents have rights and obligations, and if they want religion to be clear to children and loved and respected by them, there is an obligation on parents to facilitate that.  I take my job as a godfather seriously and would take it much more seriously if I was a parent.  I will seek to add a provision stating &quot;but publicly and lawfully manifesting a religion or belief shall not be grounds for undermining the ethos of the institution&quot;.  The point has been made and if a person turns up at a marriage equality demonstration and is photographed there, why should that person be subject to discrimination?</p><p>That is basically what I wanted to say as I do not want to be tedious.  I look forward to Report Stage of this very important Bill.  I commend Senator Bacik for introducing it.  It is interesting that it was proposed by the Senator and I presume there is Labour Party support for it.</p></speech>

I get the sense we are broadly in agreement.  There have been issues raised by the report published over the weekend by the International Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC.  We support the thrust of what is being said in that regard.  As has been admitted by Senator Bacik, there is a need for amendments of some sort, so perhaps we could get a sense of those from the Senator and the Minister of State.  Will they take on board some of what has been said in order to move the debate along?  We do not want to stall this Bill, which is important and should be moved along as quickly as possible.  We could go around in circles for quite a while but I would prefer to get to the nub of the matter.  Will the Government support the thrust of what is contained in the report and will it introduce Report Stage amendments to that effect?  If not, we must rethink the issue.</p></speech>

It is in some ways its first piece of work related to legislation and I acknowledge the leadership of Mr. Brian Merriman and all of the staff.  We should keep up momentum.</p><p>I agree with Senator Bacik and on reading the report I believe the body is calling on us to be technically correct and clear around two primary issues concerning the religion ground, and there may be some discriminatory treatment allowed on the basis of religious ethos, and only regarding a genuine occupational requirement relating to that ground.  That is as I read the report and how I was following the issue in terms of advice received.  I put forward amendments that tried to follow the EU framework, and that is why some amendments must try to do this.  It is important for us to be aware of these issues.</p><p>I like the idea of a committee considering the matter, although it should not be a long or extensive process.  If representatives of IHREC came before the committee, it would be interesting for us to tease out issues in creating Report Stage amendments.  It was not always clear to me where the various submissions fed into this opinion, so such a process could be helpful.</p> <p>I would be especially pleased to hear about some of the thinking behind the amendments tabled by Senator Averil Power on Committee Stage that might perhaps dovetail with the opinion coming from the Commission in order that we can move on and reach Report Stage.</p></speech>

I regret not being able to be part of the debate either last Wednesday or today because on both occasions I had to prioritise committees.  It is one of the faults of the system to have these matters running concurrently.  </p><p>This is interesting legislation.  I have worked in schools as a teacher and a teacher educator and would not wish any teacher to feel discriminated against on the grounds of religion or ethos.  I am deeply conscious that I have not heard the debate today as I was elsewhere, but it has been my experience as an educator that it is within the capacity of a board of management and a school to facilitate a teacher who does not wish to teach religion such that another teacher can take on that duty.  I believe there is that capacity in the system.  The Minister of State might respond to the point in her summation.  Religion is not just about facts; it is about attitude and belief also.  There is as much caught as is taught.  I would welcome a response from the Minister of State in that regard.  Our institutions, schools and colleges have the capacity to be able to have a teacher on the staff and at the same time to be able to facilitate that staff member such that someone else can take the class while he or she teaches another.</p></speech>

I am sure schools make arrangements every day about teachers who are particularly good at teaching geography or have a particular interest in history or maths &ndash; we all know some teachers are better than others at maths &ndash; and I am sure it is the same in the case of religion.  As Senator David Norris correctly pointed out, both today and on the previous day, one will know very quickly whether someone has a particular interest.  I do not mean someone who is particularly good at something, but it is obvious when someone has an interest.</p><p>I hope I will not have to read my prepared speech.

I am sure it will not have any great objection.  It is important that we waited for the contribution of the commission designate because it has brought a new focus on where we need to be and the issues we must deal with also.  However, it is simply an opinion; it is not the definitive legal position.  Because of this we will now have to go to the Attorney General with a list of questions on the legislation arising from the contributions made and the opinion given.  We cannot determine the length of time this will take.  There are always issues that might arise that could take priority, but we will not allow the matter to rest.  We will continue to apply pressure.</p><p>I am not certain when the Government amendments to the legislation will be ready.  I would not like to mislead anybody by giving guarantees in that regard.  It would be lovely if we could have them for the next school term, but I do not think that can be guaranteed by anyone because it will very much depend on the speed with which the Attorney General can make a response and what the Government&rsquo;s position will be as soon as that is presented with the information.  That is the normal and natural course of events.</p><p>I very much thank Senator Ivana Bacik and everyone who has made a contribution to this legislation which is hugely important.  It is about a significant cohort of Irish citizens who find themselves in a position where they cannot fully be themselves and where they cannot fully express their own identify within their work environment.  It is important we ensure people, both male and female, feel protected.  As elected representatives of whatever nature &ndash; Independents or party members &ndash; in both we Houses are very privileged.  That is why the protection we have for what we say is called &ldquo;privilege&rdquo;.  We should recognise what it means.  It means that we must be careful about how we speak about those who do not have that privilege or protection.</p><p>I am very conscious of Eileen Flynn and the circumstances in which she found herself, but it is not just that, she has a family who are still living normal lives, as we all do, of which we must be very cognisant.  We must be very conscious not to make the type of innuendo that is unexplained and could be made about any one of us &ndash; God knows, it probably has been done &ndash; but not in an arena such as this.  We must be conscious of the privilege we have.  I wish people the very best in the future.  Those who suffered in the past are probably more delicate than the rest of us and we need to be careful.  People should be reminded continuously of the privileged position they hold.</p><p>I thank Members for their co-operation.  The suggestion made of a cross-party group to discuss the legislation is very important.  It is a very good one.  When the Government comes back with its amendments, having gone through the process, I hope we can have a civilised discussion, as has been the case to date.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-04-16a.236" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1170" speakername="Marie Louise O'Donnell" time="13:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014041600025#Z00200"><p>I move:<blockquote><br />That Seanad &Eacute;ireann &ndash;- conscious that almost 29,000 people die each year in Ireland and 290,000 people are newly bereaved;<br />- aware that contributors to the recent hearings on palliative, end-of-life and bereavement care at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children identified that end-of-life issues are wider than health care;calls on the Government to put in place a review to explore the components of an overarching strategy on end of life and bereavement, which would have regard to the wider societal issues arising, including legal, financial, economic, educational and cultural aspects.</blockquote>Between October and November 2013, an unprecedented series of meetings took place in the Oireachtas health committee, ably steered by the Chairman, Deputy Jerry Buttimer.  The committee brought together an extraordinary group of people to discuss an issue which has, without exception, the most profound implications for everyone - namely, palliative care, end-of-life care and bereavement.  It was a privilege and an education to hear practitioners, clinical and non-clinical, specialist and generalist medical personnel, as well as legal, governmental and non-governmental experts speak about their work with and for people and their families who are facing death and loss.  We heard about how 29,000 people die every year in Ireland and 290,000 people are newly bereaved, as well as the philosophy, psychology, cultural and educational aspects of dying, death and bereavement.  The depth and breadth of their knowledge gave a new insight into the universal truth a dying man once told me, &ldquo;You cannot get off this planet alive.&rdquo;<br />I attended the hearings, which made me look again at how and when people die, as well as the way we acknowledge death.  I do not intend to rehearse all of the information and argument given to the Oireachtas health committee but I will share a few salient points with my colleagues who were not able to be present at the hearings.<br />It is estimated that we spend &euro;1.3 billion each year on end-of-life care, most of which is unplanned.  I learned that we can die at any age, from the end of a long life to the prime of life or when life is just beginning.  We die at all times from the small hours of the morning to the middle of the night, although less often between 9 and 5 on Monday to Friday.  We die in all circumstances - in hospital, in long-stay care, at home or in hospice care.<br />While we Irish believe we are good at death, we have very different understandings, practices and protocols about dying, death and bereavement.  Some are good while others are not so good.  When they are not good, the people mainly affected are those who are dying and those who love and care for them.  In end-of-life care we have one chance to get it right, and there are so many people inside and outside the health services working to get it right.  I learned that there is great support for all of the excellent palliative care, end-of-life care and bereavement practices and initiatives within the health services and in hospices, hospitals and the community.<br />It would make sense to bring together all of these developments to augment and reinforce them.  A strategic approach would, at the very least, ensure we spent our &euro;1.3 billion in a more planned and focused way.  It might ensure that the one chance to get it right is successful more and more often.  I have great faith that following the compelling information shared with my colleagues in the health committee, they will recommend such a strategic approach to the Minister.  This is a time of great challenge and great change in the health services.  Perhaps it is also a time of great opportunity for our new hospital trusts and others.  Dying, death and bereavement, however, cannot be neatly packaged and handed over to the palliative care services or the health service generally as their exclusive remit and responsibility.<br />Dying, death and bereavement affect us all, and they are our responsibility as citizens and as human beings.  It has been said that dying, death and loss are often marginalised into sub-specialities and external locations, all of which give an implied message that death is someone else&rsquo;s business.  Professor Eamon O&rsquo;Shea of NUI Galway told the Oireachtas committee that if our approach to dying is to be truly holistic, it must broadly move beyond the clinical, medical and caring areas into an understanding of what is needed around death.  Dying, death and bereavement affect us all.  They are our responsibility as citizens and as human beings, as mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, grandparents, brothers and sisters, nieces and nephews, aunts and uncles, employers and employees, law-makers and law enforcers, public servants and private citizens, teachers and pupils, colleagues and friends.  It is our responsibility because we interact in all of those roles, personally and professionally, with our fellow human beings facing or dealing with dying, death and bereavement.<br />How is this responsibility ours, and, by extension, part of the State&rsquo;s responsibility?  The State interacts with the dying, the dead and the bereaved.  For example, with the registration of births, deaths and marriages, the State counts us in and counts us out.  When it really counts, does the State perform well?  Does it help those public servants registering deaths to interact sensitively and sensibly with the people facing the collection of the inevitable bureaucratic full stop, namely the death certificate of a loved one?  How does the State equip the garda who has to knock on the door at three o&rsquo;clock in the morning to deliver the news that no family wants to hear?  How does the State support the teacher with a class of adolescents who have just lost one of their number to suicide or the seven year old who has lost a parent or sibling?  How does the employer cope with terminal illness, death and bereavement in the workforce and how do we as work colleagues support each other?  Do we really want to continue with unregulated crematoria and an unregulated funeral industry?<br />The State, and we as governors of the State, is prone to inconsistencies.  We are doing some things very well and others not so well.  Two examples will suffice to illustrate this.  On the plus side, the Government is about to enable true patient autonomy through the enactment of legislation to allow for advance health care directives.  On the minus side, in the last budget, the decision was made to abolish the modest bereavement grant.</p> <p>What a negative message and disproportionate burden that is on older people and their psychological security and peace of mind concerning funeral arrangements.<br />In other areas citizens have taken brilliant initiatives such as the Compassionate Communities project at Milford Care Centre in Limerick which seeks to work in partnership with individuals, groups and communities facing loss and those experiencing bereavement.  The grief-at-work resources were developed in partnership with the Irish Hospice Foundation, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, IBEC, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, the Small Firms Association, SFA, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Employment and others to help workers to support employees.  In 2011 the Taoiseach launched the Forum on End of Life's think ahead initiative, a citizen-led planning tool that encourages and provides a way for people to think about and pre-record their wishes in the event of a serious illness.  It highlights the importance of planning ahead to ensure an individual's right to make decisions for himself or herself is honoured.<br />The State must learn from these initiatives and catch up with community-led creative solutions.  We need the panoply of State services to help us to think, talk and tell about dying, death and loss and enable us to support each other.  We need to examine what we do and do not do brilliantly, pull all these strands together in a coherent whole and weave all the separate threads of good practice and support into a tapestry of our common humanity.  I urge the Government, through the Minister and the Cabinet, to accept this proposal that it establish an advisory or working group to build on the initial work done by the Oireachtas committee.  The group should be charged with the task of identifying all the components of a comprehensive end-of-life strategy and the actions required to ensure a better end of life.  It should develop a strategic framework which identifies short-term minimal resources, highest priorities and medium-term and long-term outcomes, creating a blueprint for action to ensure people can live well at the end of their lives and that their families are supported in their bereavement.  The group should be led by the Department of the Taoiseach to ensure a wide perspective and supported by a strong secretariat.  It should be cross-departmental and comprise representatives of all Departments, including the Departments of Health; the Environment, Community and Local Government; Social Protection; Justice and Equality; Education and Skills; Finance; and Public Expenditure and Reform.  It should invite oral and written submissions from interested parties and facilitate meeting people where they are, namely, in their homes and communities.  It should seek the views of people living in the community.  It should reflect on the findings and recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children which concentrated on the health aspects of end-of-life care.  It is not an Insurmountable task or ask but an essential undertaking.<br />Dr. Paul D&rsquo;Alton addressed the Oireachtas committee thus:<blockquote>Death remains the biggest threat as well as the greatest challenge to humanity.  It is the single universal event that affects all of us in more ways than we care to know.  There is a growing amount of literature that points to the fact that death is not a discrete event; rather, we die as we live ... In this way dying well does not simply involve the last days or weeks of life; rather, it is the product of attitudes and values that we hold as citizens and governors of the State.  These attitudes and values underpin how we prioritise and organise our services, how we interact on a personal level, and fundamentally how our society responds to the issue of death and dying.</blockquote>I commend the motion to the House and echo the words of the Taoiseach, in whom I believe, when he launched the think ahead initiative:<blockquote>The think ahead initiative helps prevent shock, helps avoid confusion ... by encouraging us to think, talk and tell.  It takes the attention, the intention and the desire of the way we live and applies them equally and exquisitely to our death and dying, so we have some control, choice, peace, dignity at the end.</blockquote></p></speech>

Government Members are decent people and we can stand united on this motion.  It would have been outrageous to have tabled an amendment to it.  I thank the Government, as it is a good day for Seanad &Eacute;ireann and Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell.  This important point has been addressed, but it did not receive much publicity.  Last year a former Member of this House and a former Supreme Court Judge, Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness, chaired the Forum on End of Life which issued a press statement calling for precisely the kind of thing for which the Senator calls, that the Government prepare a national end-of-life strategy.  The statement read:<blockquote><br />We believe the time has come for the State to look at all aspects of end of life in Ireland and plan for the future delivery of care and services.  The strategy should be wider than health care and reach into other relevant areas of life - economic, legal and administrative affairs.  Death is a taboo issue.  The State should take the lead in starting a national dialogue on death and bereavement.</blockquote>Here in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, thanks to our colleague, we have started to do so.<br />The enormous shift in the past 100 years has surprised me.  I studied it when I gave a lecture in honour of Dr. Mary Redmond at St Francis Hospice.  At the beginning of the last century the overwhelming majority of people died at home, while now less than one quarter do so.  Although most people, 80%, want to die at home, 76% of them do not.  We must take this into consideration and examine the environment in which they die.  Acute hospitals are often noisy; there is little privacy; wards are mixed-sex; there is a lack of single rooms; other people may be watching television or joking while the dying process is ongoing.  Naturally, the nursing staff are far more geared up to save lives.  They are not even trained in the skills necessary to assist people when they confront this issue.<br />Each death is different and people have different attitudes towards it.  While I am very lucky because death does not bother me, I know many are petrified by the idea of it.  There is the question of the attitude towards doctors.  Will they tell the person concerned?  Will they tell the family?  Who will make the decisions?  The inclusion, as far as possible, no matter what the circumstances, of the dying person in all these decisions is essential for a dignified death.<br />Recently, a much beloved former Member of this House and a Member of the other House, Deputy Nicky McFadden, died of the cruellest disease, motor neurone disease.  I have been reading the evidence of a nurse which fits in very well with what Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell said:<blockquote>The development of evidence-based guidelines for end-of-life decisions in non-malignant terminal illness is overdue.  This work will be valuable from patient management and health service planning perspectives as it will identify and characterise the current limitations in care for a large proportion of patients with neurodegenerative diseases.  Informing and guiding patients and their families through the difficult decision-making process to a peaceful death should be integral to the medical practice.</blockquote>We all hope for a peaceful death.  The great communion service and the mass include the words &quot;<i>Agnus Dei ... dona nobis pacem</i>,&quot; &quot;grant us thy peace.&quot;  We can help by starting the debate.<br />I remember a woman who was a great friend of my aunt.  She was a wonderful person, commanding and domineering.  She would get turf for all of the distressed old gentlefolk and organise their free television licences.  One day I told my aunt that I did not think the lady was well.  I could see that yellow thing.  She had the same cancer I have but nothing could be done at that stage.  She went into a very expensive nursing home, which was appalling because although every luxury was provided, they were not interested.  She fell on the floor several times and was left there for half an hour.  When I telephoned her, she was in tears.  She wanted to go to the hospice, but the doctors knew better.  With all of her money, the doctors and the luxury, she was in misery.  I called in a favour and got her in a hospice and her life was transformed.  She could have a little glass of gin, play cards, have her friends in and live to the end.  That is what all of us want, to have some quality of life before we go.<br />I also remember a friend of mine, a great character, who was an artist, and his partner, Caitr&iacute;ona, who lived on Mountjoy Square.  He had a sudden heart attack and was taken into hospital where the last thing he heard was a drunken couple fighting in the corridor.</p> <p>A young doctor came in and told his partner that he was dead.  That was it.  Then in they came and carted him off.  She said that nobody there had any training on how to deal with a person who is suddenly bereaved because hospitals "don't do death".  I think that they should start to do death. </p><p>There is also prejudice and stereotyping against various groups such as Travellers, people who suffer from dementia and gay people who experience what is called disenfranchised grief.  Sometimes these people are not allowed to attend funerals or are not recognised as spouses.  Occasionally this does happen.  I will never forget when Miche&aacute;l MacLiomm&oacute;ir died and President &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh, at a time when being gay was still criminal, reached across the grave to shake the hand of Miche&aacute;l's partner, Hilton Edwards, and told him he was sorry for his trouble.   What about people who suffer from cystic fibrosis which is a very special disease?  We need to examine all of these matters.  What about people with learning disabilities?  Bereavement is often not just about the confusion of the person.  Parents worry what will happen to their child when they pass on.  </p><p>I shall make two final points.  Sometimes terminally-ill children are discharged into the community but there is no place, help or assistance available for them at that point in their lives.</p><p>Finally, the State grant for funerals is gone.  I would like the Minister to re-examine the matter and provide a cushion and help to people.  If that were done it would indicate that we, as a community, care.  I congratulate my colleague, Senator O'Donnell, on tabling the motion.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-04-16a.242" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1150" speakername="Colm Burke" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014041600027#BB00200"><p>I formally withdraw the amendment.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I also welcome this debate and thank the Senators for bringing it forward.</p><p>As set out in the motion, on average 29,000 people die every year and for every person who dies ten people, directly or indirectly, are affected which amounts to 290,000 people.  The motion covers a number of different issues.  It is important that we look at how and where people die which has been referred to by a number of speakers.  A survey was conducted a number of years on Irish people and 67% indicated that if they were dying they would prefer to be cared for at home.  However, only 25% of people die in their own home, 70% die in care institutions, and 43% of deaths occur in acute hospitals.  It is in that context that we need to decide whether it is necessary, for instance, to transfer people from nursing homes to hospitals for the last few days of their lives.  We need to examine the issue immediately.  Between the fair deal scheme being operated in private nursing homes, community hospitals and care facilities for the elderly, over 27,000 people are cared for.  Surely we could start with them and adopt a more progressive approach instead of unnecessarily transferring people to hospitals at this time.  We need to look at the matter.  </p><p>We must also examine palliative care.  We focus very much on palliative care for people with cancer.  Interestingly, the figures show that 29% of people with cancer in this country take up most of the palliative care support.  In fact, 33% of deaths are due to disorders of the circulatory system but we do not take that fact into account when it comes to providing palliative care.  It is right that support is given to people with cancer but palliative care should also be provided to people with other health problems.</p><p>Let me turn to the Department's document entitled Future Health: A Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012-2015 which shows that the HSE is working on a prospective funding model for palliative care.  The review will be chaired by Professor Charles Normand who is the professor of health policy and management at Trinity College.  The review will include the following: an analysis of international approaches to palliative care funding; a description of the best palliative care model provision; a description of current data collection systems for palliative care activity; a description of the current funding for palliative care and will refer, as I mentioned earlier, to palliative care not being confined to people with cancer; and a definition of the current spend on palliative care.</p><p>Let me outline one of the palliative care issues.  This year a budgeted spend of &euro;73 million, in the national service plan, has been provided for palliative care but that sum does not include spending on palliative care in acute hospitals.  Quite a big budget already exists but is it being used effectively?  How can we develop the programme to accommodate all of the needs of the people who are ill?</p><p>The motion deals with a number of different areas.  It is about adopting a joined-up thinking approach to providing support and care to people who are facing death.  All of their medical care is being provided but we must assist their immediate family.  As a practising solicitor I have discovered that people do not take into account the best way to deal with their affairs.  This motion deals with the legal and taxation aspects of death.  Solicitors are asked to visit hospitals at a very late stage in order to look after people's affairs.  People simply do not give serious thought to drafting a will.  As a result, solicitors are finding more and more that issues arise after the person has died which cause even further conflict.  Over the past decade I have dealt with a number of cases where a family who worked very well together before a death changed once the death occurred.  Major problems arose that led to major divisions and people ended up not talking to one another at all.  In any review on such a matter we need to educate the public generally on the need to plan ahead, especially for taxation purposes.  </p><p>I welcome this debate.  It is a start but we need to continue the debate.  All of the professions involved need to adopt a joined-up approach and I refer to the medical, legal and care sectors.  However, the debate is very welcome.</p></speech>

One wonders why we have not considered such a motion in the past.  The fact that it does not show up on the radar as often as we like does not change the fact that we all have a vested interest in the motion.  There is not a person here, or a person who will consider the motion, who will not be at the receiving end some day of whatever policies and procedures are progressed.</p><p>I also compliment the Government on withdrawing its amendment.  I was taken aback when I saw its amendment because I could not see the reason for it.  The withdrawal is a good start.  </p><p>A lot of us just draw on our own memories.  How often have we written to a bereaved person to express our sympathy and made the point that we know he or she will be comforted by many happy memories.  That sentiment is very much a part of the motion.  It is not just about dying or the dead but also the living who remain.  That can indicate straight away the multifaceted nature of the policy that is required.  There will not be any disagreement about the motion because we all strongly agree with it.  I hope that the motion will be treated with a degree of urgency.   </p> <p>I hope we will not just agree on this, because we all support the motion, but also treat it with a degree of urgency.  There are ways of means of doing that.  The role the Joint Committee on Health and Children has already played is an indication of the opportunities we have to progress this motion very quickly.  The motion is comprehensive and well thought out and flags many of the headings to which we have to give consideration.  It would be helpful if the Joint Committee on Health and Children, over a number of hearings, invited various interested parties to appear before it, now that Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell has provided a focus for us and let it play a role.  </p><p>Everybody here will have visited somebody who was dying, whether at home or in a hospital, and each environment is different, but the public environment is a particularly important one.  The smallest thing in a hospital, when visiting someone who is dying, can leave one with a bad or a good feeling or a good memory.  It all comes down to staff and their training.  In general, my experience is that they are pretty good in this regard.  Communications skills are very important in this area.</p><p>Another issue concerns the actual place where the person is left.  I have seen an elderly person dying in a ward where there were other patients.  It was difficult for the patient who was dying, it was difficult for the visitors and it was certainly difficult for the other elderly patients in the ward.  Much of this will require a great deal of commitment.  Obviously we are talking about physical space and so on to make this possible.  There are other issues as well.  A very good friend of mine who died in the past three weeks had attended a meeting with me two weeks previously.  Due to a double brain tumour, the person lasted only 14 days, which was shocking for everybody involved.  It was interesting to note that she sent for her friends to come in and plan her funeral with her.  This is becoming quite common and it shows how the culture is changing.  We are making decisions on what music we want played.  This is important to the relatives and friends as it helps them to grow with the reality that they will lose a relative, a loved one and a friend.  </p><p>So far as the motion is concerned, any one of us could virtually write a document on this, referring to the points we have noticed over a period.  While I was a member of the town council in Cashel, a very distraught lady came to visit me.  She explained the reason she was so upset.  She said she could not sleep at night thinking of Jack's feet, God be good to him, out under the kerbs.  What had happened was that Jack had died and been buried, and subsequently, the council made a decision to lay a path in the cemetery, putting it over his feet.  One wonders if that means much to anyone, but to that lady it meant everything.  She could not sleep at night.  Even though I am smiling, I could understand it for the person involved.  </p><p>One must also remember there are 3,500 to 7,000 people in Ireland who are suffering from mental problems as a result of bereavement.  That is understandable because of the legal issues involved.  I have often reflected on this at a wake.  We help people to get through the immediate grief and we are very good at that.  Those who are bereaved are able to smile and talk.  However, when they return to their own homes after all the sympathisers have gone, the reality, which is huge, hits home.  There is a trauma involved in that also.  We should assist in whatever way we can assist through policies and focusing people on the financial realities.  Even cultural and legal issues have to be considered.  I compliment Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell on starting something I believe is very important.  The withdrawal of the amendment is much more than it might appear on the face of it.  I think we are all beginning to realise that there is an opportunity for us to do the right thing for future generations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-04-16a.245" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1117" speakername="John Gilroy" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014041600028#CC00200"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I assure Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell that this morning when we saw the amendment proposed by the Government, we were equally concerned and, as Labour Party Senators, made our concerns known to the Minister, who agreed to withdraw the amendment.  We were shocked that the amendment would have come before the House in the first place and we are happy to support the motion.</p><p>Last year the Joint Committee on Health and Children conducted public consultations in the area of palliative care, end-of-life care and bereavement.  The contributions to the committee find good expression in the motion before the House.  That is the reason we welcome it.  I commend Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell on tabling the motion.  It is part of a political process and it is good practice, if a motion is introduced in one House of the Oireachtas, that we follow it up here later.</p><p>Last month I presented a report to the Joint Committee on Health and Children on suicide prevention which I hope we will be able to progress here. The Minister is aware of and is supportive of it and will surely come in to discuss it with us.  During the public hearings we heard from a range of expert witnesses, including the Institute of Community Health Nursing.   Public health nurses have a key role to play in this area because, in conjunction with general practitioners, they are probably the first ones who come upon the need for palliative care.  That is how it should be.  There is a huge role for public health nurses, which needs to be expanded.  We need to support them in the delivery of care as close as possible to home in the community.  The care needs to be structured and holistic, and public health nurses are to the forefront in this area.   </p><p>Nursing Homes Ireland also made a thoughtful contribution, pointing to the fact that 23,000 people receive residential care in our nursing home services.  Some 75% of the care is provided by the private sector, which has a role to play also.  I draw attention to several publications in this area and one in particular which was written in conjunction with the Irish Hospice Association, End-of-Life Care for Older People in Acute and Long-Stay Care Settings in Ireland.  It is an excellent document which provides a platform on which to build our strategies, and should be used as one pillar of a comprehensive and holistic approach that is needed in this area.  Who better to listen to than the experts delivering the services?  That points to the comprehensive nature of Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell's motion and the reason we should support it.  The motion is non-controversial and eminently sensible in calling for a comprehensive and strategic view of how we might deliver services.  There is no question that the services are very good, but they could be better.  A strategic view of services is exactly what is needed.  I am aware that the Minister is keen that this is the way it should be. </p><p>To speak about the importance of delivering palliative care and end-of-life care as close as possible to the person's home is not to ignore the increasingly complex nature of some of the palliative care interventions required.  Unfortunately, their complexity means it will not be possible for some people to receive palliative care treatment in the location of their choice - that is, at home or in a nursing home - as it may require complicated intervention at acute level.</p> <p>Where it is possible to ensure that palliative treatment is provided in the home, we should do everything possible to support that.</p><p>Declan Walsh, a professor of palliative care medicine, made a contribution to the committee also and called for a comprehensive, integrated, palliative medical programme.  When professors of palliative care call for this, they are obviously saying we do not have it currently.  We need - and the Minister is looking at this - to provide a service that is closely linked with clinical, operational, financial and administrative services.</p><p>I had reason in the past couple of weeks to have some contact with accident and emergency services in this country, one in Navan and the second contact with Cork University Hospital, in regard to the admission, on an acute basis, of two very unwell elderly people.  The service provided in these accident and emergency services was far from optimum and I was very discouraged by the level of treatment received by both of these people.  Whether this was an unfortunate or isolated instance or symptomatic of something worse in our accident and emergency services, it needs further examination.</p><p>I abhor hearing the media talk about elderly people as &quot;bed blockers&quot;.  I have heard the Minister say many times here that what is needed in this country as much as resources and staffing is a change in the culture of how we deliver services.  I know he is strong on that and look forward to working closely with him in that area.  I have a lot more to say, but do not have the time to say it now .</p></speech>

Senator O'Donnell accompanied me, as a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, to the committee hearings and we both participated actively in them.  I learned a lot by having her there.  In developing this overarching strategy, I suggest the Minister of State needs to look no further than Senator O'Donnell to lead the work in this area.</p><p>As Senator O'Donnell said, we die at all times, at all ages and in many different ways.  When we talk about end of life, we often forget the word &quot;care&quot;.  People only hear the words &quot;end of life&quot; and think of finality and the last moment or second.  However, this motion suggests for me that end-of-life care refers to those days, months, weeks and years leading to death.  Who knows when death will arrive?  None of us has a time stamp that tells us exactly when the moment of death will come.  Therefore, we are talking about care over that time.</p><p>Think of the language we use about death.  We start with children by saying things like &quot;Granny went to sleep&quot;.  It is no surprise then when the child says, &quot;Mammy, I do not want to go to sleep; I am afraid I will not wake up.&quot;  This is like telling a child whose parent has been imprisoned that the parent has gone off to work, leading the child to have a fear and resentment against work.  We need to be careful about the language we use when talking about death, from talking to children all the way through the care system.  We often use medical language in a way that does not allow the individuals involved, their families and supporters to use other meaningful language.  This does not allow them express their fears and admit they do not know the answers.  Often there is no right answer, no pathway or set of steps to follow or to explain what exactly will happen.</p><p>Often when we speak about end-of-life care, we are talking about care for older people, but we must be equally cognisant of the work of organisations like the Jack and Jill foundation and the LauraLynn Children's Hospice.  I would like to mention in particular the Irish Hospice Foundation and the eight children's outreach nurses it is providing.  I thank the foundation for providing these nurses.  I am very proud to chair an organisation, Early Childhood Ireland, which has raised funds through its pyjama days for these nurses.  I believe that we have raised &euro;1 million over four years for this outreach service.</p><p>I want to speak personally on this issue.  I know that the story the Minister of State often hears in the Department is the negative story, but I have had a very positive experience and I want to name the Clonskeagh community nursing home in this regard.  I believe the word &quot;community&quot; is very important in regard to this issue.  During the committee hearings, one of the witnesses spoke about the triangle of care - the staff, the patient and the relative and went on to say that staff in this area need three Cs.  They need to be confident, competent and comfortable.  I came up with my own three Cs when talking of the individuals concerned, because we often remove these three Cs, consent, choice and control from the individual.  </p><p>The three Cs for an individual describe what we are talking about here.  We are talking about consent, choice and control and when control is removed from the person.  My experience in Clonskeagh has been that one can pop in at any time, because it is a home.  My dad is at &quot;home&quot; in Clonskeagh.  People there go to bed at all different times of the day and night.  There is no set bed time.  When my dad was in another hospital, I registered him to vote in the children's referendum because I wanted to be sure he got to vote on that issue.  He was the only resident in that hospital to vote at that time.   However, in Clonskeagh community nursing home, everyone is registered to vote, because it is their home.  We often seem to push people into a nursing home and say that is it and confine them to that, but that should not be the case.  In Clonskeagh nursing home, they celebrate the good days, have parties and invite singers in to sing.  It is the kind of atmosphere we would all want.  It is about consent and control.  Staff never force anybody to do something or to take part in something.  The individual has control over what he or she wants to do.</p><p>We heard again and again in committee hearings about staff, which includes cleaning, catering, nursing and care staff.  We are not just talking about one group.  The idea that only one person talks about death or end of life is wrong.  Should we have to wait until that one person is on duty before a family member or individual can ask a question?  We all face the cliff edge, but do not know how far it is to get to it.  We need to look at how we deal with this.</p><p>Senator Burke mentioned accidents and emergencies.  I believe there is too much reliance on a medical approach in this regard.  We do not need to take the medical approach all the time when dealing with end-of-life care, because this is not always the answer.  That is not part of the choice and control for the individual concerned.  The person does not need to be in an accident and emergency unit.  Instead, people need care and support at that difficult time.</p><p>Some particular issues were raised during our committee hearings and I have raised these issues at quarterly meetings with the Minister.  These particular issues concern advanced care directives.  I believe we wait far too late to take these on board.  We learned at our hearings that in Belgium when one buys a house, one also makes a will and makes out an advanced care directive.  This is seen as a positive move, not a negative one.  We need nurses who can prescribe medication and a provision allowing ambulance services to pronounce death.  There is too much use of resuscitation by ambulance staff to ensure they get people to the hospital where they can be pronounced dead.  Rather than this, if somebody has died at home, we should allow the ambulance staff pronounce the death in the home.  </p><p>We need this overarching strategy.  I look forward to the report being produced by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children.  I thank my colleague, Senator O'Donnell, who is a fount of knowledge in this area.  Personally and professionally she has been a great resource for me.  I believe she would play a strong role in developing the strategy.</p></speech>

The discourse on older people and care of our elderly citizens is one of the most important discourses we can have, as is the management of our approach to the elderly, death, dying and bereavement, not only within our health services, but in society in general.  This motion covers many of these areas and matters, not only for patients in the health system but for the whole system.  Senator O'Donnell has encompassed many of the relevant areas in what one might say is a broad motion.</p> <p>It has to be because people do not change because they are elderly or late in life.</p><p>Having a truly strategic approach to care of the elderly, not only those facing end of life, makes political and economic sense because death is something everybody will experience.  We all have a vested interest in the subject.  Some 27,000 people die in Ireland each year and up to 290,000 are newly bereaved.  In anticipating and planning for the needs of the elderly, over-medicalisation is usually what we have to deal with in Ireland.  When there was consultation in the Seanad, Nursing Homes Ireland had a good input and spoke about medicalisation.  It has many facets, for example, preventing inappropriate emergency admissions, discharge from expensive care settings such as acute hospitals and providing care closer to home in line with the patient's preferences.  It is easy to have over-medicalisation and the patient's preference sometimes do not come into it.</p><p>In 2011, there were 523,800 people or 11% of the population over the age of 65 years.  By 2041, this percentage will have risen to 22%.  It is vital, therefore, that we look at this issue in an all-encompassing manner.  On my way here this morning I listened to a radio interview with a 98 year old woman who gave classes in knitting.  Given the benefits the elderly bring to society and will bring in the future, we do not use them.  Everybody has so much to offer, which is another facet at which we should be looking.</p><p>I note the contribution made by the voluntary and community sector.  When representatives of Nursing Homes Ireland were here, they spoke about nurse training and how nurses over-medicalised in treating the elderly.  As we all know, gerontology is distinct from geriatrics, the most universally acknowledged branch of medicine that deals with the diagnosis and treatment of disease, but I took to heart Nursing Homes Ireland's statement that nurses should receive more training in the field of gerontology and what the people wanted.  In its submission it stated nurse training was lacking in assessment and care planning.  This was through no fault of the nurses but the training provided.  Nurses are ill-equipped to assess a person's psycho-social needs and include his or her personal preferences in care planning.  Personal preferences are so important as one size does not fit all, be it in what the person wants in making a will, giving power of attorney to someone while he or she still can, all of the financial and legal matters that have to be dealt with and everything else that worries an older person.  In that regard, he or she should have the facility to get advice on what he or she should be doing.</p><p>The range of issues which impact on bereavement is diverse, ranging from palliative care, counselling, social welfare payments following death to taxation on inheritance, the legal rules around capacity, public awareness and bereavement training.  I acknowledge that 8,751 episodes of bereavement support were provided by the Department's bereavement support services in 2013.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is doing a lot in the Department to acknowledge the person-centred approach recommended, which is obvious in the various changes made in what she termed &quot;other supports&quot; provided and the linkages in the provision of advice on social protection and support from organisations such as the citizens information centres.  I mentioned the voluntary sector, but there is also the Irish Hospice Foundation and the work the Minister of State is doing with it.</p></speech>

I found it extraordinarily informative and moving.  It is one everybody looking at changing policy on end-of-life care should read.  He wrote:<blockquote>It's not a frequent topic of discussion, but doctors die, too.  And they don't die like the rest of us.  What's unusual about them is not how much treatment they get compared to most Americans, but how little.  For all the time they spend fending off the deaths of others, they tend to be fairly serene when faced with death themselves.  They know exactly what is going to happen, they know the choices, and they generally have access to any sort of medical care they could want.  But they go gently.<br />Of course, doctors don't want to die; they want to live.  But they know enough about modern medicine to know its limits.  And they know enough about death to know what all people fear most: dying in pain, and dying alone.  They've talked about this with their families.  They want to be sure, when the time comes, that no heroic measures will happen - that they will never experience, during their last moments on earth, someone breaking their ribs in an attempt to resuscitate them with CPR [cardio pulmonary resuscitation] (that's what happens if CPR is done right).<br />Almost all medical professionals have seen what we call &quot;futile care&quot; being performed on people.  That's when doctors bring the cutting edge of technology to bear on a grievously ill person near the end of life.  The patient will get cut open, perforated with tubes, hooked up to machines, and assaulted with drugs.  All of this occurs in the Intensive Care Unit at a cost of tens of thousands of dollars a day.  What it buys is misery we would not inflict on a terrorist.  I cannot count the number of times fellow physicians have told me, in words that vary only slightly, &quot;Promise me if you find me like this that you'll kill me.&quot;  They mean it. Some medical personnel wear medallions stamped &quot;NO CODE&quot; to tell physicians not to perform CPR on them.  I have even seen it as a tattoo.<br />To administer medical care that makes people suffer is anguishing.  Physicians are trained to gather information without revealing any of their own feelings, but in private, among fellow doctors, they'll vent. &quot;How can anyone do that to their family members?&quot; they'll ask.  I suspect it's one reason physicians have higher rates of ... depression than professionals in most other fields.</blockquote>We have a colossal job to enable rational humane end-of-life care to become the culture, not only among the caring professions, medicine and nursing, but also in society at large.  This is an appropriate co-operative collegial gathering and I do not mean to pick holes in the arguments of others because everybody is singing from the same hymn sheet, but one should be a little careful in talking about over-medicalising because throughout history and contemporary current affairs there are examples of medically unassisted dying processes which can be miserable, uncomfortable and painful and characterised by great anguish.  In general, what we want is not to overly and inappropriately medicalise death, but the presence of skilled health professionals, doctors and nurses, is something for which I myself would wish when I am at the end of my life.<br />There are unbelievable imperatives to get this right such as the inevitability of death.  This is a health service which we will have to provide for every person.  It is uniquely a health service in which we are guaranteed not to receive consumer feedback.  We must ensure we do it right on behalf of the people who cannot tell us if we are doing it wrong.  For all of these reasons, we need to undertake a job of education in medical schools about futile care, which to be honest is happening.  We also need to undertake a significant job of education with society at large that it is not humane to insist on doctors doing that final test or extra investigation, or putting the patient through that treatment; that if somebody puts his or her hand on a relative's shoulder and says their loved one should not go to the intensive care unit, it is not because he or she is trying to save money for the health service but because it is bad medicine, not something one would want to have done under the circumstances.<br />In attempting to get this right and prevent over-medicalisation, there is something else we really must do.  We have to prevent the over-legalisation of medical care because the tendency to practise defensive medicine does not end when a person's prognosis is for short survival.  At that time, more than ever, doctors can be nervous that in the heightened emotive environment of end-of-life care, if they do something which the family does not either necessarily agree with or fully support, they may face consequences.  This can sometimes be a powerful motivation for doctors to do what they would not want to be done to themselves.<br />I commend the motion, the process involved and the hearings of the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  This is a critically important part of the provision of health care.</p> <p>I will make one practical observation.  Not only is it right from a humane and social point of view to do this medically, it also makes sense in terms of health service resources.  I am not saying we should economise in caring for the dying but doing it wrong is not only wrong but also more expensive.  I am not saying people do not deserve to have these resources provided when their prognosis is that their life expectancy is short; they do not lose their rights when their life expectancy is short, but we are putting them through things that are bad for them.</p></speech>

My family and I have experienced death under differing circumstances.  My father died suddenly one morning at the age of 55 years; my mother died from cancer a number of years ago; my father-in-law took his own life at the age of 55 years and my husband's nephew took his own life last summer, at the age of 17 years.  I think I know what it is like to experience death under a range of circumstances.  Speaking from this experience, I am familiar with the work done by palliative care nurses, or daffodil nurses as we also call them.  The care, affection and medical assistance they gave to my family member was second to none.  The counselling, consoling and help they offered to us in coming to terms with the impending death of our loved were far and above what was expected of them and, I believe, beyond the call of duty.  The care provided by the palliative care team at Kerry General Hospital was also outstanding.  The unit is absolutely amazing.  We are lucky to have such a facility and every county should have similar teams.  As the saying goes, they are &ldquo;bad to want, but good to have&rdquo; when needed.  Kerry General Hospital is in the process of providing palliative care beds for patients who need in-care treatment.</p><p>Other speakers have discussed the medical and clinical aspects of end-of-life care, but I want to change course somewhat because bereavement goes far beyond the death of a person.  While I appreciate that a number of organisations such as Console offer one-to-one counselling to the bereaved, the fact is that when people are bereaved, they are in distress because of the loss of their loved ones.  There is a huge void in their lives and often they do not know where to turn.  It is imperative at this time that they get the help that they need.  From my work with bereaved people, I recognise how lost and unsure they can be about what they need to do and how they can claim their entitlements.  For example, not many people know that they are now required to register a death.  Whereas hospitals or doctors formerly registered deaths, the onus is now on the family concerned.  As people often do not realise that when they register the death, they must show photographic proof of identity, they can be required to make a return visit.  They may also be unaware of the fact that a specific death certificate for social welfare purposes only costs &euro;1, as opposed to the &euro;20 which they end up paying because they did not know about it.  Many people, particularly men, are not aware of their entitlement to survivor's pension.  They may believe they cannot claim both allowances because they have private pension provision.  People who do not qualify for the State pension because they worked in the public sector may not realise they can receive a widow's or widower's pension.  I have also encountered a number of bereaved young parents who did not know about the widowed parent's grant or that a funeral grant was payable if the death was the result of an accident at work.  These are all important issues of which a bereaved person needs to be aware.  A simple way of making sure people are aware of their entitlements is to distribute booklets through undertakers that outline in clear detail what needs to be done.  These booklets could then be supplied to bereaved families.</p><p>The legal aspects of bereavement can also cause confusion and distress.  The absence of a will can complicate the disposal of capital and property because two thirds of the legacy will go to the spouse, while the remaining one third is divided equally among the children.  It can be very expensive to resolve this complication.</p><p>Senator Marie-Louise O&rsquo;Donnell's motion does not make an unreasonable demand.  It reflects what every organisation stated to the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  I am delighted, therefore, that the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, agreed to withdraw the counter motion which would have been impossible for me and my Labour Party colleagues to support.  I commend Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell and her colleagues for the motion which I am delighted to support.</p></speech>

However, death is traumatic, stressful and costly.  Other speakers focused on elderly people, but the subject of end-of-life care issues is not confined to people of a particular age.  Having buried a friend, I realise it is not something for which we can ever be prepared.  In respect of the educational and cultural aspects of bereavement, I used to laugh at my father and called him a coffin chaser when he listened to the death notices, but when it came to my own experience, I was not ready to organise flowers and put on black clothes to attend a funeral service.  Growing up, one experiences one's granny or grandad passing away.  It is in our mind that death affects the older generation, but we also need to consider that end-of-life and bereavement can happen at any age.  I refer to Donal Walsh and the example he showed in concentrating on the importance of life.<br />I do not know if other Senators have read the book, <i>Tuesdays with Morrie</i>, by Mitch Albom which contains lessons on how to live.  I was reminded of that book when I read the motion.  Even though the protagonist in the book, Professor Morrie Schwartz, was prepared for death and imparting lessons to the author, Mr. Albom, he was nonetheless fearful as his condition deteriorated towards the end.  For someone who was previously independent, losing the ability to dance had a particular impact on him.<br />Other speakers referred to the legal and financial aspects of bereavement.  I have two brothers and always tease my parents about what they will be leaving us in their will.  This is an issue which people often neglect.  I get on very well with my brothers, but that is not to say if, God forbid, something were to happen to my parents, we could not fall out with each other.  People need to be aware of this issue.<br />The fact that we have an ageing population gives rise to challenges.  Combined with high levels of emigration in recent times, there could be profound implications for the way in which the parents of today enter their final days.  There is a danger that some of them will be left alone and devoid of the support of their extended family and bedside care provided by sons and daughters.</p> <p>It is very difficult, if one's loved one is in another country, to deal with his or her loss or illness.  I am very happy to support this motion, and I welcome the fact that the amendment has been withdrawn.</p><p>The Irish Hospice Foundation published a report last year entitled Access to Specialist Palliative Care Services and Place of Death in Ireland - What the Data Tells Us.  It examines the empirical aspects of this shortage of palliative care.  One of the findings was that where one lives impacts on how one spends one's final days.  There is regional inequity in resource allocation.  The report estimates that 2,470 people are denied admission to hospice beds in Ireland each year.  While this motion considers aspects apart from the health issues, there is much to be said for the hospice approach to death and dying.  Senator van Turnhout mentioned the home approach.  I am aware of hospices where people have their own things around them so that they are not alienated and can have comfort in their last months or days.  We need support for families in bereavement.  As Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; said, in the initial stages of grief we are very good at helping one another, but weeks and months down the line, when people stop making the tea or calling in, we have to deal with the grief.  We need to consider that.</p><p>I thank Senator O'Donnell for introducing this motion forward.  We need to keep it on the agenda, because death happens and it affects everyone.  I welcome the Minister of State's comments.</p></speech>

I am naturally going to focus on the sad story of end-of-life care for young children because I represent the Jack and Jill Foundation, which was set up in 1997 to provide specialist care to children with life-limiting conditions.  It is a nationwide service serving the Twenty-six Counties.  We have a very simple model with eleven wonderful specialist paediatric liaison nurses who come to the maternity unit or the home of the family with the sick child.  They help source nurses in the area to get to know and liaise with the family, to care for the child, and to help the parents and the other children cope with the situation at home.</p><p>Previous speakers have said that 80% of adults want to die at home, but sadly, 76% do not die at home.  Parents have the exact same wish for their children.  In most cases they want their children to die at home, although in some cases parents do not feel they can cope with that.  I am very proud of the wonderful mummy who built the LauraLynn Hospice in South Dublin.  There is also the Irish Hospice Foundation.  I hope that in the spirit of good governance these three charities will begin to collaborate.  They each have different strengths and different ways of working.  We could gather our collective knowledge and experiences and develop good strategy and practice.  This is an area of increasing learning and continual striving for excellence.  Those parents need commitment, love, dignity and control to create the relationship within the family between the baby or the little girl or boy and the other siblings, to make it as happy and special a time as it can possibly be.</p><p>The Jack and Jill Foundation does not have a waiting list.  Nursing care can be provided within 24 hours.  We do not care if it is Saturday night or Sunday morning.  We are a small organisation but we stretch all over the country.  We create a relationship with the family, staying with it for a year or more after the child or baby dies.  We run bereavement counselling once a year.  We try to bring together all the parents who have lost children because, while we might think we are experts in counselling them, they counsel each other just by sharing.</p><p>We have raised over &euro;50 million, of which the Minister of State has very kindly given us just under &euro;5 million.  We need a lot more money.  We need to ring-fence money so that people with children who are going to die can have 24-hour nursing care in their homes.  We are funding four Jack and Jill liaison nurses to undertake a master's level qualification in children and young people's palliative and complex care at Coventry University.  All of the nurses need that education.  We have to bring ourselves to the next level.</p><p>It may sound strange to bring up medical cards, but we must roll out the red carpet for these children, not red tape.  Our nurses spend a lot of time on the phone with the HSE and the public servants fighting on behalf of these children and their parents, trying to get a medical card for someone who is checking a child out of hospital, who might have a month or six months to live.  I leave that thought with the Minister of State.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-04-16a.256" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1145" speakername="Feargal Quinn" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014041600032#GG00300"><p>The Minister of State is very welcome and the step she has taken in withdrawing the amendment is also welcome, because it means this debate is welcomed by the Government.  I know something of the Think Ahead project, which is part of the Irish Hospice Foundation's forum on end of life in Ireland.  It is a fantastic initiative which aims at awareness-raising, planning and promoting public debate on issues related to death, dying and bereavement.  It is a difficult subject to raise, but if people do not have an open conversation about it, that can bring many problems for families.  I was present at the death of my sister-in-law in Our Lady's Hospice.  It was a very pleasantly well-planned departure.  Her children were with her.  For years we had been afraid to talk about death.  That was the only occasion on which I came across the work of the hospice and it was what one could call a happy death.</p><p>Prior to the 20th century, in Western culture, being without preparation for even a sudden death was considered a huge tragedy.  It is amazing to discover that people have gradually moved away from talking about death, because it became a taboo subject.  The simple fact, however, is that many studies have shown that there is a much greater satisfaction for patients' families at the end of life when time is devoted to end-of-life discussion.</p><p>At present, conversations about end-of-life wishes happen all too often for the first time at the patient's bedside, prompted by daunting questions such as, &quot;If your father's heart stops, do you want us to start it again?&quot;  What if one's children had to answer that question?  This is the last question someone wants to take responsibility for, particularly for someone they love.  Family members, including one's children, may disagree, decisions can be delayed and regrets over the things that should have been said and done surface.</p><p>It is also, obviously, much better for the patient when planning takes place.  Patients at the end of life who are unable to communicate and who have not documented their treatment preferences through an advance directive are vulnerable to receiving unwanted treatment.  This vulnerability is heightened for patients without family or recorded preferences.  To take one example, according to the Irish Hospice Foundation, when end-of-life care preferences were recorded in nursing and medical notes, dementia patients were less likely to be transferred to acute care or have unnecessary invasive procedures.</p> <p>Mr. Des O'Neill, a consultant in geriatrics and stroke medicine, pointed out that "contrary to popular opinion, the greatest danger at the end of life is not that you will be over-treated, but that you will be under-treated, in a system that has strains of ageism and prejudice against disability, in particular dementia."</p><p>Studies of surrogate decision makers such as family or doctors have found that surrogates and patients often do not agree about the use of life-sustaining measures for patients.  One medical study from the United States which reported discussions between patients and family care givers about treatment preferences found that in 60% of cases there was not agreement between patient and care giver about life-sustaining measures desired for the patient who is near death.  That is a scary thing to consider.  Therefore, on a policy level, we should do much more to ensure that younger people also plan for the future.  It was interesting to hear the points made.  I appreciate the tabling of the motion.  It is helpful, as it gets us all thinking about the issue.  Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell has given us the opportunity to think about things we would not necessarily have thought of otherwise.  There is a significant chance if something does happen to a person that one might not get the treatment one wants.</p><p>I wish also to draw attention to the need for more public awareness about a proper document on end of life.  A form devised by Think Ahead allows people to record the location of key legal and financial documents.  That might be the wrong thing to think of at this stage but it is very important.  I would love to see a situation in which such a form will be as normal as a doctor giving a routine check-up.  In terms of financial issues, unfortunately, a lot of people are still not making wills to ensure their affairs will be taken care of according to their wishes.  A will is also helpful in avoiding disputes.  The fact is that the less family members, especially children, have to deal with financial issues, the more easily they will be able to put their lives back together.  We have heard something in that regard in the course of the debate.  The grieving process will be less difficult if the family's or the children's financial future is clear and secure.</p><p>I am very glad this subject is also opening up the conversation about organ donation.  This is a subject that has been close to my heart.  I brought legislation before the Seanad some years ago on presumed consent.  The more people who record their preference for donating organs, the more lives can be saved.  I am concerned that the Bill never became law.  It should be enacted.  I hope the Government will return to it.</p><p>We have an obvious problem in that many people cannot afford adequate end-of-life care, yet they have capital locked up, for example, in their house.  The Government must look at ways to allow the elderly to free up more of the capital locked into their homes, thereby better providing for themselves.  The UK-based charity the Joseph Rowntree Foundation has piloted a scheme in the United Kingdom with three local authorities in which elderly people can sell a stake in their home which buyers would reclaim after their death to pay for modifications such as a walk-in shower that would help them remain in their homes rather than go into a nursing home.  The idea is to free some of the money locked up in the property.  Perhaps we could take similar steps in this country.  I am aware of several older people who on paper are not badly off because they own their own house, but they want to stay in the house and not sell it.  However, they need to free up some cash to survive more comfortably on a day-to-day basis.  I would love to see us look at some of the best international practice in this area.  There is much potential in this regard when considering end-of-life care.</p><p>Perhaps the Minister of State could indicate where we stand in terms of the provision of specialist training in end-of-life care for family doctors.  Are there any plans to introduce that?</p></speech>

I pay tribute to Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell in particular for bringing this extremely important motion to the House.  I am also delighted that the amendment has been withdrawn.  This is an extremely important motion and something with which we are all in agreement.  The motion is too important for dissent.  The issue is one that every single Member will have to face.</p><p>I welcome Angela Edgehill from the Irish Hospice Foundation and other visitors who are present.  I met Angela last year through work with Think Ahead.  I have worked closely with her on some areas and got to know a lot about the Think Ahead project and the excellent work it does.  I was concerned last year when I read in a briefing document provided by Think Ahead that in 16 counties in Ireland there is no access to hospice beds.  Could the Minister of State indicate whether the situation has improved this year?  The number of patients denied admission to hospice beds last year was 2,470.  Has the situation improved and are we moving in the right direction?</p><p>The briefing document provided by Think Ahead is excellent.  The proposal is to introduce an initiative to which everyone in the country has access.  That is the way to go.  I had some brochures in my office last year which I offered to people having raised the subject with them.  We are all aware that it is something that can happen.  Some of us might be prepared for it but others, as we in this House know only too well, can be struck down and our lives can change in a matter of minutes.  It is very important that those who care for us and will be left behind know our wishes and that we make whatever preparation we can.  I have discussed the matter with others and I have attended briefing sessions.  I never met one person who said the subject was too morbid and they did not want to talk about it.  The document provides the key information on what we can do in terms of care and treatment.  It also goes into care preferences and how people want to be cared for.  Even in our own families some say they want to be cared for in hospital while others want to be taken home.  It is important to make known our cultural and religious preferences.  Important information is provided on legal and financial provision.  It is also important to think about what we want when we die in terms of services and readings.  When I discussed it first with Angela I questioned whether people would want to talk about such matters, but it is something that must be discussed.  Organ and body donation and post mortem arrangements are also worthy of consideration.</p><p>An important subject is where to find important documents.  I am probably the world's worst for knowing where policies are.  I am great at having them but if someone were to ask me where they are I would not know.  Such things could be very important when someone dies if he or she only has a single current account rather than a joint account, as can very often be the case in houses where the main breadwinner passes away and the other person does not know where to access all the documents.  I have an example of a form which simply goes through every single aspect and allows one to indicate one's wishes.  It is a very sad topic, but I wish to introduce a lighter note.  When I brought the document home after I had read through it I said to my children that I was going to fill in the form and that we would look at it together.  To this day, it has become one of the biggest laughing points.  Every time I do something that annoys the children, they say &quot;That's it - we are going to do this or that.&quot;</p> <p>When I was a music teacher, I often played music at funerals, so I know how important it can be for the family and friends of the deceased.  It is important we pick the appropriate hymns and readings to show our respect for the deceased.  I do not mean any disrespect but when I raised with my kids what music I would have played at my funeral, one of them suggested at the very end of the mass we would have &ldquo;Ding-Dong! The Witch is Dead&rdquo;.  While this is a light-hearted touch, it is important that people discuss this subject.</p></speech>

I am relieved the Government, through the influence of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, decided to withdraw the amendment to the motion.  I do not know how we would have faced into a division over the waking of the dead and comforting the bereaved.  There is no more compassionate or kind person in politics than Deputy Kathleen Lynch.</p><p>I am surprised, however, it has taken three years for this topic to get to the floor of the House.  Politicians of all persuasions have had a strange relationship with funerals and bereavements down the years.  Some are noted for never missing a funeral while I have been chided and chastised repeatedly by colleagues for not going to funerals.  However, I refuse to go to someone&rsquo;s funeral if I did not know the person.  I will stick with that as it is hard enough to attend the funerals of those I knew.</p><p>When I was a young person, I was always bewildered as to why people showed up in large numbers to shake hands with families at funerals.  As we grow older and experience bereavement, we realise how important and comforting this is for bereaved families.  It should not be taken lightly as it is a well-worn and age-old ritual that should be respected.  From a distance it appears a simple process but it is important for families experiencing bereavement, getting them through that difficult time of hardship and loss.  It helps them hear other people commenting on their loved one and the relationship they had with them, a point we sometimes overlook.</p><p>Coming from a family of seven, I am conscious of the support one has during bereavement with a larger family.  These days, family units are smaller with only one or two children in a family.  Many people start families later in life and many parents and children do not have the support or the wise counsel of grandparents and extended families.  Emigration is another issue affecting families these days.  Portlaoise parish provides an Internet video link for funerals that can be seen anywhere in the world for extended family members who cannot make it home.  I know of relatives of one family who were able to watch a funeral in Portlaoise parish church in Australia.  Who would have thought we would have to resort to this?  We have the technology which will help people to cope with a loss, which could be particularly heightened as they have emigrated.</p><p>Young people these days struggle to deal with new stresses and burdens imposed on them.  If we are going to review the junior certificate, coping skills of all kinds should be embedded in the new curriculum.  By the time we give young people bereavement counselling, it can be too late because they might be in the throes of the trauma.  This motion calls for advance preparation for bereavement.  What would be wrong with introducing coping skills for bereavement into the curriculum?</p><p>Other members raised the issue of preparing a will.  Every year, there is a day devoted to making people aware of the importance of a will.  It is a matter younger people believe does not affect them.  Making a will properly, no matter one&rsquo;s age, reduces stress on families who may have to deal with a bereaved family member leaving no will.</p><p>It has been brought to my attention over the past several months that across the midlands, post mortems are not being carried out in cases of sudden deaths during weekends.  I have encountered cases of young people, unfortunately, killed in a road accident or through suicide on a Thursday evening or a Friday morning but no post mortem will be conducted until after the weekend.  This leaves families without closure.  While they need time to mourn, the trauma, anxiety and hurt is unnecessarily prolonged by this harsh cutback in health services.  Will an on-call service be made available across several hospitals so a grieving family does not have to wait until Monday for a post mortem to be carried out and the funeral, in turn, deferred to later in the week?  Death does not keep office hours.  Accordingly, we should have post mortem facilities available in our hospitals at weekends, particularly in cases of sudden death.  It is unfair to put this additional burden on the bereaved.</p></speech>

I welcome those in the Visitors Gallery who are connected with the Irish Hospice Foundation and the delivery of palliative care.  Many Members will have heard me say before that palliative care is not necessarily immediate end-of-life care.</p> <p>We all have our stories and they are not always about older people, as Senator Mary Ann O'Brien said, which I understand perfectly.  It is not always about the very young either but crosses the whole of life.</p><p>I met a man by the name of John Murphy through looking for housing and we became very good friends.  He dipped in and out of the palliative care service for ten years as he had difficulties with pain management or surgery.  It gave me a different insight into what palliative care was as opposed to what we thought it was, for the last month or week of life.  He eventually died on the morning of St. Stephen's Day at Marymount hospice, Cork.  My sister-in-law and I had spent Christmas with him.  While I am not certain any of us would ever see leaving this world as a pleasant event, in John's case it was very peaceful and dignified.  That is very important to every one of us and it is especially important to those who sit and wait that that dignity and respect be maintained.  We are not discussing somebody just transitioning but someone whom we loved, understood and with whom we had a relationship leaving this world.  It is very important to say it is not just about that short time at the end.</p><p>My father-in-law died recently in an acute hospital.  He was cared for by a palliative care consultant.  While he did not receive the type of intensive attention one would get in a hospice, very clear advice was available and pain and discomfort were alleviated.  While we are not making as much progress as we would like, we are making some and training people.  Senator Feargal Quinn's question is apt.  If we are to have advance care directives and capacity legislation which we will shortly, more people will opt to end their days at home.  What part will GPs play in that regard?  Because they are the ones who know us best and who have probably treated us all our lives, they are a key and essential element.</p><p>I thank each of the contributors.  Each person has a different story, which is important.  As Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell said, one size does not fit all because each story is different, with different family and community reactions.  I thank Senators for raising the issue.</p><p>Bereavement is a part of life which, unfortunately, affects each and every one of us and something to which we can all relate.  Few other events in life can leave a person as bruised, confused and, often, angry and few test our personal resources more thoroughly than the pain of losing someone close to us.  Where a child is lost or a person is taken through suicide, the pain for those left behind defies description.  Any instance where a person's death is sudden or unexpected, for example, in road accidents, as Senator John Whelan said, or through any other accidental cause, will leave families and friends in shock, disorientated and bewildered.  We can all relate to this.  The bereaved often do not know where to turn.  Senator Marie Moloney made a recommendation on undertakers and the type of information they hold because they are the people to whom we go, no matter how we choose to deal with our loved ones.  I commend the Senator for drawing attention to these issues by proposing the motion.  I will forward her suggestion to the division to see where it can go.  The motion correctly highlights the range of issues bereaved people face every day.  Not only must they come to terms with intensely personal grief and loss and the immediate practicalities of funeral arrangements, but they often face legal issues, financial worries and a plethora of other issues as they try to reconstruct their lives after a death.</p><p>Bereavement takes many forms and occurs in an almost infinite variety of circumstances.  Levels of interaction with officials and other agencies will vary very widely, as will the nature of these interactions.  The mix of supports provided will vary dramatically from setting to setting and from person to person and any given intervention may be entirely unrelated to others.  This is to be expected, given the number of people and agencies involved and the range of issues arising.  It is critical that all agencies constantly review what they do to support the bereaved and other groups who are vulnerable or find themselves under pressure and constantly strive to improve and strengthen what is provided.  This will require co-ordination across measures in some cases and individual responses to be tailored in others.</p><p>While palliative care is primarily directed at the person who is dying, it is also perhaps the greatest support we can provide for those close to the dying person, as what they want more than anything else is for their loved one not to suffer.  Many people in Ireland have as good a death as it is possible to have.  The hospice movement is well developed compared to elsewhere.  There is general acceptance of the philosophy of the hospice movement, which is to enable people to live as full a life as possible right to the end, with dying seen as part of a continuum and a process rather than an event at a single point in time.  As well as caring for the person who is approaching the end of life, palliative care also provides support for families and this care continues after their loved one has died.</p><p>It is the intention of the Government that all dying people will be provided with the type of palliative care services that they need, regardless of what diagnoses they have, how old they are or whether they die in a hospice, an acute hospital or at home.  I had a very fruitful meeting with the Irish Hospice Foundation which operates on a 32 county basis.  I asked the question about older people in care homes being moved to acute hospitals.  I was told there was a new protocol whereby most people in care homes, if possible, were allowed to die in that setting, which they now call home.  That is another progressive and welcome step.</p><p>The HSE is working with the Irish Hospice Foundation on the hospice friendly hospital programme to ensure the principles of hospice care are incorporated into the care provided in acute hospitals and residential homes.  Most palliative care consultants work across acute and hospice settings and also with community home care teams; therefore, there is already much ongoing collaboration to ensure patients and their families receive a seamless service.  It is equally important, as Senator Mary Ann O'Brien said, that the three substantial charities operating in this area co-operate.  Their learning and experiences are different and sharing expertise within the three will be beneficial.  There is very good co-operation and engagement between the HSE and voluntary organisations, for example, with voluntary hospice organisations in Waterford, Kerry, Wicklow, Galway, the midlands, the north east and Mayo-Roscommon, to address the gaps in service provision.</p><p>While I do not want to impose a long list of statistics on Members, some performance data from the HSE for 2013 are worth mentioning.  They show that almost 95% of patients received a specialist palliative in-patient bed within seven days, while 99.5% received the service within one month.  Again, improvements can be made.  All HSE areas have community specialist palliative home care teams in operation.  On average, 3,234 people accessed these services each month during 2013, a 10% improvement on the figure for 2012.  Some 87% of patients received specialist palliative services in their places of residence within seven days, while 99% received the service within one month.</p><p>A national policy was published in 2009 to set out a clear strategy for the development of an integrated palliative care service for children and their families, across all care settings, which included the establishment of a national development committee.</p> <p>The national development committee, the membership of which includes representatives of statutory, voluntary and professional bodies and parents, has established a number of working groups to progress policy recommendations, including the development of a model for hospice at home care.  This is being done in partnership with LauraLynn, the Milford Hospice and the HSE and three pilot locations have been identified.<br />Eight children's outreach nurses are now in place with the assistance of the Irish Hospice Foundation, for which we are very grateful.  The nurses work to identify the needs of each child and ensure families are appropriately linked with local services.  They are located in Drogheda, Limerick, Waterford, Temple Street and Crumlin in Dublin, Mullingar, Cork and Galway.<br />In 2010 the Economist Intelligence Unit ranked Ireland as having the fourth best developed palliative care service out of the 40 countries surveyed.  The 2001 report of the national advisory committee on palliative care recommended that bereavement support be an essential part of all specialist palliative care programmes and available in all settings where specialist palliative care was offered.  In 2013, 8,751 episodes of bereavement support were provided for 2,233 families through adult specialist palliative care services.  In addition, 72 families received bereavement support through the children's outreach nurses and Our Lady's Children's Hospital Crumlin during the two months of January and February this year.<br />The HSE is in the final stages of producing a palliative care comprehensive framework which sets out the core competencies as to the required knowledge, attitudes and skills across ten health care disciplines.  One of the areas of care addressed is loss, grief and bereavement.  The framework, through its implementation, will ensure the provision of bereavement support is enhanced across all care settings, including in the community, nursing homes, hospitals and specialist palliative care units.<br />Another palliative care service improvement being undertaken by the HSE is the development of an initiative entitled, Towards Excellence in Palliative Care.  It consists of eight quality assessment and Improvement work books which will be used to assess specialist palliative care services against the national standards for safer and better health care.<br />One of the essential elements relates to maximising quality of life and support in bereavement, including the development of bereavement plans.  Other supports and advice are also offered to those who find themselves bereaved.  The National Office for Suicide Prevention which is based within the HSE is working to develop formal and structured partnerships between voluntary and community organisations and the statutory sector to support and strengthen community-based suicide prevention, mental health promotion and bereavement support initiatives and to fund a range of very important initiatives in these areas.  The office provides funding for Console, a registered charity that provides one-to-one counselling for those bereaved by suicide.  Console has centres in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Wexford.  It also publishes a directory of bereavement support services which range from local support groups, self-help groups, voluntary or community groups and larger organisations with multiple branches.<br /><i></i>Reach Out<i>, </i>the national strategy for action on suicide prevention 2005-14, will come to the end of its ten-year term this year.  My Department and the HSE are developing a new strategic framework for suicide prevention for the period 2015 to 2018, building on the comprehensive work delivered under the current Reach Out strategy.  The  aim of the new framework will be to support population health approaches and interventions that will assist in reducing loss of life through suicide, while aiming for improved co-ordination and integration of services and responses in this area.  I have recently approved the establishment of a planning oversight group and five advisory groups covering research, policy, practice, engagement and communications and media to drive the process and they have commenced their work.  The new framework is expected to be in place by the end of this year.  <br />The Department of Social Protection and the Revenue Commissioners will advise families on where they stand as regards entitlements and whether liabilities arise.  The staff of these Departments and other public agencies will be as sympathetic as possible to bereaved persons and try to smooth the way for them as much<br />as they possibly can.  I take on board what Senator Marie Moloney said, that once people have the information in their hands, they can read it at their leisure when they get home.  <br />The Citizens Information Board is an excellent resource, too.  It provides general guidance and very useful contact details and linkages to both public and voluntary agencies which can help at this time.  In 2013 the board issued a publication entitled, Information for those affected by bereavement.  It provides information on dealing with the practical and material matters that arise following a death.  The Irish Hospice Foundation has provided a series of short, simple information leaflets aimed at the bereaved and those who support them.  A document entitled, Finding your Way, has been published by the PARC road safety group.  It is a guide for victims following the death or serious injury of a loved one in a road traffic collision.  There are many other bereavement services and support groups throughout the country, both public and private.  Information on organisations providing bereavement support is available from the Child and Family Agency.<br />An issue which, unfortunately, can arise for dying people is that of mental capacity.  This is a particularly painful and difficult issue but one which cannot be ignored.  Accordingly, the Government made a commitment in the programme for Government to develop a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults who had difficulty in making decisions unaided.  In this context, I am glad to say we published the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013 in July that year which constituted a fundamental reform of the law in this area.   The outmoded legislation will be repealed.  Wardship will be abolished.  The Bill proposes a series of guiding principles designed to safeguard the person's autonomy, where possible, and ensure the person's will and preferences can be at the heart of decisions concerning his or her life.  It proposes a series of support options for situations in which decisions have to be taken on behalf of an individual.  However, it requires that those taking decisions on behalf of another person are obliged to respect his or her wishes, where known.  It constitutes a major step forward in protecting the rights of vulnerable adults, including those reaching the end of their lives.  It passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il in December 2013 and will shortly be considered on Committee Stage.<br />An advance health care directive is a statement made by an individual with capacity setting out his or her will and preferences regarding treatment decisions that may arise in the future in the event that he or she lacks the capacity to provide consent or refusal for these treatments.  On Tuesday, 4 February 2014, the Government approved the publication of the draft general scheme of the advance health care directive provisions for the purposes of public consultation.  Following on from the consultation process, the advance health care directive provisions will be incorporated into the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013 on Committee Stage, in line with a Government decision made in 2013.  It is envisaged that the Bill will be taken on Committee Stage in the coming months.<br />The work that has been and continues to be done to support people who are bereaved demonstrates the priority the Government attaches to this issue.  This will continue to be the case for all public agencies which have a role to play.  For my part, I will ensure the issues which fall within my remit will be given the priority they deserve.  I will also ensure those who are approaching death and those who are left behind when a loved one departs will always remain our central focus.<br />I wish to add the following.  Even with advance health care directives and knowledge of a person's will and preferences, in my discussions with people who operate at that end of the scale - it was interesting to hear Senator John Crown's contribution - they have told me that it will be very difficult to override the insistence of families at the point when they say, &quot;Hold on a second, she never discussed that with me.&quot;   That will be very difficult to deal with.  As Senator John Crown rightly said, we need an education piece.  I hope today's exercise has made a contribution towards educating people in this regard.</p></speech>

I also thank my colleague, Senator David Norris, for seconding the motion and Senators Jillian van Turnhout and Mary Ann O'Brien who were part of the Taoiseach's cabal for speaking to the motion.  I thank the Government for withdrawing its amendment which I appreciate more than it knows.  It was brave, perceptive and good to do.</p><p>About one year ago I was doing some work in my capacity as a broadcaster and a writer when I met a man who was facing his last days.  He was living in a very tough and treeless estate located somewhere outside Mullingar.  He ached for breath as I sat beside him in the privacy of his own home.  When he turned to me and said &quot;You cannot get off this planet alive, Marie-Louise,&quot; I knew that death, dying, end-of-life issues and bereavement had a lot more to do with things other than health.  That was at the core of what I tried to say earlier.</p> <p>The motion is not about health.  While it of course comes from the genius of the eclectic and electrifying people who gave of their expertise to the Joint Committee on Health and Children - which of course would be the platform for this proposed review - out of that come issues on finance, legality and all the matters I included in the motion, including the educational, cultural and legal aspects of our living lives.  This is because the living have to do with the dead and dying and the dead have an awful lot to do with the living.  Moreover, it is never someone else's business.  One cannot present it to the palliative care or health providers and tell them it is their business.  It is the business of people in all walks of life, including Senator Crown's remarks on the education of doctors, the education of young people and in respect of culture, finance, law and all parts of society.</p><p>I ask that the State learn from the brilliant initiatives that it created itself, as well as those created nationwide in the various different community-led solutions.  I ask that the full panoply of State services be examined and that the Government begins to bring them together, both what is done brilliantly and what is not, to weave them all from a thread to good practice and support into our common humanity.  I ask the Government to set up a facility whereby this can be done.  While Members need be part of it, I believe there is a place in which this can be done and in which all these strands may be brought together.  This should be done in order that people in Ireland can, as the Taoiseach stated, learn to live well, that is, to be born well, to live well and to grow old but also to die well, as they have lived.</p><p>I wish to comment on a most interesting remark on bereavement made by a member of the public at the national conference organised in October 2013 by the Forum on End of Life.  She explained that because her husband had died well, she and her children could live well and grieve well.  What happens before death can dictate what happens after death.  I wish to expand this issue beyond the confines of health to all of our living lives.  This was the point of the motion and I thank my colleagues for their support.  I thank all Members of the House for their support because a motion such as this comes from a good place.  It does not come from a political place but is above politics.  Members brought a great deal of their own experience, as well as much agreement, to what I was trying to suggest to the Government.  I hope Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who I consider to be a fine, articulate, compassionate and perceptive Minister of State, might bring to the Cabinet the idea of bringing this together and might examine its possibility in the future.</p></speech>

The implications of these were potentially of such gravity that the Government decided to establish a statutory commission of investigation to examine all matters of public concern relating to the issue.</p><p>In the context of ongoing legal proceedings in a particular case, it was learned that a system was in place in a large number of Garda stations whereby incoming and outgoing telephone calls were recorded.  From the information available, the practice of making recordings was in place for many years and was discontinued in November of 2013.  It is now public knowledge that the case in question is the Bailey case.</p><p>Subsequently, at its meeting on 1 April, the Government decided to appoint Mr. Justice Nial Fennelly, currently serving as a judge of the Supreme Court, as chair of the commission of investigation.  The Government also decided that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Justice and Equality should ensure the retention and preservation of all tapes; complete a full inventory of all tapes; and devise arrangements to ensure that tapes can be accessed, as required and in accordance with the law.  The Government also decided to establish a new Cabinet Committee on Justice Reform to oversee the development of proposals for an independent police authority, and other associated reforms to the policing and justice system.</p><p>It is imperative that we, as a society, have full public confidence in, and support for, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na given the very difficult and important job that it does.  We therefore wish to see a full public debate on the issue of policing and justice reform and the Government will bring forward proposals for a public consultation process on the issue in the coming weeks.  The Government is strongly committed to these reforms and intends to have new structures, including the appointment of a new Garda Commissioner by open competition and the establishment of a new independent policing authority, in place later this year.  Further evidence of this commitment is the establishment of the Cooke and Guerin inquiries, both of which are due to report very shortly.</p><p>On 8 April, the Government published detailed terms of reference for the commission, which incorporate the views conveyed by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality in its letter to me of 3 April.  The terms of reference of the commission are to investigate and report on the operation of Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na telephone recording systems and on the following matters in particular: (a) to identify all Garda stations in which telephone recording systems, to record calls other than 999 calls to the emergency call answering service, were installed and-or operated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na between 1 January 1980 and 27 November 2013 and to establish an inventory of those Garda stations so identified to include: (i) the date of initial installation, where such installation occurred at a date between 1 January 1980 and 27 November 2013; (ii) to report whether any such installations were already in existence on 1 January 1980; (iii) the duration for which telephone recording systems continued in operation in each such Garda station; (iv) the date on which telephone recording systems were terminated or removed from each such Garda station; (b) to establish the immediate circumstances surrounding the installation of telephone recording systems operated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at the said Garda stations and to establish what authorisation was sought or obtained by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for such installation and, including the funding, installation, maintenance and-or upgrading of those telephone recording systems, to include the public procurement procedure followed in 1996 and further in relation to the installation of the NICE recorder system in 2008; (c) to establish how the said telephone recording systems operated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were managed and to establish what use, if any, was made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of any information collated by the said telephone recording systems; (d) to identify the organisation and structures in place for the installation, operation and management of the said telephone recording systems and in the storage, access, analysis and use of any information obtained from them; (e) to investigate and report on the level of knowledge of the existence, operation and use of the said telephone recording systems within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; (f) to investigate and report on the level of knowledge of the existence, operation and use of the said telephone recording systems within the Office of the Minister for Justice and Equality, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Office of the Attorney General, the Chief State Solicitor's office, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission; (g) to establish whether the installation, operation and use of the said telephone recording systems was authorised by law; (h) to establish whether any telephone conversations between solicitors and their clients were recorded by the said telephone recording systems; (i) to establish whether any information obtained from the said telephone recording systems by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was used by it either improperly or unlawfully and, in particular, whether any recordings as may have been made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of solicitor-client telephone conversations were used for any purpose whatsoever; (j) to establish where the recorded information obtained from the telephone recording systems operated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was stored since the creation of same and to establish how such information was accessed and analysed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; (k) to establish whether any of the recorded information has been destroyed; (l) to establish any instances during the relevant period where the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions made use of the data and information produced by the said telephone recording systems for any purpose; (m) in particular, to identify and review all recordings in the possession of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na emanating from the Garda telephone recording system at Bandon Garda station or otherwise, which relate to the Garda investigation into the death of Sophie Toscan du Plantier and to establish whether those recorded phone calls, and any other acts or events in the course of the said Garda investigation, disclose any evidence of unlawful or improper conduct by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in connection with that investigation; (n) to investigate and report on the furnishing to the Minister of a letter dated 10 March 2014 sent by the former Garda Commissioner, Mr. Martin Callinan, to the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality; (o) to investigate and report on the sequence of events leading up to the retirement of the former Garda Commissioner, Mr. Martin Callinan, on 25 March 2014; (p) in the event that any matter arises from the Report of the Inspector of Prisons Judge Michael Reilly pursuant to section 31 of the Prisons Act 2007 into all the circumstances surrounding the recording of telephone conversations between prisoners and their solicitors, which appears to require further investigation in the public interest the commission may investigate and report on same; and (q) to report on any other matters of concern arising from its investigation of recordings to and from Garda stations and to make any further recommendations as it sees fit.</p><p>The commission shall exercise discretion in relation to the scope and intensity of the investigation it considers necessary and appropriate, having regard to the general objective of the investigation.   </p> <p>In particular, the commission shall have the discretion to decide to limit its investigation to samples of recordings in light of what is disclosed as the investigation progresses.</p><p>The commission's terms of reference, as approved by Government, envisage a final report to the Government no later than 31 December 2014, subject to section 6(6) of the Act.  I am aware that there have been calls for earlier reports on some elements of the investigation, in particular the sequence of events leading up to the retirement of the former Garda Commissioner.  However, it is important to recognise the independence of the judge and, therefore, the Government believes it is more appropriate to give the commission full flexibility on the nature, timing or sequencing of any part of the investigation.</p><p>The staffing requirements of the commission will reflect the scope of the terms of reference and the ambitious timescale involved.  The exact requirements of the commission will become clearer once the commission is established and begins to scope out its work in more detail.  The appointment of staff and their terms and conditions will be subject to approval by me, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  In addition to direct staffing costs, set up and ongoing costs will arise in regard to the establishment of the commission's office, ICT and administration, travel and subsistence, etc.  Specialist expertise may also be required given the subject of the investigation.</p><p>Based on an initial assessment, a cost of &euro;2 million is deemed a reasonable estimate for 2014 and it is proposed to provide for this from the Vote of the Department of the Taoiseach.  This estimate is based on the assumption that the commission completes its work by the end of 2014, as specified in the terms of reference.  If it were deemed necessary to extend the commission's work beyond that date, then further staffing and other costs will arise.</p><p>In addition to salary and administration costs, third party costs are also likely to arise.  In accordance with the provisions of the Act, following consultation with the commission and with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, I will have guidelines prepared concerning this area.  The extent and timing of any such costs are difficult to estimate at this stage.</p><p>My sole interest in addressing these matters, which is why I have come to the Seanad and which are rightly of deep concern, is to establish the truth.  It appears that the practices which will be investigated by the commission may have been going on for 30 years.  The establishment of the commission of investigation is the most appropriate, timely and cost effective way of getting to the truth.  The commission's comprehensive terms of reference will ensure that all relevant issues are investigated in a thorough and timely manner and I commend the motion to the House.</p></speech>

We support the establishment of the commission of investigation.  However, I do not accept the Taoiseach's explanation as to why this investigation cannot be done on a modular basis.  Many of the issues raised, such as the illegal taping and the Bailey case, are of public concern and require an investigation such as that which the Taoiseach outlined.  However, in regard to terms of reference (n) and (o), the Taoiseach could clarify the information, the timeline and his involvement in respect of the forced resignation of the former Garda Commissioner, Martin Callanan.  That does not require a commission of investigation.  This is a &euro;2 million cloak around one issue in which the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, found themselves embroiled and this is a way to get out of it, namely, by sending it to a commission of investigation along with everything else.  That said, we will support the motion.<br />I wish to ask the Taoiseach a few specific questions on terms of reference (n) and (o).  Why is it that one month after only the second Garda Commissioner in the history of State was effectively removed from his post, the Taoiseach has not outlined his involvement in that matter?  As I said, that issue does not have to be part of an investigation.  The Taoiseach outlined very serious matters which should be part of the investigation but I believe, as do my colleagues, that the issue relating to the resignation, retirement or forced retirement of the former Garda Commissioner could be dealt with by the Taoiseach this evening.<br />I have a couple of specific questions in that regard which the Taoiseach may be able to address.  The Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Shatter, sent the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality to the Garda Commissioner's house on 24 March.  What did they ask the Secretary General to say to the former Garda Commissioner?  Did they tell the T&aacute;naiste on 24 March that they were sending the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality to the former Garda Commissioner's house?  What was the Secretary General asked to say?  Was he instructed to say anything in particular to the former Garda Commissioner?  Was the Garda Commissioner effectively told at that Monday evening meeting his position was untenable?  Apparently, it was a courtesy call, which I do not believe.<br />What I find even more remarkable today, having read reports in the <i>Irish Examiner, </i>that the T&aacute;naiste is demanding answers on the circumstances of the former Garda Commissioner's resignation.  To me, my colleagues and many people outside this House, that is incredible because surely the T&aacute;naiste should just ask the Taoiseach and his Cabinet colleague, the Minister, Deputy Shatter, about the circumstances of that Monday evening courtesy call by the Secretary General to the former Garda Commissioner.  <br />The Attorney General telephoned the Taoiseach on the Sunday about the taping concerns.  I agree with the Taoiseach that they were very serious concerns but why did it take him until Monday evening to tell the Minister for Justice and Equality?  Are we meant to believe that at the Monday evening meeting, which the Taoiseach had with the Minister, Deputy Shatter, the Secretaries General of the Department of the Taoiseach and Justice and Equality and the Attorney General, that he did not discuss the former Garda Commissioner's letter sent to the Department of Justice and Equality which apparently was not passed on to the Minister?  At that Monday evening meeting with all of these people, what was discussed if that letter was not discussed?  As a citizen - forget about the fact I am Senator - I genuinely cannot understand that.  The Attorney General knew about these taping concerns at least since last November.  Am I meant to believe that the Attorney General never once mentioned this to the Minister for Justice and Equality even though she sits at Cabinet? <br />While supporting the broad thrust of the investigation, what the Taoiseach and the Government are telling the people about the circumstances of the forced resignation of the former Garda Commissioner is just not credible.  For whatever reason, the Taoiseach has decided time after time to circle the wagons around the Minister for Justice and Equality in respect of whose Department four separate inquiries are taking place.  The Taoiseach chairs a sub-committee of Cabinet to oversee what is happening in justice.  Why does the Taoiseach not provide clarity on the timeframe and the circumstances around the forced resignation of the former Garda Commissioner because he was involved?  That does not require to be part of this investigation.  If the Taoiseach believes it does, then he should allow it to be done on a modular basis because, as he rightly says, he wants to get to the truth.  The Taoiseach is in possession of the truth in respect of a major part of this and I ask him to state it in the Seanad this evening.</p></speech>

I greatly welcome the establishment of this commission of investigation and commend the Taoiseach on his swift and, indeed, decisive action in establishing it.  As an organisation, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has always enjoyed public confidence and is held in high regard among the people.  However, recent revelations and events have raised some serious questions.  The people want answers to those questions and it is our responsibility, as a Government, to seek to provide them.</p> <p>I hope the establishment of the commission of investigation, with its comprehensive terms of reference as outlined to the House by the Taoiseach, will provide the necessary answers and explanations to the questions raised concerning the recording of telephone conversations at Garda stations.  While we all support the Garda for its work on our behalf, no one would wish its members to engage in any improper or unlawful acts, although I am not suggesting this was the case.</p><p>The decision of the Government to keep hold of all the tapes and establish an inventory in order to make appropriate arrangements for them to be available to the commission, along with the formation of a Cabinet committee on justice reform to oversee the process, is also to be welcomed.</p><p>In any functioning democracy, the good standing of its police force is essential.  The public need to have full confidence in the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, given the central role the organisation plays in society.  In my view, every State organisation should be subject to periodic review, not only to ensure that it meets the needs of the public but also to ensure it is being run appropriately.  I hope the membership of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na engage fully with the process, because they are in the best position to inform, advise and offer recommendations for change.</p><p>This investigation, along with the Guerin and Cooke reports, provides a great opportunity to address the overall architecture of policing.  It will also improve oversight, and confidence in oversight, about which the public have doubts.  This is far too grave and serious an issue to be subjected to political point-scoring, although I suggest this is what has occurred.</p><p>I am confident that the commission of investigation will provide all the answers to the questions asked by Senator Darragh O'Brien this evening, for instance.  The Minister for Justice and Equality is a reforming Minister who has introduced significant reforming legislation since his appointment.  These reforms will continue when he introduces the DNA database Bill and the Irish human rights and equality commission Bill in this House next month.</p><p>I commend the Taoiseach on his decision, which we should all agree is the best way of seeking the answers to the questions that many of us are asking.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-04-16a.278" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1176" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014041600040#PP00200"><p>I welcome the Taoiseach to the House.  Three years ago the Irish electorate voted for this Government because they wanted a new form of political and administrative governance that offered transparency and open communication with the public.  They voted to bring a new system of governance to the Irish State that would move beyond the scandals and corruption that were endemic in the past.</p><p>In light of the unfolding of the multiple dimensions of this current crisis regarding An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, various Departments and State bodies and offices, it is vital that the Government demonstrate an energy, an alacrity and a commitment to dealing with these issues immediately and with all the resolve necessary and transparency expected.  There is a lot of disillusionment at present and a sense that the expectation of a new form of governance has not been delivered and that the people's hopes have been bruised.</p><p>The Taoiseach's decision to establish a commission of investigation with terms of reference of such breadth, including some suggested to him by the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, of which I am a member, is to be welcomed.  The commission of investigation is vital to restoring public confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which has taken a considerable blow in recent months, and is also vital to supporting and ensuring strong morale within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The commission of investigation is critical in demonstrating the Government's commitment to transparency, openness and accountability in the State.  For that reason, it should be given all necessary resources and be concluded as quickly as possible.</p><p>The breadth of the terms of reference should allow the commission as much scope as is needed to investigate all the details of the recordings and other issues, some details of which may only come to light through the inquiry.  That is the reason point (q) of the terms is particularly welcome.  For example, the inquiry must be empowered to establish the lines of responsibility and knowledge within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Justice and Equality with regard to the recordings.  I say this because the focus appears at times to be more on the Garda, yet it seems implausible that the authority to undertake recordings was restricted to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and undertaken solely at its initiative without reference to the Department of Justice and Equality.  Such independent action by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na seems all the more unlikely given what we have seen about the proximity of the relationship between the Department and Garda management.</p><p>I welcome the establishment of the commission of inquiry and the breadth of its terms of the reference.  I acknowledge the Taoiseach wishes to establish the truth.  Even at this late stage it is critical that the terms of reference be amended to ensure the transparency, urgency and open communication with the electorate that the Taoiseach promised.  I urge him to consider my suggested amendments.  There should be maximum transparency and the inquiry should be held in public, except where there are clear, identifiable and justifiable grounds for not doing so, which should be limited and explicitly stated.  This was also recommended by the justice committee.  The terms of reference should be amended to prioritise the sequence of events leading up to the retirement of the former Garda Commissioner, the handling of correspondence and information by the Department of Justice and Equality and the administrative procedures in place within the Department governing the transfer of knowledge from officials to the Minister.  Further, the commission should publish an interim report on these matters within a period of eight weeks.  This, too, was recommended by the justice committee.  Eight months is too long a period for the public to wait with regard to these two issues.  If administrative and governance problems exist they need to be discovered as soon as possible and fixed as soon as possible.</p><p>I propose an amendment with regard to open communication, in that interim reports should be produced by the commission, as I have already mentioned, and that the commission of investigation report should be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and published.  In my view there should be a timeframe of a maximum of 30 days after its receipt by the Taoiseach.  Because the Commissions of Investigation Act does not explicitly require publication, the publication of the commission's report should be included in the terms of reference.  If the Oireachtas and the public do not have the report of the commission in as timely a manner as possible, how will the people and their representatives know what is wrong and be able to engage in a proper public debate about what reforms are necessary?  I welcome the Taoiseach's announcement about the other debates on policing and wider justice reform.</p><p>In conclusion, I believe these amendments establishing transparency, urgency and open communication are critical if the Government is to deliver on its promises to the electorate.</p></speech>

We welcome the fact that the commission will investigate three key areas: the widespread and long-running practice by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of operating telephone recording systems; the implications of the tapings into the tragic death of Sophie Toscan du Plantier in 1996; and the sequence of events leading to the resignation or retirement of the Garda Commissioner, Martin Callinan.</p><p>As Senator Zappone said, the justice committee - of which I too am a member - wrote to the Taoiseach on 3 April.  We are delighted to note that the matters we sought to have included in the terms of reference are included in terms (n) and (o) - that is, the progress of the letter dated 10 March 2014 sent by the former Garda Commissioner to the Minister, and the events leading up to the retirement of the former Garda Commissioner.  We are glad that both of these have been incorporated, but we also asked that these two matters in particular be front-loaded and dealt with in the early course of the work of the commission of investigation and within eight weeks.  The members of the justice committee are disappointed that this requirement was not included in the terms of reference of the commission.  We accept that the judge is independent in the conduct of the inquiry and that he will, of course, make a decision as to whether it be held in private or public, but it is our view, at least in respect of those two matters, that the hearings should be held in public.  The committee will be expressing that view to the Taoiseach and to Mr. Justice Nial Fennelly.</p><p>As other speakers have said, it is vital that we seek to restore faith and trust among the public in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The events which led to the establishment of the commission of investigation will lead to a great improvement in governance systems in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I particularly welcome the Government's commitment to establishing an independent policing authority, which has been a long-standing Labour Party policy.  Deputies Anne Ferris and Se&aacute;n Kenny and myself, as the Labour Party members of the justice committee, last week published a framework document for the shape of such a Garda authority, which would at last provide a buffer between the Minister and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In our view this will greatly improve the governance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

For Senator Darragh O'Brien to call it some class of cloak is just ridiculous.  I do not believe any Government would normally subject itself or allow or encourage a Supreme Court judge to sit over an inquiry for such a length of time.  That is certainly no cloak.</p> <p>I welcome that a timeline has been set.  As someone who spent part of my life investigating all kinds of things, I differ from Senator Bacik in thinking the timeline to the end of December is appropriate.  As someone who had the costs, length and complexity of a tribunal laid at my feet as if I were to blame, I know something about these things.  However, by December, I hope there will be a report and an extension will not delay it too much longer.  It is important that the sequence of events leading to the departure of Martin Callinan are included, that the recordings relating to the death of Sophie Toscan du Plantier are analysed and that any other acts that reveal unlawful or improper conduct by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will also be investigated.  This is long overdue.  The original authorisation of the taping and its continued use and updating of the equipment should also be examined.<br />I welcome the urgent approach being taken to the establishment of an independent policing authority.  I am firmly of the view that rank and file garda&iacute; know that this, ultimately, will help them in their work.  A high-level committee is also obvious evidence of the commitment of the Taoiseach to this matter.<br />The task of GSOC has been a difficult and lonely task.  It endeavoured to play its role in changing the culture of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by encouraging greater transparency.  It was very clear at the meeting last November of the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions, of which I am a member, when Martin Callinan gave evidence.  He said:<blockquote>[i]t is the case that I am required by law to assist the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and so I have no choice but to provide that assistance.  As to whether I would wish it were different, yes I would. </blockquote>When that is the mood music at the top of an organisation, why are we surprised there is a culture of secrecy?  Any policing authority put in place must be accompanied by training and retraining of garda&iacute; to help change the culture from within the organisation, not solely from without and not relying entirely on such an independent policing commission, although I do not need to underline its importance.<br />I am disappointed by one thing.  I would have liked the commission to take a look at the procedures run by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the surveillance of mobile phones of those it believes may endanger the State and how it seems to be able to add new mobile phones to an existing order.  Those newly-added numbers belong to other people whose identity is known and against whom the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is unwilling to look for such an order to tap their phones.  Journalists are one such group and others fall into the category.  This was not an issue when we only had landlines but technology has moved on.  This is a matter that requires urgent attention and the logs of numbers held by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for such surveillance would reveal numbers for which no authorisation was given.</p></speech>

The assistant commissioner, John O'Mahoney, reassured us there is no question of what has been described as a culture of non-enforcement of penalties being tolerated by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but we must wonder how it comes to pass that there are now three separate inquiries into the activities of garda&iacute;.  How has it come to this?  I believe that it is mismanagement.  A culture of cover-up has permeated successive national Administrations but I expected more from the Taoiseach and this Administration.  Over the past few months, we have seen attempt after attempt on the part of the Government to hide from the reality of the multitude of problems that have emanated from the mismanagement of the powers entrusted in our garda&iacute;.  Despite these cover-ups failing time and again, the response to every new fact has been further cover-up.  Considering the very limited scope of the terms of reference for this inquiry, I must ask the following questions.  What about the other recording facilities in our Garda stations?  Have they ever been misused?  Why have they been so deliberately excluded from the terms of reference of this inquiry?  When the culture of using electronic surveillance within the prosecutorial service is so strong that the DPP would think to attempt to introduce surreptitiously recorded conversations as evidence in a criminal case, surely it is plausible some others within the service - broadly defined - would have thought to use other recording facilities in the Garda stations in a similar fashion.  Would it not be better to exclude them, if they are rightfully to be excluded, from any suggestion that they were abused by investigating whether they had been abused?  The alternative is to risk some further future scandal as more information about the practices of a minority of our garda&iacute; leaks into the public domain.</p><p>The obfuscation of the truth and the slow emergence of the facts provides an acidic drip, drip, drip of information that is steadily wearing away the genuine and well-deserved high esteem the Irish people have for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  So many of them have put their health and lives on the line to defend our rights.  The Taoiseach, personally, must take some of the blame for this as his is the Government overseeing this and not managing it well.  The Taoiseach's Government has transformed discreditable behaviour on the behalf of a minority of garda&iacute; into what has become a systemic crisis for the force.  The Cabinet has overseen this and handled it badly.  We expected more of the Taoiseach than this and I expected more.</p><p>Ours was a generation that knew the arms crisis, knew the bad old days of Charlie Haughey and the activities of former Minister Se&aacute;n Doherty - Lord rest him - at their extremes, which saw the bugging of journalists for political gain, and lived through incidents that were grotesque, unbelievable, bizarre and unprecedented.  Our generation knew the potential for harm to the Republic when a Government, instead of acknowledging uncomfortable facts, instead puts up a hedgehog defence that sees internal critics as traitors and external critics as enemies.  What did the Government do?  The record so far is to put pressure on the Smithwick tribunal to end its inquiries early, to dismiss the concerns of the whistleblowers and, more reprehensibly, to issue statements made at multiple levels - administrative and political - of the Government to undermine the good names of these whistleblowers.</p><p>I publically thank the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, who said what needed to be said, who said what should have been said by senior members of the Government many months earlier.  He is a credit to the Fine Gael Party, to the Cabinet and to our medical profession.  There was the leaking of confidential information about the Deputies who supported the whistleblowers.  There was the Taoiseach's misinterpretation of the Garda Act regarding GSOC.  At every opportunity to hide, there has been hiding, at every opportunity to evade, there has been evasion.  This is not what the electorate expected of the reforming Government.  Those of us who endorsed the Taoiseach, and supported his candidacy for high office, believing that he would be a reforming Taoiseach, did not expect this.</p><p>The official version of events that the former Commissioner retired for family reasons only hours after meeting the Taoiseach's representative, drags this mess into less and less credible territory.  It is not credible that the long-recognised practice of improper taping in Garda stations, which Martin Callinan attempted to bring to the attention of others, was the proximate cause for his apparent dismissal.  Every time there has been a partial acknowledgement of the reality of the Garda behaviour, some other fact comes into light and there is something else beneath this surface.  How does the Taoiseach answer the charge that will be levelled by the Irish people, cynical as they are about politics, that what differentiates any Irish Opposition party from an Irish Government party is merely the opportunity that a particular tribe will have to further the interests most closely associated with it and to damage those who are not loyal members of the tribe?  In the remaining two years, I urge the Taoiseach to recapture the zeal of reform that swept him into office, to put the protection of whistleblowers front and centre and to acknowledge that people who disagree with him are not necessarily his enemies but people whose point of view should be esteemed and sometimes acted upon.  </p></speech>

I welcome the Taoiseach to the Seanad to discuss this vital issue.  Whatever criticism, both valid and otherwise, has been levelled at Government in the past months about its response to the various issues surrounding the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it is to the Taoiseach's credit that when he took the decision to set up a commission of inquiry under the auspices of Mr. Justice Fennelly, he proposed terms of reference that are comprehensive and exacting in nature.  I also welcome the fact that the Taoiseach has involved the chairperson of the commission in the drafting of the terms of reference to ensure he has the requisite tools to perform his task.  The only criticism levelled to date is the length it will take the commission to report.  However, eight months is not a long time to get to the bottom of the very serious issues involved.  No one would be in favour of a truncated inquiry that did not deliver comprehensive answers to very troubling questions.</p> <p>I particularly welcome the Government's decision to ask Mr. Justice Fennelly to report on the Garda's handling of the Sophie Toscan du Plantier murder investigation.  Given what the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality has said about the content of the recorded telephone conversations in Bandon Garda station during the investigation, the various other accusations levelled and the rumours abounding in public and in private, the results of Mr. Justice Fennelly's investigation will make for very difficult reading.  The saga has dragged on far too long and it is positive, no matter what the outcome, that the Government is willing to get to the bottom of it.</p><p>I know that the Taoiseach is willing to listen and while I have the opportunity it would be remiss of me not to, in a constructive way, suggest that, in addition to the very welcome announcement of a new Garda authority, a few other matters relating to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na could be considered.  Has the Taoiseach considered the method by which garda&iacute; above the rank of inspector are appointed?  I fully accept that, historically, it was necessary for senior members of the national police force to be committed to the Free State and, therefore, a certain degree of political oversight in promotions was required.  I understand, however, that two years ago the Government made a decision to civilianise the human resources element of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This decision should be activated immediately as it will go a long way to bringing transparency to the appointment and promotion process within the organisation.  In the light of recent events, it would be a welcome move in terms of ensuring transparency.</p><p>Has the Taoiseach considered whether the new authority could be mandated to investigate whether the Garda requires what the Defence Forces term an &quot;officer corps&quot;?  While I recognise the value of coming up through the ranks, this pathway can result in an element of institutional inertia and a lack of new thinking.  It is also the case that the current system of promotion through the ranks can be seen to be, even if it is not so, a form of favouritism or client&egrave;lism.</p><p>I fully support the terms of reference outlined and the Taoiseach's firm resolve on the issue.  While nobody has emerged particularly well from recent events, bar the two Garda whistleblowers, perhaps, in the end, some good might come of it.</p></speech>

We can have immediate confidence in the appointment of Mr. Justice Fennelly, a very senior member of the Supreme Court and a man totally above reproach.  The terms of reference are comprehensive and I hope the deadlines can be met.  They will be reviewed in due course.  This is necessary for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We have seen the events in County Donegal.  Human nature being what it is, there are, unfortunately, some bad apples everywhere.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is, however, a great force.</p><p>This commission and its work in the interests of the citizenry constitute a total commitment to the openness and transparency Senator Katherine Zappone mentioned.  The Cooke and Guerin reports will be published shortly.  I also welcome the open public competition to which the Taoiseach has committed for the appointment of the new Garda Commissioner.</p><p>What my good friend Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien has said as ever totally lacks objectivity and impartiality.

This has been a very disturbing period in the administration of justice.  Public confidence has been fundamentally undermined by the Government&rsquo;s incompetence in overseeing all of these episodes.  With regard to the administration of justice, the allegations in respect of the Office of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, being bugged were very serious.  Unfortunately, however, on the day after the matter was reported in <i>The Sunday Times</i>the Taoiseach misquoted the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and said GSOC had a requirement to report to the Minister.  Straightaway the tone was set and in the language used, the victims were turned into the villains.<br />The Taoiseach robustly refused media calls for an independent inquiry and the matter dragged on for another week.  Finally, he opted not for an inquiry but for a review by Mr. Justice John Cooke who will report soon.  In particular, he did not opt for a commission of investigation into something fundamental to our democracy.  When it came to the dossier handed to him by the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il which contained the very serious legacy allegations from the Garda whistleblower, Sergeant Maurice McCabe, the Taoiseach again opted for a review, not an inquiry, this time by Mr. Sean Guerin, senior counsel.  This review is also ongoing.<br />When it came to the matter of the tape recordings, however, the Taoiseach went immediately for a commission of investigation.  There are suspicions that this is an attempt at distraction from the core issue, another emerging scandal, one of the biggest in the history of the State, the Ian Bailey affair.  Very soon investigating officers from the French authorities will come to the State to investigate witnesses.  This is outrageous interference in the criminal justice system that the Taoiseach is tolerating, even though he knows that the basis of the case and for external investigating officers in coming to our jurisdiction is flimsy at best.  This is based on Garda files that are fundamentally flawed, as proved by the report from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in 2001, of which the State has been aware for all these years.  That was the basis on which the Supreme Court refused to extradite Ian Bailey.  We have all that information, yet the Government is allowing the French authorities to come here and carry on.  It is a fiasco.<br />This involves allegations of Garda behaviour very similar to those that emerged during the Morris tribunal, but it is worse because the State apparatus has stood over this for far too long.  The various Ministers responsible for the justice portfolio, Attorneys General and the Department of Justice and Equality have stood over it throughout the years.  While the incorporation of the Ian Bailey tape recordings from Bandon Garda station into the commission&rsquo;s terms of reference is welcome, we need a dedicated commission of investigation into the affair. </p> <p>There are serious questions for the Minister for Justice and Equality to answer in respect of this affair.  He has known this since early 2012, following the Supreme Court decision and his Department handing over the 44-page critique from the Director of Public Prosecution, DPP, of the initial Garda investigation.  The critique apparently rips the entire investigation to shreds.  The Minister has known about the issue for a number of years but stood back and let it continue.  His Department and the Government are defending a civil case taken by Mr. Ian Bailey and his partner, Ms Jules Thomas, as we speak.</p><p>The 44-page critique by the DPP given to Mr. Bailey's legal team and the Supreme Court, and which formed the basis of the court's decision to refuse to extradite Mr. Bailey, only came into the hands of his legal team because a previous Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr. Eamonn Barnes, realised there was a basis for a serious miscarriage of justice.  He knew from 2001 about this ridiculous and appallingly flawed investigation, with all the emerging issues around witnesses being coaxed and cajoled into giving evidence.  That was known about at the highest levels of administration of justice in the State, and it continues today.</p><p>The Taoiseach must intervene in this case by asking the Minister what he did through 2012.  On three occasions in 2012, Mr. Bailey's legal team wrote to the Minister about the failure of the Garda to co-operate with the investigation by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.  The Minister refused to intervene and ensure the documentation required by GSOC was given to the ombudsman, yet he intervened in the following year when GSOC made public its absolute bewilderment and frustration about the failure of the Garda to co-operate in the Kieran Boylan affair.  He could have intervened in the Bailey case when the three letters were sent to him but he refused to do so.  He also refused to intervene in sorting out the issue of Garda co-operation with GSOC and the implications of the Supreme Court case.  He indicated he would consult the Attorney General but nothing happened.  That is the real scandal.  T&aacute; tuilleadh le r&aacute; agam ach t&aacute; mo chuid ama caite.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go dtabharfaidh an Taoiseach aghaidh ar na ceisteanna at&aacute; ardaithe agam.</p></speech>

Mr. Justice Nial Fennelly has been appointed to the process.  Of the 17 letters of the alphabet used, 15 referred to the phone issues.  The Law Society has indicated that a commission of investigation must undertake a broad analysis to ascertain why the phone recordings were made and on what basis State authorities believed such recordings were lawful or warranted.  How far into the system were the recordings known?</p><p>There are other aspects that must be considered, including the circumstances of the Garda Commissioner's departure and treatment of whistleblowers.  The Garda Commissioner indicated he wanted to withdraw his remark about the whistleblowers but was advised from within the Department not to do so.  That is a strange episode that should be examined.  There is also the matter of the missing letter.  A key point in the Smithwick tribunal was how two people lost their lives in Dundalk with haphazard organisation by the Garda.  The fact that a letter addressed to the Minister took 15 days to reach him is important, and we must update procedures to ensure that does not happen again.  We should also consider the treatment of Deputies Wallace and Clare Daly in the penalty points issue, and many aspersions were cast on the Garda force as a result.  There should be a report on the matter.</p><p>There is the opportunity for a new beginning, with new recruits coming into Templemore for the first time in several years.  We have the opportunity to now draw on the wisdom of Chris Patton in Northern Ireland with an independent police authority, and I hope this will be a genuine new beginning.  The aspects we have discussed should be included in Mr. Justice Fennelly's inquiries.  I thank the Taoiseach for what he has done, as these issues have caused serious concern around the country.  We have the chance to set things right so that people can be reassured when the matters come into the open; an independent police authority will be particularly helpful, and there should be a healthier relationship between GSOC and the Garda.  GSOC seems to have been dismissed but it is an agent of the wider public, so its treatment by the Garda was wrong.  It has a superb tradition and a place in the hearts and minds of Irish people, but things have been going wrong in the Garda, so the Taoiseach will have the support of many in the House when he tries to put them right.</p></speech>

I came as Taoiseach to deal with this issue - the terms of reference for the commission of investigation - because it is important.  Ms Sophie Toscan du Plantier was murdered and the crime was never solved, her killer may well be at large.  In the course of analysis in the process of discovery, it transpired there were recorded conversations at Bandon station.  These have been transcribed and a number of them are stark and critical with respect to the case being pursued.  Ms du Plantier's family has never had closure.</p><p>From this will arise a position where we will have an independent statutory Garda authority which will bring transparency, accountability and pride to the men and women who wear the uniform of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in such a way that the citizens of our country can have faith and belief in the integrity and quality of what the Garda does.  The decision referred to by Senator Naughton to civilianise the human resource management element of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is important, although no more than the decision to have an open competition to fill the post of Garda Commissioner.  I note the comments and actions of the interim Garda Commissioner in terms of her view of the force and the decision to send a private questionnaire to each of the 13,000 members.  I remind Senator O'Brien that his party wanted to reduce Garda membership to 11,000.  I also note the interim Garda Commissioner's comments about those with a dissenting or different voice in the force, and from all this will come a different Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in which there is pride and visible integrity.</p><p>Senator Crown asked about the difference between Government and Opposition; I can tell him one difference.  For a considerable period, Deputy Shatter raised questions in the D&aacute;il arising from the Donegal situation.  It was ten years before the Morris tribunal was set up.  One difference I can stand over is that two weeks from being personally informed by the Attorney General of what I considered a grave and serious situation, a commission of investigation was set up by the Government, with very comprehensive terms of reference, under the chairmanship of a sole member who is a member of the Supreme Court and a person of exceptional competence and experience.  He is not and should not be subject to political overtures, political direction or political instruction.  In consultation with the Attorney General and the sole member, the Cabinet has defined the parameters of the terms of the commission of investigation.  As Senators Bacik and Zappone pointed out, on the recommendation of the Oireachtas committee dealing with justice, the four issues mentioned are included fully in the terms of reference for the commission of investigation.</p><p>It is difficult to know the truth in all these matters.  When the evidence was presented to me in the D&aacute;il and when one goes through the issues, many of these issues were dealt with by the Garda Commissioner, the DPP or GSOC, but I speak for none of those three.  What does one do?  Does one set up another public inquiry about each of these matters or does one get a criminal lawyer of exceptional experience, like Mr. Guerin, to go through the evidence and examine the issues dealt with by those independent authorities to see if another case is to be answered?  I stated in the D&aacute;il that if the findings of that analysis are that further work is warranted, it shall be done.</p> <p> I say to Senator O'Brien that I have three dozen cases on my desk now of allegations from both members of the community and members of the Garda about actions and allegations that are very serious.  I have no idea whether they are true or not.  Some of them go back many years.  I assure Senator Crown that issues of concern are not confined to the justice profession.  We have had to deal in the other House and in this House with issues relating to his profession that came to light 30 years ago and were never followed up.  In fairness to the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter - nobody is perfect - he was the first one to point out and deal with the fact that GSOC did not have the facilities to do its job completely independently.  He is the one who has now overseen the analysis of the situation by Mr. Justice Cooke.  The results of the investigation by Mr. Guerin, SC. are awaited.  The Oireachtas committee is conducting public consultation and examining the terms of reference and the views presented.  In view of the exceptional capabilities of the sole member, the commission of investigation will endeavour to deal with the issue in the best way possible.  These issues that go back so many years must be dealt with and it is entirely a matter for Mr. Justice Fennelly as to what he wishes to do with his investigation.  I do not accept Senator O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s point, which he might make with the best intentions in the world, that it is for me or anybody else to attempt to give directions to somebody in charge of the commission of investigation.</p></speech>

That was not to interfere in any way with his right or responsibility to run the tribunal as he saw fit.  I am pleased the final report was eventually produced.  Some conclusions are being contested by members and former members of the Garda.</p><p>There are 41 Bills to be produced in this session of the D&aacute;il.  Two of those will become law before the summer.  One deals with whistleblowers and the other deals with freedom of information.  I say to Senator Daly that, unfortunately, these were matters that had been around for a very long time.  The legislative agenda of the D&aacute;il and Seanad is crowded enough.  I accept and I would have liked to see a more even flow of legislation coming through in the first weeks but between the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and the complex issues that arise in many pieces of legislation, the Senator's assumption that one might be able to produce the legislation by X date does not always stand up.  We have changed the rules in that when heads of Bills are approved by Cabinet they then go to the committees for public consultation.  There is engagement with civic society and the committees bring in the letter writers to the newspapers, groups, associations and organisations to give their view and to get the best analysis we can from members of the public on what is their country and the laws that should apply to them.  To get that right takes a more comprehensive and thorough approach but it probably takes a little longer.  The old way of dealing with legislation is no more.  That in itself is an element of a democratic resolution of which I am very proud as so many new voices, issues and dissenting voices can be heard in the process of the analysis of legislation.  Such things are important.  The Bills on whistleblowers and freedom of information will come through the Seanad.</p><p>People can be criticised for failures to measure up to perfect management.  I am not by any means perfect but I appreciate that what we want out of this is a Garda force that is respected, has integrity and is seen to be competent, professional and transparent in the way it goes about its work.  The men and women who serve in that force need to understand and have a sense of pride in their work as the only barrier between criminal activities and law-abiding citizens.  It is the responsibility of Government to see that they are given the facilities to do the job we charge them to do through many different sectors of society.</p><p>Senator Zappone mentioned transparency and urgency.  I hope that in the analysis of the way he goes about his work, Mr. Justice Fennelly will move through the investigation in whatever way he thinks appropriate with as much speed as possible.  Between the commission of investigation and the decision to have a new process for the selection and appointment of a competent person to be the Garda Commissioner - the Government decision was in fact was a joint proposition by both parties in government in 2006 - we will have a statutory independent authority for the future.  Out of all of the culture shocks and very difficult, intractable and complex situations we will get a new regime in terms of the structure, running, presentation, personnel and movement through An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We need answers to those questions from our justice system.  If I were to read out what arrived on my desk in the past fortnight one would say it is very difficult to know whether the allegations made are true, false or will stand up.  We must define who is responsible for determining that.  I could come to the Seanad and say we need another half dozen inquiries but I must find the trail that led to these allegations to see whether they were investigated and if they stand up or not.  It is all part of having clarity about the rights of citizens and the rights of people who serve in agencies, organisations and authorities as well to be able to do their job responsibly.</p><p>I commend the Senators for their contributions.  The commission of investigation and its terms of reference are very forthright and comprehensive and they will allow Mr. Justice Fennelly to do the kind of job I know he can do in the interests of the country.</p></speech>

This matter relates to the appointment of an ambassador from the US to Ireland.  Since coming into office for his second term, the US President, Mr. Obama, has not yet appointed an ambassador to this country.  This has been the longest gap since 1927.  There are only 14 countries to which the US has not appointed an ambassador, the Arctic Council, Belarus, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Egypt, Eritrea, France, Guatemala, Romania, Russia, Sudan, Syria and Venezuela.  Some of those, one could say, are not the most glamorous of locations and possibly quite dangerous.  With others, there are political issues between them and the United States which might explain why no ambassador has been appointed.</p><p>When it comes to Ireland, however, it is somewhat disappointing for us that we are drifting into the third year with no ambassador from a country which we hold in high esteem, in which we have so many citizens and which has so many people with Irish heritage.  Previous ambassadors have played significant roles in the Northern Ireland peace process, particularly Jean Kennedy Smith.  Now, in the North the Haass talks have broken down and the engagement of the United States is critically important.  Having an ambassador on this side of the Border would be critical in ensuring the success of future talks.  What has been raised by the Department to ensure there will be a US ambassador appointed before the next St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day?</p></speech>

The former ambassador, Mr. Dan Rooney, completed his mission to Ireland on 14 December 2012.  Pending the nomination of his successor, the deputy head of mission at the US embassy is acting in the capacity of <i>charg&eacute; d'affaires</i>, <i>ad interim</i>.  He and his colleagues at the embassy are in frequent contact with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on a broad range of issues of mutual concern.<br />While the appointment of a new ambassador is a matter for the sending state to initiate, and we are conscious that the process for ambassadorial nomination and appointment is rigorous and lengthy, the T&aacute;naiste is keen to see that process concluded as soon as possible and to welcoming and working with the new US ambassador to Ireland at the earliest opportunity.  It is a matter to which the Government attaches considerable importance.  The Taoiseach raised the issue with the US President, Mr. Obama, in their discussions during his St. Patrick's Day visit to Washington DC last month.<br />Members will agree with me that it is only fitting that there be a resident US ambassador to Ireland to reflect the extraordinary strength and depth of the relationship that exists between our two countries.  That relationship is evident in so many ways.  For example, the US is home to our largest and most powerful diaspora of approximately 36 million people.  It is our most important source of foreign direct investment, as well as one of our top sources of investment, trade and tourists.  It remains an indispensable partner in the Northern Ireland peace process.  We will continue to work on the further development of all these aspects of our bilateral relationship with the United States.<br />The Government is in continuing contact with the US authorities on the appointment of a new US ambassador.  We expect that a nomination will be forthcoming in the near future.</p></speech>

It is unfortunate that the Minister of State with responsibility for this area, Deputy Tom Hayes, cannot attend the House this evening.  I am aware he had a prior engagement in Tipperary.  If grants were made available for replanting these private forests, it would work out to be cost-neutral.  Approximately 50,000 ha of forestry have been destroyed.  A replanting grant at &euro;800 per hectare would come to &euro;4 million.  The benefits of such a grant would create jobs and more carbon credits, both of which would offset any cost of the grants.  I hope my suggestion is looked upon favourably.  If the Government took a lead on this, it would be a positive news story, cost-neutral and bring benefits to rural communities through employment while increasing the State's carbon credits.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-04-16a.323" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/958" speakername="Brian Hayes" time="17:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014041600045#UU00600"><p>I thank Senator Sheahan for raising this matter.  The Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, is, unfortunately, unable to attend for which he send his apologies.</p><p>It is important to clarify what services are available to those affected and to set out what actions have been taken to date by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine with regard to the damage caused by the February storm.  Wind blow is not a new phenomenon to forestry and is one of the biggest problems facing plantations in this country.  The risk of wind blow is influenced by soil type, height of the trees and altitude.  Thinning, however, greatly increases the likelihood of wind blow.  On certain more vulnerable soil types, such as those which are located in exposed high altitude sites, thinning will increase the risk of wind blow by up to 80%.  It is accepted practice in some locations not to thin forests at all.  Plantations are at risk of becoming unstable after thinning, as removing some of the crop removes the wind firm edge of the forest, making the plantation more vulnerable to being blown over.</p><p>The scale of the wind blow in the February storms was certainly unexpected.  However, if we cast our minds back to the high winds and heavy rain we all experienced over the Christmas and into the new year, it would seem the winds of 12 February were the last straw for many forests.  While the extent of the damage is estimated to be less than 1% nationally, the damage is extensive at local level.  The south and parts of the midlands in particular have experienced significant damage where substantial quantities of timber have been blown over and entire forests in some cases have been completely levelled.</p><p>It is important that forest owners realise, however, that although their forests have suffered wind blow damage, there may well be significant value still to be realised from the plantation.  Also owners must take care to make the right decision in keeping those trees that remain standing or to clearfell the entire site.  This is not the time, therefore, to rush into making decisions on what to do next.  Instead, private forest owners should consult with forestry professionals either in Teagasc or with their local professional forester who can help them take the right course of action.</p> <p>A qualified forestry professional will meet owners on the ground and most importantly advise on health and safety issues when it comes to accessing the plantation and recovering the timber.  It is also important for owners to look into the possibility of co-operating with adjacent forest owners.  Lower recovery costs can be achieved and higher prices offered where forest owners achieve economies of scale by working together.<br />Events have also been organised by Teagasc and the Irish Timber Growers Association in conjunction with Coillte on wind-blow plantations.  I believe the first of these happened in Kilkenny last week on 8 April attended by 200 people.  Other events were organised in Castleisland in County Kerry and I know there was a significant amount of damage in north County Kerry and west County Limerick.<br />The Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine is facilitating those wishing to apply for felling licences to deal with the situation in the most appropriate manner.  In this regard the Department has asked forest owners to make their applications at the time of storm damage to allow it to be prioritised by the Department.  While direct funding is not being provided at present to those whose forests were destroyed in the storm, a task force chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, has been established to assess the damage nationally and to quickly identify the various issues arising as a result of this serious wind-blow event and to agree on a course of action to deal with these issues.  The assessment of the damage will be carried out by Coillte staff.  The forest industry, Coillte, the IFA and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine have all committed to jointly fund this assessment using high-resolution satellite imagery.  The result of this assessment will give accurate maps of damaged areas and allow the Department to review all policies on wind blow.<br />The task force has issued a guidance note for forest owners laying down the steps to consider in safely harvesting and selling the fallen trees and giving advice on a range of other associated issues.  The guidance note is also published on the Department's website.  The Department also has set up a dedicated e-mail address, <i>wind-blow@agriculture.gov.ie</i>, for any queries on the issue.  Any forestry premium payments that have not yet been paid for 2014 will be paid even if these forests have been affected by this wind-blow event.</p></speech>

I am glad that forestry payments will not be affected for those whose plantations have been destroyed and that there will be no trimming of that.  Much of this forestry is 15 or 20 years into a 30-year lifespan and so the value is minimal.  The cost of the harvesting will probably be as much as will be achieved in selling the product because it is only half way there.</p><p>The Minister of State made a valid point.  People in the industry have told me that our forests lack good drainage, which may be one reason for the extent of the wind damage.  I thank the Minister of State for the reply and I hope that another day - beidh l&aacute; eile - funding may be made available for this.</p></speech>

Teagasc, the IDA and all industry representatives are involved.  If there has to be movement on this as set out by the Senator, it would have to come from that task force.  I will ensure that the Senator's contribution to this debate will be sent to the task force and it might reply directly to him as to whether it would consider direct compensation.  There may be cases where people have insurance.  At the very least a full assessment of the damage needs to be concluded as speedily as possible and the satellite images might help in that regard.  The task force should look at the issue and I will ensure that the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, is made aware of the Senator's comments.</p></speech>

I wish to outline the rationale for a credit union bond and to ask the Minister for Finance to initiate negotiations towards introducing one.  I know this is also an area of interest for the Minister of State.</p><p>I have visited many credit unions in Galway city and county, and in doing so have learned a considerable amount.  I have come to the conclusion that the Government needs to look again at credit unions and open its mind to the potential for a win-win by working differently with credit unions.  It should initiate negotiations with the Irish League of Credit Unions to produce a credit union bond.</p><p>I will outline the realities as I have learned them.  Credit union loan books are shrinking and their main income is charging interest on money they lend.  The opposite is happening with loan books shrinking and the investment pot is getting bigger.  They then have to invest that money somewhere and are getting incredibly poor interest rates.  Funds not loaned out are invested in bank deposits, Government bonds or other financial products at very low rates of between 0.5% and 1%.</p><p>Credit union funds were attractive to banks at one point because the banks did not need to hold them liquid.  They were treated like fixed deposits until Basel III changed the status of credit union deposits so as to require banks to hold them liquid, therefore attracting less interest.  A report published in May 2013 showed that because of Basel III, credit unions lost &euro;58 million in deposit interest.</p><p>Credit unions are now transferring their funds out of Ireland into European banks.  For example, Athenry Credit Union, a very successful credit union, now has funds invested in KBC in Belgium.  Credit unions have lots of funds in Ireland at the moment but these could potentially leave the country.  It is estimated that they have about &euro;8 billion in deposits, of which about &euro;2 billion is now invested outside Ireland.  Investments are getting larger and loans are getting smaller.  The loan-investment ratio is about 2:1 - in other words only half their pot of money is lent out in loans.</p><p>Credit unions would like to see a bond, guaranteed by the Government which complies with Central Bank regulations and offers an element of liquidity with a return better than we are receiving on the market.  I ask the Minister of State to explain why this is happening.  At the moment the Government borrows money, probably at about 3%, and the credit unions have &euro;8 billion they could lend to the Government if they got a rate better than 0.5% to 1%.  It seems like a no-brainer to me.  I know liquidity needs to be built into that and that there need to be terms and conditions, but why is the Government not prepared to do business with the credit unions?  In setting up a bond the Government could borrow money.  While &euro;8 billion will not meet its needs, it is not bad.  We have narrowed our deficit greatly.  If the Government offered credit unions 2% rather than the 1% they are getting, it could save itself 1.4% in interest rates.</p><p>I will give a specific example.  In January 2014 the Government offered a ten-year bond at a rate of 3.4% and Athenry Credit Union bought &euro;8 million worth of that bond.  So there is a discrepancy here.  This came to mind when I was visiting the credit unions at the time the flooding was taking place - an issue close to the Minister of State's heart.  We know the bill for repairing the damage created by the flooding could be &euro;300 million or even more.  St. Anthony's and Claddagh Credit Union in Galway city was willing to lend this money to the Government.  It trusts the Government which is great to hear.  It would prefer to keep its money local and in Ireland if it was just able to get a slightly higher interest rate than it is getting.</p><p>Since then I have learned that credit unions are looking to the international banks.  Why has the Government not entered into negotiations with the Irish League of Credit Unions which is open to do this?  Will it do it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-04-16a.328" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/958" speakername="Brian Hayes" time="17:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014041600047#WW00100"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  She is aware that the Government established the Commission on Credit Unions in May 2011.  The Government also published an agreed final report in March 2012 and has accepted fully the commission's recommendations.  Over 60 of its recommendations are being rolled out under the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act.  The legislation contains measures which will reform and strengthen credit unions and deals with four broad areas, namely: prudential regulation; governance; restructuring, including the establishment of the credit union restructuring board called ReBo; and of course stabilisation.<br />During the passage of the Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas there was extensive engagement and debate on the subject of credit union investments.  Partly in response to the debate in this House, an amendment was made to the Bill to include a specific reference to credit unions investing in projects of a public nature.  I recall, although I did not take it here, that I took Report Stage for the Minister for Finance in the other House and remember bringing forward the amendment myself, following the debate that occurred in this House.<br />The Commission on Credit Unions Implementation Group was set up to monitor progress on implementation of the recommendations.  Membership of the group includes the credit union representative bodies and the Registrar of Credit Unions and it is chaired by the Department of Finance.  The group reports to the Minister for Finance directly and quarterly on its progress.<br />As part of the implementation of the commission's report, investments in State projects for credit unions, which was raised by the Senator, was added to the agenda of the Commission on Credit Unions implementation group in the second half of 2013.  That was due to the fact that when the commission was initiated this was not an issue.  It was not raised as a result of the recommendations and only came about as a result of the debate in both Houses of the Oireachtas, and correctly as a result of that debate.<br />The Department of Finance invited credit union representative bodies to bring forward proposals for credit union investments in State projects.  Proposals were received from the Irish League of Credit Unions and the Credit Union Development Association.  The Department of Finance facilitated engagement between the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Credit Union Development Association, the Central Bank and the NTMA to see if the suggestion of a specific credit union bond could be progressed.<br />A number of issues were raised regarding the possibility of a credit union bond.  They were as follows: that a bond would not be liquid, as credit unions would only be able to sell to other credit unions and, therefore, there would be a very limited market for disposals; it would not be optimal for the NTMA to structure bonds for separate areas of Government policy, for example housing and schools, rather than funding more generally because when we go to the market we go for a specific amount of money which we then use for specific purposes as against for purposes by themselves; and any proposal for a bond which would be callable before maturity date and would affect the total return on the bond with the yield reducing accordingly.  A number of alternative approaches were explored as follows: investing in sovereign bonds for a long-term investments of say ten years; and using short-term products, for example Exchequer notes or similar, for short-term investment.  These may have a very low rate of return but are callable at any time.<br />On foot of the NTMA engagement, credit union representative bodies were asked to reflect on the issues raised regarding a credit union bond.  They have been invited to consider the next steps, including an alternative proposal under which credit unions could invest in State projects.  Any such proposals would need to be approved by the Registrar of Credit Unions.  In 2006 the Registrar of Credit Unions issued a guidance note on investment limits for credit unions investing in Irish and EMU State Securities as follows: maturity date shall not exceed ten years; not be more than 30% of holding shall be held in bonds maturing after seven years; and holding shall not exceed 70% of the total value of the credit union's investment portfolio.  Most of the proposals would meet the criteria in these cases.  Any proposals, therefore, will have to be in line with this guidance and considered in the context of the tiered regulatory approach.<br />The Commission on Credit Unions made recommendations for a tiered regulatory approach which could see some credit unions take on a more sophisticated business model with increased regulatory requirements.  The Central Bank is proposing a two category approach to the introduction of a tiered regulatory approach for the credit union sector.<br />Under the proposals currently being considered category 1 credit unions would be limited to basic investments and Government bonds within specified limits.  Credit unions that are capable of, and wish to undertake a wider range of activities and services, could apply to become a category 2 credit union.  This category would allow for a wider range of investments with longer maturities and in Government bonds, along with the ability to offer certain additional services.  Category 2 credit unions will be subject to additional regulatory requirements, as one would expect, given the fact that the risk would be higher. <br />The Central Bank held an informal consultation process with all credit union stakeholders on their proposal for a tiered regulatory approach.  Consultation Paper CP76 was published on the Central Bank's website on 23 December 2013 and closing date for receipt of submissions was the end of March 2014.  A further consultation and regulatory impact assessment is to follow later this year.<br /><b></b>I wish to assure the Senator that both the Minister and his officials in the Department of Finance will continue to work with the representative bodies to explore and find alternative ways for credit unions to invest in State projects.  I look forward to hearing from them in respect of alternative proposals that they may have on the matter.<br />Finally, I thank the House for giving me an opportunity to discuss this important issue and allowing me to put on record the work that has taken place behind the scenes with credit unions.  This issue has not been left in abeyance.  On the contrary, a lot of work has already occurred, as I think Senators will see from my remarks here this evening.  We now have a broad proposal to make about two tiers of credit unions which could pitch for investments.  What is required now is a wider engagement to see if we can tease out those issues through the various different bodies.  </p></speech>

The legislation has only gone through a while ago.  As I said in my speech, we have already had two very substantial consultations and we have now reached broad agreement about the tiered approach required.  There is absolute support in Government to make this a reality.  The proof is the very lengthy and good discussions that we have had on the matter at all Stages in both Houses.  It takes time to get a product into the field.  There is absolute commitment to it from the Minister for Finance and his departmental officials because they report to him on a quarterly basis on the progress that has been made following the enactment of the legislation and the commission itself to see if we can make this happen.</p><p>I am confident that over the course of the next few months that we will get a more sophisticated and exacting proposal from the credit union sector.  It could deal with the regulatory issues that have been set out by the NTMA and the Central Bank and the potential risk issue which is one of the reasons the commission first reported.  I do not see this issue as something that will be left in abeyance and not followed up and reported.  I think that we are going to make progress but it will take a little bit more time before the issue will be brought to fruition.</p></speech>
