The 2015 Mental Health Commission inspection report referred to various areas of compliance and excellent standards, with many good practices on display.  It appears that the hospital and, in particular, its staff are working to a high level and providing an excellent service within the confines of the resources given to them.  The hospital was described in the report as:</p><blockquote>The approved centre was an inpatient service of the National Forensic Service.  It was located in Dundrum Dublin and had 94 beds ... The main building was over 150  years old and was not suitable for the care and treatment of mental health patients.  Plans for the new forensic hospital were progressing.</blockquote> <p>The plans will be now be realised on the site at Portrane.  Will the Minister of State confirm that the opening date will be 2020?</p><p>I would like to discuss the facilities in place for violent, mentally ill people while we await the new hospital.  <i>The Irish Times </i>reported on 21 June that Professor Harry Kennedy, the clinical director, had told the High Court that all 94 beds in the Central Mental Hospital were full and that there was a waiting list of 24.  He said that while mental hospitals in Ireland had been closed down, the necessary services were not being provided to look after people who had been detained in them.  This sentiment was echoed by my old colleague and the former general secretary of the Psychiatric Nurses Association, PNA, Mr. Des Kavanagh, in his report earlier this year.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator M&aacute;ire Devine:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2468"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2468&amp;amp;pid=MaireDevine&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=19"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->He stated, &quot;the correlation between the closure of hospitals and the increase in the prison population of people with serious mental illness is inescapable.&quot;  He continued by discussing regular cases of violence and, indeed, homicide involving those who are mentally ill.  He urged the Government to review all such killings and assaults over the past ten years and come up with recommendations for a prevention strategy.<br/><br/>The Mental Health Commission's inspection report in 2015 found that:</p><blockquote>There were eight units in the approved centre [at the Central Mental Hospital] and this allowed the male patients to progress from acute care with high security through medium to low security and rehabilitation.  However, all ten female patients were accommodated in one unit, whatever their level of acuity, security requirements and rehabilitation needs.</blockquote><p>Does the Minister for Health think that the opening of the extra beds in the period prior to the new hospital being opened would improve these conditions?  The report also states:</p><blockquote>Due to the waiting list of seven patients in other approved centres [never mind prisons] awaiting transfer ... plans were progressing to renovate and re-open a closed unit (Unit 5) to provide 10 beds for these patients.  The completion date for this was the end of 2015.</blockquote><p>The beds in question are ready, duvets have been placed on them and yet they lie empty.  Mental health institutions have been closed down and nothing substantial has replaced them.  As a result, the rare but real cases of people with mental illness who have violent inclinations have slipped through the gaps and caused real harm in our society and to themselves.<br/><br/>I have a few questions for the Minister.  Has the Central Mental Hospital reopened the ten beds?  If not, why?  How does he intend to rectify the current crisis in the period prior to the facility in Portrane being opened?<br/><br/>I have spoken to various staff and learned that negotiations have been held up due the fact that decisions handed down by the Workplace Relations Commission in 2012 have not been implemented.  I ask that the Minister intervene in order to get the negotiations going.  I urge him to bring people to the table and to get these beds open.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-07-19a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1314" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017071900002#B00200"><p>I thank Senator Devine for raising this matter, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for Health who, unfortunately, cannot be with us.</p> <p>The Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum has a current bed complement of 93.  All of these beds are operational.  It is a priority under the HSE's service plan for 2017 to increase bed capacity at the hospital.  An additional ten beds to accommodate patients awaiting admission under section  21(2) of the Mental Health Act 2001 are due to be commissioned shortly, which will increase capacity to 103 beds.  The additional beds remain unopened pending agreement between the executive and the relevant unions on issues that have been through a process at the Workplace Relations Commission.  I understand that these are likely to be referred to the Labour Relations Commission for adjudication.  At this point, it is not possible to give a precise date for the additional beds to open.  The executive is continuing efforts to open them in the autumn.  I urge all involved with this process to work together to open these beds as quickly as  possible.</p> <p>It has been accepted generally for some time that there are serious bed capacity pressures at the Central Mental Hospital.  It is on this basis that the HSE prioritised the opening of more beds.  The  management of those requiring admission is being prioritised on the basis of assessed clinical need.  The provision of new facilities, or other non-capital initiatives, to enhance forensic mental  health provision nationally is core to modernising mental health services in line with A Vision for Change.  To date, significant ring-fenced funding has been provided to improve all aspects of mental health care, including prioritising the replacement of the Central Mental Hospital.  This has resulted in a total funding of just over &euro;850,000 to the HSE for mental health for this year.</p> <p>Following the signing of a contract on 1 June, construction of a new 170-bed national forensic mental health complex at Portrane recently began.  This facility will replace the Central  Mental Hospital in Dundrum.  It will also include dedicated components for mental health and intellectual disability, a forensic child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, and a new 30-bed intensive care rehabilitation unit.  The new national facility will provide psychiatric care in a modern and high-quality setting that rivals the best available elsewhere.</p> <p>A core approach is developing the concept of recovery, wherever possible, in delivering mental health services - whether in community or residential settings - into the future.  The operation of the additional beds at the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum will assist towards this objective.  It will relieve the acknowledged pressures on the existing forensic mental health and judicial systems.  It also paves the way to opening the new facilities in early 2020.  The Senator may rest assured that I will keep this matter under close review with the HSE or that I will refer the issues to the Minister, Deputy Harris, in order that all of the parties involved in the current process reach agreement as quickly as possible in the interests of those that require this key service.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, no date has been given in terms of the negotiations at the Workplace Relations Commission.  The stalemate has lasted a year and a half at this stage.</p> <p>Does the Minister of State understand that there are people who cannot be managed in approved centres and people in prison who are waiting to avail of the new facility?  A tragedy occurred in my area, which is located in the constituency of Dublin South-Central, last week.  The person involved cannot be admitted to the Central Mental Hospital due to overcrowding.  To free up space, the institution would have to pick somebody to return to the prison population but he or she would clearly be unfit to be moved.  We are not fulfilling our duty of care and nurses in particular are concerned about this matter.</p> <p>The HSE has agreed that the staff have made prudent demands.  Rosters were also implemented without a by your leave.  The days of draconian management are over.  Consultations and negotiations are required, which is the nub of the issue, but the Workplace Relations Commission will probably not meet for some months.  I urge the Minister of State to ask the Minister to hurry this matter along and get these much-needed beds opened.</p></speech>

I congratulate him on his appointment and wish him well.</p> <p>As he is undoubtedly aware, even though this matter is not his particular area, the Defence Forces are faced with many challenges.  One regularly hears about low morale, the recruitment and retention of staff and low pay.  It is sad that many members of the Defence Forces must avail of family income supplement, FIS, to simply survive.  With respect, not assigning a full Ministry to the defence portfolio sends out the wrong message.  The current Minister responsible for the Defence Forces is doing a good job but I would much prefer if he could sit at the Cabinet table as it would afford him an opportunity to exert more power and influence on his Cabinet colleagues.</p> <p>I have outlined many issues.  Recently, leave entitlements for members of the Defence Forces were brought to my attention.  At present, leave entitlements can be lost at the end of the year if a member of the Defence Forces who has been posted overseas for a mission has his or her term extended or if a member is on sick leave or falls pregnant.  The loss of leave is unfair and the situation should not be allowed to continue.  Interestingly, over the five-year period from 2001 to 2016, as many as 146,038 days were lost by members of the Defence Forces.  That is a staggering figure.  In monetary terms, the amount involved would be &euro;22 million.  I am sure that the Minister of State appreciates that people in any employment can get sick or fall pregnant.  It is very sad that in such situations people lose their annual leave allotments if they are out sick at the time they were about to take their annual leave.  People, through no fault of their own, can find themselves in these situations.  The leave entitlement aspect needs to be addressed.  Does the Minister intend to amend the Workplace Relations Act 2015?  If so, the terms and conditions enjoyed by all workers could be enjoyed by the members of the Defence Forces, which is the least they deserve.  There is a lack of respect for the Defence Forces and the leave entitlement issue is just another example.  I am interested in hearing the comments that the Minister of State will make.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-07-19a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1314" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017071900002#B01000"><p>I thank Senator Gallagher for raising this matter, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Deputy Kehoe, who, as a super junior Minister, sits at Cabinet.  The Taoiseach has full responsibility for defence matters and sits at the Cabinet table so such matters are well covered.</p> <p>Defence Force Regulations, DFR, A11, governs the granting of leave, other than sick leave, in the Permanent Defence Force.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=19"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As part of normal personnel management, the granting of annual leave is a balance between the entitlement of the individual to annual leave and the requirement to ensure continuity of a public service.  Paragraph 16 of DFR A11 provides for the carrying forward of annual leave, not granted or availed of in the leave year concerned.  This can be of benefit both to the individual and the organisation.  Officers may be allowed to carry forward a maximum of 24 days, non-commissioned officers and privates in the Army and Air Corps a maximum of 19 days, and non-commissioned officers and ordinary or able seamen of the Naval Service a maximum of 24 days.  In addition, members are entitled to Defence Force holidays, which include all public holidays along with the 1916 Commemoration day, 11 July and 15 August.  The Minister is also authorised to grant such other days, usually in the form of additional days leave at Easter and Christmas, such as Holy Saturday and Easter Sunday, to the Defence Forces to reflect the leave allowable to other public servants who work on a five-day a week basis.</p><p>A request to increase the number of carryover days has been considered.  The current carryover has been found to be proportionate and reasonable.  I have been advised by Department of Defence officials that three plenary summonses have been taken by members of the Defence Forces in relation to the transposition of the working time directive and the carryover of annual leave.  Given that these matters are before the courts it would be inappropriate to comment further on the legal proceedings which have been commenced in this matter.</p><p>The conciliation and arbitration scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, provides a formal mechanism for the PDF representative associations, RACO and PDFORRA, to engage with the official side.  The purpose of the scheme is to provide a means for the determination of claims and proposals from the associations relating to remuneration and conditions of service.  It is open to the representative associations to submit claims to the official side in relation to matters falling within the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  Generally, claims relate to pay and conditions, award of allowances etc.  When submitted, these claims are generally the subject of negotiations and where agreement is not reached it is open to both sides to seek the assistance of an adjudicator to settle the matter.</p><p>The Minister has received representations from PDFORRA seeking to have access to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court made available to it in the event of any future legislative changes being made to provide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with access to same.  The proposals in relation to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na being granted such access will require detailed legislative change and the Department of Justice and Equality has established a working group to examine in detail what future legislative changes are required.  While present arrangements have worked well, it is intended to review the conciliation and arbitration scheme and the Minister has agreed that this should happen towards the end of this year.  This review will be informed by any future arrangements to be made for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p></speech>

There are many issues with which we must deal.  Some of them are complex and some are not of our making but their resolution will be very tricky and may take some time, both for the UK and European sides.  There are some, however, which I believe can be resolved quite early and quite simply, one of which is energy security.  Ireland is largely reliant on energy imports from the UK and, while I hope this continues, it would be prudent to secure our supply by looking further afield into the European Union.  The easiest way to do this is by the completion of the Celtic Interconnector.  The EU designation of this project as one of common interest, meaning it has been allocated 50% of funding in the past week, is welcome and we need to grab the bull by the horns and bring the project to fruition as quickly as possible.  We need to work with our counterparts in France and the wider EU so that we will have the option of getting an energy supply from France as well as the UK.</p> <p>I ask the Minister to outline what stage the application is at for the foreshore licence to land the line in Ireland, and what dealings have been held by EirGrid and its French counterparts in RTE.  How is the Government working with its counterparts in France and the European Commission to bring this project to fruition?</p></speech>

I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten.</p> <p>Interconnection is viewed as critical infrastructure by the European Commission in order to move to a genuinely integrated electricity market.  This is reflected in national policy through the White Paper on energy, published in December 2015.  The Celtic Interconnector is a &euro;1 billion electricity interconnector jointly proposed by EirGrid and its French counterparts, the French transmission system operator, Reseau de Transport d&rsquo;&Eacute;lectricit&eacute;, RT&Eacute;.  It is proposed as a 500 MW to 700 MW high-voltage direct current line that will run from the north-west coast of France to Ireland&rsquo;s south coast, coming onshore at either Cork, Waterford or Wexford.  At this scale it would be able to provide electricity for some 450,000 homes.</p> <p>In July 2016, together with the Taoiseach and the then President of France, Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande, the Minister, Deputy Naughten, was present at the signing of a memorandum of understanding between EirGrid and RTE.  This marked the completion of the feasibility phase of the project and was an agreement between the two organisations to move to the current phase.</p> <p>The feasibility phase of the project was a two-year process, part funded by the EU&rsquo;s connecting Europe facility, CEF, programme.  It concluded in mid-2016.  A suite of marine surveys and marine engineering studies was carried out, as well as the identification of possible landing sites and preliminary economic and other assessments.  This phase provided the information required to determine that there was sufficient justification for EirGrid and RTE to proceed to the current phase of the project.  This current phase of the project comprises an indepth economic assessment of the project, technical and environmental studies and pre-consultation in preparation for permit granting procedures in France and Ireland.  Last month the project was awarded further funding of &euro;4 million from the CEF to support the delivery of this phase of the project.  Around the middle of next year EirGrid and RTE are expected to seek regulatory approval for the development of the project, with a final investment decision to be taken in 2020.  The construction of the project would be expected to be completed circa 2025.</p> <p>The Celtic Interconnector project has the potential to provide a reliable high-capacity electricity link between Ireland and France that would have significant benefits for the people of Ireland.  The project would provide access to the European electricity market, leading to expected increased competition and lower prices in Ireland.  It would also improve security of electricity supply and facilitate increased capacity for renewable energy here via access to the mainland European market.  As the Senator said, in the context of Brexit it is hugely important that we have an additional interconnector to the one we have with the UK.  I hope we will see progress on it and that it can be provided for by 2025.</p></speech>

The issue has been raised by my colleague, Deputy Robert Troy, in the D&aacute;il by way of parliamentary question in the past 13 months but no progress has been made.  Deputy Robert Troy has been told consistently that the legislation is imminent, yet the Minister does not seem to know whether primary legislation or a statutory instrument is required to transpose the EU regulation.  Today we learned from a senior figure in the airline industry that the delay apparently was in the Office of the Attorney General, which has yet to sign off on a statutory instrument.  This seems to be the second time the Office of the Attorney General has been used as an excuse for the Government's failure to implement legislation.  We know that the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill has been held up conveniently in the Office of the Attorney General.  It is also strange, given that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has its own legal section.  Why has the issue not been dealt with by that section.  It is a disgrace that in the wake of Brexit and for the purpose of achieving economic growth the second runway has not been constructed.  It is vital for the development of the city and its surrounds.  The Minister has failed us again and should be called to the House to explain exactly how he proposes to allow the legislation to be brought before the House to enable the construction of the second runway to proceed.</p> <p>The second issue I wish to raise concerns the report of the Committee of Public Accounts which was published yesterday.  I call on the Minister for Justice and Equality to attend the House to explain how he will act on the recommendations made in the report.  Serious concerns about the Department of Justice and Equality's oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were raised.  The Department has presided over serious financial and governance irregularities in the force in recent years.  The report is also sceptical about the Department's lack of awareness of the irregularities in Templemore.  The Minister needs to commence an internal review, not just of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but also of his Department, especially of the reporting structures between it and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is not enough to just note the contents of the report.  The Committee of Public Accounts has raised serious questions in its report and action is needed now by the Minister.</p></speech>

This morning I listened to a BBC radio programme which covered the plight of those arriving in Italy and the circumstances in which they were being kept.  The Minister of State at the Department of Defence should come to the House at some point to update us on what is happening at European and inter-armed forces level to devise a real strategy to deal with these issues.  If the way into Europe is to have a tide of people crossing in boats that are wholly unsuitable, with many of them losing their lives, and if part of that scene is their rescue on a humanitarian basis and being brought to Italy, there are huge problems not merely for Italy but also for the entire Continent of Europe, with which the Minister of State should deal.</p> <p>We are coming to the end of this term of the Seanad and I am anxious that progress be made in debating the Seanad Reform Bill that was placed before the House.  There are many views on it, but they could be accommodated in the debate.  I have never heard of a chamber that was afraid of debating a Bill.  We should get on with debating the Bill.  The former Taoiseach wrote to my group on 8 December 2016 stating the Government, comprising Fine Gael and the Independent Alliance, was committed to the establishment of an implementation group to oversee implementation of the reforms and that A Programme for a Partnership Government contained a commitment to progress them.  He then proposed that we establish an implementation group and seek the nomination of persons from both Houses of the Oireachtas to it, but nothing has really happened since.  Another eight months have passed since that letter was written, which, itself, came late in the day.  I, therefore, propose an amendment to the Order of Business that No. 47, non-Government motion No. 23, be taken before No. 1 and that the motion be dealt with by the House in short order.  It reads: "That Seanad &Eacute;ireann resolves that provision should be made for Committee Stage of the Seanad Bill 2016 to be debated in Government time during the autumn term 2017".<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=19"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is not an exorbitant demand.  It is merely aimed at ensuring that we should get on with the business in order that everybody would have an opportunity to express his or her views.  Whether people are in favour of emigrant votes or whatever, they can express their views and the Bill can be amended accordingly.  The legislation will not be in operation in time for the next general election so people in this House who fear the implications as to their immediate survival should rest assured that when this Bill is passed, there will be at least one further general election before it comes into operation.</p></speech>

I want to raise a key recommendation of the Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services, namely, equality for those of us on group water schemes.  Equity was clearly recommended in the report of the Expert Commission on the Future Funding of Domestic Public Water Services.  It is not good enough that many low-income households in rural Ireland are obliged, as matters stand, to continue to pay twice for water.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has said that he will refund the water charges, which will cost &euro;170 million.  It would only cost a fraction of that to provide for group water schemes.  That is why Sinn F&eacute;in, in its last alternative budget, set aside &euro;1.5 million to achieve this.  Why has such a key recommendation of both the expert commission and the committee not yet been implemented?  There must be equality between those members of group water schemes and those accessing public services.  The key difference is that the group water schemes receive an annual subsidy of &euro;70 per household but this subsidy does not cover the full annual cost of accessing the water supply.  Those connected to the public water supply and who are customers of Irish Water do not pay an annual charge for accessing this supply.  Equity would mean that the State would cover the full annual cost of the group water scheme users accessing that water supply.  The submission of the National Federation of Group Water Schemes to the committee showed the experience and the extraordinary voluntary effort that goes into every scheme.  This is often neglected in the debate relating to the supply of water.</p> <p>Another important matter is the need for a proper and timely programme to be put in place to facilitate the takeover of the schemes that request for this to happen.  This is taking far too long and the schemes have been left in the dark as to when the necessary upgrades and takeovers will happen.  We urgently need an absolute guarantee from the Minister and his Department that the legislation due in September will deal with the issue of group water schemes and will implement fully the recommendations of the expert group and the committee.  I am seeking an assurance that group water schemes will be included under that legislation.</p></speech>

This is just one of a slew of drilling expeditions recently permitted by the Minister, with the North Celtic Sea basin off the coast of Cork and the Kish Bank off Dalkey's Forty Foot swimming spot next in line.  The company will drill for 45 to 60 days throughout the summer without a strategic environmental assessment having been carried out.  In a desperate plea for investment, it states that it expects to find 5 billion barrels of oil.  Has the Minister thought about the impact of these drilling expeditions from a social, environmental and economic point of view?  In June 1991, the Government declared all Irish waters to be a whale and dolphin sanctuary, the first of its kind in Europe, but the seismic blasts from exploration and drilling are deadly for these mammals because they give rise to disorientation, deafness and internal bleeding over distances of up to 100 miles.  A deaf whale is a dead whale.  One blast also kills 64% of zooplankton, which is the basis of the marine ecosystem, for up to 0.7 miles.  We cannot afford to look for any more fossil fuels.  International climate experts warn that 80% of known fossil fuels must stay in the ground in order that we might avoid going over the safe 2<sup>o</sup>Celsius limit in respect of global warming.  The Minister recently spoke to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and IMPACT on the need for a just transition to a low-carbon economy.  In banning fracking and working on climate action, the Minister claims that he would protect workers in Bord na M&oacute;na, farmers and tourism but he shows that he has no intention of protecting the transition or providing a consistent policy with regard to green investment.  In complete doublespeak, he is inviting the destruction of our coastal fishing, marine resources and tourism industries and a marine ecosystem for one of the lowest Government tax takes for oil and gas in the world.  Extraction of oil and gas from the Irish Sea is not even profitable.  Shell Oil recently left the Corrib gas field with a loss of &euro;2 billion.  The granting of these licences is a slap in the face for young Irish people.  A peer-reviewed study published yesterday in the journal <i>Earth System Dynamics</i>argues that if massive emissions reductions do not begin soon, the burden placed on young people to extract CO<sub>2</sub>emitted by prior generations may become implausibly difficult and costly.  This new fossil fuel infrastructure investment will lock Ireland into a completely discredited economic model that serves neither the planet nor its people and that is built on a form of fuel that is fast becoming irrelevant.  This shows inconsistency and incompetence on the part of a Minister and a Department named in honour of climate action and environment.  I recently made amendments to the fracking legislation to ban offshore fracking and all fossil fuel exploration and these received a great response in the House.</p></speech>

I think Senator Higgins is seconding the amendment but I would be happy to do so if required.  It is important that Government time should be allocated to debating the Seanad Bill in the autumn and I am very happy to support that.</p> <p>I also propose that we take No. 21, the Education (Welfare) (Amendment) Bill 2017 today.  This is an important Bill on education proposed by Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in.  I know the Senator will second my amendment to the Order of Business.</p> <p>I support Senator Ardagh's request that the Minister for Justice and Equality come to the House to discuss the findings of the report of the Committee of Public Accounts into the financial irregularities at the Garda Training College in Templemore.  These were very serious findings, particularly in respect of the Garda Commissioner.  Many members of the committee, particularly Deputy Kelly, have called for the Commissioner to resign.  I think her position is untenable following the publication of that report.  However, the report also discloses serious failings in the Department of Justice and Equality in respect of its oversight of policing practices, particularly those in Templemore.  It would be useful if the Minister came before the Seanad to discuss those failings on the part of the Department and how the relatively newly-established Policing Authority might best be equipped to take on a stronger oversight role and, in particular, to have a part to play in the appointment of a new Commissioner.  </p> <p>Today, a long overdue report that was in the possession of the Department of Justice and Equality for two years has been published.  This is the report conducted by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs on children's experiences in direct provision.  It contains some very serious findings, notably that children in direct provision are concerned for their safety, particularly where they see single men seeking asylum being housed alongside families, and really serious problems with the system in terms of food provision.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=19"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I also welcome the forthcoming publication at noon today of the national mitigation plan by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.

While Members often think of cyber bullying as a significant threat to young people, the study finds that face-to-face bullying remains the most common form of bullying among teenagers.  According to the study, cyber bullying is best understood as a new avenue to victimise those already being bullied in traditional ways rather than a way to pick new victims.  Whether the method of bullying is through social media or more traditional forms at school and at work, Members should take every opportunity to say it should stop.</p> <p>In that context, I bring to the attention of the House an initiative called I'm a Friend started in the midlands by a man named Charlie Wynne.  It is a simple initiative aimed at creating a support community for those being bullied.  Its mission is to create a more thoughtful, caring society where friends look out for friends.  By wearing the I'm a Friend pin, a person supporting the initiative's ideals make a proud statement that he or she does not agree with bullying behaviour or accept that it is okay to bully others or be bullied by others and that he or she will support the victims of bullying in any way possible.  In a similar way to the statement the wearing of a Pioneer pin makes about the wearer, it is hoped that wearing the symbol will spread the message to others.</p> <p>As a person who has been on the receiving end of a barrage of vile personal abuse, I know how it feels to be bullied.  During the most recent general election campaign, I was targeted by several people on social media who were too cowardly to talk to me face to face and thought it was okay to personally insult and attack me.  I chose to ignore the comments at the time but the bombardment of insults continued.  Thankfully, I have the wherewithal to stand up to such bullies.  Members should take every opportunity to say that bullying should stop.  I'm a Friend is one way to do that.  It does not claim to be a solution to all bullying but might be of assistance to some victims.  I am informing Members of this organisation in order that they can look it up further.  I will endeavour to provide Members with a pin and I hope that every Member will wear it and set an example for others.</p></speech>

It is a great initiative that would bring transparency for those behind the camera as well as those in front of it.  It is widely used across Europe with very positive feedback.  The London Metropolitan Police Service has deployed approximately 22,000 cameras on its members and has experienced very positive results such as greater transparency in relation to detections and, interestingly, a drop in the number of fictitious complaints against members of the police force.  I ask the Leader to mention this to the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, in order that a similar initiative be deployed in this country.</p> <p>I compliment students of DCU and Trinity College Dublin on the initiative announced yesterday which involved the team creating several property websites to advertise the rent-a-room scheme.  As Members are aware, any householder can rent out a room and receive up to &euro;14,000 tax free, which is very welcome.  All Members know of the chronic shortage of accommodation that will arise in the coming months as students from every part of the country come to Dublin to seek a place to stay.  I encourage property owners and householders to consider the scheme and its merits and perhaps open their door to students from all parts of the country who are trying to find accommodation in order to further their studies.</p></speech>

I chaired the Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services.  One of its recommendations is that equality will prevail.  I hope that action will be taken in that regard and commend Senator Conway-Walsh for raising the issue.</p> <p>There was a very good discussion in the House yesterday with the Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy McHugh, regarding a 20-year plan and strategy for the Irish language.  He is committed to the strategy.  I mentioned that John Wayne once said that when one is on a dead horse, the best thing to do is to get off.  The Irish language plan is not working.  Over the past six years, there has been a 12% decrease in the number of people actively speaking Irish.  Article 8.1 of the Constitution enshrines the Irish language as the first official language of the State.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, to the House for a full debate lasting at least two hours in order that all Members can have an input into this very important area concerning who Irish people are and what we are about.  I ask the Leader if the debate could be had when the House reconvenes in September or as soon as possible thereafter.</p></speech>

All Stages should not be taken today.  The issue needs further reflection and consideration.  It breaks a very important Irish tradition and goes against health and anti-drink strategies and policies.  It is offensive to many religious groupings, will not assist tourism and is a bad proposition.  It is wrong and is threatening workers' rights.  The vast majority of publicans do not want it brought in.  I appeal to the Leader to allow more reflection on the matter and for it to run into the autumn, at which stage there can be a wiser consideration of it.  Members should not run willy-nilly to dismantle things that are important in this country.</p></speech>

Several Members will have seen correspondence received this week from the family resource centre in Loughrea.  There are 108 family resource centres doing amazingly important work across the country.  Several Members have probably visited some of them.  I was involved in arranging for workers in several family resource centres to join SIPTU.  Workers in family resource centres have not received a pay increase since 2008.  In view of the years of austerity, that can be understood to some degree.  What cannot be understood is the refusal of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, to attend the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, on this issue.  What signal does it send if State bodies refuse to engage with the industrial relations machinery of the State?  A bad example has been set by those at the very top of Government because when the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, was Minister for Social Protection, his Department refused to attend the Workplace Relations Commission in relation to SIPTU and community workers.  The refusal of Tusla to attend is totally unacceptable and workers in family resource centres deserve not just recognition and nice, kind words, but a pay increase.  At the very least, the Government and State bodies should have the respect to attend the Workplace Relations Commission.  I ask the Leader, a fellow trade unionist, to support my call for Tusla to attend the WRC and I ask for the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, to come to the House as early as possible in the autumn because there should not be a situation where vital workers providing vital services are ignored by the State and, worse than that, the industrial relations machinery of the State is also ignored by the Government.  It is not good enough.</p></speech>

We had a debate on this issue on the first day of this Seanad, when it was the first matter brought before the House.  Many of us stood on the plinth to propose the Bill on that first day.  This is the first Seanad after the public, in its wisdom, decided that it was interested in and engaged with the Seanad.  People wanted to be part of its deliberations and of the Seanad process.  They recognised its additional value.  They also wanted reform.  I strongly believe that there was a mandate for reform in the referendum.  When I campaigned on the doorsteps for the retention of the Seanad, people told me they wanted reform.</p> <p>The Government gave a commitment in the programme for Government that it would pursue the implementation of the Manning report as a priority.  Sadly, it has not been a priority.  It is one year later and there has not been any movement in this regard by the Government.  The very reasonable proposal put forward by Senator McDowell would give the Government the opportunity to show that it is serious about proceeding with the implementation of the Manning report and that it intends to work with Members across the House to ensure that people see genuine sincerity in politics with regard to Seanad reform.  There is scope on Committee Stage for people to put forward the concerns they may have by tabling amendments and debating them properly, as we should do as legislators.</p> <p>I urge the acceptance of the proposed amendment.  We should bear in mind that there have been two referendums on this issue, the one I mentioned earlier and the one on the 1979 amendment which has still not been implemented.  We have been waiting a long time for this.  We must be in good faith with the people of Ireland and ensure we respect their concerns on this issue.  We want them to be part of our process as a Seanad.</p></speech>

Outside, it is a soft morning in Dublin but, statistically, we have had 33% less rainfall in the first six months of this year.  People might think that this is good for tourism and so forth, but unfortunately the major knock-on effect is that communities in my part of the country and elsewhere are facing a water shortage.  It is amazing.  In Ireland, there is rain every day of the week but when it stops raining we do not have enough water to keep our population going.  It shows the poor state of our water infrastructure.  I am familiar with areas where the people are looking for tankers because water is not available.  Magnesium levels are rising through the rocks and the water that is emerging is undrinkable.  We must have a serious debate on how we will deal with this issue into the future.  There are forecasts that there will be huge increases in the population between now and 2040 but we cannot serve the current population's water needs after a minor drought.  How to deal with it will be a major issue for the State.  When we return in the autumn, we must have a realistic debate on how to fund and ensure water services for our people.</p> <p>A new regime is required now to ensure people do not waste water over the next few weeks.  There should be a ban on watering gardens, washing cars and so forth for the next few weeks, so we will have enough water for basic services.  We will not have enough water for those services in two or three weeks if this drought continues.  The rain supply is down 33% at present and we do not expect much change to occur.</p></speech>

It is a matter of pride to this House that Members, collectively and across parties, have taken the matter of direct provision so seriously.  A number of debates on the issue took place both in this Seanad and the previous one.  Can we not, for the love of God, implement the report of the working group on direct provision, which was chaired by Judge Bryan McMahon?  I ask that the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Stanton, be invited back to the House, but I know, because I was once in his position, that he is not necessarily the person with the last call on these issues.  That is the Minister for Justice and Equality.  There is a new Minister for Justice and Equality and he has expressed concern about, and interest in, this issue in the past.  I ask the Leader to invite him to the House in the autumn, with the express intention of committing to implementing the McMahon report on the protection and direct provision systems.  Many Members of this House want the direct provision system to be abolished, but we are simply asking that the McMahon report on the system, which is more than two years old and which was a compromise with the non-governmental organisations, NGOs, that were invited to take part in the working group, be implemented to the letter and in full.  That is not too much to ask in this day and age.  We are scarring the lives of children, in particular, who are still in the direct provision system.</p></speech>

He is the Brexit negotiator for the European Parliament and is a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, with which Fianna F&aacute;il is associated.  Given Fianna F&aacute;il's link with the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, we are delighted because a man of his calibre will have the right ideas where Ireland is concerned.  I understand he is visiting Ireland on 21 September and it would be worthwhile and appropriate to have this important Member of the European Parliament address the Seanad, although not necessarily both Houses of the Oireachtas as was granted to Michel Barnier.</p> <p>The Seanad will play an increasing role in the continuing discussions and negotiations on Brexit.  The report of the committee chaired by Senator Richmond was available at the 54th annual British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly which was held in Kilkenny last Sunday, Monday and Tuesday.  It was snapped up at the event.  I particularly noticed that our friends from the Ulster Unionist Party and the Democratic Unionist Party were anxious to obtain copies of this excellent report.  I believe it will be of great assistance in the negotiations.</p> <p>Finally, I believe we should have a Brexit-type European house in Dublin.  I suggest that Agriculture House be converted into a central location to focus attention on all aspects of the developing Brexit negotiations and that there be a dedicated team in that building to assist industry, agriculture and the other sectors of Irish life that will be affected post-Brexit.</p></speech>

I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, to the House to discuss the matter.  Tourism in the midlands is at a serious juncture.  Roscommon and east Galway do not fit into the Wild Atlantic Way or the Ancient East brand.  Both of those initiatives have been very successful for their areas but the midlands have been very much neglected and forgotten by F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland's website prominently advertises Ireland's Ancient East, the Wild Atlantic Way and Dublin, but there is no mention of the midlands.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maura Hopkins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2478"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2478&amp;amp;pid=MauraHopkins&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=19"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I have been contacted by many in the hospitality sector in County Roscommon who are questioning their membership of F&aacute;ilte Ireland as a result of the lack of focus on and support for their business.  Tourism will be a key element in the revitalisation of the economies of towns and villages right across the midlands.  It has the potential to bring jobs and further revenue to support local businesses.  Rathcroghan near Tulsk in County Roscommon, which is rich in ancient tombs and monuments, is the Tara of the west.  It has been nominated tentatively for UNESCO world heritage status.  It will play a very important role in the further development of tourism in our region.  There is an urgent need for a midlands tourism brand to be developed.  The midlands has much to offer in terms of tourism.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to develop an evidence-based tourism strategy for the region but we need to see evidence of its implementation.  It is about affording the midlands an equal opportunity and a level playing field to attract tourists to our region.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister, Deputy Ross, to the House to discuss the matter.</p></speech>

There is an old saying that the sped arrow and the spoken word can never be retrieved.  As irresponsible comments may bring embarrassment to the Oireachtas or the country, we need to be careful about what we say.</p> <p>With respect to what my colleague, Senator McFadden, said about bullying, I have requested a debate in the House solely devoted to bullying.  Once it moves out of the child arena into the adult arena it should be a criminal offence.  Bullying isolates the individual.  It is an attack on the personality, mind and thinking of the individual.  It is the most horrendous thing.  I suffered it once in life and I will tell the House something for nothing, four years of my life was given over to being isolated in the workforce.  I will never forget it.  I found the courage to take on the bully and beat him at his own game.  We need to have a proper discussion here.  Nobody is exempt from bullying and nobody can escape the bully.  At the end of the day, even big, ugly, bald guys like me can be bullied.  It is something we need to realise and we must have protections in place.  It should be a criminal offence.  It certainly is a personal injuries issue.  If we tackle it with adults, the chances are our children will be far more careful in what they do.  I attended a school some years ago where two children had taken their own lives within a short time as a result of bullying.  The teachers sat in their cars at night monitoring social media in order to be aware of what was going on among the children in the school.  The Leader will know, because he is a teacher, that teachers take responsibility for children from 9 a.m. until they leave the school in the evening, but society expects the school to take responsibility 24 hours a day, seven days a week. </p></speech>

Most people come in and out of here as if they are standing at a bus stop.  People come in here and they do not listen to arguments.  They may have plenty of other wonderful things to do but they do not even listen to the arguments.  Sometimes they do not even know what they are voting for or against.  They also use it as a back office.  We can talk all we wish about reform, external reform, changing things for councillors and this, that or the other but we need to start with ourselves.  It is disengaged, graceless and bad mannered a lot of the time.  That is the first thing I want to say.  I agree with reform and think we should start with ourselves.  Whatever committee is going to do it, we should start with learning how to act in public and how to listen to one other.  We should not be on phones and using the place as a back office when people are talking about very serious issues or issues that mean something to them and their constituents or localities.</p> <p>I suggest Senator Hopkins should listen to Garry Hynes's lecture on the greatness of Ballaghaderreen and her life there.

On the positive side, CSO figures for 2016 indicated the number of suicides has reduced from 451 in 2015 to 399 in 2016.  It is a welcome drop but we have a long way to go.  The frightening part about the figure is that of the 399 who died as a result of suicide in 2016, 318 were men.  It is an area we need to focus on.  We need to do a lot of work on it to try to get the figure down again.  I thank all the community groups and people working in this area because they are working effectively on bringing down the numbers.  I also thank the people in the HSE and various State agencies who have worked in the area.  It is something on which we need to continue to make progress over the next number of years.  It had been increasing for quite a number of years.  It was reduced in 2016 and hopefully that trend will carry into 2017.</p> <p>The other good figure from the health statistics is that the number of teenage pregnancies has reduced from 3,087 in 2001 to 1,098 in 2016.  That is a 64% decrease, which is very welcome.  It is to the credit of everyone involved in the education sector.  We have a lot of work to do in that area because 1,098 is the number for 2016.  There are good statistics available in respect of health and much good work is being done to which we do not give credit often enough.</p> <p>The area I am now working on now is orphan drugs whereby a number of people with rare diseases cannot get access to medication quickly enough.  We have a system here and I tabled a Commencement matter on the issue last week.  It is taking too long and too many people are affected.  We need to speed the process up.  I ask the Leader that we deal with the delay in the processing of applications for orphan drugs in the autumn.  It is extremely important and is something we need to do.</p></speech>

I join Senator Grace O'Sullivan in raising concern that the Minister, Deputy Naughten, has just given consent to a company called Providence Resources to drill for oil and gas off the south-west coast of Ireland where it expects to find 5 billion barrels of oil.  I find it hard to believe that the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment would consider the granting of such a licence to be consistent with his aims to tackle climate change and meet the targets of the Paris Agreement, in particular because only a number of weeks ago, Ireland took the hugely positive step of banning onshore fracking.  This decision is bad for our ecosystem, wildlife, carbon emissions and economy as all profits accrued will remain with the company with only a fractional benefit for Irish labourers.  Will the Leader bring in the Minister to justify why he has made this decision?  It flies in the face of everything Ireland says on a world stage about tackling climate change and moving to a green and energy-efficient Irish economy.  Will the Leader ask the Minister whether he will consider revoking the licence given the significant opposition of environmental groups and NGOs?</p></speech>

Rank and file garda&iacute; with whom I have spoken in recent weeks have told me that they, while on their beat, face an onslaught of allegations of corruption from ordinary members of the public.  Something that I would otherwise have found hard to believe brought it home to me today, though.  I was passing through a provincial town at 8.30 a.m. where a 40 year old chap was sitting at the window of a barber shop waiting to get in.  As a Garda car passed by, this guy stuck his fingers up at it.  I went to do a bit of work and so on and returned through the town when I happened to meet the Garda car at a petrol station.  When I asked the garda&iacute; what that had been about, they told me that they were used to it and that, over the past two years, respect for the Garda had been at an all-time low.</p> <p>There are problems in the Garda, although many are legacy problems.  We are pillorying the Garda Commissioner about accounts and systems that were set up in the 1960s but, speaking as someone without an accountancy background, where are we going?  I am sure that many mistakes have been made at the top echelons of the Garda and I am not here to defend the Commissioner or the top echelons, but we must be careful about what we want as a society.  If we continue to hammer the Garda at every available opportunity, where will we go?  If there is a problem with law and order or any other issue, we usually turn to garda&iacute;.  If we are not going to protect and back garda&iacute; and place the full rigour of the law behind them, there will be a serious social problem in Ireland.  It is happening now.  There is a disconnect between people on the ground and the Garda.  As we have been told by senior garda&iacute;, there is a severe threat level of terrorist attack for the first time in 25 years, but garda&iacute; will have a worse relationship with people on the ground, and it is not of their doing.  I ask that every stakeholder, including senior politicians and the media, get behind rank and file garda&iacute;.  If we do not have rank and file garda&iacute; operating correctly, we will have no State.  That is the bottom line.</p></speech>

We attended a successful British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly plenary session in Kilkenny.  I pay tribute to the co-chairs, Deputy Funchion of Sinn F&eacute;in and Mr. Andrew Rosindell, MP, of the Conservatives.  I also pay tribute to the Oireachtas staff, who were incredible.  The programme that they put on was brilliant.</p> <p>I am referring to the assembly because we need such links now more than ever thanks to Brexit.  The British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly was set up in 1990.  A man in the assembly told me that, on its first day, there was a bombing in London and the divisions in the room between the Irish and UK parliamentarians were palpable.  One would never have believed then the friendships, relationships and work that would develop in subsequent years.</p> <p>There are many such assemblies, including the North-South Inter-Parliamentary Association, NSIPA, but we need more links.  People do not realise that NSIPA members from the DUP, UUP, Alliance Party, SDLP and many others in Stormont met in this Chamber four years ago.  It meets every six months.  This work has gone unnoticed, but it forms part of the normalisation of politics north, south, east and west.  I want to ensure that there is more of it.  I call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to tell the House what he is proposing.  In light of Brexit, these links are more important than ever.</p></speech>

It has been debated for long enough.  We are all aware of what it contains and there has not been a change in the law since 1927.  The Bill is in line with the Government's alcohol awareness plan in the sense that, with pubs open on a Friday, it would cut out binge drinking and drinking in pubs and restaurants would be regulated as it has always been.  I respect the traditional faith of this country and traders and customers would have the option of not opening or drinking.  I look forward to passing the Bill's final Stages this afternoon.</p></speech>

Young people feel unsafe.  These children were born into the system and confined to one room and four walls.  They are not able to live normal lives or to develop as children should be.  This is sowing the seeds for significant mental health problems down the line.  We need to reject it.  We know the reality of what it is like in these centres.  This report shines another light on the scandalous conditions that children are living in in 2017.  I call on the Minister to give an urgent response and engage with Seanad &Eacute;ireann on this issue.</p> <p>I welcome the new drugs and alcohol strategy that was published this week, entitled "Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery - A health-led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland 2017-2025".  Under this strategy, the devastating effect of addiction on families will be considered and the fact that addiction in the family is a family disorder, disease or however one would like to phrase it will be highlighted.  Families need a separate recovery from the person in addiction.</p> <p>I wish to highlight the fact that a licence was awarded this morning for drilling in Kerry.  It is vital that the licence be revoked by the Minister.  What is happening is a disgrace.</p></speech>

I would welcome a debate on the matter.  It is one of the issues of our time.  The Government is often criticised for being lax or not wanting to pursue targets, but that is not true.  At a high level, everyone agrees that something must be done.  There is no dispute.  Every day of the week, we are told that there has been a natural disaster, people cannot harvest their crops and so on in some part of the planet on account of climate change.  I would like us to have a realistic debate about this, which I have not often heard in the Chamber.  I have heard the Government being chastised and people beating their chests about this or that being terrible.</p> <p>I would like a debate on the question of the plan's desirability, with which most people agree, but let us first get down to the nitty gritty of how the plan will be implemented.  Take the issue of fuel poverty, for example.  We placed a carbon tax on coal, but those who are most affected are people who can least afford to change their heating systems to a green or renewable energy source.  What about the cost to businesses, farms and households at a fragile time?  We have just exited a bad economic situation and are facing into Brexit.</p> <p>What of renewable energy infrastructure?  People are right to ask whether there will be further drilling for and harvesting of gas and oil and I watched a programme not too long ago about the need to close down peat-burning power stations for obvious reasons, but there is no debate about the economic impact that these factors will have on communities.  What are the alternatives?</p> <p>Another issue arises as we try to hit our renewable heating and electricity targets.  Friends of the Earth tell us about the targets that we ought to be achieving.  I agree with it, but when a renewable energy project - a wind turbine or pylon - is to be built, it makes no contribution as to why the project should go there and how a community should be accommodated.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michelle Mulherin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=19"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is no talk about communities, which have to accommodate this infrastructure, at all.

I read an interesting piece on the Internet, which has its uses, about Airbnb.  The Mayor of Vancouver is bringing in regulations whereby anyone using the site will have to register.  It is quite a draconian measure but people can only register in respect of their own homes.  They will be unable to register other properties they own with Airbnb.  It will cost $54 to register and then an annual fee of $49 must be paid thereafter.  The city expects that will free up a significant number of properties for rental.</p> <p>I appreciate this issue is being examined by the Government and there are ongoing discussions with Airbnb.  While this is very much a Dublin-based issue, every day I meet constituents in Limerick who are complaining about the lack of availability of homes to rent.  I meet single parents and families, and single men and women every day.  It is not a gender, age or socioeconomic specific issue.</p> <p>In a spirit of cross-party harmony, I endorse everything Senator Davitt said about An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There was an incident recently in Caherdavin, Limerick, which is a lovely area in which to live.  Our local garda&iacute;, from the Chief Superintendent, David Sheahan, to the superintendent, Derek Smart, performed above and beyond the call of duty.  They were on call 24 hours and they could be rung any day or night.  They dealt with the residents, there were garda&iacute; on the ground and they attended public meetings.  We have to separate, at times, corporate garda&iacute; from garda&iacute; on the ground.  I can only speak from first hand experience in Limerick.</p></speech>

I compliment the co-chairpersons of the BIPA, Deputy Kathleen Funchion and Mr. Andrew Rosindell, MP, on their conduct of this week's plenary.  Given the depth of the ties that bind us to Britain, it is important at this difficult time that we strengthen them in any way we can.  It is unfortunate that in the current negotiations being led by Mr. Michel Barnier and Mr. David Davis, MP, London failed to engage in advice and consultation with Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.  The report this House produced was made available at the plenary and it was very much appreciated.  It behoves us to strengthen our links with Britain in any way we can.</p></speech>

I did my best to listen to everybody and capture everything they said.  I apologise to Senator Devine, whom I missed out on yesterday in respect of the issues she raised regarding An Bord Altranais and the accreditation of nurses from the US.  She raised an important point, which I hope the Minister will address when he comes to the House in the autumn.</p> <p>Senator Ardagh raised the issue of the second runway at Dublin Airport.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Attorney General are not procrastinating on this.  It is a matter of a statutory instrument and competency in the area of noise management for which the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, is the lead agency.  We must ensure we get this right.  If there is a failure to do so, Senator Ardagh and her colleagues will be first to jump up and roar about it.</p> <p>To be fair to the Minister, due process is being undertaken in connection with the proposed runway.  Second, I ask the Senator to read the Department's strategy, which contains a commitment to a parallel runway by 2020.  I would like to refresh the memories of all Members.  The DAA has made an application to Fingal County Council for a five-year extension of the planning permission in order that the runway permission will not become outdated.  Noise management is an important issue for the residents of the area and it comes under the competence of the IAA.  I assure Senator Ardagh that the Minister is very much committed to building a new runway.  If it takes more time, let us make sure we get it right.</p> <p>The Senator also made reference to yesterday's PAC report.  In welcoming the report, it is about ensuring whatever the investigations, that we continue to shine a light on the culture and practices within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as part of the ongoing process of reform initiated by the previous Government and continued by the current Government.  Investigations are being undertaken by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission on foot of referral by the Commissioner of suspected fraudulent activity in respect of certain EU training funds.</p> <p>There is also a need, as I said yesterday, to expedite the civilianisation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to provide for a new perspective on management of garda&iacute;.  Senators Davitt and &Oacute; Domhnaill have in one way encapsulated that we need to reaffirm and work with an gn&aacute;th garda, the man and woman on the street, and with the inspector or superintendent who is working flat out in community policing in a variety of ways.  They deserve not just our support and respect, but our affirmation.  They do a job in difficult times, often at unsocial hours, and we must support them.</p> <p>There is an obligation to transform the culture within the force and the only way to do that is to ensure we get to the bottom of the cancer that exists within it in order that we can have a force that we can be even more proud of.  As a Government, we have invested in the Garda.  Pay restoration is happening and there has been investment in different sections of the force.  I would be happy to invite the Minister for Justice and Equality to the House in the autumn.  The interim audit report into the Garda Training College published in March 2017 made 19 recommendations.  Five have been fully implemented, five are partially completed and nine are in progress.  Complex legal issues arise from the report and we were all disappointed to read some of the outcomes in it.  Senator Craughwell referred to the use of words and language.  Our party founded the Garda and all those who have supported the force since the foundation of the State will stand by it but we must also ensure there is cultural reform.</p> <p>Senators McDowell, Higgins, Bacik and O'Donnell referred to the need to continue the process of Seanad reform.  All of us are very much committed to reforming the House.  There has been strong cross-party co-operation in this Seanad and, as Leader, I have been clear that I will work with all Members regarding the internal workings of the House, the passage of legislation and how we do our business.  Seanad reform is not as black and white as the populist manifesto included in Senator McDowell's election literature.  It invites a variety of views and opinions.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=19"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am very much looking forward to working with all Senators to ensure that at the end of this Seanad we will have a reformed Seanad that can be passed on to the next Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</p><p>I accept the intention of Senator McDowell's motion on the Order of Business to give, and to imbue in all of us, the spirit of co-operation rather than to have a divided House.  I will work with everyone but it is a two-way street.  As the Leader of the House it sometimes feels as though I am on a cul-de-sac or on a revolving roundabout that seems to only go in one direction.  I will persevere.  I know the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, and the Government are committed to bringing about reform.  The question that needs to be posed by all Members of the House is "What do you want to see in a reformed Seanad and what does it actually mean?"  Many Members of the House will go on the national airwaves, will write articles and will come in to debate here, but they do not stand for anything-----</p></speech>

Senator Alice-Mary Higgins made a reference to the 1979 referendum.  I am confident we will get there.</p> <p>I want to go back to the comments made about the issue of decorum and listening.  Senator O'Donnell makes a very good point because at the risk of sounding pompous - which I am not - there are Senators who come in here to the Order of Business and they then skidaddle before they get a reply.  To be fair some of them apologise for leaving.  If we are to be honest some of the Members of the house do not want to listen at all.  Senator Marie Louise O'Donnell is correct in that regard.  I appeal to all Senators to take a reflective pause in some of the contributions.  There are some very fine contributions made from across the House by Senators who deserve to be listened to.</p> <p>In the past the Cathaoirleach has spoken about the use of mobile phones and other devices in the Chamber.  I use mine to get information so I can reply to the Order of Business, but it is a good point and may be a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</p> <p>Senator McDowell spoke of the situation in the Mediterranean Sea.  It is a huge crisis and a humanitarian issue.  I am very proud of the men and women of the Naval Service who have saved thousands of lives in the region.  There is a moral duty on all governments to act collectively in trying to end this nightmare in the Mediterranean Sea.  If one speaks with members of the Naval Service who have come home they will speak of the horror of the nightmare they have endured and of the terror they have seen.  I commend these men and women for the work they do.  The point was made by Senator McDowell that we need to have a real debate on it and I would hope this could happen in the new Seanad term.</p> <p>Senator Conway-Walsh spoke of the issues around group water schemes and the work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Future Funding of Domestic Water Services.  It is an example of how a Senator in this House, Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh in this case, can be praised for chairing this committee.  Just in case the Sinn F&eacute;in Senators did not know, the Government invests millions of euro on a multi-annual basis in group water schemes.  Last year it was nearly &euro;15 million, which was an increase of 30% on 2015.  Of course we do not hear about this from Sinn F&eacute;in because it is good news and they do not want to hear that.  There is a philosophical question around investment in water.  In his contribution, Senator Lombard said that in parts of Cork there is a 90% decrease and in some parts of Carrigaline there may be no water in ten days' time.  We must invest in our water infrastructure.  The Sinn F&eacute;in Party does not recognise that this money does not fall off the trees.  It must come from somewhere.  This Government and the last government made a decision to invest in water.</p> <p>I would ask the Sinn F&eacute;in Senators to reflect on the role their colleagues played in the Assembly in Northern Ireland in this regard, how they pay for water in the North and how they allocated money for that.  We have seen investment in group water schemes and the former minister, Phil Hogan brought in the grant for the inspection of sewerage systems to ensure the water table is of pristine quality.  I commend the men and women who work in and administer group water schemes.  For a generation they have, on a voluntary basis in many cases, done Trojan work in rural Ireland providing water.  We must ensure that the multi-annual funding by Government of group water schemes continues.  The expert group that was set up by then Minister, Deputy Coveney, allows for places such as Galway and Mayo, and other parts of the State, to have group water schemes set up and we must see this continue.  The Government must prioritise this issue because we cannot-----</p></speech>

We cannot compromise on water quality.  The Expert Commission on the Future Funding of Domestic Public Water Services speaks about equality.  We want to see equality.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Future Funding of Domestic Water Services, chaired by Senator P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh, recommended there would be an enhanced budget for small group water schemes.  This is a priority for the Government and is happening as we speak with a process under way.  Underpinning this is the presence by Irish Water of investment plans in the improvement of water quality and in the infrastructure.  In my city of Cork we are pumping raw sewage into Cork Harbour.  We cannot allow this to continue to happen.  We must take action but this will cost money.  The philosophical question that has not been addressed by some people is "Where does the money come from?" Do they want to increase taxation on the ordinary citizen? Senators must face this question themselves.</p> <p>Senators Lynn Ruane, Grace O'Sullivan, Ivana Bacik and Michelle Mulherin raised the issues of climate change, the national mitigation plan and licensing.  I have not got the information on revoking the licences but I can tell the Senators that the Cabinet is meeting today to discuss climate change.  The Government is committed to implementing 100 actions around climate change, decarbonisation and ensuring Ireland has a reduction in carbon emissions.  The Minister, Deputy Naughten will be in the House today to discuss the Minerals Development Bill 2015.  Maybe the Senators could have a conversation with the Minister as part of that debate.  If it is not relevant to that Bill I would be happy to have that debate in the autumn.</p> <p>Senators McFadden and Craughwell raised the issue of bullying.  I commend the founder of the I'm A Friend organisation, Charlie Wynne, whom I have met.  It is important we continue the work being done by a former Minister, Ruair&iacute; Quinn and now by the Minister, Deputy Bruton around the issue of bullying and its inclusion on the curriculum in schools.  It is an important issue that has not gone away.</p> <p>Senators Bacik, &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and Black raised the issue of the report on children in direct provision.  The report makes for a very disappointing and upsetting read.  As Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in has rightly said, it is important that the actions from the McMahon report are implemented in full.  If one visits a direct provision centre one comes away with an absolute need to see action continue and, in this case, to be concluded.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan and the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton are working on the matter.  I would ask that all Members would read the report of the consultation we are debating here because it is a very honest reflection, especially of the young people involved, and is one we need to see.  The report should not gather dust on a shelf or just receive a headline in a newspaper; there needs to be direct action by the Government.  Action is being taken.  The Minister, Deputy Flanagan and the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton are committed to implementing the recommendations of the McMahon report and, as Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in has alluded to, we have had debates in this House.  We will continue to do so.  To be fair, as the former Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality and now as the Minister of State, the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton has committed to the implementation, as has the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan.  I would be happy to have that debate in the house in the autumn.  It is about ensuring that there is an end to direct provision.</p> <p>Senator Gallagher raised the issue of body cameras for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is an operational matter but I would certainly be happy to see the report referred to by the Senator introduced.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=19"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Labhair an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh mar gheall ar &aacute;r dteanga d&uacute;chais.

We have had debates in the past.  The Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, is very much looking forward to resuming duty as Minister of State responsible for the Gaeltacht.  We will have that debate.  We will see an extension of the Senator's Commencement matter of yesterday because it is important that there is a 20-year plan for the Irish language as a living language.  Today and this weekend in the city of Cork the Munster Fleadh Ceol will take place, which ensures our language and culture are promoted and that we all use them.  I welcome the Senator's remarks and look forward to that debate.  </p><p>Senators O'Reilly and Lawless referred to the Intoxicating Liquor (Amendment) Bill 2017, which is before the House today and I am happy to take it to its conclusion today.  I gave a commitment on behalf of the Government to Senators McDowell and Lawless on that.  The issue is a matter of opinion.  I will be happy to let the debate unfurl and to have that discussion.  </p><p>I am not aware of the issue about family resource centres in An Tusla raised by Senator Gavan.  This Government and its predecessor have increased and restored the minimum wage and terms and conditions of those on low pay.  I am not aware of the pay and conditions of those in the family resource centres but if Senator Gavan sends me an email about that I will be happy to bring it to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  </p><p>In response to Senator Lombard, it is important to have infrastructure for the provision of clean drinking water.  </p><p>Senators Leyden, Coghlan and Feighan referred to Brexit and the British Irish Parliamentary Association, BIPA, and North-South relations.  This arises in the context of the report from the House of Lords today which is particularly worrying given that there is no devolved Government yet in the North of our country but I hope there will be.  It is important, as Senator Feighan said, that the normalisation of politics continues and that we continue to draw on the friendships, expertise, benefits and experience we gain from these interparliamentary groups.  </p><p>Senator Leyden referred to Guy Verhofstadt.  I think there will be a motion before the House tomorrow on that and I will be happy to deal with it then. </p><p>Senator Hopkins referred to the tourism strategy for the midlands, Roscommon and east Galway.  That needs to be addressed because it does fall between Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East and the Wild Atlantic Way.  Senator Marie-Louise O&rsquo;Donnell who does snippets on the "Today with Sean O&rsquo;Rourke" programme would be a very good ambassador for Roscommon and east Galway. </p></speech>

What we say and how we say it is heard, does implicate us and has an import.  It is important we choose our words carefully.  Sometimes we do not do that but we should.</p> <p>Senator Colm Burke referred to health and I welcome the good news he gave of the reduction in numbers of those who have taken their own lives.  The problems for men need to be addressed.  There was a good item on "Morning Ireland" this morning about men's sheds in Mullingar and the need for men to look after themselves.  There are many organisations providing supports and services for those with mental health problems.  No person should feel alone, isolated or vulnerable.  It is important to talk, seek advice and help.  I appeal to all people but particularly men, as Senator Burke said, to reach out, talk and engage.  He also referred to the 64% reduction in teenage pregnancies in 15 years.  It is an extraordinary decrease.  He also referred to orphan drugs and people with rare diseases trying to access medication, an issue that has raised its head in recent weeks.  The Health Service Executive, HSE, must address this and I would be happy to work with him on that. </p> <p>Senator Davitt's remarks were among the most sensible contributions in the House for a long time about An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is important to reaffirm the work done by our rank and file.  </p> <p>I mentioned Senators Lawless and Black, and yesterday the national alcohol strategy was discussed on the Order of Business. </p> <p>In response to Senator Mulherin's comments on climate change and the national mitigation plan, it is important to have a realistic, reasonable and rational debate on renewable energy, farming and business, and the costs, notwithstanding that we have commitments to live up to.   </p> <p>Senator Kieran O'Donnell mentioned Airbnb and the Canadian model.  The former Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs and data protection, Deputy Dara Murphy, following a request from Senator Humphreys, was considering Airbnb but we should consider it again.  I would be happy to have a debate in the House on that issue.  </p> <p>I am happy to accept Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's amendment to the Order of Business.  In the interests of cooperation and the spirit of bipartisanship we should all address the issue of Seanad reform but not as if it was the first fence in the Grand National, as a race to see who can get what.  It is a question of how we can do so in a manner that can progress the need for reform.  I accept both amendments and thank the Senators for them. </p></speech>

It is being brought forward to give effect to one among a number of commitments arising under the Stormont agreement and implementation plan, known as the Fresh Start agreement.  Senators will recall that in September 2015 the Irish and British Governments convened a talks process in Northern Ireland to address the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement of 2014, as well as trust and confidence issues stemming from the legacy of paramilitarism in Northern Ireland that had led to difficulties at the Northern Ireland Executive in the course of 2015.  Following ten weeks of talks, the Fresh Start agreement was concluded on 17 November 2015.  The agreement provides a roadmap for the implementation of many aspects of the Stormont House Agreement of 23 December 2014, including measures to support institutional reform at the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Executive and financial and welfare reform in Northern Ireland.  The agreement also sets out a strategic approach for ending paramilitarism in Northern Ireland and tackling organised crime, especially cross-Border crime.  It contains a firm commitment to achieving a society free of paramilitarism, to working for the disbandment of all paramilitary organisations and their structures and to challenging paramilitary attempts to control communities.</p> <p>An important thread that ran through the talks was the need to seek to tackle the legacy of paramilitarism in Northern Ireland on a cross-cutting basis to see it as a whole of society issue, rather than solely through the lens of security and policing.  In this regard, among the key elements of the agreement is the establishment of the joint agency task force as provided for in the agreement.  The task force is a cross-Border, multi-agency body which has been established in order to enhance co-operation between police, revenue and other law enforcement agencies, at both strategic and operational levels, in tackling cross-Border organised crime.  It is led by the police and revenue services in both jurisdictions and it has been taking forward a range of targeted actions to tackle serious criminal activities that exploit the Border and impact particularly on Border communities.</p> <p>Another key element is the Northern Ireland Executive's strategy to end paramilitarism.  In line with the agreement, the Executive appointed an expert panel to develop recommendations for the disbandment of paramilitary groups.  The panel comprised Lord John Alderdice, Professor Monica McWilliams and Mr. John McBurney and it reported to the Executive in June 2016.  Based on the panel's report, the Executive published its Action Plan on Tackling Paramilitary Activity, Criminality and Organised Crime on 19 July 2016.  The action plan adopts an Executive-wide strategic approach to measures aimed at ending paramilitary activity, including measures to promote a culture of lawfulness, to support persons moving away from paramilitary activity to do so, to tackle criminality linked to paramilitaries and to address broader societal challenges, such as educational and economic disadvantage that is often exploited by paramilitary organisations.</p> <p>The Fresh Start agreement also provides for the establishment by the two Governments of a body to monitor and report on the implementation of the various measures in the agreement aimed at ending paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland.  This body is the independent reporting commission.  In my previous capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I signed an international agreement between Ireland and the UK on the establishment of the independent reporting commission on 13 September 2016.  The agreement, which is included in the Schedule to the Bill, outlines the agreed structure, functions, objectives and other necessary arrangements for the commission, and the Bill before the House will provide for those in law.  It is the intention that reporting on the implementation of the Executive's action plan will be a priority for the commission in order to help to support and to ensure its implementation by the Northern Executive.</p> <p>The Bill has 12 sections which provide for the establishment of the commission in accordance with the terms of the international agreement between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  Section 1 contains the definitions of terms used in the Bill.  Section 2 provides for the establishment and status of the commission as an independent body with the legal capacity of a body corporate.  Section 3 articulates the objective and functions of the commission.  Those are as set out in the agreement between the Governments establishing the commission and they follow directly from the Fresh Start agreement.  The commission's primary objective is the promotion of progress towards ending paramilitary activity connected with Northern Ireland in the interests of long-term peace and stability in society, and stable and inclusive devolved Government in Northern Ireland.  The functions of the commission in relation to the remaining threat of paramilitary activity will be to report on tho progress that is being made towards ending continuing paramilitary activity connected with Northern Ireland.  Section 4 provides that the Minister shall provide the commission, on a basis to be determined by the Government, with funding, premises, facilities and other services as may be necessary for its proper functioning.  The costs of the commission will be shared between the two Governments.</p> <p>Section 5 provides for the necessary privileges, immunities and inviolabilities of the commission.  Section 6 sets out certain duties on the commission in the performance of its functions, notably that it shall not do anything that might put at risk the life or safety of any person, have a prejudicial effect in Ireland or the UK on national security interests, legal proceedings, or the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of crime.  The provisions in sections 5 and 6 are particularly important given the obviously sensitive nature of the matters with which the commission will be dealing.  They are also important in ensuring that there is no unintentional interference with the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI in their ongoing work to tackle paramilitary groups and criminal gangs North and South.  Section 7 provides for controls on the disclosure of information obtained in the performance of its functions unless authorised by or on behalf of the commission and it also facilitates co-operation between the commission and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p> <p>The lifespan anticipated for the commission in the course of the Fresh Start agreement talks was about five years and section 8 provides for the future dissolution of the commission by mutual agreement of the two Governments.  Section 9 amends the Freedom of Information Act 2014 to preclude the application of the Freedom of Information Act to the commission.  That is required by the nature of the sensitive information that the commission will deal with.  Section 10 provides for the laying of the commission's reports to the two Governments before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The commission will report at least annually.  Sections 11 and 12 are standard provisions for legislation relating to the expenses arising being paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas and the Short Title and commencement arrangements.</p> <p>As provided for in the Fresh Start agreement, the commission will be a four-member body and the Governments and the Northern Ireland Executive have advanced matters by nominating the four commissioners.  The Irish Government has nominated Mr. Tim O'Connor, a former Secretary General to the President and a respected former diplomat.  The British Government has nominated Mr. Mitchell Reiss, who was the United States Special Envoy to Northern Ireland between 2003 and 2007.  The Northern Ireland Executive has nominated Mr. John McBurney, a well-known and respected Northern Ireland solicitor, and Professor Monica McWilliams, who has a long experience in politics and public service in Northern Ireland.  John McBurney and Monica McWilliams were members of the Executive's Expert Panel on the Disbandment of Paramilitaries which reported in June 2016.  All four nominated commissioners have extensive experience of the situation in Northern Ireland and they will have the full support of the Irish and British Governments and of the parties in Northern Ireland in bringing forward their work.  Of course, the Seanad will know well that there is an ongoing process of talks at Stormont aimed at establishing the Executive following the Assembly elections earlier this year.  While much progress has been made in reaching agreement on a range of important issues, it has not yet proved possible to finalise an agreement that will facilitate the formation of the Executive for the time being.  That is, of course, a disappointment.</p> <p>The Government maintains its strong, ongoing commitment to the success of the institutions established by the Good Friday Agreement and we will continue to play our full part in supporting the resumption of power sharing in Northern Ireland.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, has encouraged all the parties in Northern Ireland to maintain contact with each other over the coming weeks with the aim of securing agreement at the earliest opportunity.  This Bill is not without precedent and it follows in many respects the arrangements that were successfully put in place in regard to other bodies established to further the objectives of the Good Friday Agreement, notably the Independent Monitoring Commission; a cross-Border institution established by Senator McDowell when he was Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The independent reporting commission will have an important role to play in bringing forward work aimed at bringing an end to paramilitarism and its insidious legacy that impacts on all communities in Northern Ireland.  I look forward to finalising the Bill at the earliest opportunity and to commencing the important work of the commission.</p></speech>

The Bill creates a new monitoring body to review and report on any paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland.  It is a damning indictment of Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP that such a body is still required almost 20 years on from the Good Friday Agreement.  The peace process was always about more than the absence of violence.  However, the zero-sum attitudes taken by the two main parties which has led to the current impasse in Stormont has hobbled the immense potential and optimism of the Good Friday Agreement.  This sterile political environment has allowed paramilitaries to continue to blight both communities in Northern Ireland.</p><p>This Bill was necessitated by MI5 and the PSNI confirming the continued existence of the IRA and its role in formulating Sinn F&eacute;in policy.  Sinn F&eacute;in has fundamental questions to answer around its links to the IRA, which has no part in the democratic state.  It is now time for Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP to move beyond tribal partisanship and work to ensure Northern Ireland is capable of addressing the challenge of Brexit.  The Bill ultimately arises from the Fresh Start agreement.  However, Northern Ireland remains engulfed in yet another political crisis, which has led to the protracted paralysis in the institutions.  The lack of progress in getting the institutions up and running is deeply disappointing and underlines our concern that zero-sum politics is sustaining a fertile ground for paramilitaries.</p><p>Due to the tight numbers in the House of Commons following the recent elections to the British Parliament, the Tory Government is reliant on DUP support.  The DUP has secured a deal worth &pound;2 billion over two years and further flexibility around &pound;500 million already committed.  It appears to bypass the Barnett formula used to allocate funding across the component nations of the United Kingdom.  This has drawn criticism from other devolved administrations.  We hope that a focus is placed on key Stormont House and Fresh Start measures such as the A5 motorway to Derry, which will be a key piece of infrastructure for the north west, and the Narrow Water bridge, which should be completed.  The Irish Government should uphold its commitment to those measures.</p><p>The botched renewable heating incentive scheme could cost up to &pound;490 million and has acted as the catalyst for this crisis.  However, behind the immediate problems lies a deeper malaise that has afflicted the institutions over the past number of years.  The political system has to move on from this addiction to crisis politics.  Over the past few years, there have been annual problems with the institutions, punctuated by a series of new agreements and arrangements designed to keep the system ticking over.  Since 2013, there have been the Haas talks, the Stormont House agreement and the Fresh Start agreement, all aimed at reinvigorating a stagnant political process.  History has shown it requires both Governments to fully and honestly engage in order to keep the peace process moving forward.  The DUP's leverage cannot be allowed to stymie progress and undermine long-established British policy for the sake of short-term political gain.  Likewise, Sinn F&eacute;in has painted itself into a corner and must have the honesty to agree a way out of this impasse.  With Brexit looming, all parties need to work together to ensure there is no hard border.  It is time for real maturity and leadership from all of us on the island.</p></speech>

While I do not take huge issue with Senator Ardagh personally because it is clear from her contribution that she has been handed a speech to recite in regard to this issue, I do have to pull the Fianna F&aacute;il Party up on a number of points.</p><p>Coming just a few short weeks after the UDA murdered a man in the car park of a Sainsbury's supermarket in Bangor, Fianna F&aacute;il got up in this House and started to tell Sinn F&eacute;in it needs to reflect on the IRA, which left the stage in 2005.  That, of course, was verified by a whole raft of organisations, North and South and internationally, and by bodies appointed by the Government.  Its decommissioning was overseen by the Rev. Harold Good and the late Fr. Alec Reid, and I do not imagine Fianna F&aacute;il will call into question the bona fides of those individuals.  I do find it interesting that Fianna F&aacute;il, in the form of hurlers on the ditch - in fact, all-Ireland winning hurlers on the ditch when it comes to politics in the North - is saying this to Sinn F&eacute;in, which, I remind the House, received its biggest ever mandate since the partition of the country and overwhelmingly significant endorsement from the people in the North, while Fianna F&aacute;il received zero votes there.  The people there are very clear in regard to the Sinn F&eacute;in stance on these matters.</p><p>The issue of rights, Acht na Gaeilge, marriage equality and victims and legacy issues should not simply be parked and set aside.  I wonder what rights the members of Fianna F&aacute;il would ask their children, families, neighbours and constituents to compromise in this jurisdiction.  Would it be Irish language rights, the right to marry the person one loves or the right to access a proper legacy inquest into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, for example?  Is that what Fianna F&aacute;il is telling nationalist and republican people, and many people from the unionist and loyalist tradition in the North, to park, and all simply because it wants to have the opportunity to grandstand and take political sideswipes at Sinn F&eacute;in in advance of the summer recess?  I will not be distracted and I do not think people in the North will be particularly enamoured.  It is very clear those issues will not be parked for the sake of returning to the <i>status quo</i>and what passed previously.  Those days are very clearly over.</p><p>To return to the business at hand, I welcome the Bill, which gives effect to the international agreement between the Irish and British Governments in September last year to establish the independent reporting commission.  This commission mechanism was agreed as part of the Fresh Start agreement in November 2015 which Sinn F&eacute;in negotiated and supported, along with other parties - I do not think Fianna F&aacute;il was there.  All and any steps that contribute to the ending of violence and criminality on our island are to be welcomed.  The establishment of the independent reporting commission is a positive step forward in that regard.  Its objective, as outlined in section 3 of the Bill, is to support long-term peace and stability.</p><p>No one in this House can argue against all of that and it is what all of us want to see - peaceful communities and a peaceful country.  There are those, however, who do not want to see that objective fulfilled.  The continued activity of so-called paramilitary groups impedes the development of peace, imposes hardship and inflicts great harm on citizens and communities.  The Bill before us rightly reflects the need for greater all-Ireland co-operation to tackle crime and criminal activity.  I welcome the realisation of both Governments and all parties, North and South, that we are better able to tackle issues like this on an all-island basis.  The argument has been made here many times that it is together that we are better equipped to tackle the big issues that face all of us on the island.</p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in is totally and absolutely opposed to criminality of all kinds and we stand with communities across this island, with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and with the PSNI in opposing criminal gangs and criminality in all its forms.  As a consequence, Sinn F&eacute;in members' homes, my own included, and their families been attacked.  Our party will continue to try to reach out to others and to robustly face down violent loyalism and so-called republican dissidents.  Despite that fact, there have been deliberate efforts, some of which we have heard here today, to criminalise and demonise republicans, Sinn F&eacute;in activists and other citizens, especially those in cross-Border communities in places like south Armagh and north Louth.  Contrary to the image portrayed by some elements in the media and some in this House, such portraits are a fallacy, conjured up for the purposes of pathetic political point-scoring.  There is no doubt that criminal gangs which masquerade as republicans, for whatever reason, exist.  They are not republicans; they are criminals.  No doubt, the independent reporting commission will come to that same conclusion.</p><p>There is also a major problem relating to ongoing loyalist paramilitary violence which should concern us all.  The recent killing of Colin Horner, purportedly as a result of a feud within the UDA, is deeply concerning and there can be no room for such grievous acts in a civilised society.  I urge those involved to stop now in the interests of all citizens.</p><p>The independent reporting commission is a mechanism on which we can all agree.  It was agreed as a result of all-party talks and agreement between both Governments.  The latest round of talks in the North have, regrettably, not proven successful, despite the very best efforts of Sinn F&eacute;in to find agreement with the DUP, the other parties and the two Governments on outstanding issues.  It is disappointing but perhaps not surprising that a deal has not been done.  Such a result is a direct consequence of the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, supporting the DUP and the DUP supporting her.  The DUP which, of course, was strangely absent from the Fianna F&aacute;il contribution, had the endorsement of the Loyalist Communities Council ahead of the last Westminster election, certainly giving cause for concern among many of us.  It is a monumental failure by Theresa May and her Government.  Decades of work are being put on hold to keep her in power.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2477"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=19"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It should be very clear by now that a restored Assembly and Executive are only sustainable and tenable if they are based on fairness, respect and equality.  The rights-based issues, whether they be Acht na Gaeilge, a Bill of rights, marriage equality, the rights of families to coroners' inquests, independent investigations or information recovery, are not solely Sinn F&eacute;in demands but are citizens' demands and are basic rights that are protected in England, Scotland, Wales and the rest of Ireland.  The denial of these rights would not be tolerated elsewhere on these islands and should not be tolerated in the North.  However, the British Government is prepared to facilitate such a failure because it is in hock to the DUP.  It is prepared to say "No" to fundamental human rights to appease its partners in the DUP, which is unacceptable.</p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in was and is prepared to work through the issues and we will continue to try to do that.  We will not tolerate the denial of basic human rights.  It should not be a shock to anyone that unionist parties want to delay, nor that they come to the issue of rights slowly and reluctantly, but they cannot do that forever.  The Sinn F&eacute;in electorate will not consent to be governed by the DUP on the DUP's terms.  We do not and would not expect the DUP electorate to consent to be governed by us on Sinn F&eacute;in's terms either.</p><p>It is quite simple.  It is all about rights, equality and respect.  It is about agreement on how these rights and our agreements are to be delivered and implemented.  That is the only way to get the institutions back up and in place.  I support the Bill.</p></speech>

The best any of us can do for the negotiations in the North is wish the parties well in their endeavours to find an agreement.  It is in the interests of all Irish citizens, North and South, to find an agreement and I have no doubt that all parties will play a constructive role.  I commend the previous Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, on the many long hours and days he spent up North engaging with the parties in a constructive manner, and I have no doubt his replacement, the new Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, will learn from his example and continue that engagement.</p> <p>I see this Bill as another fundamental building block in the ongoing process of peace on this island.  It was appropriate that the Minister acknowledged the role our colleague, Senator Michael McDowell, played as Minister for Justice and Equality.  Indeed, all Governments and Ministers for the past decade and a half have been constructive in their engagement to ensure the peace continues.  It is a fragile peace and probably will be fragile for another couple of generations.</p> <p>This Bill is part of the agreement.  I wish the four designated appointed commissioners well.  They have vast experience and it is an important job of work.  Going from a paramilitary background to mainstream society brings its challenges and the Bill is about the State engaging in a positive way to ensure there is a framework in place to deal with it.</p> <p>The Minister has outlined the 12 provisions of the Bill and it is fairly straightforward.  This is our responsibility and the Oireachtas has a duty of care to ensure it passes without delay.  The full agreement of this House is very welcome in this regard.</p></speech>

I hope this will be another step towards achieving a society free from paramilitarism.  This will help provide stability and peace in a society that has been plagued by violence for many years.  The shared futures agreement promised to build hope and confidence throughout the North and to establish true reconciliation.  While this has not been fully achieved yet, we must build a society based on equality and justice because this is the best way to ensure paramilitary activity will cease.</p> <p>My father comes from Rathlin Island off north Antrim, and during the conflict we spent our summer holidays there.  Rathlin is a small island but, while one would see the army in Belfast, the island led the way in non-sectarian politics.  The community always worked together no matter what part people came from, and they still do that to this day.  The people there lead by great example and the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement is taking a trip up to Rathlin in September.  Maybe the Minister would like to join us.  It would be lovely if he came to meet the community there.</p> <p>The fears of some communities are being exploited by paramilitary organisations for their own financial gain.  This must not be tolerated, and support for independent community organisations must be maintained.  The most deprived areas are those most affected by paramilitary activity and more investment and services in these communities will help decrease the influence of the paramilitary organisations, more than any policing or security measures.  The re-establishment of the Northern Executive is of the utmost importance if this Bill is to be effective because the elected representatives in the North must work together to rid society of all paramilitary activity.  To this end it is necessary that the equality agenda is implemented and outstanding issues from previous agreements are addressed.  I know this is a very difficult situation and I wish all parties well in re-establishing the Northern Executive.  With the start of the Brexit negotiations it is more important than ever that the Northern Executive is up and running and both the Irish and British Governments, as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, must ensure the issues leading to the suspension of the Executive are resolved.</p> <p>I welcome the enactment of this legislation and I hope it can be an important step towards building a better future for all communities in the North.</p></speech>

This is an important aspect of the progress being made under the peace process.  The Minister referred to the unfortunate stalemate in Stormont and the disappointment over the failure to date to get the Northern Ireland Executive up and running again.  There has been an interruption to the process by the elections, and colleagues in the North have suggested to me that election fatigue had set in among many citizens in Northern Ireland following all the election and referendum processes through which they have been in recent years.</p> <p>It is good to see initiatives such as this Bill coming forward which will see the establishment of an international body, the independent reporting commission, to report on progress towards ending continuing paramilitary activity connected with Northern Ireland.  I thank the library and research service for preparing for us a very good synopsis for the context of the Bill and giving us an important reminder that there are ongoing levels of paramilitary activity.  The PSNI recorded security situation statistics annual report for the past year, from April 2016 to 31 March 2017, provides a chilling reminder that deaths and casualties continue, even with an established peace process in place.  In the timeframe to which I referred, there were five security related deaths and there has been one more since, in May this year.  The five deaths between April 2016 and March 2017 also represent a high level of activity compared with previous years and is the highest number per year since the 2008-2009 reporting session.  On top of fatalities there have been 61 shooting incidents and 29 bombing incidents.  There are ongoing casualties and individuals and families are being grievously affected on an ongoing basis by paramilitary groups and individuals.  It is important we recall that while we speak in support of this legislation.</p> <p>I join others in wishing the best of luck to the four members of the commission: Mitchell Reiss, Tim O'Connor, Monica McWilliams and John McBurney.  In particular, I welcome the inclusion of Professor Monica McWilliams, who has a proud record of public service, in particular in ensuring there is representation of women in the Northern Ireland public sphere and in political debate through her work with the Northern Ireland Women's Coalition.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=19"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->For those of us not from Northern Ireland, the lack of women at high levels in political life in Northern Ireland is a constant source of concern.

I very much welcome the broad support that has been expressed in the House for the Bill and for the objectives and work of the independent reporting commission.  I acknowledge that traditionally there has been cross-party support in the Seanad for measures that have been brought forward over the years to support the process of seeking full and stable peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland, building on the many achievements, initiatives and programmes of all Governments throughout the decades during the very difficult times of the Troubles and beyond.  I am very pleased to note that this cross-party approach has been maintained and I thank Senators for that.</p> <p>It is the firm intention of the Government to do what we can towards achieving a society that will be free of the scourge of paramilitarism.  We will work with our colleagues in the Executive in Northern Ireland, as soon as it has been established, and also with the British Government with the aim of disbanding all paramilitary organisations and their structures, activities and what they stand for.  I have no doubt that the commission will play a positive role in that regard.  The Bill, and the measure to which it gives effect, fully underlines the strong importance we all attach to positive developments not only in politics on the island of Ireland but also in respect of society on the island of Ireland and the economy, North and South, which will benefit everybody across the island.  </p> <p>I once again thank the Senators for their contributions.  I look forward to hopefully completing Committee, Report and Final Stages of the Bill before the Seanad rises for the summer vacation.  That would be some good news coming from Seanad &Eacute;ireann in the form of our contribution towards ensuring the establishment of the important independent reporting commission in Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

There are a number of Government amendments to it.</p> <p>As Senators will be aware, the Bill, as published, provides for a number of amendments to section 2 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1927 which, incidentally, was introduced and piloted through this House by one of my predecessors, the first Minister for Justice, Kevin O'Higgins, who represented my constituency, and the 90th anniversary of whose assassination we commemorated just last week.  I want to acknowledge his contribution over a wide range of issues not least in the matter of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1927.  My understanding is that during the course of debate on this important Bill in 1927 it was the intention of the then Minister, Kevin O'Higgins, to introduce a consolidated piece of legislation in the matter of intoxicating liquor dealing with statutes, some of which dated back at far as 1634 and many of which were enacted during the course of the 19th century.  Of course, we now know that did not happen.  Ninety years later we are still awaiting a consolidated single statute.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charles Flanagan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=19"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am not going to suggest that during the course of my Ministry that we will have one but I acknowledge the contribution of Senators Lawless, Boyhan, Craughwell and McDowell in this regard.  Perhaps over the summer months, while enjoying a well earned vacation, if the same Independent Senators find themselves somewhat idle or in need of a project, they might like to assist in the drafting of the comprehensive and consolidated intoxicating liquor Act that Kevin O'Higgins did not get around to doing in 1927.</p><p>These Government amendments would remove some restrictions to Good Friday operations.  As for the amendments to section 2, having regard to the complexity of the licensing code, the Bill as drafted, while acknowledging its importance, could in certain circumstances unless amended create further anomalies.  Indeed, it could unintentionally create some unfair trading conditions for certain categories of licenses premises.  That is why the purpose of my amendments is to ensure that all of the provisions in the licensing Acts that prohibit the sale and supply of intoxicating liquor on Good Friday are removed in their entirety.</p><p>Amendment No. 1 inserts the correct collective citation of the Licensing Acts in section 1 of the Bill.  Amendment No. 2 provides for a number of amendments to the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1927.  It also incorporates the amendments to section 2 of the Act that is set out in the Bill as published, which would permit the sale of intoxicating liquor in public houses and off-licences on Good Friday.  Amendment No. 2 also amends sections 1(1), 4(7), 14 and 56(1) of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1927.  In practice this will mean that the restriction on the sale of intoxicating liquor in hotels and the restriction on the sale of intoxicating liquor in registered clubs on Good Friday will also be subject to removal.  The provision will retain the current symmetry between the rules of registered clubs and licensed premises on the sale and supply of intoxicating liquor on Good Friday.  It will also mean that hotels will be permitted to sell intoxicating liquor to paying guests at any time on Good Friday and not only for consumption with a meal as is currently the law.</p><p>Amendment No. 3 provides for the amendment of section 7 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1960.  It relates to the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquor on holiday camps licensed under the Tourist Traffic Act 1952.  Amendment No. 4 provides for the amendment of sections 11(5) and 22 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1962.  The amendment of section 11(5) removes the prohibition on the granting of an occasional licence on a Good Friday.  As Senators will be aware, an occasional licence, subject to obtaining an order from the District Court, allows the holder of an ordinary publican seven-day on-licence to sell intoxicating liquor for a special event at a place to which no licence is currently attached.  </p><p>Amendment No. 5 provides for the amendment of section 14 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 that will remove the restriction on the sale of intoxicating liquor on Good Friday in premises operating on the basis of a special restaurant licence.  It is my view that it would be inequitable to permit the sale of intoxicating liquor in public houses that happen to operate as restaurants or otherwise provide meals to customers but not in restaurants that operate on the basis of a special restaurant licence, of which up to April of this year we have recorded up to 500 such premises.  Finally, amendment No. 6 amends the Long Title of the Bill to insert the correct collective citation.  I have outlined my amendments and look forward to hearing the views of Senators on same.  </p></speech>

He has had a long day today and yesterday by the looks of things.  I, too, accept all of the amendments that have been tabled by the Government.  I thank the Government for taking the courageous step to support this Bill.</p> <p>Some people have contacted me claiming that the passing of this legislation today would be a black day for Ireland.  I contend that today is a great day for Ireland and it is wonderful that the Government has accepted the Bill.  The legislation will have brought Ireland into the 21st century and catered for one of our largest industries - the tourism industry.  </p> <p>Incidentally, the Bill, as proposed by my colleague, Senator Lawless, is not a Bill that forces people to take drink on a Good Friday but merely leaves the option open.  We are not trying to trample all over the religious beliefs of people in Ireland.  The people who have religious beliefs will continue to observe them.  The people who wish to have a drink will do so.  I sincerely hope that on Good Friday in 2018, I will have a pint with my good colleague, Senator Lawless, in a hostelry somewhere close.  I thank the Minister for his time. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-07-19a.140" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1402" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017071900002#U00700"><p>Since Senator Lawless has expressed support for the Government's amendments then clearly I am happy to express support, on behalf of the Labour Party, for the amendments and the Bill.  Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in spoke on behalf of the Labour Party on Second Stage in support of the legislation.  I think the legislation is a sensible move towards the consolidated intoxicating liquor code that the Minister mentioned.  We are all hopeful that we will get the code some day.  I know many legal practitioners who have made a great living from the complexity of the code and interpreting it for clients.</p> <p>All of us are conscious of the harm caused by alcohol in society.  We are also aware of the need for a mature attitude towards alcohol and responsible consumption.  The current law has anomalous exceptions about which Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in quite amusingly spoke on Second Stage.  As the current law is simply not fit for purpose, it makes sense to introduce this rational change.  I am delighted to support the change and the amendments too.   </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-07-19a.141" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1408" speakername="Frances Black" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017071900002#U00800"><p>I, too, welcome what the Minister has said.  Some people might be surprised that I support the legislation bearing in mind my background of community work and helping people who have problems with alcohol, in particular family members.  I am in favour of the change because I believe it will help reduce the harm that alcohol does to the health of our people, which is interesting enough.</p> <p>In recent years, Holy Thursday has been the day on which people become frenzied as though alcohol was about to be prohibited.  The excessive amounts of alcohol that are bought because the pubs are closed on Good Friday is a sad reflection on our society.  Alcohol is then consumed in homes in the presence of young children.  I am really concerned about this unhealthy example that gives children.  Members are all familiar with the recently-published report by Dr. Geoffrey Shannon in which he cited the impact alcohol misuse has on children.  In addition, bar workers look forward to not working on a Good Friday and being able to spend time with their families.  Any changes made to the licensing laws must ensure that one can opt to work on a Good Friday and workers are paid the same rate as that which applies to a bank holiday.</p> <p>The idea of a pub being a regulated environment should make it easy for the responsible server of alcohol to be built in as a requirement in licensing law in Ireland.  Many people drink at home before they go out to socialise, which means many licensed premises serve alcohol to people who already are intoxicated.  The important issue is not whether the pubs are allowed open on Good Friday but our unhealthy relationship with alcohol.  I hope it is okay to say a little bit about this matter.  This matter is being addressed by the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  There is a genuine disbelief around the country that public representatives do not favour a Bill that will save lives.  The lobbying by the retail and alcohol industries must not be allowed to shape Government policy.  The aims of the alcohol industry to maximise consumption and the aims of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill to save lives are incompatible.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Frances Black:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2474"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=19"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The saving of even one life is much more important than the profits of multinational corporations.  Three people die every day in Ireland from an alcohol-related illness and this must be tackled.</p><p>I am encouraged by the fact that both An Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar and the Fianna F&aacute;il leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin have both been Ministers for Health and must know that alcohol is a psychoactive drug and should be treated as such.  I hope they will put the health of the nation before the wealth of the alcohol industry.  The fact that alcohol is legal does not reduce the harm it does and we have an obligation to ensure that Ireland is not defined by our consumption of this drug.  I hope we will arrive at a time when the idea of the pubs being open or closed on Good Friday will be irrelevant.</p></speech>

He comes very well equipped to that role and has vast experience in that area.  I also pay credit to his former role as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and his work in Northern Ireland trying to re-establish the power-sharing Executive there.  I hope that comes to fruition sooner rather than later.  It is inconceivable that they will not realise the necessity of power-sharing as they face into the Brexit situation.</p> <p>In respect of this Bill, it is welcome that the Government will adopt it.  Although Senator Lawless has brought in the Bill, he accepts it will go through faster when Government, Opposition and Independent Members work together.  It is timely.  This Bill was introduced before by former Senator Imelda Henry, who is in the Gallery today and worked very hard on it.  We disagreed on it at the time.  I adopted a stance similar to that of Senator O'Reilly at that stage.  However, like on the road to Damascus, we changed our opinion.  It was impractical, particularly in respect of Dublin.  Incidentally, these provisions do not force anybody to open on Good Friday.  If conscientious objectors have any problem, they do not need to open.  It is a matter for themselves, which is reasonable.  I am also aware that Padraig Cribben and the Vintners Federation of Ireland are working on this.</p> <p>Frankly, the Bill is quite irrelevant because a number of pubs will not be open next year to avail of its provisions.  A lot of rural pubs will be gone.  The Government, Government Members of independent stature and others can publish statements about naming and shaming and all that stuff.  It is all going to damage rural Ireland and rural pubs.  How nice this is.  This is just trimmings.  One day will not make any difference to the life and soul of rural pubs.  We are witnessing the beginning of the end of rural pubs in Ireland.  Unfortunately, the Government and Sinn F&eacute;in supporters will be collaborating in this regard.  That is fine.  That is the way they want to go.  It will be a sad day for rural Ireland when the reality hits home.  It will be too late to reverse the situation then.  The laws are there and are being enforced.  They are effective and they are getting results.  I think people realise that.  There is no way I will in away endorse anyone drinking alcohol.  That is not a question of fact.</p></speech>

It is not everyone who can say they successfully got a Private Members' Bill over the line.  I did need persuasion on the necessity to have pubs open on Good Friday.  There are 365 days in the year and they are only closed for two.  It is not the biggest crime in the world to leave them closed.  I have, however, been persuaded by the arguments, particularly those of Senator Black, given her background, experience and phenomenal work.  If she does not have a problem with the Bill, I do not think any of us really can have one.  I congratulate Senator Lawless.</p> <p>The Government amendments are primarily technical to ensure that equity flows across all the beer pipes, as it were, in the pubs throughout the country.  We have seen a remarkable growth in the brewing and craft beer industry.  In County Clare, we have the craft brewers' festival in Doolin, which is one of the most successful festivals in the county.  It was created because of the number of cottage breweries that exist in the country.  There is proposed legislation to improve brewing.  The Minister might like to inform the House as to when he intends to bring that legislation forward.</p> <p>I have also noted media commentary over the weekend that the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, has proposals to protect rural pubs.  It is a big challenges.  In lots of villages, pubs are now only really open at weekends.  There is no way they can make a viable living out of it.  Many publicans must now find day jobs and so forth.  We need some thinking outside the box in terms of protecting what is part of the fabric of rural society.  We often talk about the importance of the post offices.  The pubs have a critical role to play as well, particularly for people who live alone.  We need some creative thinking in that regard.  I am in the presence of some very successful publicans.  Senator Leyden owns the D&aacute;il Bar in County Roscommon and Senator Byrne is a very successful publican from a line of many generations in Limerick.  There is a lot of service to the hospitality industry in this House.</p> <p>I welcome the thinking outside the box it is hoped the Government will do.  A lot of people are worried, particularly about the proposed legislation on drinking and driving and so forth.  The pubs have an important role to play in society.  I commend Deputy Lawless on his Bill.</p></speech>

It would be hypocritical of me if I did not champion the same in this institution.  The reason I champion it, as Members have alluded to in terms of previous contributions, is because of the potential economic benefit for our tourism sector, the importance of that to the economy of the State and what it does for job creation, provision of services and so on.</p> <p>I have some issues with the broader sentiment of the Bill.  While I support Senator Lawless, and he knows he has our party's support, it is not beyond the realms of possibility to outline some of the issues, not so much in the Bill because it is very direct in what it sets out to achieve, but in the broader context of the issue of our relationship with alcohol in Ireland.  Senator Black referred to that during the course of her contribution.</p> <p>Senator Leyden accused us of being in cahoots with Fine Gael.  I do not understand why this Bill could be brought forward and yet the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill is gathering dust on a shelf somewhere.  Support for this legislation today does not mean we should not have the opportunity to debate the real concerns about Ireland's relationship with alcohol, its impact on the cohesion of our society, and the tangible practical issues it brings to bear on our health care system and other aspects of life, including the financial and many other burdens.</p> <p>Another issue I touched on in the Second Stage debate is workers' rights.  I appreciate fully that it is a separate matter in terms of what this Bill sets out to achieve, but it would be remiss of us when we are debating this issue not to reflect the experience of workers in the hospitality sector.  Currently, the trade is dominated by minimum wage pay, no overtime rates, no pension and no sick pay.  There are no guaranteed hours of work.  The bar and hospitality trade have become a template for the low wage exploitation economy that has taken hold of large sections of our economy.  Research by the Nevin Economic Research Institute reveals that 345,000 workers, equal to 25% of the workforce, earn an hourly rate below the living wage of &euro;11.50 per hour.</p> <p>While I do not believe that is a negative in terms of what the Bill can do, I am sure the Minister will accept that in its broadest possible sense it puts an onus on us to reflect on the people who work in our bars and the hospitality sector generally who are already under a huge amount of pressure.  If Senator Lawless has achieved more than one objective with the passage of this Bill, his focus remains on the people who work in the sector.</p> <p>As a society, we need to reflect on our relationship with alcohol.  I welcome the Bill.  It is the right decision.  It is stand-alone legislation in that regard.  If done properly and if all the issues I have outlined are dealt with in a truly national conversation, this is welcome and very important legislation.</p></speech>

In the late 1980s, when Ian Paisley finally had to give in to pubs opening on Sundays, there were protests about that.  I do not believe there will be protests about this Bill in this part of the country.</p> <p>I refer to the harm alcohol can cause.  Home drinking has increased massively.  I have memories of being a young adult when, for the first time ever one Christmas, my mother decided to buy a bottle of wine.</p></speech>

To assuage her religious belief, she dutifully introduced Blue Nun to the seven of us.  We thought that was astounding at the time but when one looks back one realises it was a naive time.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-07-19a.192" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1397" speakername="Joe O'Reilly" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017071900002#W02400"><p>I join in the tributes to Senator Lawless for introducing legislation in the House, which is a good thing to do.  He made the point that a publican had the freedom to opt out of this in the sense that an individual publican might not necessarily open.  That is fair enough to a point, but there will be pressure and a commercial imperative on publicans.  What is happening up the street can become a difficulty and they could tend to lose customers, so it is putting them in an unfair position.</p> <p>I understood we would have a proper Report Stage.  I have a few difficulties with this legislation.  That we are starting to try to deal with the alcohol question is at variance with health policy in general.  That sends the wrong subliminal message and it is a mistake in that respect.  I genuinely believe it offends many, although not all, people from all the Christian traditions in this country who have dearly held religious beliefs around the fact there are two sacred days in the calendar, Christmas Day and Good Friday.  It offends the sensibilities of a number of people in this regard.  I genuinely believe those people's sensibilities, sensitivities and feelings in this matter and their rights of citizenship should not be ignored or cavalierly regarded.  I regret that.  I have an amount of anecdotal evidence to support it.</p> <p>I would be concerned about the issue of workers' rights, which has been well articulated by colleagues.  Traditionally, Good Friday was a day off for the people who worked in the bar sector.  I hope they will receive adequate remuneration.  Some of them may have personal difficulty with this measure.  Traditionally, it was a day of rest.  Those two big days marked the Christian calendar.  They were part of our Christian tradition in Ireland.</p> <p>There is a mythology that in some way this measure will assist tourism.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Joe O'Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1610"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1610&amp;amp;pid=JoeOReilly&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=19"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->What assists tourism in Ireland is our distinctiveness, our native culture, our difference, our Christian values and our traditions.  Maintaining our identity attracts far more people to the country than shredding that identity on the altar of naked commercialism and constantly seeking to fumble in the greasy till and add the ha'pence to the pence.<br/><br/>Senator Leyden is right in saying that the rural pub is under threat.  It is an endangered species which offers its own problems in rural areas.  It has its own difficulties in terms of the tourism sector and the quality of life of people who live in isolation.  While he is right about that, opening on two further days a year is not the way to resolve the matter.  From talking to them, I know that the great majority of rural publicans do not want to open on Good Friday.  They would prefer the <i>status quo</i>.  This is putting them under further economic pressure with costs.  It was a day on which their premises were closed and on which they carried out repairs or whatever.  Now they will be under commercial pressure from their peers and their neighbours to open and put in staff for a day, which, in most instances, will not yield a return.<br/><br/>I think more reflection ins required in respect of the Bill; we are rushing into it too much.  We need to stand back a little.  It is too easy to jump on every fad.  With regard to the Minister in some way improving in our position, I think people want us to keep our tradition and culture, and stand up for what is right.  Many people outside the House have genuine and sincerely held religious views on Good Friday, which is very sacred to them.  I am not sure that we should not respect it a bit more.</p></speech>

I also pay tribute to our colleague and former Senator, Imelda Henry, who prepared this legislation in the previous Seanad.  I welcome the members of the LVA and Dublin vintners today.</p> <p>While I understand Senator O'Reilly's point of view, a report published yesterday on the agrifood sector by Ciaran Fitzgerald, an economist, showed that tourists spend &euro;6.5 billion in this country annually and 65% of that is outside Dublin, including in rural regions, where it is the largest and, in some cases, only economic activity.</p> <p>While I understand the religious aspect, I have seen tourists in Limerick city looking to get food on Good Friday.  Places have not been open and it has been very inconvenient for them.  Therefore, the legislation we are passing is most welcome.  It is about choice.  Nobody is saying that people have to go out and drink on Good Friday.  When sports clubs and the different organisations that were able to serve drink on Good Friday were open, people had a choice; they either went to them or they did not.</p> <p>I also support what Senator Black said about the amount of binge drinking that was happening.  People were going out and bulk-buying drink from supermarkets on Thursday, which was also anti-publican.  However, this is about giving people choice and facilitating tourists.  I welcome the Bill's passage.</p></speech>

I wish him well with his new portfolio.  I also welcome the former Senator, Imelda Henry, and her colleagues in the Gallery.  In particular, I commend Senator Lawless and his colleagues who co-sponsored the legislation.  I welcome the passage of the Bill.</p> <p>While I understand Senator O'Reilly's reservations, I am of the view that it is in the best interest of health and controlling the abuse of alcohol.  We all know what happens at Easter and Christmas.  There is a big stock-up of alcohol in private houses because the pubs are closed on Good Friday. Far more alcohol is consumed - in fact, dangerous levels are consumed - because the licensed premises are closed.  I also contend that pubs being closed drives more people to drink on Good Friday than would do so if they were open.</p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile mentioned the licensing laws in Northern Ireland.  For as long as I can remember, droves of people have travelled to the Border towns in the North in order to take a drink on Good Friday.  The only reason for doing so was that the pubs in the Republic were closed.  While they might not necessarily have been going for a drink at all, it was something they could not do in the Republic on that particular day.</p></speech>

It is ludicrous that at the beginning of the tourist season and heading into the height of it, tourists cannot have a drink in public houses here.  That has been wrong.  While bearing in mind what Senator O'Reilly said about tradition and religious offence, quite frankly, other legislation passed in this House and in the Lower House has offended people of religious thinking far more than this legislation will do.</p> <p>I commend the legislation to the House and I hope it also goes through D&aacute;il.  If people want more time to think about it, they can consult with their colleagues in the Lower House and propose amendments that Deputies could take on board.  I welcome the passage of the legislation.</p></speech>

I commend Senator Lawless on his great work in getting it through.  For all the reasons I and others have given, it is important that we see it through.  I hope it goes to the D&aacute;il.  We live in a republic and it is an important step in the development of a more mature attitude to alcohol consumption and also in the separation of church and State.  The points about harm done by alcohol are well made as are the points about workers' rights.  However, those are not irreconcilable with the merit of the Bill.  I thank the Minister and his officials for accepting the Bill.  It is good to see a Private Members' Bill, introduced by a Member of the Opposition, pass through the Seanad.  We have had a number of these and this is another success for the Seanad.</p></speech>

It was not a particularly successful meeting but I had not expected it to be.  They mentioned to me that this Good Friday Bill was offered to them as part of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  While I am speaking from memory, I believe the vintners explained to me that they clearly rejected that because they did not believe the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill would ever see the light of day again.  My one regret is that the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill was not passed before this legislation.  I must be clear on this; that is Fine Gael's fault.  Fine Gael Senators have objected and blocked their own Bill, which is shameful.  I am encouraged by the Taoiseach's comments yesterday, but it is beholden on all of us to ensure that the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill, which is a Fine Gael Bill and not a Sinn F&eacute;in Bill, is actually passed as it is and not made toothless.  If that does not happen, shame on all of us.</p></speech>

I wanted to add my voice.  I will try not to repeat what others have said.  I welcome the Bill.  I congratulate Senator Lawless on his tireless work.  I also congratulate the former Senator, Imelda Henry, on the work she did on this matter in the previous Seanad.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Neale Richmond:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2472"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2472&amp;amp;pid=NealeRichmond&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=19"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->One topic mentioned by those a little uncomfortable about the Bill is respect for traditions and values.  As a person from a minority background, the most important value is that the State is a republic, that all those in the State are tolerated equally and that the value system of the majority is not imposed as much as was previously the case.  That is an issue on which the country is slowly progressing and the Bill is yet another example of how we are starting to open up.  If people choose not to take alcohol on Good Friday - as I will so choose due to the peculiar nature of my personality rather than any religious views - that is fine.  However, legislation prohibiting the consumption of alcohol of Good Friday is no longer needed and Ireland needs to move more quickly towards being a secular and open republic.  I commend the Bill.</p></speech>

I was very happy to co-sign it.  He put an enormous amount of work into it from beginning to end.  It has not had an easy passage.  Many people had to be convinced and many changed their minds along the way.  It must be acknowledged that it was not a walkover.  Senator Lawless had to consult and convince people.  He had to argue and set out the rationale and logic behind the legislation.  He did that exceptionally well, as is the case with anything to which he applies himself.  I acknowledge that because it was not all simple.  At the beginning of the process, it was not certain that this Stage would be reached.  I acknowledge the consultations, work and focus that went into the Bill and the constant need for Senator Lawless to keep bringing the matter up and on the political agenda, which he might not say himself but many Members know to what I refer.  I acknowledge and thank the Minister for facilitating the legislation as it would not have come to fruition without his input.  He is new to his very important role and has contributed to making the Bill a success.  Perhaps this is an example of new politics and it is a good example thereof.  We have arrived at a common-sense position and the right legislation.  Members will look back on the Bill and wonder why it was not passed a long time ago.  I particularly acknowledge the work and commitment of Senator Lawless.</p></speech>

I compliment him on his contribution in the House to date.  Like many other Senators, he is new to the House but he is leaving his mark and the Bill is one example of that.  When the prohibition was first introduced, the concept of drinking alcohol at home was a non-entity because no-one ever did that.  Unfortunately, in today's world more and more people are drinking at home.  That is not a good thing.  I encourage people who want to have a drink to go to a public house to do so because when one is at home - and I take the odd tipple myself at home - the temptation is to open the bottle and not pay much attention to the measures one is consuming.  When one is in a pub, measures are calculated and one knows how much alcohol one is getting.  The ship has sailed a long time ago on the issue addressed by the Bill.  It is sensible legislation that I fully support.  I compliment Senator Lawless again on bringing it forward.</p></speech>

I also thank the Leader, Senator Buttimer, for honouring his commitment and ensuring that Committee and Final Stages of the Bill are being taken today.  I also thank the co-sponsors of the Bill, Senators McDowell, Craughwell and Boyhan, along with James Geoghegan, who helped me with the Bill.  I commend my great friend, former Senator Imelda Henry.  Her father is also a great friend of mine.  I acknowledge the work she put into the Bill and thank her for it.  It provided a basis for me to build upon.  I thank the former Minister for Justice and Equality and current Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Fitzgerald, who advocated the change put forward in the Bill to the Government.  I am delighted to have the support of the Government in bringing the Bill through the Seanad.  I thank the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, for ensuring that amendments were submitted in time to make certain that, along with pubs, restaurants and other licensed premises will be able to open on Good Friday once the Bill has been passed by the D&aacute;il and signed by the President.</p> <p>The passage of the Bill is another progressive step in Ireland's long journey towards separation between church and State.  It is understandable that when lawmakers try to introduce legislation to change a practice that has been in place for almost 100 years, people pause to reflect upon that.  However, that is what legislating is supposed to do and it is what I came to this House to effect.  There is an affinity to the day of closure but in many cases it is leading to alcohol abuse.  Government policy is to reduce binge drinking, which is an objective with which no Member would disagree.  Cheap, low-cost alcohol needs to be removed from supermarkets and off-licences.  Under existing legislation, an 18-year-old with &euro;10 could buy 10 cans of beer on Holy Thursday to keep for the next day but could not meet friends in a pub on that day to drink two to three pints costing the same amount of money.  Removing this 90-year-old provision from the Statute Book sends another clear message that Ireland is a pluralist, global and forward-thinking country.</p> <p>The passage of the Bill also says something about the Upper House, which survived an attempt to abolish it in 2013.</p></speech>

The passage of the Bill, initiated in the House, reinforces my belief.  I again thank the Minister, Deputy Flanagan.</p></speech>

I wanted to step out of the Chair to make comments I would not otherwise have been able to make.  Almost all issues have been addressed but I particularly congratulate and thank Senator Lawless for putting the legislation forward, along with his co-sponsors, Senators Boyhan, Craughwell and McDowell.  I also thank my party, Fianna F&aacute;il, for supporting the legislation.  It had to consider and deliberate on the Bill.   I thank the Fianna F&aacute;il leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, his Front Bench team and other party members for their support.</p> <p>When I was elected to the Seanad, I told the Licensed Vintners Association, LVA, which represents Dublin publicans and was good enough, along with another body, to nominate me for the Seanad, that I would do my best to have this issue addressed but, as a new Senator, I was unsure of what the outcome would be.  I am delighted that, a year after being elected to the Seanad, the Bill is progressing through the House.  Pubs are the lifeblood of communities in both rural and urban areas across the country and are also very important to tourism.  The number of visitors from the UK, which is our biggest market, has dropped significantly this year.  Anything that detracts from Ireland's attractiveness to that market is not a good thing.  In recent years, many pubs in Dublin have opened on Good Friday to serve food and soft drinks.  They will now also be able to serve alcohol.</p> <p>I thank former Senator Imelda Henry and welcome her to the House, along with the chief executives of the Vintners Federation of Ireland, VFI, and the LVA.  They have also done great work on this issue and many others.  To hear Members such as Senator Frances Black supporting the Bill gives one confidence it will result in less alcohol being consumed on Good Friday than was previously the case because there is much anecdotal evidence of off-licence operators saying Holy Thursday is their busiest day of the year.  An off-licence not far from my house ran out of beer on a Holy Thursday several years ago.</p> <p>This is a very significant day.  The Minister might outline how soon the Bill might pass through the D&aacute;il, although I acknowledge that is a matter for the Business Committee.  Senators want the Bill enacted long before Christmas if possible in order that there be no likelihood that it will not be in force by Good Friday 2018.</p> <p>In reference to a point raised by Senator Gavan, both publican representative organisations support the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill and have no difficulty with it.  They may have felt that it was being frustrated and that if their piece of legislation went into it, it might never see the light of day but they are not against the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.</p></speech>

It is not my intention to address them because we will have a further opportunity to do so.  However, in response to Senators' concerns about the Sale of Alcohol Bill, to which reference was made, I wish to state that it is not gathering dust on any shelf anywhere.  It will proceed in the next session.  I acknowledge what the Taoiseach has said on that in recent times.  I also acknowledge, however, that there is further work to be done and that it is unlikely to be enacted in its current form.  Like all legislation, it will be subject to rigorous, robust and full debate in the D&aacute;il and also in this House.  That is precisely the manner and means by which and through which legislation is enacted.</p><p>A number of Senators made reference to workers' rights.  It was appropriate that they should do so.  I want to acknowledge what this Government has done in that regard, particularly in response to the recently published report of the Low Pay Commission.  Workers' rights and workers' pay will continue to be a priority for this Government.  I acknowledge again the second increase in the minimum wage.  The second increase in the lifetime of this Government has now been agreed and will come into force on 1 January 2018 in the form of an increase of 30 cent per hour.  It is modest but it keeps well ahead of inflation and it also underscores commitment on the part of this Government to its objective to ensure that every family will benefit from an economy that continues to grow and from economic progress in recent years that was hard won .  During the summer months, when the Seanad goes into recess, the Government will engage at the highest level in respect of the Estimates for departmental spending and the budget that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, looks forward to introducing in the autumn.  We will continue to acknowledge the need for wider and broader support for lower-paid workers to achieve the objective of opportunities for all.</p><p>I wish to commend the initiative of Senator Billy Lawless, an Independent, with the support of other parties in this House.  I commend Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; and acknowledge the cross-party support.  I also acknowledge the contribution of Members of the previous Seanad to the genesis of this legislation.  In that regard, I acknowledge the work done by and initiative show in respect of this matter my colleague and friend and former Senator, Imelda Henry.  I am pleased to see her present for the enactment here in the Seanad of legislation that she was particularly interested in during the course of her career.</p><p>Senator Martin Conway is not here.  He made reference to the Intoxicating Liquor (Breweries and Distilleries) Bill.  It is a Private Members' Bill in the D&aacute;il, which, like the Bill before the House, was not opposed by Government.  The Government is currently working on Committee Stage amendments.  I will say, for the benefit of those in this House and beyond who are interested, that there will be restrictions in that legislation.  The hours of trade will be restricted to 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and the sale of alcohol in these craft brewery premises will be restricted to those who have participated in tours of the premises.  I also understand that consumption on or off a premises would only be applicable to a product that is either brewed or distilled on that premises.  This is a Bill that would require a measure of work.  However, that is work which we will, I hope, be in a position - by way of the cross-party co-operation and support that facilitated Senator Lawless' Bill - to be able to complete by the end of the year in both Houses.  I acknowledge that there is work to be done on that legislation.</p><p>I acknowledge the role of Senator Billy Lawless in respect of the Bill before the House, which is important in the context of ensuring that all our legislation is of a type, form and measure that is befitting of a pluralist republic.  This legislation is very much in keeping with that objective.</p></speech>
