It was the subject of a lengthy battle for the people of the area.  When the former Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, published his infamous list of primary health care centre projects, the centre in Kells was not on it.  As Members will recall, the centres in Balbriggan and Swords in the former Minister's constituency were included.</p> <p>What I am seeking from the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, who is taking this matter on behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, whom I understand cannot be present, is an outline of the range of services that will be provided, an indication as to when the centre will be opened and, most importantly, whether, as omitted in the planning process, a safe bus stop will be provided to enable those using public transport to access the centre which is located on a busy bus route outside the town of Kells.  It is important to ensure older people will be able to access the centre using public transport.  </p> <p>I have corresponded on the matter with the National Transport Authority which has informed me that it has corresponded on it with the HSE but that it has not yet received a formal reply.  There is a need for joined-up thinking on the part of the agencies involved to ensure a bus stop will be provided to benefit a number of those likely to use the centre.  Many people living in the area have signed a petition seeking installation of this facility and I am calling on the agencies involved to deliver it.  I would welcome an update from the Minister of State.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-12-08a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1033" speakername="Kevin Humphreys" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015120800002#B00900"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue which I am taking on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who has responsibility for primary care issues.</p> <p>The new primary care centre in Kells is being delivered under the operational lease mechanism.  The centre is now complete and the HSE plans to move services there early in 2016.  Two local GPs and their practice staff will be moving into their surgeries in the new centre in the coming weeks.  The HSE will also shortly move a broad range of services into the new facility, including public health nursing, physiotherapy, podiatry, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, dental, psychology, social work, primary care counselling, clinical nutrition and dietetics and community mental health services.  In addition, palliative care services for the population of north County Meath will operate from the centre.</p> <p>In regard to the Senator's concern about the bus stop, I understand the HSE is in communication with Bus &Eacute;ireann on the provision of a bus stop as close as possible to the centre.  I agree with the Senator that the accessibility of the centre is very important and work on this issue is ongoing.  The development of Kells primary care centre represents a step forward in the modernisation and updating of working practices, facilities and equipment and supporting ICT systems.  The sharing of accommodation between GPs and HSE staff in one centre facilitates a team-based approach to service provision, which is the main purpose of primary care centres.  </p> <p>In the national context, the development of primary care teams and primary care centres is a priority in the programme for Government and an extremely important element of the health reform process.  The provision of primary care centres and teams throughout the country will significantly increase health and social care services in local communities, which will be achieved by redirecting services away from acute hospitals.  Primary care infrastructure is being delivered using three mechanisms: direct build, the leasing initiative and the public private partnership model announced in July 2012.  The development of primary care centres, through a combination of public and private investment, will facilitate the delivery of multidisciplinary primary care services and represents a tangible refocusing of the health service to provide care in the most appropriate and lowest cost setting.</p> <p>The modernisation of primary care accommodation and practice is vital to the successful delivery of services into the future.  In this regard, there are 90 primary care centres in operation around the country, 47 of which have been opened since March 2011.  Work is ongoing on a further 52 centres which are expected to be delivered by the first half of 2017.  The development of primary care centres is central to the Government's objective of delivering a high quality, integrated and cost effective health system.  Shared premises encourage and facilitate interaction across all health care professionals.  For this reason, the Government is committed to the development of a network of new primary care centres.</p> <p>I will bring the Senator's concerns about the provision of a bus stop to the attention of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  As stated by him, it is important in the context of the forthcoming opening of the centre that there be a follow-through and delivery in this regard.</p></speech>

All the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill does is ensure there will be no change in the amounts up to 2019, so I would expect the debate on it to be well over within the time allocated.  Likewise, the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill is due to run from 3.45 p.m. to 5.15 p.m. and, as there are only three amendments, again, I would expect it to be finished well within the time.</p></speech>

For people of the Christian faith, it is the most significant event on the religious calendar.  However, there are many thousands of individuals who will not benefit from this celebratory mood.  I am thinking, for example, of those who have no homes, those who are facing eviction, families that trying to make ends meet on a pittance of income and heroic parents who are trying to shield their children against poverty and the disadvantages that go with it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1968"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1968&amp;amp;pid=LabhrasOMurchu&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The only bulwark that one has in that case are the charitable organisations that prevent destitution and oblivion for these people.  I am thinking of organisations like the Simon Community, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Merchant's Quay and so many other charities as well.</p><p>One must be inspired by the young people who take to the streets every night, seeking out people who have fallen off the radar of society, who bring human contact to them and help them with food and advice.  It is the only glimmer of hope that is given to those people.  It is particularly important for us here to listen to what they are telling us.  I am sure that they have been in contact with all Senators.  They are telling us of their experiences, difficulties, concerns and lack of resources.  As legislators, we have a duty also.  We appreciate that these organisations exist and without them we would have a very impoverished society.  It is wrong to ignore the problems.</p><p>We can approach this matter without any party politics or partisanship.  There are issues in this House and we should do that as well.  One can go out and see that people are still living rough on the streets at the height of winter.  I am sure Senators feel like I feel and wonder how can people live like that.  They are human beings that probably come from good families but something went wrong in their lives.  Maybe they were disadvantaged or deprived.  We do not know what their story is.  This House is the best forum that we have.  I am not talking about patronising but being proactive and helpful in this regard because I feel we are expecting too much.  I marvel at the young people.  These are educated people who have every opportunity in life yet they will not forget the most vulnerable and other members of society.  Their actions enrich us all.  </p><p>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the Leader would give us some time today, and I do not care how late in the night it is, so that we can bring to the floor of this House the experiences that have been brought to us, the concerns and requests.  That is what we should be doing and we should not miss the opportunity here this morning for doing so.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that we will not let this day pass without responding to the reality of what is happening.</p></speech>

In my own area, the towns of Killarney, Kenmare and Tralee have suffered very badly from flooding.  Last night we heard the sad news that there had been one fatality and I extend my sympathies to the family of the elderly man who was swept away in his car.  A package of measures is going before the Cabinet this morning and I am sure that we will have the details of the programme of work for recovery and preventative works to be carried out in the future.</p> <p>I pay tribute to the emergency services that have worked tirelessly over the weekend.  I refer to the ESB, the Garda, council workers, Civil Defence, Red Cross and the HSE.  I could go on.  People also volunteered their services.  A great tribute must be paid to them all.  They worked to restore power and clear floodwaters from areas.</p> <p>I shall also mention the recklessness of the youths in Salthill.  I do not know what they were trying to do or what their mental state was but they dived into the sea and recorded their antics.  I presume they thought it would look good on Facebook or social media.  What if they had got into difficulties?  People would have had to rescue them.  Had these youths any thought for rescuers who would put their lives in danger to rescue them or the families of their rescuers?  The parents of the youths will be able to identify them.  I hope that their parents will lay it on the line as to how reckless their behaviour was.  On the flip side, we must pay tribute to the youths who were washed off the rocks at Hook Head and the young lad who held a girl's head over water until she was rescued.  That shows the variation in the different types of carry-on by youths.</p> <p>People may not realise that the Department of Social Protection plays a major role in responding to severe weather events and the aftermath.  The Department can provide help, under supplementary welfare, for food, clothing and personal items.  It will also assist in the replacement of white goods, basic furniture items and other essential household items.  In addition, more extensive works can be carried out, including plastering, drylining, the relaying of floors, electrical rewiring and painting.  The Department also has a humanitarian assistance scheme for larger jobs.  Senators can let people who contact them know that such help is available.  People may not be aware that the Department of Social Protection plays a role in responding to weather events.  </p> <p>On a lighter note, I welcome the fact that last week the T&aacute;naiste launched a community employment pilot scheme for participants who are over 62 years of age.  I spoke about this matter when we debated the Social Welfare Bill here and I know other Senators have spoken about the matter as well.  People over 62 years have a lot of experience and life skills to offer.  Many of them want to continue working and are happy to participate in community employment schemes.  The pilot scheme is welcome and I hope that it will be extended to the rest of the country.  </p> <p>The Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Damien English, has responsibility for research, innovation and skills.  Today, he published Innovation 2020 which is Ireland's five-year strategy for research and development in science and technology which is welcome.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the issue early in the new year so that we can learn what the proposal by the Minister of State contains.  </p></speech>

Corruption is a cancer in this country and it needs to be utterly and absolutely condemned.  Corruption has real effects on people's lives.  We see it in the planning decisions, in the flooding, in inappropriate developments and so on that have ruined people's lives.  The most indicative moment of the programme was the two gestures.  The sly compliant wink of the man from Donegal and the scrabbling movements of Councillor McElvaney when he was trousering and jacketing what he described as loads of money.  It was disgusting.  However, if one is going to take the high moral position, if one is going to lay down the law about morals and if one is going to investigate people then one also needs certain standards.  I must be the only person in this country to feel that those standards were grossly vitiated by the makers of the &quot;RTE Investigates&quot; programme.  They instigated and initiated criminal activity.  They acted as <i>agent provocateur</i>.  They set up a fake company.  They entrapped people into situations where they invited them to engage in criminal activity.  It is indicative that out of all of them they got three, which is 0.3% of councillors, yet everybody was tarred in politics.  I personally greatly resent this.</p><p>The programme makers illegally recorded and broadcast telephone conversations.  Of course the material on them was corrupt and has to be condemned but the law must be upheld as well.  I understand they appealed the High Court's decision in the case of the nursing homes.  In the case of the nursing homes, criminal activity had been going on, was going on and continued to go on.  In this case, the criminal activity was precipitated deliberately by RTE's investigative team.  I find that disgusting.  I was astonished that not one - not one - of the moral pundits and academics sought to question, in any sense, the methods used in this situation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I speak with an interest in this, which I will declare.  A couple of weeks ago, a letter was hand delivered to me here.  It was like something from the Gestapo.  In it, there were allegations that I had transgressed ethics by failing to disclose that I was a director of a film company.  I found that very shocking and was left shaking from it.  I raked my memory.  I contacted an accountant who went to the Companies Office.  I never heard of that company, never signed anything, never received any reports and never got notice of meetings.  I was blissfully unaware of the situation and I made that clear to these people within 24 hours.  Does one think I got as much as an acknowledgement or an apology?  One must be joking.  The attitude of these people was the tabloid thing - squirt out the accusations all over the place and let us hear people deny them.  RTE is a national broadcaster; it is a public service broadcaster.  It was disgraceful that these tactics were allowed.  I condemn utterly corruption but I also condemn the squalid methods employed by RTE in the making of that programme.</p></speech>

In County Leitrim, my county, there were a number of incidents of flooding and there was a landslide in one part of the county while in Sligo, people had to be evacuated from nursing homes.  I welcome the suite of measures that has been put in place.  I know the money will be spent on helping those people who were affected.</p> <p>I welcome the signing of the contract today for another phase of the N16, a road I have mentioned on many occasions since becoming a Member of the House in 2011.  Approximately &euro;5 million has been spent on that stretch of road since 2011.  The N16 from Sligo to Enniskillen is winding and dangerous.  This phase will remove the bends from another three miles of the road and leave it much safer.  I thank the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, who met me, local councillors and council and engineering staff from Leitrim County Council three or four months ago, following which the funding was allocated.  This is very good news for that part of the country.  The signing of the contract takes place in the Rainbow ballroom, another place I have mentioned on several occasions, at 2.30 p.m. today.</p></speech>

Gerry Reynolds who died in Belfast this day last week.  He was an architect of the peace process, promoting cross community links in Belfast, in particular with the Fitzroy Presbyterian community of the Reverend Ken Newell.  He crossed the peace line to worship with Presbyterians, Methodists and members of the Church of Ireland to make Clonard the cradle of the peace process.  The work of people in Clonard, Corrymeela and Glencree is most valuable as we push into the past the history of enmity between religions in Ireland.  People like Fr. Reynolds shine like a beacon in that process.  I thank the rector of the monastery for making Clonard a centre of the peace process and all those who work tirelessly to promote better community relations in Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

Gerry Reynolds.  He was a champion of dialogue in relation to obtaining peace.  I knew him and am deeply saddened at his death.  I echo also the comments of Senators Marie Moloney and Michael Comiskey on the recent storms and pay tribute to members of the emergency services who worked hard in the past week to keep people safe.  I convey my condolences to the family of Ivan Vaughan, the 70 year old man from Tyrone, who died as a result of being swept away in floodwaters in County Monaghan at the weekend.  Storm Desmond has wreaked havoc across the country and many people have been affected.  Coming so close to Christmas, it is a cruel blow for Mr. Vaughan's relatives.  I wish to send good wishes to the 14 year old rescued from the sea at Hook Head and who remains in a critical condition.</p> <p>I welcome the fact the Government will consider today an aid package for those affected by the storm and that the Department of Social Protection is overseeing hardship payments to those in need.  Weather conditions are outside the Government's control.  Will the Leader ask for an update from the relevant Departments as to what contingency plans will be put in place for the forthcoming expected bad weather, particularly in those counties expected to be hit the hardest because without a contingency plan agencies will continue to fire-fight?</p></speech>

Any form of entrapment is a terrible thing and the result does not always justify the means.  However, we are confronted with a problem, that is, what happened last night affects the entire body politic in this country.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Taoiseach to call on the agencies of the State which have responsibility for investigation and prosecution of any form of corruption to examine what was delivered last night on RTE and to decide what, if anything, should be done?  People have a right to their good name.  If people were misled or entrapped and have a perfectly reasonable explanation for what they finished up doing on television last night, they have a right to protect themselves.  If what they were involved in is a criminal offence, they need to prosecuted.  It is one or the other as far as I am concerned.  People who saw that programme last night are absolutely outraged.  That outrage turns on all of us, not just on the people involved.  Every hard-working politician is tarred with the same brush and that is no way to run a country.  Will the Leader speak to the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Taoiseach today on those two issues?</p></speech>

Our thoughts are with the families and the businesses which have been severely discommoded as a result of being flooded and also with members of the farming community throughout the country who have lost animals and fodder.  I hope the package being announced by Government today will address many of these issues.  I am aware humanitarian aid is available to meet immediate needs.  The victims of the 2009 flood who have no insurance must be given priority in the Government's aid programme.  There is no doubt that investment in flood defences and other remedial works has to be a priority.  </p> <p>While the town of Ballinasloe was severely impacted, the investment made there post-2009 has made an impact.  More rain fell over the past weekend than in the flood event of 2009 and while a number of businesses and a few homes have been impacted, if there is no further rainfall, much of the town will not be impacted.  The CFRAMS study is available and, hopefully, it will be the blueprint for future investment.  Funding is absolutely crucial.  There is a need for an open discussion on many issues, including the causes of flooding.  Much has been said in Ballinasloe about the lack of cleaning of the River Shannon and the silting caused by Bord na M&oacute;na.  All those issues will have to be addressed if a serious impact is to be made on preventing flooding.  </p> <p>Like others, I pay tribute to those involved in the huge local effort to lessen the impact on people at the weekend.  Great work was done by the staff and members of the county council, the fire brigade, the Army, the Office of Public Works, local community volunteers and local contractors who were called on at short notice to help with pumping activities.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael Mullins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2368"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2368&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMullins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A full debate is required and I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris, the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, and the Government to expedite a plan to put money behind the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, study and deal with the worst impacted parts of the country first.</p></speech>

It is a matter of urgency that we debate the issues he so eloquently outlined, particularly - but not only - coming up to Christmas.</p> <p>I join with colleagues in welcoming the Government's humanitarian assistance scheme which was announced this morning.  Senator Moloney has outlined the areas to be covered by the scheme.  The last time the Government announced such a programme, however, it was a total farce.  It was not easily accessible by those who needed the aid most.  It was almost impossible for them to adhere to the conditions that were set out.  I appeal to the Leader to impress upon the Government the urgency of this scheme and the need to make it user friendly on this occasion.  These unfortunate people need the money now, not when and if they are lucky enough to get through the hoops created by the Department.  If they manage to get through those hoops, it will be six or eight months down the road that they get financial aid.  That is not good enough.</p> <p>Like others, I pay tribute to the emergency services involved and to the volunteers as outlined by my colleague, Senator Mullins.  It is high time and high tide that we had an urgent debate on flooding and on whatever proposals the Government has to advance the flood relief plans that are in place.</p></speech>

We have to ask what they have got to hide.  Five vulture funds were invited to appear before the finance committee to engage with members on a range of issues raised by us concerning their operation in Ireland.  The invitations were extended to Pepper Asset Servicing, Lone Star Funds, Cerberus, CarVal and Mars Capital.  Each has refused to appear before the committee and has effectively told us to mind our own business.</p> <p>Naturally, the committee members wish to raise questions with these companies about how they treat customers whose distressed loans they have bought.  There are thousands of Irish homes and businesses whose future lies in their hands.  These large companies, which are effectively carpetbaggers, are in here to make a quick buck and are often devoid of any apparent social or moral compass to direct their operations.  One such company sought to commit a distressed borrower to jail for refusing to leave their property.  Another ignored the protection of a personal insolvency arrangement provided to a distressed borrower, and sought to move against his property.</p> <p>What are these companies afraid of and why will they not come before the Oireachtas and outline how they operate and the protection they afford to customers?  Their failure to appear leads me to believe that they have something to hide or to be ashamed of.  I suspect that we may need to consider a more in-depth review of the operations of vulture funds in Ireland.  At the very least, we should seek to oblige these people to co-operate with rather than stonewall the national Parliament of a sovereign State.  I will be taking the matter up with the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, and my colleagues on the finance committee.  </p> <p>On the matter raised by Senator Norris, I can identify with much of what he says because I too received a letter from "RTE Investigates" stating that I, like Senator Norris, had breached the Standards in Public Office and Ethics Acts, the whole lot, by being the director of a firm.  They said I had not declared it.  Of course, they were totally wrong.  I am neither a shareholder nor a director of the company they named.  I might not have been quite as shaken as the good Senator opposite but I did ring the man from whom I received the letter.  He wanted something in writing but when he heard what I had to say, I think he accepted it.</p></speech>

It is literally the talk of the country today and people are surprised, shocked and angry.  Where investigations are necessary I am sure they will be conducted and presumably, should prosecutions be necessary, they will follow in due course.</p> <p>We need to recognise that the spotlight that is being shone on local authorities and their members across the country should, perhaps, be redirected closer to home.  The political example must be set from Leinster House, not from council chambers.  Many years ago, the former T&aacute;naiste, Mr. Dick Spring spoke about a cancer in the political system.  He was speaking about a particular individual at that time and expressed his views about that gentleman.  However, there remains a cancer in the political system - the cancer of cronyism.  We saw it in this House about 18 months ago when an attempt was made to use the House for political purposes.  We see it in the unreformed quango system, those quangos which were supposed to be gotten rid of but which still exist, the appointments to those quangos, or judicial appointments in respect of which people in the Law Library know months in advance who is going to be appointed to what position.  We see it in the distribution of grants and funds in various schemes across the country.  Let us not pretend.  Cronyism is part of our political system and political culture and always has been.  We must decide whether we want to continue with that type of broken, dysfunctional politics, or whether we need a new start.</p> <p>While the problems at local authority level, where they exist, must be examined, we must start much closer to home and the buck stops with us and with the Government.  There has been mention of the need for an anti-corruption Bill.  I am sure that is somewhere in the ether waiting to be passed, and the sooner the better.  Everything about our political system, our appointments system, patronage and favouritism is as bad now as it ever was.  That is the real cancer and cronyism.  When the small-time county councillors have disappeared off the public airwaves, the substantial matter of cronyism and its cancerous effect on politics will still have to be tackled.  That is where we must start, at the top.</p> <p>We need to put new legislation in place.  An anti-corruption Bill would be a step in the right direction but the culture needs to change.  The culture of the public needs to change as well.  Substantial findings have been made about certain politicians, yet the public decides to re-elect them.  It would sometimes make me wonder.  We need a very new culture in Irish politics.</p></speech>

The programme has done some service in shining a light on this darkest recess of the political system.  However, in the midst of the justifiable fury it has caused, it must not be forgotten that the vast majority of councillors are honourable and just people who do not deserve to be held to account for the deplorable actions of a small number of individuals.  Councillors - I have received telephone calls from three or four of them from various parts of the country - who have dedicated much of their lives to serving the public with the utmost integrity and endeavour, many of whom are working for their communities on a full-time basis with modest rewards, are waking up this morning knowing that they will face unwarranted criticism and suspicion, from their communities because of the shameful actions of those witnessed by Members on national television last night.  I received telephone calls from a couple of them after the programme had been broadcast last night.  However, Members cannot allow the unlawful and immoral actions of a few to sully the reputation and honour of the many councillors who hold office throughout the country.  It is incumbent on them to issue a message of support to councillors and a message to the public that they should not devalue and sour the work of their representatives by tarnishing them with the same brush as those who were exposed last night.  In the interests of the huge majority of upstanding, hard-working councillors, those who last night brought such shame to their vocation should face the full rigour of the law.  Some of them think they have conveniently sidestepped the juggernaut of public opinion and culpability by resigning from their parties, but they should know that that is not enough.</p></speech>

I do not refer only to illegal loan sharks but also to those who advertise everyday.  I love the small print at the bottom of their advertisements to the effect that they are regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland.  They absolutely pulverise the people who approach them for small, short-term loans to get over Christmas with the punitive interest rates they are obliged to pay back.  In addition, I ask the Leader to bring in the Minister for Finance, if possible, to have a discussion on this issue because being regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland should not give such companies a free hand to do as they please.  Moreover, as credit card interest rates are regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland, that institution has a question to answer in this regard.  However, I reiterate the advice that people should go to their credit unions where they will be looked after and to please stay away from loan sharks, both regulated and unregulated.  I also call on the Leader to arrange a debate on some of the bodies regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland, including credit card companies, and the punitive interest rates they charge.</p></speech>

I call on all agencies of the State with power in this regard to use it.  When one considers the investigative programme, as one must call it, that was broadcast last night in conjunction with that broadcast on prostitution, trafficking and so on, RTE must be commended.  There is a debate to be held on entrapment, enlightenment and investigative journalism, but the concept of serving the public interest must also be brought into it.</p> <p>I will start by noting that last night it was shown that there were 949 elected councillors, 60 Senators and 166 Deputies, but there were very few such people involved.  I acknowledge that until something is proved, one cannot state anybody is guilty and that anyone who makes a statement must presume innocence until people are found guilty.  However, some rotten apples in a barrel should not be allowed to corrupt what I will not call the entire political system because since it took office, the Government has taken the bull by the horns, if one considers what has been brought forward since.  For example, funding for politicians must now be declared openly, whereas heretofore, it was possible to raise funding.  I refer to the Criminal Justice (Corruption) Bill 2012 and Members should note the date.  As the last speaker noted, councillors who are found guilty should resign, but that will be provided for under the 2012 Bill.  The Government also brought forward the Regulation of Lobbying Act.  In fact, therefore, RTE would be obliged to register as a lobbyist before coming before people.  Legislation in respect of the planning regulator is before the environment committee.  This measure has been sought for 25 years and has been brought forward by the Government.  </p> <p>I reiterate that abusing position for public gain brings the entire public system into disrepute.  If any politician, official or anybody else abuses a position of power, the aforementioned legislation, namely, the Criminal Justice (Corruption) Bill 2012 will bring Ireland in line with the conventions of the United Nations and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, on corruption and bribery and make it possible for convictions to be secured against individuals.  Members also saw at the banking inquiry for how long different things had gone on and who had been found guilty or responsible and who was paying.  The question is: who pays the piper?  As the public gets extremely annoyed when they see people getting away with stuff-----</p></speech>

Interestingly, one report from the United Kingdom shows that in one area &pound;37 million was spent on flood defences, yet, four or five years later, the entire area was flooded again.  Consequently, it is not only about building flood defences but also about making sure they cater adequately for the threats in terms of sudden changes in weather.  This must be prioritised because in the Cork region alone approximately &euro;60 million to &euro;70 million must be spent on flood defences for the city and surrounding areas that have been flooded, including both residential areas and business premises.  It is important to ensure local authorities do not go after business premises that have been flooded for rates for the next 12 months because they are paying a substantial sum of money to keep local authorities going.  I visited one premises recently for which more than &euro;120,000 per year or &euro;2,400 per week was being paid in rates to the local authority.  That is a huge amount of money.  It is now extremely important that any business or premises that has suffered flood damage be given a reprieve from the local authority in the payment of rates for the coming year.  Businesses should be given that allowance because a great number of premises no longer are insured as they were flooded previously and, therefore, do not have insurance this time around.  That is an important step and every possible support must be provided for those commercial premises and people with small businesses that are operating with a tight margin.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colm Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2353"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is eliminating any margin they have.

Anybody who wishes to discuss the matter should be here.  We will provide an hour for the debate.  If nobody is here, there will be no debate so it is up to Members to be here to discuss that matter.</p> <p>Senators Marie Moloney, M&aacute;ir&iacute;a Cahill, Michael Comiskey, Michael Mullins, Diarmuid Wilson and Colm Burke and other Senators spoke about the flooding and storm damage we have seen over the past number of days.  Everybody lauded the work of the emergency services in their efforts to help people.  Senator Moloney outlined the fact that services are available from the Department of Social Protection.  Senator Comiskey also spoke about that matter.  Senator Cahill extended her sympathy to the family of Ivan Vaughan, a gentleman in his seventies who was swept away in the floods, and wished the 14 year old who went into the waters off Hook Head a speedy recovery.  I understand she was part of a scouting group visiting Hook Head and I am sure we all wish that girl well.  Senator Mullins said that the flood defences put in place over the past number of years were holding up.  That is the message that is coming from most areas where flood defences have been installed.  Senator Wilson expressed the wish that people who need aid would get it.  Finance has been put in place under the capital plan, so there is a plan in place for the alleviation of flooding in the areas we see on our television screens so often.  </p> <p>Senator Colm Burke also spoke about flood defences and the need for proper design and planning.  He mentioned the UK.  The ones that have been put in place in Ireland are holding up well.  He argued that a rates waiver should be considered by local authorities, which is a very good idea.  </p> <p>Senators Norris, Craughwell, Brennan, Keane and Bradford mentioned the "RTE Investigates" programme that aired last night.  They rightly pointed out that corruption is a cancer in public life.  The revelations in the programme are shocking and go against the definition and spirit of public service as we know it.  It is unacceptable for any public representative to use their position for financial gain.  Senator Keane mentioned that the Government has strengthened the Freedom of Information Act, established the whistleblower framework and legislated for the creation of a register of lobbying to increase transparency.  Local authority members are designated public officials under the new register of lobbying and their interactions when lobbied must now be reported by lobbyists, thus shining a light on the practice for the first time.  The Government has put measures in place to counteract such lobbying.  I hope these measures will bear fruit and that we will not see what we saw on our screens last night.  Senator Norris also questioned the methods employed by RTE in this programme.  I note his points in that regard.  I agree with Senator Paul Coghlan that in respect of people who received letters from RTE that were found to be wrong, RTE should as a matter of courtesy issue apologies to the people it upset.  I understand how Senator Norris felt at being wrongly accused.  Anybody who is wrongly accused would be shaken.  Apologies should be issued by the national broadcaster where it made false allegations against people.</p> <p>Senators Barrett and Cahill spoke about the death of Fr. Gerry Reynolds and praised his work during the peace process.  I join in their praise.  Senator Paul Coghlan raised the issue of vulture funds and their non-attendance at the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Senator raised that matter on the Order of Business last week and I agree that these companies should be held accountable and, if possible, compelled to appear before the committee.  </p> <p>Senator Sheahan spoke about loan sharks, legal and illegal moneylenders and the exorbitant interest rates that are charged.  He is quite right that there are so-called legal moneylenders charging very exorbitant rates.  He advised people to go to their credit unions.  We have all witnessed people who go to these loan sharks looking for a small amount of money and, in some cases, having to pay double, if not treble, the amount they have actually borrowed.  They are in continuous debt as a result.  The credit union is the place to go for help in that regard.  Most of the other matters raised concerned flooding and the RTE programme, so I think I have dealt with those.  </p></speech>

This Bill builds on the recommendations of the national ports policy published in 2013.  The Bill&rsquo;s primary purpose is to provide the necessary legal basis to allow for the later transfer, by ministerial order, of the five designated ports of regional significance to local authority led governance structures.  Every Senator is aware that, as an island nation, our ports are critical to our ability to trade with the rest of the world.  However, every Senator will also be aware of the social and cultural importance of our ports to the communities and cities in which they are located.</p> <p>The varied stories of our ports&rsquo; development are mirrored in the diversity found today in our modern commercial port network.  Nine State commercial port companies operate under the Harbours Act 1996, namely, Cork, Dublin, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Drogheda, Galway, New Ross, Shannon Foynes, Waterford and Wicklow.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Paschal Donohoe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2244"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2244&amp;amp;pid=PaschalDonohoe&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We also have Rosslare Europort, which, for historical reasons, is a business unit of larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and not subject to the Harbours Acts.  In addition, there is one fully privately-owned port at Greenore and there are various other local authority-controlled ports and fishery harbour centres that handle commercial freight.  To give an example of this diversity, last year Dublin Port handled 21 million tonnes, 7,000 vessels and generated a turnover of &euro;72 million while at the other end of the scale Wicklow Port handled 94,000 tonnes, 56 vessels and generated a turnover of &euro;250,000.  Clearly, different ports perform different functions and service different markets.<br/><br/>The national ports policy recognised these differences through providing a clear outline of the Government's strategy for the sector by categorising the sector into three tiers.  The ports of national significance that come under tier 1 are Dublin, Cork and Shannon Foynes.  Collectively, these three ports handle more than 80% of all tonnage handled in Irish ports in any given year.  All three ports have development master plans and earlier this year I launched the first phase of Shannon Foynes &euro;50 million quayside improvement project.  Both Cork and Dublin received planning permission from An Bord Plean&aacute;la this year in respect of their projects at Ringaskiddy and the Alexandra Basin.  The total outlay on all three projects is more than &euro;350 million and all will be delivered without Exchequer contribution.  All these projects have qualified for EU funding through the TEN-T programme and its related connecting Europe facility, CEF, funding stream.<br/><br/>The ports of national significance that come under tier 2 are Rosslare and Waterford.  These ports together currently handle approximately 7% of total tonnage and offer competition to the larger ports in the economically significant unitised lift-on lift-off and roll-on roll-off trades, while both are well positioned in terms of their ability to service direct routes to Europe and both are well connected to our rail and road networks.  While both ports suffered tonnage losses during the recession, there is no doubt about their potential in the context of ensuring healthy competition within those important unitised trades.  I am happy to inform Senators that both ports are now recovering the tonnage lost in recent years.<br/><br/>The ports of regional significance are Drogheda, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Galway, New Ross and Wicklow.  These are the ports which are central to the Bill. Currently, they handle approximately 4.5% of total national tonnage, which represents a decrease of more than 30% in their collective market share when compared to 2000.  Within these five ports there are very different stories, with some quite dramatic decreases in tonnage at D&uacute;n Laoghaire, New Ross and Wicklow while both Galway and Drogheda are performing reasonably well in terms of tonnage handled, albeit at a lower level than in previous years.<br/><br/>I recognise that there are those with particular interests which may question the need to make any change to the <i>status quo</i>.  Some of these local interests made their voices heard during debates in the Lower House.  However, at a national, strategic level we must be clear about which ports are fundamentally significant for national performance and which ports are crucial for regional performance.  Notwithstanding some of the contributions made during the Bill's progress through the Lower House, I believe the approach adopted by the Government is broadly accepted by the D&aacute;il as being one of common sense.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications in its pre-legislative scrutiny report stated that the &quot;overall purpose of the Bill was broadly supported by the Committee&quot;.  In respect of the ports of regional significance, the national ports policy explicitly recognises that these five ports continue to play an important role for their regional hinterland.  This is an important policy statement in respect of those ports.  However, this role is not one that requires central government oversight.  In line with the Government's reforms of local government, the oversight of these regionally significant ports should be devolved to the most appropriate level of government - the local authority.  This devolution of responsibility will allow these ports develop as required by their regional economies and in tandem with their regional communities.  The change in perspective will enrich and enhance their future development and better aligns the needs of local authorities, regional economies and the ports themselves.<br/><br/>Senators will note that the Bill is flexible enough to allow for either the continuation of the existing company and a transfer of the ministerial shareholding to the local authority or a dissolution of the existing company and a physical transfer of all assets, liabilities and employees into the local authority.  This flexibility in primary legislation is, I believe, entirely appropriate.  I have been clear throughout the debates on this Bill that for some of these ports the requirement that a separate statutory company oversee and manage the port may no longer be appropriate.  Equally, for other ports, the continuation of the corporate model and the recognition of an entity enshrined in company law could well be the best fit.  My Department has made funding available to local authorities for due diligence in respect of all five companies.  The results will inform the model of transfer ultimately chosen for each particular port.<br/><br/>I will turn now to the key provisions of the Bill, which are found in parts 2, 3 and 5.  Part 2 deals with the first of the two possible transfer methods, that of a transfer of shareholding in the existing company.  Section 8 provides the power to transfer the shareholding in a port company.  Any order will be made by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, as the other current shareholder, and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.<br/><br/>Section 9 provides a potentially interesting new dynamic to our commercial ports sector.  It allows for the local authority chief executive, subject to the consent of the elected members of the council and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, to consider a divestment of shares in a transferred port company to the private sector.  The section ensures continued public ownership of the port through limiting any such disposal to 49% of the shares in the company.  This represents a new potential method of funding for future development in these transferred port companies, one that is not currently a feature of the sector.<br/><br/>Section 10 provides for a general ministerial power of direction to the transferred port companies in respect of the national ports policy.  The section requires the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to consult  both the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the chief executive of the local authority prior to issuing any such direction.  This requirement for consultation addresses a concern the Oireachtas joint committee identified with regard to its potential unilateral use and possible interference in company operations.  The section explicitly restricts its use to general policy matters only and cannot be used to direct a company to act in a particular manner in a particular instance.  <br/><br/>Sections 11 to 27 lay out the administration of the transferred companies under the new local authority shareholding arrangements.  It is important to note that the Harbours Acts will continue to apply to any company which transfers under this transfer of shareholding model.  As the Harbours Acts contain a number of explicit provisions relating to the ministerial shareholding, these sections require amendment to reflect the fact that the shareholding has transferred.  The exercise of these shareholder functions will primarily be one for the chief executive but the Bill also provides for a number of important oversight functions for the elected members of local authorities.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Paschal Donohoe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2244"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2244&amp;amp;pid=PaschalDonohoe&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Section 11 lists the 17 sections of the Harbours Acts that will no longer apply to a transferred company.  These sections require an active role for the shareholder in consenting to something.  Obviously, as the shareholding has changed, these particular sections can no longer apply and amended versions of these sections are instead included within sections 13 to 27, inclusive.  Many of these sections are routine in nature such as section 14, which requires any change to a transferred company&rsquo;s memorandum and articles of association to be approved by the local authority chief executive.</p><p>I will instead, therefore, focus on a number of the more substantive sections and also on the role of elected members generally in the oversight of these transferred companies.  Where the transfer of shareholding model is chosen as the transfer method, the company structure remains in place, as it exists today.  An important consideration in the model is to ensure the appropriate balance between the commercial freedom of the company and democratic oversight.  The Bill achieves that balance through providing for a number of specific oversight functions for elected members of a council.  First and foremost, section 23 requires the chairperson and CEO of a transferred company to appear before the council, if invited, and account for the administration of the company.  Second, section 22 provides that a proposed chairperson of a transferred company shall appear before the elected members prior to his or her formal appointment.  This mirrors the current practice of prospective chairpersons appearing before the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications.  The Government introduced this practice and it has proven valuable in allowing elected representatives question prospective chairpersons on their vision and ambition for the company.  In many ways, the power that will be afforded to local authority members is similar to the power Oireachtas Members have by virtue of their membership of the committee.</p><p>Section 19 requires the annual audited accounts of the transferred company accompanied by a report on the year to be laid before the elected members.  While ultimately a matter for the relevant local authority, there is an obvious link between the submission of these accounts and the power of elected members to require a chairperson and CEO to appear before the council under section 23.  The consent of the elected council will also be required where the disposal of shares in the transferred company to the private sector is envisaged.  With regard to board appointments to these transferred companies, I am clear that the improvements to the board appointment process generally must also apply to any transferred company.  Section 22, therefore, mirrors the improvements introduced in section 39 to those companies remaining under ministerial shareholding.  Directors will be selected through the State board appointment process launched last February.  The Bill requires that certain skill sets must be present on the board including maritime transport, financial, legal and commercial skills.  The Bill also indicates a further set of skill sets which might be considered for board level representation such as infrastructure planning or environmental management.  The local authority chief executive will formally appoint the persons recommended by the Public Appointments Service.  The maximum total service of a director will be ten years, which will allow for both the development of board level experience and also provide fresh thinking which is a necessary feature of any board.  The central oversight of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as regards board fees will continue.  The CEO of a transferred company will, as of today, be appointed by the board of the company following consultation with the local authority chief executive.  The central oversight function of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of the terms and conditions of CEOs will be maintained.  These are the key issues addressed in Part 2.</p><p>However, the legislation also provides for a second transfer method within Part 3.  This model is called "transfer and dissolution of companies", and it is outlined in sections 28 to 33.  These sections are based on existing precedents generally and provide for the dissolution of the company as body corporate and its complete integration within normal local authority structures.  The port would be administered as a functional area of the local authority.  All employees would transfer, as would all property, assets and liabilities of the company.  The legislation provides for the continuation of any harbour and pilotage limits.</p><p>Part 5, covering sections 37 to section 49, comprises technical amendments to the existing Harbours Acts which are being made on foot of submissions made during consultations or on foot of experience gained in the years since the previous amendments.  Three important elements to this Part further improve the overall corporate governance culture within the ports sector.  Section 39 amends the board appointment process through introducing mandatory skill sets and introducing overall term limits of ten years.  Section 40 introduces a new statutory provision regarding the accountability of a chairperson and CEO of a port company to elected representatives.  The section requires that the chairperson and CEO appear before the joint Oireachtas committee, if invited to do so, and account for the administration of the port company.  Section 42 extends the current prohibition on Deputies, MEPs and Senators serving on the boards of port companies to councillors.  This will apply equally to companies whose shareholding remains with the Minister and those where the shareholding transfers to a local authority shareholding model.  National ports policy is clear that the boards of port companies must comprise individuals with the necessary skills required of any commercial company.  I am legislating for that in sections 22 and 39.  There have been instances in the past where councillors serving on port company boards have had to absent themselves from discussions at board meetings and from council discussions on topics due to potential conflicts of interest.  When people elect their local representative, they obviously do not want to see his or her contribution to local democracy restricted in such a manner.</p><p>As I hope is clear to the House, the Bill is an important step in the development of the commercial ports sector and represents an important contribution to the further devolution of responsibility from central to local government.  The changes introduced will enhance the ports&rsquo; role as centres of their regional economy, deepen the economic development role envisaged for local authorities and improve the corporate governance and democratic accountability of the sector overall.  Our ports sector is critical to our nation and to our economy.  As an island nation, we need to ensure our ports sector is positioned to deliver cost effective and efficient services, irrespective of whether their significance is national or regional.  The amendments the Bill proposes in respect of board structures will enhance the corporate performance of our ports and ensure they continue to fulfil their vitally important role as facilitators of our economy.  During the past year, I have had the opportunity to visit and meet the boards of almost all our ports and to appreciate at first hand the necessary and vital contribution they make to our economy and growth within our country.  It is frequently understood that they make such a contribution to our export economy but what is less frequently understood is the role they play in respect of imports whereby products such as oil and petroleum, which are vital to the functioning of our economy, are brought in through our ports, along with other raw materials.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Paschal Donohoe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2244"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2244&amp;amp;pid=PaschalDonohoe&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Value is added to them in our country and then they are exported again.  I am very clear that how we support that sector in future will be an increasingly important part of how our country prospers.

It will not be opposed by my party at this stage, if at all.  Our ports and harbours are one of our most important pieces of infrastructure with regard to the overall economy, communications and goods inwards and outwards.  I speak as someone with the privilege of serving for 16 years as a director of a number of harbour boards in the west and on the Shannon in particular under various denominations.  I was a director of the Limerick harbour board and the Shannon Foynes Port Company, along with a number of other local authority members.  The prohibition on Deputies, MEPs and Senators serving on boards will now be extended to include councillors and although I know the chestnut has been debated well, I have very mixed feelings about it.  In the 16 years in which I represented Kerry on the Shannon Estuary, the best-informed and least personally biased directors - aside from parochial interests - would have been county councillors.  If a board is to be created where members cannot have another interest, it will be very difficult to form any board.  If somebody from the business sector is put on, who is the say the person does not have financial arrangements regarding import or export for a particular harbour?  It is very difficult to find somebody who would be squeaky clean.</p><p>When I was first elected here in 2007, I was followed by a Standards in Public Office, SIPO, request or a complaint about me from a disgruntled person in Kerry who felt I had over-extended myself by representing the interests of the harbour board on Kerry County Council with regard to a planning matter.  For a while I was worried about the complications as I had no axe to grind or anything to gain personally.  I suppose the harbour board and the interests of the county council did, to a certain extent, overlap.  As a member of both, I felt it was my duty to represent both.  I was fortunate to receive a full and positive exoneration by SIPO.  I can see the other view as well.  There is a blanket exclusion of county councillors, notwithstanding what we saw in last night's programme.  That expos&eacute; asked more questions about RTE than it did of councillors.  I heard my colleague, Senator Brennan, making the point that we know and have worked with councillors, and they are decent, honourable people.  Like every other job in the world, there are aberrations and anomalies, with people doing the wrong thing.  We are proud of our councillors and we are proud to be elected by them.  I am digressing from the question but the blanket exclusion of county councillors should be considered more seriously.</p><p>The Minister has indicated the Bill is not prescriptive but sets out the framework by which statutory instruments can be used.  There is a question about that.  As the Taoiseach famously asked, does Paddy know everything then?  We are voting on the outline of legislation but the devil will be in the detail when the Minister introduces a statutory instrument.  What level of control and oversight will we have of that?  Will the Minister accept that this should be teased out on a committee level with various parties so we could have the main bullet points of what the statutory instrument might entail?  I will not exaggerate and say we are creating an enabling Act like Hitler but we are giving the Minister <i>carte blanche</i>to a certain extent.  Fianna F&aacute;il supports the transfer of responsibility for the regional ports and harbours to local authorities.  We would like greater detail from the Minister at a later stage.  As I stated, we would like a draft statutory instrument to be made available to the joint committee.</p><p>I am sure the Minister agrees it is important that councils inheriting responsibility for harbour boards should not be heirs to any dogs tied, as we say in Kerry.  There should not be any debts, as some of these debts are often hidden.  It is important that this is done with a clean sheet and not by carrying legacy issues or problems.  I am sure the people from the east coast have their views on what are to be designated regional harbours on the east coast.  The only ones I am reasonably familiar with on my own side of the coast - apart, naturally, from Shannon - is Cork and Dublin.  Shannon, Cork and Dublin are responsible for 80% of all cargo handling in this country.  The Shannon Estuary is the biggest bulk cargo handling port in Ireland.  It is probably second only to Rotterdam with regard to its natural deep harbour.</p><p>I do not want to pre-empt the comments of my colleague from Galway but to a certain extent, its port seems to be losing out.  Galway is the only port of consequence north of Kerry on the west coast.  Knock Airport proved to be central to the revival of the west and I want to ensure nothing in this Bill will downgrade or make less appealing the facilities in Galway.  Designations have a habit of creating their own problems.  We have the three major harbours, a raft of important harbours and then smaller harbours.  Fenit's facility was transferred to the local authority in Kerry without much trouble.  Has the Minister given sufficient thought to how central Galway's port is to the economy of the west and mid-west?</p><p>I could go on at length but the bottom line is we are giving the Minister the go-ahead at this stage.  We wish the Bill well but we will consider the detail later.</p></speech>

As the Minister indicated, this Bill will continue what was Government policy from 1999 to 2011, when 13 of our smaller harbours were transferred to local authority control.  The Bill deals with the ports of regional significance, including the ports at Drogheda, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Galway, New Ross and Wicklow.  This will bring about the dissolution of the existing port companies and transfer of all assets, liabilities and employees to the relevant local authorities.</p> <p>Taking into consideration the Government's many reforms of local government, the oversight of these regional ports will now be the responsibility of local government.  This devolution of responsibility will allow the ports to continue to develop, as required by the regional economy and in tandem with the regional community.  The change in perspective will enrich and enhance their future development and better align the needs of local authorities.  For some ports, the requirement that a separate statutory company should oversee and manage the port may no longer be appropriate.</p> <p>As the Minister stated, as an island nation we rely on our ports for the majority of imports and exports.  Our agricultural and pharmaceutical industries account for nearly &euro;25 billion exports, so it is important that our ports are run in an efficient manner.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Pat O'Neill:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2364"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2364&amp;amp;pid=PatONeill&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->He said in his speech that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport will provide funding for local authorities in respect of all five companies and that the results of this exercise will inform the model of transfer ultimately chosen for each port.  As the Minister said, the Bill is flexible enough to allow for a continuation of the existing company and the transfer of the ministerial shareholding to the local authority, or the dissolution of the existing company and a physical transfer of all assets, liabilities and employees to the local authority.  This is dealt with at sections 8 and 9, which I will address with later in my contribution.</p><p>In 2013, just over 800 vessels called to the five designated regional ports named in the Bill - in other words, about one every two days for each port.  Four of these ports returned a profit in 2013, with the exception of D&uacute;n Laoghaire, although it technically no longer operates as a commercial goods transit port.  Of the 26 ports in Ireland, only five will now not be in local authority control, that is, Dublin, Cork, Shannon Foynes, Rosslare, which involves Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, and the port of Waterford, which is actually in County Kilkenny.  I would remind the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment Community and Local Government, Deputy Coffey, that he is not getting it back.</p><p>When the Bill is passed and the amendments made, it is important that proper structures are put in place so the executive and members of the local authority can perform due diligence and that the new port authorities, together with the audited accounts, can appear before the local authority members, as the Minister has outlined.  I welcome the fact the Minister said funding will now be in place to support the five ports because it is important they are not placed under financial strain as these transitions take place.  In this regard, I would appreciate it if the Minister could tell the House how much funding is going to be put in place.  It is important no financial burden is placed on the local authorities, although section 8 suggests a fairly straightforward transfer, if that is the model that is put in place.</p><p>Given the LEOs are in place in each local authority area, it is important the ports work closely with the LEOs to ensure continued economic growth and development in their areas.  As they say, all politics is local, and the members of the local authority, in conjunction with the new ports boards, will know exactly what is necessary in order to achieve this.</p><p>Section 9 is perhaps the most controversial section, in that up to 49% of the shares may be privatised.  In that regard, who would value the shareholdings of the ports?  What rights would the new shareholders have in regard to properties of the ports?  We must remember that Aer Lingus and Eircom were State companies that were privatised.  There is a fear that if we go down this road, we might come to a point where we lose control of the ports.</p><p>I welcome the Bill.  It is important that we continue to develop our ports.  As an island nation, much of our exports and imports have to come through the ports and we do not yet have a tunnel to Europe or Britain, unless the Minister is going to make an announcement about that in the near future, given the economic upturn.  Everything has to come in through the ports.  It is important we do not keep the pressure too high on the main ports of Dublin, Cork and Shannon-Foynes and that the regions are also looked after.  I welcome the Bill.  I ask the Minister to give us more detail in regard to section 9, which is the most important section in that some areas may be privatised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-12-08a.74" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015120800002#S00200"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  It has been of interest to see how policy in this area has developed.  When I served on the Culliton committee in the early 1980s, the issue then was to reproduce the efficiency of Larne at ports in this State, and I think that was substantially accomplished.  Competition between ports had an impact then, and a substantial impact on the lack of efficiency at Dublin Port was achieved by competition from Waterford when the containers went there, and also from ports like Drogheda.</p> <p>The scope for inter-port competition is limited, as the Competition Authority said in its report, and therefore we have to look at competition within ports, or intra-port competition.  The issues raised by the Competition Authority should be addressed in this legislation, in particular the allocation of leases on terminals within Dublin Port and making sure there are enough stevedores to ensure competition.  It seems that, yet again, the Competition Authority's views have been forgotten by the other Ministers around the Cabinet table, and the same happened last week in regard to the views on the conveyancing monopoly.  Competition is essential in this island economy.  Ministers should liaise with the Competition Authority and should take on board what I consider an excellent and impressive report by its economist, Ciar&aacute;n Aylward, who also gave a presentation to TCD students.</p> <p>If competition between ports is limited, and we do not look at restrictive practices within ports, particularly within Dublin Port, we are not doing any great favours to the competitiveness of Ireland as a country.  In a minority report to the Murphy report on ports, which was commissioned by the then Minister, Mr. Michael Woods, I recommended that we should run ports as a business.  That is what we want.  Ports need customers, namely, the shipping companies and the shippers on the land side.  Where they do not have them, as Senator O'Neill has just said in regard to D&uacute;n Laoghaire, it is a ghastly prospect because a lot of investment has gone in but it is sitting there, doing nothing.  It is very sad to see the D&uacute;n Laoghaire harbour front in its current state, with the facilities built for Sealink, which are no longer wanted.</p> <p>I am a little nervous about the local authority model.  The McLoughlin report, which is gathering dust in the Custom House, showed substantial excess managerial layers in local government.  I do not know if we will improve the productivity of ports by transferring them to the local authorities.  I do not know many people who would come in here to say local authorities are so efficient that we should do more things through them.  Given the Irish Water example, they might be thinking the opposite, namely, that we should not let the local authorities determine their definition of productivity because, when it is made explicit, as with the water charges, we can get some appalling results.</p> <p>We need to look at the first recommendation of the Competition Authority on the leasing and licensing of the Dublin lo-lo terminals.  The Competition Authority said this was a matter for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in the first instance and in November 2013 the Department was asked for its view on the leasing and licensing of Dublin lo-lo terminals as an essential part of improving the efficiency of ports.  The second recommendation concerned stevedore licensing.  The Competition Authority stated that, for Dublin Port, at least two new general stevedore licences should be issued by the Dublin Port company, one on the north side and one on the south of side of the port, and it recommended consideration of this by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  We have to address those issues.</p> <p>We need more analysis of what has been happening in the south east, given that Arklow is virtually shut and Wicklow deals with a very small number of vessels, as the Minister said in his speech.  What is the future of Rosslare?  There is a secret report on it, and the Minister referred to some correspondence that is on the website of the Competition Authority.  Has Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann an interest in it any longer?  It removed the railway tracks and the railway now ends about a half mile before the port.  If passengers try to get a passenger train through Rosslare to get on the ferry, they could face a walk of some hundreds of yards in the rain.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Sean D. Barrett:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2370"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2370&amp;amp;pid=SeanDBarrett&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I do not know why.  We got a grant from the European Union.  The buses still use the terminal but the railway mysteriously left.  There is no longer any rail connection between Waterford and Rosslare Harbour.</p><p>A huge facility was put in at Belview, which is in County Kilkenny, as Senator O&rsquo;Neill has reminded us.  We accept that point but has it lived up to expectations?  Although it has been recovering recently, why did traffic fall?  Is there something in the management or in the way Waterford sells its services to customers in the freight forwarding sector?  The high hopes for Belview and the Port of Waterford have not been realised.  Drogheda and New Ross are both on the border between counties - Drogheda between Louth and Meath and New Ross between Kilkenny and Wexford - so which local authority do we mean?  I am inclined to look askance at the idea of letting any local authority run those ports.  Is local authority the model that gives the least cost result?  I share people&rsquo;s misgivings about Galway too.  Is local government in Galway so efficient in any legendary sense that it should take over a harbour which has been doing quite well, retaining a good oil business from Whitegate?  The harbour had to do the numbers on whether the oil went from Whitegate to Galway by road, rail or ship and managed to get the best contract.  Will that kind of efficiency be lost if Galway Harbour goes into the local authority structure?</p><p>It is good that the very substantial loss of business from the ports in the Republic of Ireland to Larne has been won back, not by restrictive practices but by making our ports more efficient.  I thank Larne and its manager, Denis Galway, for showing us how to do that.  We learned the lessons and have retrieved a substantial amount of business that used to go over the Border to Larne, Warrenpoint and Belfast.  Let us not eliminate the prospect of competition within Dublin Port and the remaining competition, which is probably small at this stage, as stated by Ciar&aacute;n Aylward of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  He adds that we must improve competition within ports.  When there was some mining in Kilkenny, there was a choice to go to either Cork or Waterford Ports and Cork won that competition.</p><p>I would like to see a more commercial emphasis on keeping pressure on this sector.  As the Minister said, in serving an export-orientated island economy, we need ports performing at the highest level.  I hope the Department and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission will combine in their efforts to extract monopolistic rents where they still occur in the sector.  Let us see the numbers to show that Galway and Drogheda would be better run by the local authority than by a separate port company, facing competition.  If they are not efficient, they lose the business.  Is that not the test rather than whether we see them as part of local authorities?</p></speech>

I welcome this Bill and note that it will further enhance the corporate governance structures of all port companies, that the oversight functions make sense and are useful and that the transfers support the Government forums in the area of local government through enhancing the role of the local authority in regional economic development.  That is a welcome step and demonstrates the Minister&rsquo;s commitment in this regard but it also demonstrates a common sense approach to accountability, which is very welcome.</p> <p>I have found the contributions interesting and look forward to the next Stages of the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-12-08a.77" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1155" speakername="Kathryn Reilly" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015120800002#T00300"><p>I echo the sentiments of many Senators that the harbours are a very important part of coastal communities, providing recreation and commerce, and as a major asset in attracting tourism, especially for an island.  They can be engines for growth and a sustainable source of good employment.  Access to the sea brings many opportunities but it also brings the challenges of maintaining and growing that opportunity.  It is unfortunate that some harbours have gone to rack and ruin which has a domino effect on some of our local economies.  It is important that we do all we can to enhance and support the potential of harbours, particularly in their efforts to support growth and employment opportunities.  For that reason, a harbour policy must have at its core a drive to maximise the potential of the harbours to support and encourage growth and job creation and, most importantly, to do so in a sustainable and environmentally sound way which incorporates the community in important decision-making.</p> <p>This Bill is taking a step in the right direction.  The Minister mentioned that oversight of these regionally significant ports should be devolved to the most appropriate level of government, which is the local authority.  One concern raised by my colleague, Deputy Ellis, in the D&aacute;il was that the Bill can be seen to be empowering local authority chief executive officers and less so the local councillors.  The CEO is not elected and that person can often be at odds with the elected officials in local authorities who derive their mandate from the local community in democratic elections.</p> <p>In what respect are we devolving oversight to the local authority?  How much will go to the CEO?  What is the balance between the councillors and the CEO?  Studies by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, show that councils are very efficient at managing and overseeing local services because of their local know-how and expertise to complete the job at hand.  They have the support of the public.  It does not always work perfectly but our local authorities are more accountable than those in corporate spheres.</p> <p>The Minister said this Bill tries to balance the commercial needs with democratic oversight.  That needs to happen and it is a fine line to try to do that.  Democratic oversight is an important ingredient in finding success in the management of the harbours but it also ensures success benefits the wider community which will last for generations.  We need to get the balance right and make sure there is a greater level of democratic accountability.</p> <p>We are told that the controls will be handed over to the local authority but can the Minister give us a picture of that in reality?  Will control rest primarily with new bodies established by the CEOs of the local authorities?  What accountability will there be to councillors as opposed to the CEO?  Will there be adequate consultation on the directors nominated to each harbour?  The Minister said the proposed chairperson will appear before members prior to formal appointment but is that just to question them?  Is that the only role they may have?  Concerns were raised in the other House about the board&rsquo;s ability to sell off assets without consideration or oversight by local authorities.  Could this lead to some damaging sell-offs that may be against the wishes of the local community?  I welcome the role of the local authority members in overseeing the accounts of the harbour companies under section 19.  I hope the link the Minister mentioned between this and section 23 is real and the councillors can employ this.  Local authority members should be allowed to debate the accounts and have oversight of the audits of the harbour company.  What role will local authorities have in respect of performance reviews, given their role in ensuring the provision of quality services and value for public money?</p> <p>We support this legislation because it makes the harbour structure more democratic and accountable but I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s response to some of the questions raised.  He probably responded to them in the other House but I would like them to be included in the Official Report of the debate in this House.  I look forward to debating the Bill further.</p></speech>

The Competition Authority estimates that our ports handle approximately 84% of the volume of all merchandise and trade and 62% in terms of value.  As an island nation, our ports are critical to our ability to trade throughout the world.</p><p>The purpose of this Bill is to allow for the transfer by ministerial order of control of the five ports of regional significance, Drogheda, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Galway, New Ross and Wicklow to local authority-led government structures.  Some people will cringe when they hear that.  I am aware Senator Barrett has reservations in this regard.  However, I note, as did Senator Reilly, that an important consideration in the model is to ensure the appropriate balance between the commercial freedom of the company and democratic oversight.  This is a key element of the Bill.  It is important that the commercial entity be allowed to exercise freedom also and that there is democratic oversight.</p><p>As someone whose grandfather was a sea captain who plied his trade on a three-masted schooner from Waterford to Wales and as a person who worked in the Port of Waterford for over 20 years, I have a love of ports and port activity in Ireland and worldwide.  To answer Senator Barrett's question as to why the Port of Waterford thrived since it moved to Belview, there are a number of reasons for this.  Having witnessed the storm damage of recent days, I recall that storm damage once brought down the main crane in the Port of Waterford.  There was also had the demise of the major customer on which the port was probably over dependent, namely, Bell Lines.  These were the main reasons for the lack of growth of the port.</p><p>I am happy to say that under the new board and management, things are improving significantly.  There is no reason this should not be the case.  It is a port with a load-on, load-off facility and where trains can go right in under the gantries.  In respect of trains however, CIE abdicated its responsibility in regard to rail transport and just did not want to know about the port  20 years ago.  I do not know if the situation is any different now.  It has not been competitive in its rates.  At that time the Port of Waterford was served by three or four trains from Dublin at weekends.  Trains also came from Belfast, from Ballina - with freight from the Asahi plant - and from all over the country.  Now such traffic is negligible, mainly because CIE was uncompetitive and abandoned it.  That is why we see so much heavy goods traffic on our roads.  This must be rethought in the context of a transport policy for the country.</p><p>I agree with Senator O'Sullivan and I abhor the blanket exclusion of councillors because, over the years, I have known many good councillors who were excellent members of port companies or harbour commissions.  Now that these ports are coming under the local authority umbrella, councillors should be included on the boards.  What is the reason for excluding them?  There can be no conflicts of interest in that regard.</p><p>In the context of local authorities, section 23 of the Bill requires that the chairperson and chief executive of the transferred company can appear before the elected council, if invited, to account for the administration of the company.  I am of the view that we should not include the words "if invited" and that these individuals should come in each year to report to the relevant local authority.  If the local authority is taking over the port, why should there not be an annual report from the chief executive of the port authority?  We need to reconsider the use of the phrase "if invited" in the context of our discussion on the later Stages of this Bill.  It should be a requirement that they report to the council.  If we are giving control to the local authorities, why not give them the power to question the report.  If councillors are being excluded totally from the boards, surely they should have the facility to question the chairman and chief executive of these ports each year.  There is no point in excluding the councillors totally.</p><p>In general, I welcome the Bill which has come about as a result of the review of port policy.  It is a step in the right direction, but we will need to monitor the model on a regular basis to see how well it works.  I am sure we will have many teething problems before these companies are set up under the local authorities.  I welcome the Bill but I have reservations in regard to the total exclusion of councillors.  If they are to be excluded from these bodies, then the local authorities' oversight and that of the chairmen and chief executives should be extended to those members each year.</p></speech>

I welcome this Bill in so far as it provides for democratic oversight of the running of our harbours.  It is important there be accountability for such assets of the State to the State.  However, like Senators Cummins and O'Sullivan, I have reservations regarding the exclusion of local councillors - the people on the ground who know exactly what is going on - from membership of the boards.  I can understand why Oireachtas Members or Members of the European Parliament might be excluded but I cannot for the life of me understand why we would want to exclude the people who live locally and who have an interest in developing their local harbours.  I am delighted the Bill provides that any transfer will involve discussions with the relevant trade unions.  That is a positive step which will make the transfer somewhat easier.</p><p>In regard to D&uacute;n Laoghaire, I have worked and lived adjacent to D&uacute;n Laoghaire for over 20 years and have watched the direction the port has taken and seen the loss of lines to and from Britain.  The <i>HSS Stena Explorer</i>has gone and that was a serious knock for the port.  However, I have watched D&uacute;n Laoghaire develop a yachting industry.  I believe that if these port companies were left to their own devices, they would respond and find a way forward for themselves.  I was born and reared within sight of Galway Port and spent many long summer days there.  Notwithstanding that this port lost the trade of Tynagh Mines several years ago, it managed to move its entire oil storage system from the centre of the city out onto a little island just off the harbour.  There is also a massive coal import industry through Galway Port.  Again, left to its own devices, I believe Galway would probably respond better than it will under the cumbersome management of a local authority.</p><p>I agree with Senator Barrett that local authorities are not exactly known for their dynamic, market-focused approach towards driving issues forward.  I am not sure that is the right way forward.  I agree with Senator Cummins that the annual report should be part of the reporting mechanism for the harbour boards locally.  I am somewhat concerned by the level of authority we are ceding to the chief executive officers of local authorities.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

For some reason, we seem to be sidelining the harbour master.  Maybe I am wrong and, if so, the Minister might correct me but it appears the harbour master's attendance at board meetings is at the discretion of the board.  Anything he or she may have to say is at the discretion of board.  The harbour master does not have a right to cast a vote at a board meeting.  Surely, the harbour master is the person who knows what is happening on the ground and, like a chief executive officer in a major company, should have the right to cast a vote at any meetings.  That is all I am willing to say on it.  Overall, I welcome the move to bring some form of democratic accountability to harbours.  Those are some of my concerns.</p></speech>

The importance of our ports and harbours cannot be over-emphasised, as has been mentioned by many of my colleagues.  Ports which are not a requirement as commercial ports for the area in which they are located should be developed into ports of recreation and amenity.  A river flowing through a town should enhance that town rather than, as in some instances, detract from it, perhaps due to a lack of investment in the hinterland of the river.  To be parochial, in Dundalk's case, very little if any of the limited amount of cargo coming through the port is actually for Dundalk or its immediate hinterland.  This is already well-served by the ports of Drogheda and Greenore.  Incidentally, I began my working life at the very port which contributes significantly to the economy of the entire area and the Cooley peninsula.  It is doubtful if trade through Dundalk could meet the cost of dredging the port without Government assistance.  This dredging has to take place on a fairly regular basis as far as ports go.  In the event of a transfer to Louth County Council, what body will shoulder any trading deficit or the cost of dredging the port when the need arises?</p><p>I, too, disagree with elected members of county councils being excluded from directorships.  I am not convinced this is a good idea.  I refer to the experience of elected members, and I am familiar with two or three from my 25 years on Louth County Council.  One, in particular, although not of my political persuasion, could run any port in this country given his tremendous experience, and I do not say that lightly.  To exclude a man of that calibre and with that experience from any board is wrong.  </p><p>I could not countenance costs being the responsibility of Louth County Council, which has difficulty enough in balancing its budget at present, but I admit I am not fully aware of the detail of this transfer.  However, there are a number of scenarios which will require to be addressed before the transfer actually place.  What was the recent experience of Dublin Port when it was charged with the running of the local Dundalk Port?</p><p>There is a Latin motto over the door of Ballymascanlon hotel, <i>Festina Lente.  </i>Latin scholars could probably translate it.  It means,<i></i>hasten slowly.  We should apply that motto to the transfer to Dundalk Port to Louth County Council.</p></speech>

In general, an updating of ports policy is welcome and on this basis, I welcome this legislation.  However, the Minister will be aware that politicians in the west have had particular difficulty with the legislation, specifically the decision which still remains active, to place Galway on the lowest rung of ports in this country.  I, therefore, very much welcome the Minister's decision not to sign any commencement order until planning decisions are finalised in Galway and elsewhere.  However, while this is welcome, I wish to bring some of the concerns of the people in Galway to the Minister's attention.  They and I would be interested to know the commercial or economic reasons for the proposed transfer of ownership.  They are of the view that there is little or no benefit to such a transfer.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's view on that issue.  There is also a general concern that for a city of its size and potential and for a port serving a vast area of the coastline, the absence of a modern national port is unacceptable.  If this comes to pass, as outlined, there will be no national port from Foynes to Donegal and, as stated, in the other House, Foynes is nearer to Cork than it is to Galway.</p> <p>Access to TEN-T funding was mentioned in previous debates.  In the D&aacute;il, the Minister of State was at pains to point out that Galway or a local authority port would still be eligible.  However, the legislation seems to have Drogheda, D&uacute;n Laoghaire and Galway remaining as limited companies with their shareholding held by the CEO of the local authority.  Only the first two seem to have been included with Dublin Port as eligible for TEN-T funding.  It would, therefore, seem to those involved that Galway has been excluded and is, therefore, the only commercial port of its size in the country to be excluded from TEN-T funding.  The Minister will be aware that this can amount to up to 20% of capital expenditure for the proposed extension of Galway Port.  What reassurance can the Minister offer the people of Galway that they will not be disadvantaged when seeking funding? </p> <p>While the Minister's decision not to sign a commencement order is welcome, the issue still remains outstanding pending the expansion of Galway Port.  My view is that the port of Galway should have been afforded the same status as Waterford and Rosslare Ports, that is, tier 2 status.  The decision would appear to have been taken without any regard to future capacity and made on the present tonnage and capacity.  Galway needs to be a national port and eligible for TEN-T funding.  The Minister should be aware that the effect of not being a tier 1 or a tier 2 port will make it extremely difficult to attract investment funds for the port's extension as potential investors in the sector will look to national port.</p> <p>I see no provision in the Bill setting out the criteria for any port to be upgraded to a tier 1 or a tier 2 port.  If this were in place, the people of Galway could see what is required in order to benefit from an upgrading.  It would bring much clarity to the situation.  Will the Minister look again at the legislation in this regard to see whether it would be possible to insert a section on what the requirements would be to move between designations?  Galway Port has the potential to become a major employer and a major source of revenue, not only for Galway but for the western region.  This is not a flight of fancy; it is a fact.  There is significant cruise ship business going untapped.  To attract this investment, there is a need for an upgrade of the port and it is vital that it achieves tier 2 status to do this.  The current proposal has the potential to hamstring any future development by making investment in the port unattractive.  I urge the Minister to examine my constructive suggestion and to include a provision to enable a port to upgrade if it meets these suitable criteria.  Again, I thank the Minister for his decision to postpone the signing of the commencement order.</p></speech>

I will address some of the common themes raised with me and then possibly address some of the specific matters raised by Senators.  I thank Members for offering broad support for the Bill.  </p><p>A core theme that emerged in the points made by colleagues was the role of councillors in local authorities.  There are two ways by which a transfer can take place.  The first is complete dissolution, by which method the company is merged with the local authority its entirety.  The concerns raised by Senators are more likely to emerge in the second model which is referred to in the Bill as a transfer of shareholding.  It means that the company will be transferred to the local authority, with the key difference being the shareholding will be held by the local authority as opposed to the Minister of the day.  In that context, I respectfully suggest the potential in the past for a perceived conflict of interest, let alone an actual conflict of interest, could become even bigger.  I will give an example of what I am referring to.  </p><p>Let us take a scenario in which the accounts of the company are being laid in front of the local authority, as required.  This involves their being laid in front of a body of which a director of the company issuing the accounts could be a member.  The director could find himself or herself in a position where he or she might not be able to engage in detail on the accounts, but questions would be raised concerning whether it was appropriate for accounts to be laid in front of the local authority of which the director was a member.</p></speech>

The answer is I have great faith in the ability of members of local authorities to exercise that power.  We are going to be in a situation where a local authority will be able to quiz the chairman of the board of a port or harbour.  If I am conferring that power on it, which represents a very significant change in its relationship with a port, is it not enough for me to confer it without requiring it to exercise it?  I would expect local authorities to exercise the power far more regularly than once a year.  </p> <p>On the different situations that could develop, an aspect that perhaps was not touched on enough on Second Stage - it can be dealt with at a later point; Senators understandably and correctly focused on the steps we were taking towards democratic accountability through the auspices of the local authority - was the great benefit to be gained in proper planning and the integration of a port into the local authority unit and community in which it was located.  I look at the issue raised by Senator Hildegarde Naughton and other colleagues about the port in Galway and pose the question as to whether it would be a more effective use of resources and a better way of handling the future of the port to recognise its needs and look at how it could be integrated into the overall development of the city and county through the local authority.  It appears obvious that local authorities in integrating harbours and ports into the decisions they will make will provide opportunities for joined-up government and the integrated planning about which many of us speak in other areas of economic and public life.</p> <p>On democratic accountability, I suggest to Senators that the wins and benefits being offered to all members of local authorities in terms of their ability to exercise their democratic mandate comprehensively outweigh any concern they might have about individual members losing their ability to raise matters with a board.  I contend that given the strengthened powers local authority assemblies will have, it makes it even more inappropriate for somebody to be on a board of a body that will now be accountable to the body to which he or she was elected - the local authority.  </p> <p>Senator Ned O'Sullivan asked about what could happen in the case of hidden debts.  This is the very reason there will be a due diligence process in which the local authorities and the harbour and port companies will participate in order that these matters can be identified and dealt with before a transfer takes place.  Senator Pat O'Neill has made the point that this is a continuation of port policy.  I listened to what Senator Terry Brennan said to me.  He said I should "make haste slowly."  I respectfully make the point that this is the continuation of a policy published in 2013 and that we are moving at a deliberate pace rather than being hasty.  </p> <p>Senator Pat O'Neill's main substantive point was about the potential privatisation of ports.  The Bill makes it very clear that the ability to dispose of a share extends only to a maximum figure of 49%.  There are two contingencies in this respect which I might explore further with Members on Committee Stage.  As things stand, with the potential exception of two developments taking place that would require ministerial consent, 51% of the company must remain in public ownership.  This is consistent with what I have said about airports also, that assets such as this, subject to a Government changing its mind - any future Government will have this ability - should remain in majority State ownership.  Due to the development for which we have provided, they will be able to be maintained in State ownership and have the ability to raise funding through the issuing of equity.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Paschal Donohoe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2244"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2244&amp;amp;pid=PaschalDonohoe&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is laid out in some detail in the sections, on which we will go into detail on Committee Stage.<br/><br/>In response to the point Senator Sean D. Barrett put to me, as he can appreciate - we can go into the matter in more detail later - the sections of the Competition Authority's report, in particular on Dublin Port, deal with competition within it.  In fairness, the Senator did acknowledge this.  The Bill is focused primarily on ports of regional significance, as opposed to competition within a port of national significance, namely, Dublin Port.  I have written to the Competition Authority and believe my letter is on my Department's website.  We can use it as we get into the Bill in more detail as it passes through the House.  I agree that there is a need for more competition within national ports.  An existing challenge is to recognise legal ownership and existing rights.  I wish to see competition increased.<br/><br/>Senator Sean D. Barrett also made a point about how we could maintain commercial focus.  Both he and Senator Gerard P. Craughwell inquired as to whether local authorities really had the reputation for efficiency that others alleged they had.  My own honest analysis in dealing with this matter is that we will see a greater impetus for regional development from local authorities in dealing with ports of regional significance.  In terms of how the commercial focus and ethos will be maintained, in the method of complete dissolution commercial responsibility for ports and the commercial consequences will sit directly with the local authorities, which of itself will create the impetus for at least the maintenance of a commercial ethos.  On those ports that we will transfer as a corporate entity, a company, the board of directors will still be in place and they they will continue to generate and drive the commercial ethos.  When I visit ports, as I do on a regular basis, I am confident that there is definitely a commercial ethos and I do not think the Bill contains anything that will change the position.<br/><br/>Senator M&aacute;ir&iacute;a Cahill welcomed the oversight function within the Bill, which is an important development, as it it something we seek to address.  I think I have addressed most of the issues raised by Senator Kathryn Reilly.  She made a point about the role of the local authority chief executive <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the role of local authority members.  The Bill makes reference to both.  It is fair to say though that because the structure of local government and the functions of the executive and members are not my responsibility &ndash; they are the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly &ndash; I have integrated the governance structures of the ports, depending on how they are integrated into the existing ways in which local authorities are organised, but I still contend strongly that the change will result in significantly more powers for local authority members than is the case.<br/><br/>I have touched on some of the points raised by Senator Maurice Cummins on the role of members.  I look forward to debating the issue further in due course.  <br/><br/>In response to Senators Gerard P. Craughwell and Hildegarde Naughton, I will handle both of their contributions together because each of them spoke about the future of Galway Port.  I emphasise one point very strongly to each of them and thank them for raising the issue in the Seanad.  Each of them mentioned trans-European transport network, TEN-T, funding and its importance.  The definition of how ports can access TEN-T funding is completely independent of the Bill.  We have ports that are integrated into local authorities the length and breadth of Europe that can access TEN-T funding.  The challenge is that TEN-T funding is determined by the European Union which has a requirement &quot;that ports have to handle 0.1% of total European Union freight or passenger numbers&quot;.  Regardless of the designation I offer ports, that is the criterion they must meet.  As is the case with any criterion, what the Commission has done is used an historical base in looking at the performance of various ports in meeting the criteria.  One point I must emphasise to each of the Senators is that the ability to access TEN-T funding is not affected by the designation of ports in the Bill.  One either accesses TEN-T funding or one does not and it is determined by the European Commission.  At times, my Department and I offer support to ports all over the country to help them to do this.<br/><br/>The decision I announced in the D&aacute;il earlier &ndash; as the Acting Chairman is ringing a bell behind me I will conclude promptly &ndash; on the 18 month period before the Minister of the day will sign the commencement order, was made to give space to allow all matters relating to due diligence and transfer to be addressed.  On the planning process, that is a matter completely independent of me as Minister.  I absolutely respect the role of An Bord Plean&aacute;la in making decisions on this matter, as it will, and also that it will take whatever amount of time it needs to make a decision.  It is a matter for it to decide and it will make the decision independently of me.<br/><br/>I heard what Senator Terry Brennan said about Louth County Council.  He put a point to me about what would happen with a trading deficit and the answer is that it depends primarily on how the company would be transferred.  If it is transferred through the shareholding transfer method, in other words, it is an existing company, and maintains its existence as a company, it will still be a matter for the board of directors of the company.  If the port is completely integrated into or amalgamated with the local authority, it will be a matter for the local authority.<br/><br/>On the question of dredging, a need in all ports - I should have referred to the matter when responding to Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill - Government policy is that we cannot and do not make funding available to meet the infrastructural needs of ports or harbours.  It is a matter for them.  It is for the local authority to fund the future dredging of any port, as is the case at present.<br/><br/>I have covered nearly all of the issues Senators put to me.  I thank them for their broad support for the Bill and look forward to having the opportunity to work with the House to, I hope, allow its passage.</p></speech>

First, it provided a stable funding base for the local authority sector, incorporating appropriate elements of local authority responsibility.  As such, it strongly reinforced local democratic decision making and encouraged greater efficiency by local authorities on behalf of their electorates.  Second, it delivered significant structural reform through broadening the base for taxation in a manner which does not directly impact on employment.  Accordingly, it contributed to meeting immediate financial requirements of the EU-IMF programme in place at the time of its inception.  The local property tax has met this objective and has replaced some of the revenue from transaction-based taxes with an annual recurring property tax.</p> <p>We know only too well how our reliance on transaction-based taxes proved to be an unstable source of Government revenue in the past.  By contrast, international experience has shown that property taxes are a secure and stable source of funding.  No one will deny that stability in its public finances is precisely what Ireland needs, now and into the future.  Moreover, the local property tax enables us to achieve our goals in a manner which does not directly impact on employment.  The Government has been steadfast in its determination to do everything in its power to protect and support the creation of jobs.  As a measure which is a tax on assets, not employment, the local property tax does not adversely affect job creation.</p> <p>Due to its importance, and conscious of the concerns of homeowners over increasing property prices and potential effects on their local property tax liabilities, especially in urban areas, the Minister for Finance asked Dr. Don Thornhill to review the operation of the local property tax and, in particular, any impacts on local property tax liabilities due to recent property price developments.  Dr. Thornhill has a distinguished record of public service and chaired the inter-departmental group on the design of a local property tax in 2012.  In his report, published on budget day, Dr. Thornhill made several recommendations.  His central recommendation is for a revised system whereby a minimum level of local property tax revenues in each local authority area would be determined by the Government, ideally having regard to the apportionment between local authority areas of the historic yield.  This, in turn, would allow for the estimation of local property tax rates for each local authority area and the application of these by taxpayers and Revenue.  Local authorities could adjust this rate upwards by a factor of up to 15%.  This new system was recommended by Dr. Thornhill with a possible interim deferral of the next valuation date until November 2018 or November 2019.</p> <p>In his 2016 Budget Statement, the Minister for Finance announced he would be proposing to the Government that the postponement of the revaluation date for the local property tax from 2016 to 2019.  This postponement means that homeowners will not be faced with significant increases in their local property tax in 2017 as a result of increased property values.  The postponement also gives sufficient time for the other recommendations in Dr. Thornhill's report to be considered fully by the next Government.  It is appropriate the next Government, whatever its composition, is given the opportunity to deal with that report.  The postponement of the revaluation date - alongside the publication of the report and the mandate the next Government will receive - provides the opportunity and the space in which that can happen.</p> <p>The Bill will give effect to the postponement of the revaluation date of residential property for local property tax purposes.  It will also give effect to two of the recommendations in Dr. Thornhill's report, involving local property tax relief for properties affected by pyrite and relief for properties occupied by persons with disabilities.  The Bill provides for a relaxation, in certain limited circumstances, of the requirement for the certification of pyrite damage by a competent person for the purpose of local property tax relief.  In addition, on reliefs for properties occupied by persons with disabilities, the changes being administered by the Revenue, under their care and management provisions, will be covered by this Bill, dispensing formally with a requirement that adaptions to property had to have been grant-aided by a local authority.  Eligibility for local property tax exemption for properties occupied by incapacitated persons is being relaxed so that they will no longer, for example, have to have been the recipient of a court award or an award from the Injuries Board.  Issues relating to the implementation of other recommendations in the Thornhill review report will be a matter for consideration by the next Government.</p> <p>Section 2 concerns a minor technical amendment to section 3 of the principal Act to correct an omission in a cross-reference to the sections contained in Part 2 of the Act.</p> <p>Section 3 amends section 8 of the principal Act, which relates to an exemption from the charge to local property tax for second-hand properties purchased during the year 2013 and occupied by the purchaser as his or her main residence.  The section, as introduced, specifies the period of exemption as the liability dates in the years 2013 to 2015, inclusive, which dates correspond to the years 2013 to 2016, inclusive.  The general rule, as contained in section 14 of the principal Act, for the treatment of properties exempt on a particular valuation date, is that they continue to be exempt until the following valuation date.  As a result of the retention of the current valuation date of 1 May 2013 for an additional three years, the next valuation date will be 1 November 2019 instead of 1 November 2016.  The amendment is required to change the reference in section 8 to the year 2016 to the year 2019 in line with the postponement of the next valuation date until 1 November 2019.</p> <p>Section 4 amends section 9 of the principal Act, which relates to an exemption from the charge to local property tax for new properties purchased from a builder in the period from 1 January 2013 to 31 October 2019, the date immediately preceding the deferred valuation date of 1 November 2019.  Again, this will bring the principal Act into line with the decision to postpone the revaluation date.</p> <p>Section 5 amends section 10A of the principal Act, which relates to an exemption from the charge to local property tax for certain properties that have been damaged by pyrite.  As recommended by Dr. Thornhill, this exemption is being extended to include some additional situations.  Up to now, the exemption has been available for those properties that have been certified by a competent person, such as an engineer, as having significant pyrite damage following assessment and measurement in accordance with regulations made by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Revenue is precluded from approving an exemption where a property owner has not obtained the required certificate of damage.  Dr. Thornhill recommended the exemption continue on this basis.  However, he considered it should be extended to certain properties which have been shown to have the required level of damage but which have not been certified by a competent person in accordance with the relevant regulations.</p> <p>When the exemption was introduced, it was envisaged that all properties which would be accepted into the remediation scheme to be operated by the Pyrite Resolution Board, would undergo testing of the under-floor hard-core building material and certification of the level of pyrite damage.  However, in some cases, the board can be satisfied that the property has the required level of damage without carrying out such testing to verify this.  In the absence of testing, the certificate of damage completed by a competent person required by Revenue may not be available.  For this reason, Dr. Thornhill recommended that evidence of acceptance into the remediation scheme be accepted by Revenue in lieu of this certificate.</p> <p>Dr. Thornhill also considered that properties which are remediated as a result of a successful claim against an insurance company should be exempt.  This could happen where builders have insured their properties against structural defects or where property owners have insurance policies which provide cover for structural defects.  The rationale for extending this exemption is that an insurance company would only pay out on foot of a claim for the cost of remediating a property where it was satisfied that the presence of pyrite had actually caused significant damage to the property.  A similar rationale underlies the recommendation that the exemption be extended to those properties that are remediated by the builder or property developer who built the particular property.  It was considered that remediation, or the provision of the funds for remediation, would happen only where the builder was satisfied that the presence of pyrite had actually caused significant damage to a property.  While builders may unilaterally volunteer to remediate a damaged property, remediation may also come about following the institution of legal proceedings against a builder or against the person who provided the building material containing the pyrite.</p> <p>The changes are being implemented retrospectively.  Accordingly, in the case of remediation by the Pyrite Resolution Board, the effective date will be the date of acceptance into the remediation scheme.  In the case of remediation by insurance companies and builders, the effective date will be when the remediation has been completed and certified or when sufficient funds to carry out the remediation have been provided by the relevant party.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Harris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2338"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is about ensuring the people who were originally meant to benefit from the exemption can do so without having undergo too much bureaucracy while ensuring we keep the exemption targeted at those at whom it was originally targeted.<br/><br/>Section 6<b></b>amends section 10B of the principal Act which relates to an exemption for residential properties that are acquired because of their suitability for occupation as a residence by certain severely incapacitated individuals or those properties that are adapted to make them more suitable for this purpose.  Eligibility for the exemption depends on an individual being permanently and totally incapacitated, because of a mental or physical infirmity, from being able to maintain himself or herself.  When this exemption was introduced, an incapacitated individual - I do not like the word &quot;incapacitated&quot; but it is the word that is used legally - was required to have received an award from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board or a court in respect of a personal injury or, alternatively, to be a beneficiary under a trust that was established specifically for the benefit of the individual.  However, in practice, there are individuals who are permanently and totally incapacitated to such an extent that they are unable to maintain themselves and whose condition is so severe that it dictates the type of property they can live in and who would be eligible for the exemption were it not for the fact they have not received the required award or benefited from a public trust fund.  For this reason, the Minister for Finance decided in May 2014 to relax these conditions.  The exemption no longer depends on the receipt of an award from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board or a court or the establishment of a public trust fund for the incapacitated individual's benefit.  Instead, the nature and extent of the individual's incapacity is established by the submission of relevant information to Revenue.  The individual's doctor is required to provide information in relation to the individual's condition and why the particular property or adaptation was considered to be necessary.  The Minister for Finance asked Revenue to implement this new procedure on an administrative basis until he had the opportunity to make the necessary legislative amendments.  We are now proposing to make those legislative amendments through this section.<br/><br/>With respect to section 7, the Government agreed to the Minister for Finance's proposal to postpone the next valuation date for local property tax from 2016 to 2019 in line with a recommendation made by Dr. Thornhill in his recent review.  The valuation date is the date on which property owners are required to establish the market value of their properties.  Section 7 amends section 13 of the principal Act to retain the current valuation date of 1 May 2013 for an additional three years up to and including 2019.  The next valuation date will be 1 November 2019 instead of 1 November 2016.  This postponement means that property owners will not be faced with significant increases in their local property tax liability in 2017 as a result of increased property values since May 2013.  It also allows sufficient time, as I outlined, for the other recommendations made by Dr. Thornhill to be considered and implemented in whatever way the incoming Government considers fit.<br/><br/>Section 8<b></b>amends section 14 of the principal Act which contains the general rule in regard to the treatment of properties that are exempt on a particular valuation date.  Such properties continue to be exempt until the following valuation date.<br/><br/>Section 9 amends section 15A of the principal Act which relates to a relief that is available in respect of certain properties that are adapted to make them more suitable for occupation by a person with a disability.  The relief takes the form of a reduction in the chargeable value of a property where the adaptation work has the effect of increasing the chargeable value.  A condition for the relief, as introduced, was that the adaptation work be grant-aided under one of the local authority schemes available for this purpose.  However, in practice, as we all know, there are people with a disability who occupy properties that have been adapted to make them more suitable for this purpose but where, for various reasons, the adaptation work was not necessarily grant-aided by a local authority.  For this reason, the Minister decided in May 2014 to relax this particular condition.  The relief no longer depends on the receipt of a local authority grant.  Instead, the nature and extent of the disability is established by the submission of relevant information to the Revenue Commissioners.  The disabled person's doctor is required to provide information in relation to the disability and why the particular adaptation was considered to make the property more suitable for occupation by that person.  At the request of the Minister for Finance, similar to other amendments, Revenue has implemented this procedure on an administrative basis.  This section now gives effect to this procedure on a retrospective basis.<br/><br/>In addition to this new procedure, Dr. Thornhill recommended a change to the way in which the allowable reduction in the chargeable value of a property is calculated.  Currently, the allowable reduction is linked to the maximum grant that would have been payable under the relevant local authority scheme and to the amount of the increase in the chargeable value of a property that is attributable to the adaptation work that was carried out.  This is being changed to a reduction of a fixed amount of &euro;50,000, which coincides with the width of the local property tax valuation bands.  This change will ensure that most people who carry out adaptation work that increases the chargeable value of their property will benefit from a reduction in their local property tax liability of the amount attributable to each one band increase in value, which is &euro;90.  This new method of calculating the allowable reduction in the chargeable value of a property is being implemented with effect from the next liability date of 1 November 2016 in regard to local property tax that will be payable for 2017.<br/><br/>Section 10 amends section 35 of the principal Act which relates to the submission of returns to Revenue by liable persons in relation to residential properties.  The information to be included on a return includes, for example, the liable person's assessment of the market value of the property, a claim for an exemption or a deferral of payment and the preferred payment method.  In the normal course, a liable person who submits a return in relation to a particular valuation date does not have to submit another return until the following valuation date when the market value of the property has to be reassessed, unless their circumstances change in the intervening period.  As a result of the retention of the 1 May 2013 valuation date for an additional three years, the number of years for which returns do not have to be submitted is also extended.  This amendment provides for that extended period that includes 2019 and brings the law in line with the announcement by the Minister.<br/><br/>Section 11 amends section 153 of the principal Act which contains the list of bodies from whom Revenue may request information.  Revenue can only request information that it reasonably requires for the purposes of establishing, maintaining and ensuring the accuracy of its register of residential properties and its administration of local property tax.  The list of such bodies includes, for example, the Local Government Management Agency, the Private Residential Tenancies Board, the Minister for Social Protection and the National Asset Management Agency.  Following on from other amendments made in this Bill, this amendment adds three new bodies to the list from whom information may be requested to verify eligibility for an exemption being claimed by a liable person.  The Pyrite Resolution Board may be asked to provide information on properties accepted into its remediation scheme.  The Personal Injuries Assessment Board and the Courts Service of Ireland may be asked for information on awards made to certain incapacitated individuals.<br/><br/>Overall, this Bill primarily seeks to achieve three objectives.  First, it seeks to postpone the revaluation date until 1 November 2019.  Second, it seeks to lessen the burden of proof required for an exemption for properties affected by pyrite and reduce the bureaucracy, difficulty and expenses some people have incurred in trying to avail of that.  Third, it seeks to relax the conditions for people with disabilities with respect to the properties they require to live in or that they require to adapt to live in.  I hope the Bill will receive broad support from Members on all sides of the House.</p></speech>

I am particularly disappointed the House has only been given one and a half hours to debate all Stages of this Bill.  We have tabled amendments to it, as has Sinn F&eacute;in, to improve it but we will probably will not have the time to consider them.  I sincerely regret taking all Stages of this Bill today as there is a good deal in it.  I and my party agree with the main thrust of it with regard to the suspension of the revaluation date.  We have called for that for some time and that is to be welcomed.</p> <p>In the six minutes allocated to me, I wish to point to areas in respect of which an incoming Government would have to further change the legislation because it does not go far enough.  The premise of the local property tax with respect to the way it is structured is that it is valuation based.  We consider that model is incorrect because it mitigates against mainly urban dwellers.  It should have been either a site value tax or based on the square footage of the house.  The owners of two-bedroomed or three-bedroomed houses in Dublin are paying multiples with respect to the property tax paid by the owners of five-bedroomed or six-bedroomed houses elsewhere.  That is not a fair way to levy the tax.  </p> <p>A glaring omission in the Bill is the lack of inclusion of an ability to pay clause.  The Minister is only allowing people to defer payment and, for that facility, they will be charged 4% per annum compound interest.  I have met many people, as I am sure the Minister of State has, who are what is termed asset rich but cash poor.  Many of them are elderly and live in large family homes and many of those people in my area of north Dublin are living on the State pension.  Those people are not been granted an exemption, all they are being offered is a deferral, for which facility they will be charged a penal interest rate of 4%.  That should have been changed.  I have tabled amendments, which we will probably not get to debate, that would deal with that aspect.  Will the Minister of State take that point on board?  The inclusion of an ability to pay clause would assist a person who is out of work or a person who is in mortgage arrears.  The issue of mortgage arrears situation is not dealt with in the Bill.</p></speech>
