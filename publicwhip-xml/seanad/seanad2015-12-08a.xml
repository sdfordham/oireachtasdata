It was the subject of a lengthy battle for the people of the area.  When the former Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, published his infamous list of primary health care centre projects, the centre in Kells was not on it.  As Members will recall, the centres in Balbriggan and Swords in the former Minister's constituency were included.</p> <p>What I am seeking from the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, who is taking this matter on behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, whom I understand cannot be present, is an outline of the range of services that will be provided, an indication as to when the centre will be opened and, most importantly, whether, as omitted in the planning process, a safe bus stop will be provided to enable those using public transport to access the centre which is located on a busy bus route outside the town of Kells.  It is important to ensure older people will be able to access the centre using public transport.  </p> <p>I have corresponded on the matter with the National Transport Authority which has informed me that it has corresponded on it with the HSE but that it has not yet received a formal reply.  There is a need for joined-up thinking on the part of the agencies involved to ensure a bus stop will be provided to benefit a number of those likely to use the centre.  Many people living in the area have signed a petition seeking installation of this facility and I am calling on the agencies involved to deliver it.  I would welcome an update from the Minister of State.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-12-08a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1033" speakername="Kevin Humphreys" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015120800002#B00900"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue which I am taking on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who has responsibility for primary care issues.</p> <p>The new primary care centre in Kells is being delivered under the operational lease mechanism.  The centre is now complete and the HSE plans to move services there early in 2016.  Two local GPs and their practice staff will be moving into their surgeries in the new centre in the coming weeks.  The HSE will also shortly move a broad range of services into the new facility, including public health nursing, physiotherapy, podiatry, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, dental, psychology, social work, primary care counselling, clinical nutrition and dietetics and community mental health services.  In addition, palliative care services for the population of north County Meath will operate from the centre.</p> <p>In regard to the Senator's concern about the bus stop, I understand the HSE is in communication with Bus &Eacute;ireann on the provision of a bus stop as close as possible to the centre.  I agree with the Senator that the accessibility of the centre is very important and work on this issue is ongoing.  The development of Kells primary care centre represents a step forward in the modernisation and updating of working practices, facilities and equipment and supporting ICT systems.  The sharing of accommodation between GPs and HSE staff in one centre facilitates a team-based approach to service provision, which is the main purpose of primary care centres.  </p> <p>In the national context, the development of primary care teams and primary care centres is a priority in the programme for Government and an extremely important element of the health reform process.  The provision of primary care centres and teams throughout the country will significantly increase health and social care services in local communities, which will be achieved by redirecting services away from acute hospitals.  Primary care infrastructure is being delivered using three mechanisms: direct build, the leasing initiative and the public private partnership model announced in July 2012.  The development of primary care centres, through a combination of public and private investment, will facilitate the delivery of multidisciplinary primary care services and represents a tangible refocusing of the health service to provide care in the most appropriate and lowest cost setting.</p> <p>The modernisation of primary care accommodation and practice is vital to the successful delivery of services into the future.  In this regard, there are 90 primary care centres in operation around the country, 47 of which have been opened since March 2011.  Work is ongoing on a further 52 centres which are expected to be delivered by the first half of 2017.  The development of primary care centres is central to the Government's objective of delivering a high quality, integrated and cost effective health system.  Shared premises encourage and facilitate interaction across all health care professionals.  For this reason, the Government is committed to the development of a network of new primary care centres.</p> <p>I will bring the Senator's concerns about the provision of a bus stop to the attention of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  As stated by him, it is important in the context of the forthcoming opening of the centre that there be a follow-through and delivery in this regard.</p></speech>

All the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill does is ensure there will be no change in the amounts up to 2019, so I would expect the debate on it to be well over within the time allocated.  Likewise, the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill is due to run from 3.45 p.m. to 5.15 p.m. and, as there are only three amendments, again, I would expect it to be finished well within the time.</p></speech>

For people of the Christian faith, it is the most significant event on the religious calendar.  However, there are many thousands of individuals who will not benefit from this celebratory mood.  I am thinking, for example, of those who have no homes, those who are facing eviction, families that trying to make ends meet on a pittance of income and heroic parents who are trying to shield their children against poverty and the disadvantages that go with it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1968"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1968&amp;amp;pid=LabhrasOMurchu&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The only bulwark that one has in that case are the charitable organisations that prevent destitution and oblivion for these people.  I am thinking of organisations like the Simon Community, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Merchant's Quay and so many other charities as well.</p><p>One must be inspired by the young people who take to the streets every night, seeking out people who have fallen off the radar of society, who bring human contact to them and help them with food and advice.  It is the only glimmer of hope that is given to those people.  It is particularly important for us here to listen to what they are telling us.  I am sure that they have been in contact with all Senators.  They are telling us of their experiences, difficulties, concerns and lack of resources.  As legislators, we have a duty also.  We appreciate that these organisations exist and without them we would have a very impoverished society.  It is wrong to ignore the problems.</p><p>We can approach this matter without any party politics or partisanship.  There are issues in this House and we should do that as well.  One can go out and see that people are still living rough on the streets at the height of winter.  I am sure Senators feel like I feel and wonder how can people live like that.  They are human beings that probably come from good families but something went wrong in their lives.  Maybe they were disadvantaged or deprived.  We do not know what their story is.  This House is the best forum that we have.  I am not talking about patronising but being proactive and helpful in this regard because I feel we are expecting too much.  I marvel at the young people.  These are educated people who have every opportunity in life yet they will not forget the most vulnerable and other members of society.  Their actions enrich us all.  </p><p>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the Leader would give us some time today, and I do not care how late in the night it is, so that we can bring to the floor of this House the experiences that have been brought to us, the concerns and requests.  That is what we should be doing and we should not miss the opportunity here this morning for doing so.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that we will not let this day pass without responding to the reality of what is happening.</p></speech>

In my own area, the towns of Killarney, Kenmare and Tralee have suffered very badly from flooding.  Last night we heard the sad news that there had been one fatality and I extend my sympathies to the family of the elderly man who was swept away in his car.  A package of measures is going before the Cabinet this morning and I am sure that we will have the details of the programme of work for recovery and preventative works to be carried out in the future.</p> <p>I pay tribute to the emergency services that have worked tirelessly over the weekend.  I refer to the ESB, the Garda, council workers, Civil Defence, Red Cross and the HSE.  I could go on.  People also volunteered their services.  A great tribute must be paid to them all.  They worked to restore power and clear floodwaters from areas.</p> <p>I shall also mention the recklessness of the youths in Salthill.  I do not know what they were trying to do or what their mental state was but they dived into the sea and recorded their antics.  I presume they thought it would look good on Facebook or social media.  What if they had got into difficulties?  People would have had to rescue them.  Had these youths any thought for rescuers who would put their lives in danger to rescue them or the families of their rescuers?  The parents of the youths will be able to identify them.  I hope that their parents will lay it on the line as to how reckless their behaviour was.  On the flip side, we must pay tribute to the youths who were washed off the rocks at Hook Head and the young lad who held a girl's head over water until she was rescued.  That shows the variation in the different types of carry-on by youths.</p> <p>People may not realise that the Department of Social Protection plays a major role in responding to severe weather events and the aftermath.  The Department can provide help, under supplementary welfare, for food, clothing and personal items.  It will also assist in the replacement of white goods, basic furniture items and other essential household items.  In addition, more extensive works can be carried out, including plastering, drylining, the relaying of floors, electrical rewiring and painting.  The Department also has a humanitarian assistance scheme for larger jobs.  Senators can let people who contact them know that such help is available.  People may not be aware that the Department of Social Protection plays a role in responding to weather events.  </p> <p>On a lighter note, I welcome the fact that last week the T&aacute;naiste launched a community employment pilot scheme for participants who are over 62 years of age.  I spoke about this matter when we debated the Social Welfare Bill here and I know other Senators have spoken about the matter as well.  People over 62 years have a lot of experience and life skills to offer.  Many of them want to continue working and are happy to participate in community employment schemes.  The pilot scheme is welcome and I hope that it will be extended to the rest of the country.  </p> <p>The Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Damien English, has responsibility for research, innovation and skills.  Today, he published Innovation 2020 which is Ireland's five-year strategy for research and development in science and technology which is welcome.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the issue early in the new year so that we can learn what the proposal by the Minister of State contains.  </p></speech>

Corruption is a cancer in this country and it needs to be utterly and absolutely condemned.  Corruption has real effects on people's lives.  We see it in the planning decisions, in the flooding, in inappropriate developments and so on that have ruined people's lives.  The most indicative moment of the programme was the two gestures.  The sly compliant wink of the man from Donegal and the scrabbling movements of Councillor McElvaney when he was trousering and jacketing what he described as loads of money.  It was disgusting.  However, if one is going to take the high moral position, if one is going to lay down the law about morals and if one is going to investigate people then one also needs certain standards.  I must be the only person in this country to feel that those standards were grossly vitiated by the makers of the &quot;RTE Investigates&quot; programme.  They instigated and initiated criminal activity.  They acted as <i>agent provocateur</i>.  They set up a fake company.  They entrapped people into situations where they invited them to engage in criminal activity.  It is indicative that out of all of them they got three, which is 0.3% of councillors, yet everybody was tarred in politics.  I personally greatly resent this.</p><p>The programme makers illegally recorded and broadcast telephone conversations.  Of course the material on them was corrupt and has to be condemned but the law must be upheld as well.  I understand they appealed the High Court's decision in the case of the nursing homes.  In the case of the nursing homes, criminal activity had been going on, was going on and continued to go on.  In this case, the criminal activity was precipitated deliberately by RTE's investigative team.  I find that disgusting.  I was astonished that not one - not one - of the moral pundits and academics sought to question, in any sense, the methods used in this situation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I speak with an interest in this, which I will declare.  A couple of weeks ago, a letter was hand delivered to me here.  It was like something from the Gestapo.  In it, there were allegations that I had transgressed ethics by failing to disclose that I was a director of a film company.  I found that very shocking and was left shaking from it.  I raked my memory.  I contacted an accountant who went to the Companies Office.  I never heard of that company, never signed anything, never received any reports and never got notice of meetings.  I was blissfully unaware of the situation and I made that clear to these people within 24 hours.  Does one think I got as much as an acknowledgement or an apology?  One must be joking.  The attitude of these people was the tabloid thing - squirt out the accusations all over the place and let us hear people deny them.  RTE is a national broadcaster; it is a public service broadcaster.  It was disgraceful that these tactics were allowed.  I condemn utterly corruption but I also condemn the squalid methods employed by RTE in the making of that programme.</p></speech>

In County Leitrim, my county, there were a number of incidents of flooding and there was a landslide in one part of the county while in Sligo, people had to be evacuated from nursing homes.  I welcome the suite of measures that has been put in place.  I know the money will be spent on helping those people who were affected.</p> <p>I welcome the signing of the contract today for another phase of the N16, a road I have mentioned on many occasions since becoming a Member of the House in 2011.  Approximately &euro;5 million has been spent on that stretch of road since 2011.  The N16 from Sligo to Enniskillen is winding and dangerous.  This phase will remove the bends from another three miles of the road and leave it much safer.  I thank the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, who met me, local councillors and council and engineering staff from Leitrim County Council three or four months ago, following which the funding was allocated.  This is very good news for that part of the country.  The signing of the contract takes place in the Rainbow ballroom, another place I have mentioned on several occasions, at 2.30 p.m. today.</p></speech>

Gerry Reynolds who died in Belfast this day last week.  He was an architect of the peace process, promoting cross community links in Belfast, in particular with the Fitzroy Presbyterian community of the Reverend Ken Newell.  He crossed the peace line to worship with Presbyterians, Methodists and members of the Church of Ireland to make Clonard the cradle of the peace process.  The work of people in Clonard, Corrymeela and Glencree is most valuable as we push into the past the history of enmity between religions in Ireland.  People like Fr. Reynolds shine like a beacon in that process.  I thank the rector of the monastery for making Clonard a centre of the peace process and all those who work tirelessly to promote better community relations in Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

Gerry Reynolds.  He was a champion of dialogue in relation to obtaining peace.  I knew him and am deeply saddened at his death.  I echo also the comments of Senators Marie Moloney and Michael Comiskey on the recent storms and pay tribute to members of the emergency services who worked hard in the past week to keep people safe.  I convey my condolences to the family of Ivan Vaughan, the 70 year old man from Tyrone, who died as a result of being swept away in floodwaters in County Monaghan at the weekend.  Storm Desmond has wreaked havoc across the country and many people have been affected.  Coming so close to Christmas, it is a cruel blow for Mr. Vaughan's relatives.  I wish to send good wishes to the 14 year old rescued from the sea at Hook Head and who remains in a critical condition.</p> <p>I welcome the fact the Government will consider today an aid package for those affected by the storm and that the Department of Social Protection is overseeing hardship payments to those in need.  Weather conditions are outside the Government's control.  Will the Leader ask for an update from the relevant Departments as to what contingency plans will be put in place for the forthcoming expected bad weather, particularly in those counties expected to be hit the hardest because without a contingency plan agencies will continue to fire-fight?</p></speech>

Any form of entrapment is a terrible thing and the result does not always justify the means.  However, we are confronted with a problem, that is, what happened last night affects the entire body politic in this country.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Taoiseach to call on the agencies of the State which have responsibility for investigation and prosecution of any form of corruption to examine what was delivered last night on RTE and to decide what, if anything, should be done?  People have a right to their good name.  If people were misled or entrapped and have a perfectly reasonable explanation for what they finished up doing on television last night, they have a right to protect themselves.  If what they were involved in is a criminal offence, they need to prosecuted.  It is one or the other as far as I am concerned.  People who saw that programme last night are absolutely outraged.  That outrage turns on all of us, not just on the people involved.  Every hard-working politician is tarred with the same brush and that is no way to run a country.  Will the Leader speak to the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Taoiseach today on those two issues?</p></speech>

Our thoughts are with the families and the businesses which have been severely discommoded as a result of being flooded and also with members of the farming community throughout the country who have lost animals and fodder.  I hope the package being announced by Government today will address many of these issues.  I am aware humanitarian aid is available to meet immediate needs.  The victims of the 2009 flood who have no insurance must be given priority in the Government's aid programme.  There is no doubt that investment in flood defences and other remedial works has to be a priority.  </p> <p>While the town of Ballinasloe was severely impacted, the investment made there post-2009 has made an impact.  More rain fell over the past weekend than in the flood event of 2009 and while a number of businesses and a few homes have been impacted, if there is no further rainfall, much of the town will not be impacted.  The CFRAMS study is available and, hopefully, it will be the blueprint for future investment.  Funding is absolutely crucial.  There is a need for an open discussion on many issues, including the causes of flooding.  Much has been said in Ballinasloe about the lack of cleaning of the River Shannon and the silting caused by Bord na M&oacute;na.  All those issues will have to be addressed if a serious impact is to be made on preventing flooding.  </p> <p>Like others, I pay tribute to those involved in the huge local effort to lessen the impact on people at the weekend.  Great work was done by the staff and members of the county council, the fire brigade, the Army, the Office of Public Works, local community volunteers and local contractors who were called on at short notice to help with pumping activities.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael Mullins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2368"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2368&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMullins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A full debate is required and I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris, the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, and the Government to expedite a plan to put money behind the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, study and deal with the worst impacted parts of the country first.</p></speech>

It is a matter of urgency that we debate the issues he so eloquently outlined, particularly - but not only - coming up to Christmas.</p> <p>I join with colleagues in welcoming the Government's humanitarian assistance scheme which was announced this morning.  Senator Moloney has outlined the areas to be covered by the scheme.  The last time the Government announced such a programme, however, it was a total farce.  It was not easily accessible by those who needed the aid most.  It was almost impossible for them to adhere to the conditions that were set out.  I appeal to the Leader to impress upon the Government the urgency of this scheme and the need to make it user friendly on this occasion.  These unfortunate people need the money now, not when and if they are lucky enough to get through the hoops created by the Department.  If they manage to get through those hoops, it will be six or eight months down the road that they get financial aid.  That is not good enough.</p> <p>Like others, I pay tribute to the emergency services involved and to the volunteers as outlined by my colleague, Senator Mullins.  It is high time and high tide that we had an urgent debate on flooding and on whatever proposals the Government has to advance the flood relief plans that are in place.</p></speech>

We have to ask what they have got to hide.  Five vulture funds were invited to appear before the finance committee to engage with members on a range of issues raised by us concerning their operation in Ireland.  The invitations were extended to Pepper Asset Servicing, Lone Star Funds, Cerberus, CarVal and Mars Capital.  Each has refused to appear before the committee and has effectively told us to mind our own business.</p> <p>Naturally, the committee members wish to raise questions with these companies about how they treat customers whose distressed loans they have bought.  There are thousands of Irish homes and businesses whose future lies in their hands.  These large companies, which are effectively carpetbaggers, are in here to make a quick buck and are often devoid of any apparent social or moral compass to direct their operations.  One such company sought to commit a distressed borrower to jail for refusing to leave their property.  Another ignored the protection of a personal insolvency arrangement provided to a distressed borrower, and sought to move against his property.</p> <p>What are these companies afraid of and why will they not come before the Oireachtas and outline how they operate and the protection they afford to customers?  Their failure to appear leads me to believe that they have something to hide or to be ashamed of.  I suspect that we may need to consider a more in-depth review of the operations of vulture funds in Ireland.  At the very least, we should seek to oblige these people to co-operate with rather than stonewall the national Parliament of a sovereign State.  I will be taking the matter up with the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, and my colleagues on the finance committee.  </p> <p>On the matter raised by Senator Norris, I can identify with much of what he says because I too received a letter from "RTE Investigates" stating that I, like Senator Norris, had breached the Standards in Public Office and Ethics Acts, the whole lot, by being the director of a firm.  They said I had not declared it.  Of course, they were totally wrong.  I am neither a shareholder nor a director of the company they named.  I might not have been quite as shaken as the good Senator opposite but I did ring the man from whom I received the letter.  He wanted something in writing but when he heard what I had to say, I think he accepted it.</p></speech>

It is literally the talk of the country today and people are surprised, shocked and angry.  Where investigations are necessary I am sure they will be conducted and presumably, should prosecutions be necessary, they will follow in due course.</p> <p>We need to recognise that the spotlight that is being shone on local authorities and their members across the country should, perhaps, be redirected closer to home.  The political example must be set from Leinster House, not from council chambers.  Many years ago, the former T&aacute;naiste, Mr. Dick Spring spoke about a cancer in the political system.  He was speaking about a particular individual at that time and expressed his views about that gentleman.  However, there remains a cancer in the political system - the cancer of cronyism.  We saw it in this House about 18 months ago when an attempt was made to use the House for political purposes.  We see it in the unreformed quango system, those quangos which were supposed to be gotten rid of but which still exist, the appointments to those quangos, or judicial appointments in respect of which people in the Law Library know months in advance who is going to be appointed to what position.  We see it in the distribution of grants and funds in various schemes across the country.  Let us not pretend.  Cronyism is part of our political system and political culture and always has been.  We must decide whether we want to continue with that type of broken, dysfunctional politics, or whether we need a new start.</p> <p>While the problems at local authority level, where they exist, must be examined, we must start much closer to home and the buck stops with us and with the Government.  There has been mention of the need for an anti-corruption Bill.  I am sure that is somewhere in the ether waiting to be passed, and the sooner the better.  Everything about our political system, our appointments system, patronage and favouritism is as bad now as it ever was.  That is the real cancer and cronyism.  When the small-time county councillors have disappeared off the public airwaves, the substantial matter of cronyism and its cancerous effect on politics will still have to be tackled.  That is where we must start, at the top.</p> <p>We need to put new legislation in place.  An anti-corruption Bill would be a step in the right direction but the culture needs to change.  The culture of the public needs to change as well.  Substantial findings have been made about certain politicians, yet the public decides to re-elect them.  It would sometimes make me wonder.  We need a very new culture in Irish politics.</p></speech>

The programme has done some service in shining a light on this darkest recess of the political system.  However, in the midst of the justifiable fury it has caused, it must not be forgotten that the vast majority of councillors are honourable and just people who do not deserve to be held to account for the deplorable actions of a small number of individuals.  Councillors - I have received telephone calls from three or four of them from various parts of the country - who have dedicated much of their lives to serving the public with the utmost integrity and endeavour, many of whom are working for their communities on a full-time basis with modest rewards, are waking up this morning knowing that they will face unwarranted criticism and suspicion, from their communities because of the shameful actions of those witnessed by Members on national television last night.  I received telephone calls from a couple of them after the programme had been broadcast last night.  However, Members cannot allow the unlawful and immoral actions of a few to sully the reputation and honour of the many councillors who hold office throughout the country.  It is incumbent on them to issue a message of support to councillors and a message to the public that they should not devalue and sour the work of their representatives by tarnishing them with the same brush as those who were exposed last night.  In the interests of the huge majority of upstanding, hard-working councillors, those who last night brought such shame to their vocation should face the full rigour of the law.  Some of them think they have conveniently sidestepped the juggernaut of public opinion and culpability by resigning from their parties, but they should know that that is not enough.</p></speech>

I do not refer only to illegal loan sharks but also to those who advertise everyday.  I love the small print at the bottom of their advertisements to the effect that they are regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland.  They absolutely pulverise the people who approach them for small, short-term loans to get over Christmas with the punitive interest rates they are obliged to pay back.  In addition, I ask the Leader to bring in the Minister for Finance, if possible, to have a discussion on this issue because being regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland should not give such companies a free hand to do as they please.  Moreover, as credit card interest rates are regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland, that institution has a question to answer in this regard.  However, I reiterate the advice that people should go to their credit unions where they will be looked after and to please stay away from loan sharks, both regulated and unregulated.  I also call on the Leader to arrange a debate on some of the bodies regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland, including credit card companies, and the punitive interest rates they charge.</p></speech>

I call on all agencies of the State with power in this regard to use it.  When one considers the investigative programme, as one must call it, that was broadcast last night in conjunction with that broadcast on prostitution, trafficking and so on, RTE must be commended.  There is a debate to be held on entrapment, enlightenment and investigative journalism, but the concept of serving the public interest must also be brought into it.</p> <p>I will start by noting that last night it was shown that there were 949 elected councillors, 60 Senators and 166 Deputies, but there were very few such people involved.  I acknowledge that until something is proved, one cannot state anybody is guilty and that anyone who makes a statement must presume innocence until people are found guilty.  However, some rotten apples in a barrel should not be allowed to corrupt what I will not call the entire political system because since it took office, the Government has taken the bull by the horns, if one considers what has been brought forward since.  For example, funding for politicians must now be declared openly, whereas heretofore, it was possible to raise funding.  I refer to the Criminal Justice (Corruption) Bill 2012 and Members should note the date.  As the last speaker noted, councillors who are found guilty should resign, but that will be provided for under the 2012 Bill.  The Government also brought forward the Regulation of Lobbying Act.  In fact, therefore, RTE would be obliged to register as a lobbyist before coming before people.  Legislation in respect of the planning regulator is before the environment committee.  This measure has been sought for 25 years and has been brought forward by the Government.  </p> <p>I reiterate that abusing position for public gain brings the entire public system into disrepute.  If any politician, official or anybody else abuses a position of power, the aforementioned legislation, namely, the Criminal Justice (Corruption) Bill 2012 will bring Ireland in line with the conventions of the United Nations and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, on corruption and bribery and make it possible for convictions to be secured against individuals.  Members also saw at the banking inquiry for how long different things had gone on and who had been found guilty or responsible and who was paying.  The question is: who pays the piper?  As the public gets extremely annoyed when they see people getting away with stuff-----</p></speech>

Interestingly, one report from the United Kingdom shows that in one area &pound;37 million was spent on flood defences, yet, four or five years later, the entire area was flooded again.  Consequently, it is not only about building flood defences but also about making sure they cater adequately for the threats in terms of sudden changes in weather.  This must be prioritised because in the Cork region alone approximately &euro;60 million to &euro;70 million must be spent on flood defences for the city and surrounding areas that have been flooded, including both residential areas and business premises.  It is important to ensure local authorities do not go after business premises that have been flooded for rates for the next 12 months because they are paying a substantial sum of money to keep local authorities going.  I visited one premises recently for which more than &euro;120,000 per year or &euro;2,400 per week was being paid in rates to the local authority.  That is a huge amount of money.  It is now extremely important that any business or premises that has suffered flood damage be given a reprieve from the local authority in the payment of rates for the coming year.  Businesses should be given that allowance because a great number of premises no longer are insured as they were flooded previously and, therefore, do not have insurance this time around.  That is an important step and every possible support must be provided for those commercial premises and people with small businesses that are operating with a tight margin.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colm Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2353"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is eliminating any margin they have.

Anybody who wishes to discuss the matter should be here.  We will provide an hour for the debate.  If nobody is here, there will be no debate so it is up to Members to be here to discuss that matter.</p> <p>Senators Marie Moloney, M&aacute;ir&iacute;a Cahill, Michael Comiskey, Michael Mullins, Diarmuid Wilson and Colm Burke and other Senators spoke about the flooding and storm damage we have seen over the past number of days.  Everybody lauded the work of the emergency services in their efforts to help people.  Senator Moloney outlined the fact that services are available from the Department of Social Protection.  Senator Comiskey also spoke about that matter.  Senator Cahill extended her sympathy to the family of Ivan Vaughan, a gentleman in his seventies who was swept away in the floods, and wished the 14 year old who went into the waters off Hook Head a speedy recovery.  I understand she was part of a scouting group visiting Hook Head and I am sure we all wish that girl well.  Senator Mullins said that the flood defences put in place over the past number of years were holding up.  That is the message that is coming from most areas where flood defences have been installed.  Senator Wilson expressed the wish that people who need aid would get it.  Finance has been put in place under the capital plan, so there is a plan in place for the alleviation of flooding in the areas we see on our television screens so often.  </p> <p>Senator Colm Burke also spoke about flood defences and the need for proper design and planning.  He mentioned the UK.  The ones that have been put in place in Ireland are holding up well.  He argued that a rates waiver should be considered by local authorities, which is a very good idea.  </p> <p>Senators Norris, Craughwell, Brennan, Keane and Bradford mentioned the "RTE Investigates" programme that aired last night.  They rightly pointed out that corruption is a cancer in public life.  The revelations in the programme are shocking and go against the definition and spirit of public service as we know it.  It is unacceptable for any public representative to use their position for financial gain.  Senator Keane mentioned that the Government has strengthened the Freedom of Information Act, established the whistleblower framework and legislated for the creation of a register of lobbying to increase transparency.  Local authority members are designated public officials under the new register of lobbying and their interactions when lobbied must now be reported by lobbyists, thus shining a light on the practice for the first time.  The Government has put measures in place to counteract such lobbying.  I hope these measures will bear fruit and that we will not see what we saw on our screens last night.  Senator Norris also questioned the methods employed by RTE in this programme.  I note his points in that regard.  I agree with Senator Paul Coghlan that in respect of people who received letters from RTE that were found to be wrong, RTE should as a matter of courtesy issue apologies to the people it upset.  I understand how Senator Norris felt at being wrongly accused.  Anybody who is wrongly accused would be shaken.  Apologies should be issued by the national broadcaster where it made false allegations against people.</p> <p>Senators Barrett and Cahill spoke about the death of Fr. Gerry Reynolds and praised his work during the peace process.  I join in their praise.  Senator Paul Coghlan raised the issue of vulture funds and their non-attendance at the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Senator raised that matter on the Order of Business last week and I agree that these companies should be held accountable and, if possible, compelled to appear before the committee.  </p> <p>Senator Sheahan spoke about loan sharks, legal and illegal moneylenders and the exorbitant interest rates that are charged.  He is quite right that there are so-called legal moneylenders charging very exorbitant rates.  He advised people to go to their credit unions.  We have all witnessed people who go to these loan sharks looking for a small amount of money and, in some cases, having to pay double, if not treble, the amount they have actually borrowed.  They are in continuous debt as a result.  The credit union is the place to go for help in that regard.  Most of the other matters raised concerned flooding and the RTE programme, so I think I have dealt with those.  </p></speech>

This Bill builds on the recommendations of the national ports policy published in 2013.  The Bill&rsquo;s primary purpose is to provide the necessary legal basis to allow for the later transfer, by ministerial order, of the five designated ports of regional significance to local authority led governance structures.  Every Senator is aware that, as an island nation, our ports are critical to our ability to trade with the rest of the world.  However, every Senator will also be aware of the social and cultural importance of our ports to the communities and cities in which they are located.</p> <p>The varied stories of our ports&rsquo; development are mirrored in the diversity found today in our modern commercial port network.  Nine State commercial port companies operate under the Harbours Act 1996, namely, Cork, Dublin, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Drogheda, Galway, New Ross, Shannon Foynes, Waterford and Wicklow.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Paschal Donohoe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2244"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2244&amp;amp;pid=PaschalDonohoe&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We also have Rosslare Europort, which, for historical reasons, is a business unit of larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and not subject to the Harbours Acts.  In addition, there is one fully privately-owned port at Greenore and there are various other local authority-controlled ports and fishery harbour centres that handle commercial freight.  To give an example of this diversity, last year Dublin Port handled 21 million tonnes, 7,000 vessels and generated a turnover of &euro;72 million while at the other end of the scale Wicklow Port handled 94,000 tonnes, 56 vessels and generated a turnover of &euro;250,000.  Clearly, different ports perform different functions and service different markets.<br/><br/>The national ports policy recognised these differences through providing a clear outline of the Government's strategy for the sector by categorising the sector into three tiers.  The ports of national significance that come under tier 1 are Dublin, Cork and Shannon Foynes.  Collectively, these three ports handle more than 80% of all tonnage handled in Irish ports in any given year.  All three ports have development master plans and earlier this year I launched the first phase of Shannon Foynes &euro;50 million quayside improvement project.  Both Cork and Dublin received planning permission from An Bord Plean&aacute;la this year in respect of their projects at Ringaskiddy and the Alexandra Basin.  The total outlay on all three projects is more than &euro;350 million and all will be delivered without Exchequer contribution.  All these projects have qualified for EU funding through the TEN-T programme and its related connecting Europe facility, CEF, funding stream.<br/><br/>The ports of national significance that come under tier 2 are Rosslare and Waterford.  These ports together currently handle approximately 7% of total tonnage and offer competition to the larger ports in the economically significant unitised lift-on lift-off and roll-on roll-off trades, while both are well positioned in terms of their ability to service direct routes to Europe and both are well connected to our rail and road networks.  While both ports suffered tonnage losses during the recession, there is no doubt about their potential in the context of ensuring healthy competition within those important unitised trades.  I am happy to inform Senators that both ports are now recovering the tonnage lost in recent years.<br/><br/>The ports of regional significance are Drogheda, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Galway, New Ross and Wicklow.  These are the ports which are central to the Bill. Currently, they handle approximately 4.5% of total national tonnage, which represents a decrease of more than 30% in their collective market share when compared to 2000.  Within these five ports there are very different stories, with some quite dramatic decreases in tonnage at D&uacute;n Laoghaire, New Ross and Wicklow while both Galway and Drogheda are performing reasonably well in terms of tonnage handled, albeit at a lower level than in previous years.<br/><br/>I recognise that there are those with particular interests which may question the need to make any change to the <i>status quo</i>.  Some of these local interests made their voices heard during debates in the Lower House.  However, at a national, strategic level we must be clear about which ports are fundamentally significant for national performance and which ports are crucial for regional performance.  Notwithstanding some of the contributions made during the Bill's progress through the Lower House, I believe the approach adopted by the Government is broadly accepted by the D&aacute;il as being one of common sense.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications in its pre-legislative scrutiny report stated that the &quot;overall purpose of the Bill was broadly supported by the Committee&quot;.  In respect of the ports of regional significance, the national ports policy explicitly recognises that these five ports continue to play an important role for their regional hinterland.  This is an important policy statement in respect of those ports.  However, this role is not one that requires central government oversight.  In line with the Government's reforms of local government, the oversight of these regionally significant ports should be devolved to the most appropriate level of government - the local authority.  This devolution of responsibility will allow these ports develop as required by their regional economies and in tandem with their regional communities.  The change in perspective will enrich and enhance their future development and better aligns the needs of local authorities, regional economies and the ports themselves.<br/><br/>Senators will note that the Bill is flexible enough to allow for either the continuation of the existing company and a transfer of the ministerial shareholding to the local authority or a dissolution of the existing company and a physical transfer of all assets, liabilities and employees into the local authority.  This flexibility in primary legislation is, I believe, entirely appropriate.  I have been clear throughout the debates on this Bill that for some of these ports the requirement that a separate statutory company oversee and manage the port may no longer be appropriate.  Equally, for other ports, the continuation of the corporate model and the recognition of an entity enshrined in company law could well be the best fit.  My Department has made funding available to local authorities for due diligence in respect of all five companies.  The results will inform the model of transfer ultimately chosen for each particular port.<br/><br/>I will turn now to the key provisions of the Bill, which are found in parts 2, 3 and 5.  Part 2 deals with the first of the two possible transfer methods, that of a transfer of shareholding in the existing company.  Section 8 provides the power to transfer the shareholding in a port company.  Any order will be made by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, as the other current shareholder, and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.<br/><br/>Section 9 provides a potentially interesting new dynamic to our commercial ports sector.  It allows for the local authority chief executive, subject to the consent of the elected members of the council and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, to consider a divestment of shares in a transferred port company to the private sector.  The section ensures continued public ownership of the port through limiting any such disposal to 49% of the shares in the company.  This represents a new potential method of funding for future development in these transferred port companies, one that is not currently a feature of the sector.<br/><br/>Section 10 provides for a general ministerial power of direction to the transferred port companies in respect of the national ports policy.  The section requires the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to consult  both the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the chief executive of the local authority prior to issuing any such direction.  This requirement for consultation addresses a concern the Oireachtas joint committee identified with regard to its potential unilateral use and possible interference in company operations.  The section explicitly restricts its use to general policy matters only and cannot be used to direct a company to act in a particular manner in a particular instance.  <br/><br/>Sections 11 to 27 lay out the administration of the transferred companies under the new local authority shareholding arrangements.  It is important to note that the Harbours Acts will continue to apply to any company which transfers under this transfer of shareholding model.  As the Harbours Acts contain a number of explicit provisions relating to the ministerial shareholding, these sections require amendment to reflect the fact that the shareholding has transferred.  The exercise of these shareholder functions will primarily be one for the chief executive but the Bill also provides for a number of important oversight functions for the elected members of local authorities.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Paschal Donohoe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2244"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2244&amp;amp;pid=PaschalDonohoe&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Section 11 lists the 17 sections of the Harbours Acts that will no longer apply to a transferred company.  These sections require an active role for the shareholder in consenting to something.  Obviously, as the shareholding has changed, these particular sections can no longer apply and amended versions of these sections are instead included within sections 13 to 27, inclusive.  Many of these sections are routine in nature such as section 14, which requires any change to a transferred company&rsquo;s memorandum and articles of association to be approved by the local authority chief executive.</p><p>I will instead, therefore, focus on a number of the more substantive sections and also on the role of elected members generally in the oversight of these transferred companies.  Where the transfer of shareholding model is chosen as the transfer method, the company structure remains in place, as it exists today.  An important consideration in the model is to ensure the appropriate balance between the commercial freedom of the company and democratic oversight.  The Bill achieves that balance through providing for a number of specific oversight functions for elected members of a council.  First and foremost, section 23 requires the chairperson and CEO of a transferred company to appear before the council, if invited, and account for the administration of the company.  Second, section 22 provides that a proposed chairperson of a transferred company shall appear before the elected members prior to his or her formal appointment.  This mirrors the current practice of prospective chairpersons appearing before the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications.  The Government introduced this practice and it has proven valuable in allowing elected representatives question prospective chairpersons on their vision and ambition for the company.  In many ways, the power that will be afforded to local authority members is similar to the power Oireachtas Members have by virtue of their membership of the committee.</p><p>Section 19 requires the annual audited accounts of the transferred company accompanied by a report on the year to be laid before the elected members.  While ultimately a matter for the relevant local authority, there is an obvious link between the submission of these accounts and the power of elected members to require a chairperson and CEO to appear before the council under section 23.  The consent of the elected council will also be required where the disposal of shares in the transferred company to the private sector is envisaged.  With regard to board appointments to these transferred companies, I am clear that the improvements to the board appointment process generally must also apply to any transferred company.  Section 22, therefore, mirrors the improvements introduced in section 39 to those companies remaining under ministerial shareholding.  Directors will be selected through the State board appointment process launched last February.  The Bill requires that certain skill sets must be present on the board including maritime transport, financial, legal and commercial skills.  The Bill also indicates a further set of skill sets which might be considered for board level representation such as infrastructure planning or environmental management.  The local authority chief executive will formally appoint the persons recommended by the Public Appointments Service.  The maximum total service of a director will be ten years, which will allow for both the development of board level experience and also provide fresh thinking which is a necessary feature of any board.  The central oversight of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as regards board fees will continue.  The CEO of a transferred company will, as of today, be appointed by the board of the company following consultation with the local authority chief executive.  The central oversight function of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of the terms and conditions of CEOs will be maintained.  These are the key issues addressed in Part 2.</p><p>However, the legislation also provides for a second transfer method within Part 3.  This model is called "transfer and dissolution of companies", and it is outlined in sections 28 to 33.  These sections are based on existing precedents generally and provide for the dissolution of the company as body corporate and its complete integration within normal local authority structures.  The port would be administered as a functional area of the local authority.  All employees would transfer, as would all property, assets and liabilities of the company.  The legislation provides for the continuation of any harbour and pilotage limits.</p><p>Part 5, covering sections 37 to section 49, comprises technical amendments to the existing Harbours Acts which are being made on foot of submissions made during consultations or on foot of experience gained in the years since the previous amendments.  Three important elements to this Part further improve the overall corporate governance culture within the ports sector.  Section 39 amends the board appointment process through introducing mandatory skill sets and introducing overall term limits of ten years.  Section 40 introduces a new statutory provision regarding the accountability of a chairperson and CEO of a port company to elected representatives.  The section requires that the chairperson and CEO appear before the joint Oireachtas committee, if invited to do so, and account for the administration of the port company.  Section 42 extends the current prohibition on Deputies, MEPs and Senators serving on the boards of port companies to councillors.  This will apply equally to companies whose shareholding remains with the Minister and those where the shareholding transfers to a local authority shareholding model.  National ports policy is clear that the boards of port companies must comprise individuals with the necessary skills required of any commercial company.  I am legislating for that in sections 22 and 39.  There have been instances in the past where councillors serving on port company boards have had to absent themselves from discussions at board meetings and from council discussions on topics due to potential conflicts of interest.  When people elect their local representative, they obviously do not want to see his or her contribution to local democracy restricted in such a manner.</p><p>As I hope is clear to the House, the Bill is an important step in the development of the commercial ports sector and represents an important contribution to the further devolution of responsibility from central to local government.  The changes introduced will enhance the ports&rsquo; role as centres of their regional economy, deepen the economic development role envisaged for local authorities and improve the corporate governance and democratic accountability of the sector overall.  Our ports sector is critical to our nation and to our economy.  As an island nation, we need to ensure our ports sector is positioned to deliver cost effective and efficient services, irrespective of whether their significance is national or regional.  The amendments the Bill proposes in respect of board structures will enhance the corporate performance of our ports and ensure they continue to fulfil their vitally important role as facilitators of our economy.  During the past year, I have had the opportunity to visit and meet the boards of almost all our ports and to appreciate at first hand the necessary and vital contribution they make to our economy and growth within our country.  It is frequently understood that they make such a contribution to our export economy but what is less frequently understood is the role they play in respect of imports whereby products such as oil and petroleum, which are vital to the functioning of our economy, are brought in through our ports, along with other raw materials.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Paschal Donohoe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2244"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2244&amp;amp;pid=PaschalDonohoe&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Value is added to them in our country and then they are exported again.  I am very clear that how we support that sector in future will be an increasingly important part of how our country prospers.

It will not be opposed by my party at this stage, if at all.  Our ports and harbours are one of our most important pieces of infrastructure with regard to the overall economy, communications and goods inwards and outwards.  I speak as someone with the privilege of serving for 16 years as a director of a number of harbour boards in the west and on the Shannon in particular under various denominations.  I was a director of the Limerick harbour board and the Shannon Foynes Port Company, along with a number of other local authority members.  The prohibition on Deputies, MEPs and Senators serving on boards will now be extended to include councillors and although I know the chestnut has been debated well, I have very mixed feelings about it.  In the 16 years in which I represented Kerry on the Shannon Estuary, the best-informed and least personally biased directors - aside from parochial interests - would have been county councillors.  If a board is to be created where members cannot have another interest, it will be very difficult to form any board.  If somebody from the business sector is put on, who is the say the person does not have financial arrangements regarding import or export for a particular harbour?  It is very difficult to find somebody who would be squeaky clean.</p><p>When I was first elected here in 2007, I was followed by a Standards in Public Office, SIPO, request or a complaint about me from a disgruntled person in Kerry who felt I had over-extended myself by representing the interests of the harbour board on Kerry County Council with regard to a planning matter.  For a while I was worried about the complications as I had no axe to grind or anything to gain personally.  I suppose the harbour board and the interests of the county council did, to a certain extent, overlap.  As a member of both, I felt it was my duty to represent both.  I was fortunate to receive a full and positive exoneration by SIPO.  I can see the other view as well.  There is a blanket exclusion of county councillors, notwithstanding what we saw in last night's programme.  That expos&eacute; asked more questions about RTE than it did of councillors.  I heard my colleague, Senator Brennan, making the point that we know and have worked with councillors, and they are decent, honourable people.  Like every other job in the world, there are aberrations and anomalies, with people doing the wrong thing.  We are proud of our councillors and we are proud to be elected by them.  I am digressing from the question but the blanket exclusion of county councillors should be considered more seriously.</p><p>The Minister has indicated the Bill is not prescriptive but sets out the framework by which statutory instruments can be used.  There is a question about that.  As the Taoiseach famously asked, does Paddy know everything then?  We are voting on the outline of legislation but the devil will be in the detail when the Minister introduces a statutory instrument.  What level of control and oversight will we have of that?  Will the Minister accept that this should be teased out on a committee level with various parties so we could have the main bullet points of what the statutory instrument might entail?  I will not exaggerate and say we are creating an enabling Act like Hitler but we are giving the Minister <i>carte blanche</i>to a certain extent.  Fianna F&aacute;il supports the transfer of responsibility for the regional ports and harbours to local authorities.  We would like greater detail from the Minister at a later stage.  As I stated, we would like a draft statutory instrument to be made available to the joint committee.</p><p>I am sure the Minister agrees it is important that councils inheriting responsibility for harbour boards should not be heirs to any dogs tied, as we say in Kerry.  There should not be any debts, as some of these debts are often hidden.  It is important that this is done with a clean sheet and not by carrying legacy issues or problems.  I am sure the people from the east coast have their views on what are to be designated regional harbours on the east coast.  The only ones I am reasonably familiar with on my own side of the coast - apart, naturally, from Shannon - is Cork and Dublin.  Shannon, Cork and Dublin are responsible for 80% of all cargo handling in this country.  The Shannon Estuary is the biggest bulk cargo handling port in Ireland.  It is probably second only to Rotterdam with regard to its natural deep harbour.</p><p>I do not want to pre-empt the comments of my colleague from Galway but to a certain extent, its port seems to be losing out.  Galway is the only port of consequence north of Kerry on the west coast.  Knock Airport proved to be central to the revival of the west and I want to ensure nothing in this Bill will downgrade or make less appealing the facilities in Galway.  Designations have a habit of creating their own problems.  We have the three major harbours, a raft of important harbours and then smaller harbours.  Fenit's facility was transferred to the local authority in Kerry without much trouble.  Has the Minister given sufficient thought to how central Galway's port is to the economy of the west and mid-west?</p><p>I could go on at length but the bottom line is we are giving the Minister the go-ahead at this stage.  We wish the Bill well but we will consider the detail later.</p></speech>

As the Minister indicated, this Bill will continue what was Government policy from 1999 to 2011, when 13 of our smaller harbours were transferred to local authority control.  The Bill deals with the ports of regional significance, including the ports at Drogheda, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Galway, New Ross and Wicklow.  This will bring about the dissolution of the existing port companies and transfer of all assets, liabilities and employees to the relevant local authorities.</p> <p>Taking into consideration the Government's many reforms of local government, the oversight of these regional ports will now be the responsibility of local government.  This devolution of responsibility will allow the ports to continue to develop, as required by the regional economy and in tandem with the regional community.  The change in perspective will enrich and enhance their future development and better align the needs of local authorities.  For some ports, the requirement that a separate statutory company should oversee and manage the port may no longer be appropriate.</p> <p>As the Minister stated, as an island nation we rely on our ports for the majority of imports and exports.  Our agricultural and pharmaceutical industries account for nearly &euro;25 billion exports, so it is important that our ports are run in an efficient manner.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Pat O'Neill:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2364"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2364&amp;amp;pid=PatONeill&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->He said in his speech that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport will provide funding for local authorities in respect of all five companies and that the results of this exercise will inform the model of transfer ultimately chosen for each port.  As the Minister said, the Bill is flexible enough to allow for a continuation of the existing company and the transfer of the ministerial shareholding to the local authority, or the dissolution of the existing company and a physical transfer of all assets, liabilities and employees to the local authority.  This is dealt with at sections 8 and 9, which I will address with later in my contribution.</p><p>In 2013, just over 800 vessels called to the five designated regional ports named in the Bill - in other words, about one every two days for each port.  Four of these ports returned a profit in 2013, with the exception of D&uacute;n Laoghaire, although it technically no longer operates as a commercial goods transit port.  Of the 26 ports in Ireland, only five will now not be in local authority control, that is, Dublin, Cork, Shannon Foynes, Rosslare, which involves Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, and the port of Waterford, which is actually in County Kilkenny.  I would remind the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment Community and Local Government, Deputy Coffey, that he is not getting it back.</p><p>When the Bill is passed and the amendments made, it is important that proper structures are put in place so the executive and members of the local authority can perform due diligence and that the new port authorities, together with the audited accounts, can appear before the local authority members, as the Minister has outlined.  I welcome the fact the Minister said funding will now be in place to support the five ports because it is important they are not placed under financial strain as these transitions take place.  In this regard, I would appreciate it if the Minister could tell the House how much funding is going to be put in place.  It is important no financial burden is placed on the local authorities, although section 8 suggests a fairly straightforward transfer, if that is the model that is put in place.</p><p>Given the LEOs are in place in each local authority area, it is important the ports work closely with the LEOs to ensure continued economic growth and development in their areas.  As they say, all politics is local, and the members of the local authority, in conjunction with the new ports boards, will know exactly what is necessary in order to achieve this.</p><p>Section 9 is perhaps the most controversial section, in that up to 49% of the shares may be privatised.  In that regard, who would value the shareholdings of the ports?  What rights would the new shareholders have in regard to properties of the ports?  We must remember that Aer Lingus and Eircom were State companies that were privatised.  There is a fear that if we go down this road, we might come to a point where we lose control of the ports.</p><p>I welcome the Bill.  It is important that we continue to develop our ports.  As an island nation, much of our exports and imports have to come through the ports and we do not yet have a tunnel to Europe or Britain, unless the Minister is going to make an announcement about that in the near future, given the economic upturn.  Everything has to come in through the ports.  It is important we do not keep the pressure too high on the main ports of Dublin, Cork and Shannon-Foynes and that the regions are also looked after.  I welcome the Bill.  I ask the Minister to give us more detail in regard to section 9, which is the most important section in that some areas may be privatised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-12-08a.74" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015120800002#S00200"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  It has been of interest to see how policy in this area has developed.  When I served on the Culliton committee in the early 1980s, the issue then was to reproduce the efficiency of Larne at ports in this State, and I think that was substantially accomplished.  Competition between ports had an impact then, and a substantial impact on the lack of efficiency at Dublin Port was achieved by competition from Waterford when the containers went there, and also from ports like Drogheda.</p> <p>The scope for inter-port competition is limited, as the Competition Authority said in its report, and therefore we have to look at competition within ports, or intra-port competition.  The issues raised by the Competition Authority should be addressed in this legislation, in particular the allocation of leases on terminals within Dublin Port and making sure there are enough stevedores to ensure competition.  It seems that, yet again, the Competition Authority's views have been forgotten by the other Ministers around the Cabinet table, and the same happened last week in regard to the views on the conveyancing monopoly.  Competition is essential in this island economy.  Ministers should liaise with the Competition Authority and should take on board what I consider an excellent and impressive report by its economist, Ciar&aacute;n Aylward, who also gave a presentation to TCD students.</p> <p>If competition between ports is limited, and we do not look at restrictive practices within ports, particularly within Dublin Port, we are not doing any great favours to the competitiveness of Ireland as a country.  In a minority report to the Murphy report on ports, which was commissioned by the then Minister, Mr. Michael Woods, I recommended that we should run ports as a business.  That is what we want.  Ports need customers, namely, the shipping companies and the shippers on the land side.  Where they do not have them, as Senator O'Neill has just said in regard to D&uacute;n Laoghaire, it is a ghastly prospect because a lot of investment has gone in but it is sitting there, doing nothing.  It is very sad to see the D&uacute;n Laoghaire harbour front in its current state, with the facilities built for Sealink, which are no longer wanted.</p> <p>I am a little nervous about the local authority model.  The McLoughlin report, which is gathering dust in the Custom House, showed substantial excess managerial layers in local government.  I do not know if we will improve the productivity of ports by transferring them to the local authorities.  I do not know many people who would come in here to say local authorities are so efficient that we should do more things through them.  Given the Irish Water example, they might be thinking the opposite, namely, that we should not let the local authorities determine their definition of productivity because, when it is made explicit, as with the water charges, we can get some appalling results.</p> <p>We need to look at the first recommendation of the Competition Authority on the leasing and licensing of the Dublin lo-lo terminals.  The Competition Authority said this was a matter for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in the first instance and in November 2013 the Department was asked for its view on the leasing and licensing of Dublin lo-lo terminals as an essential part of improving the efficiency of ports.  The second recommendation concerned stevedore licensing.  The Competition Authority stated that, for Dublin Port, at least two new general stevedore licences should be issued by the Dublin Port company, one on the north side and one on the south of side of the port, and it recommended consideration of this by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  We have to address those issues.</p> <p>We need more analysis of what has been happening in the south east, given that Arklow is virtually shut and Wicklow deals with a very small number of vessels, as the Minister said in his speech.  What is the future of Rosslare?  There is a secret report on it, and the Minister referred to some correspondence that is on the website of the Competition Authority.  Has Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann an interest in it any longer?  It removed the railway tracks and the railway now ends about a half mile before the port.  If passengers try to get a passenger train through Rosslare to get on the ferry, they could face a walk of some hundreds of yards in the rain.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Sean D. Barrett:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2370"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2370&amp;amp;pid=SeanDBarrett&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I do not know why.  We got a grant from the European Union.  The buses still use the terminal but the railway mysteriously left.  There is no longer any rail connection between Waterford and Rosslare Harbour.</p><p>A huge facility was put in at Belview, which is in County Kilkenny, as Senator O&rsquo;Neill has reminded us.  We accept that point but has it lived up to expectations?  Although it has been recovering recently, why did traffic fall?  Is there something in the management or in the way Waterford sells its services to customers in the freight forwarding sector?  The high hopes for Belview and the Port of Waterford have not been realised.  Drogheda and New Ross are both on the border between counties - Drogheda between Louth and Meath and New Ross between Kilkenny and Wexford - so which local authority do we mean?  I am inclined to look askance at the idea of letting any local authority run those ports.  Is local authority the model that gives the least cost result?  I share people&rsquo;s misgivings about Galway too.  Is local government in Galway so efficient in any legendary sense that it should take over a harbour which has been doing quite well, retaining a good oil business from Whitegate?  The harbour had to do the numbers on whether the oil went from Whitegate to Galway by road, rail or ship and managed to get the best contract.  Will that kind of efficiency be lost if Galway Harbour goes into the local authority structure?</p><p>It is good that the very substantial loss of business from the ports in the Republic of Ireland to Larne has been won back, not by restrictive practices but by making our ports more efficient.  I thank Larne and its manager, Denis Galway, for showing us how to do that.  We learned the lessons and have retrieved a substantial amount of business that used to go over the Border to Larne, Warrenpoint and Belfast.  Let us not eliminate the prospect of competition within Dublin Port and the remaining competition, which is probably small at this stage, as stated by Ciar&aacute;n Aylward of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  He adds that we must improve competition within ports.  When there was some mining in Kilkenny, there was a choice to go to either Cork or Waterford Ports and Cork won that competition.</p><p>I would like to see a more commercial emphasis on keeping pressure on this sector.  As the Minister said, in serving an export-orientated island economy, we need ports performing at the highest level.  I hope the Department and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission will combine in their efforts to extract monopolistic rents where they still occur in the sector.  Let us see the numbers to show that Galway and Drogheda would be better run by the local authority than by a separate port company, facing competition.  If they are not efficient, they lose the business.  Is that not the test rather than whether we see them as part of local authorities?</p></speech>

I welcome this Bill and note that it will further enhance the corporate governance structures of all port companies, that the oversight functions make sense and are useful and that the transfers support the Government forums in the area of local government through enhancing the role of the local authority in regional economic development.  That is a welcome step and demonstrates the Minister&rsquo;s commitment in this regard but it also demonstrates a common sense approach to accountability, which is very welcome.</p> <p>I have found the contributions interesting and look forward to the next Stages of the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-12-08a.77" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1155" speakername="Kathryn Reilly" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015120800002#T00300"><p>I echo the sentiments of many Senators that the harbours are a very important part of coastal communities, providing recreation and commerce, and as a major asset in attracting tourism, especially for an island.  They can be engines for growth and a sustainable source of good employment.  Access to the sea brings many opportunities but it also brings the challenges of maintaining and growing that opportunity.  It is unfortunate that some harbours have gone to rack and ruin which has a domino effect on some of our local economies.  It is important that we do all we can to enhance and support the potential of harbours, particularly in their efforts to support growth and employment opportunities.  For that reason, a harbour policy must have at its core a drive to maximise the potential of the harbours to support and encourage growth and job creation and, most importantly, to do so in a sustainable and environmentally sound way which incorporates the community in important decision-making.</p> <p>This Bill is taking a step in the right direction.  The Minister mentioned that oversight of these regionally significant ports should be devolved to the most appropriate level of government, which is the local authority.  One concern raised by my colleague, Deputy Ellis, in the D&aacute;il was that the Bill can be seen to be empowering local authority chief executive officers and less so the local councillors.  The CEO is not elected and that person can often be at odds with the elected officials in local authorities who derive their mandate from the local community in democratic elections.</p> <p>In what respect are we devolving oversight to the local authority?  How much will go to the CEO?  What is the balance between the councillors and the CEO?  Studies by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, show that councils are very efficient at managing and overseeing local services because of their local know-how and expertise to complete the job at hand.  They have the support of the public.  It does not always work perfectly but our local authorities are more accountable than those in corporate spheres.</p> <p>The Minister said this Bill tries to balance the commercial needs with democratic oversight.  That needs to happen and it is a fine line to try to do that.  Democratic oversight is an important ingredient in finding success in the management of the harbours but it also ensures success benefits the wider community which will last for generations.  We need to get the balance right and make sure there is a greater level of democratic accountability.</p> <p>We are told that the controls will be handed over to the local authority but can the Minister give us a picture of that in reality?  Will control rest primarily with new bodies established by the CEOs of the local authorities?  What accountability will there be to councillors as opposed to the CEO?  Will there be adequate consultation on the directors nominated to each harbour?  The Minister said the proposed chairperson will appear before members prior to formal appointment but is that just to question them?  Is that the only role they may have?  Concerns were raised in the other House about the board&rsquo;s ability to sell off assets without consideration or oversight by local authorities.  Could this lead to some damaging sell-offs that may be against the wishes of the local community?  I welcome the role of the local authority members in overseeing the accounts of the harbour companies under section 19.  I hope the link the Minister mentioned between this and section 23 is real and the councillors can employ this.  Local authority members should be allowed to debate the accounts and have oversight of the audits of the harbour company.  What role will local authorities have in respect of performance reviews, given their role in ensuring the provision of quality services and value for public money?</p> <p>We support this legislation because it makes the harbour structure more democratic and accountable but I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s response to some of the questions raised.  He probably responded to them in the other House but I would like them to be included in the Official Report of the debate in this House.  I look forward to debating the Bill further.</p></speech>

The Competition Authority estimates that our ports handle approximately 84% of the volume of all merchandise and trade and 62% in terms of value.  As an island nation, our ports are critical to our ability to trade throughout the world.</p><p>The purpose of this Bill is to allow for the transfer by ministerial order of control of the five ports of regional significance, Drogheda, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Galway, New Ross and Wicklow to local authority-led government structures.  Some people will cringe when they hear that.  I am aware Senator Barrett has reservations in this regard.  However, I note, as did Senator Reilly, that an important consideration in the model is to ensure the appropriate balance between the commercial freedom of the company and democratic oversight.  This is a key element of the Bill.  It is important that the commercial entity be allowed to exercise freedom also and that there is democratic oversight.</p><p>As someone whose grandfather was a sea captain who plied his trade on a three-masted schooner from Waterford to Wales and as a person who worked in the Port of Waterford for over 20 years, I have a love of ports and port activity in Ireland and worldwide.  To answer Senator Barrett's question as to why the Port of Waterford thrived since it moved to Belview, there are a number of reasons for this.  Having witnessed the storm damage of recent days, I recall that storm damage once brought down the main crane in the Port of Waterford.  There was also had the demise of the major customer on which the port was probably over dependent, namely, Bell Lines.  These were the main reasons for the lack of growth of the port.</p><p>I am happy to say that under the new board and management, things are improving significantly.  There is no reason this should not be the case.  It is a port with a load-on, load-off facility and where trains can go right in under the gantries.  In respect of trains however, CIE abdicated its responsibility in regard to rail transport and just did not want to know about the port  20 years ago.  I do not know if the situation is any different now.  It has not been competitive in its rates.  At that time the Port of Waterford was served by three or four trains from Dublin at weekends.  Trains also came from Belfast, from Ballina - with freight from the Asahi plant - and from all over the country.  Now such traffic is negligible, mainly because CIE was uncompetitive and abandoned it.  That is why we see so much heavy goods traffic on our roads.  This must be rethought in the context of a transport policy for the country.</p><p>I agree with Senator O'Sullivan and I abhor the blanket exclusion of councillors because, over the years, I have known many good councillors who were excellent members of port companies or harbour commissions.  Now that these ports are coming under the local authority umbrella, councillors should be included on the boards.  What is the reason for excluding them?  There can be no conflicts of interest in that regard.</p><p>In the context of local authorities, section 23 of the Bill requires that the chairperson and chief executive of the transferred company can appear before the elected council, if invited, to account for the administration of the company.  I am of the view that we should not include the words "if invited" and that these individuals should come in each year to report to the relevant local authority.  If the local authority is taking over the port, why should there not be an annual report from the chief executive of the port authority?  We need to reconsider the use of the phrase "if invited" in the context of our discussion on the later Stages of this Bill.  It should be a requirement that they report to the council.  If we are giving control to the local authorities, why not give them the power to question the report.  If councillors are being excluded totally from the boards, surely they should have the facility to question the chairman and chief executive of these ports each year.  There is no point in excluding the councillors totally.</p><p>In general, I welcome the Bill which has come about as a result of the review of port policy.  It is a step in the right direction, but we will need to monitor the model on a regular basis to see how well it works.  I am sure we will have many teething problems before these companies are set up under the local authorities.  I welcome the Bill but I have reservations in regard to the total exclusion of councillors.  If they are to be excluded from these bodies, then the local authorities' oversight and that of the chairmen and chief executives should be extended to those members each year.</p></speech>

I welcome this Bill in so far as it provides for democratic oversight of the running of our harbours.  It is important there be accountability for such assets of the State to the State.  However, like Senators Cummins and O'Sullivan, I have reservations regarding the exclusion of local councillors - the people on the ground who know exactly what is going on - from membership of the boards.  I can understand why Oireachtas Members or Members of the European Parliament might be excluded but I cannot for the life of me understand why we would want to exclude the people who live locally and who have an interest in developing their local harbours.  I am delighted the Bill provides that any transfer will involve discussions with the relevant trade unions.  That is a positive step which will make the transfer somewhat easier.</p><p>In regard to D&uacute;n Laoghaire, I have worked and lived adjacent to D&uacute;n Laoghaire for over 20 years and have watched the direction the port has taken and seen the loss of lines to and from Britain.  The <i>HSS Stena Explorer</i>has gone and that was a serious knock for the port.  However, I have watched D&uacute;n Laoghaire develop a yachting industry.  I believe that if these port companies were left to their own devices, they would respond and find a way forward for themselves.  I was born and reared within sight of Galway Port and spent many long summer days there.  Notwithstanding that this port lost the trade of Tynagh Mines several years ago, it managed to move its entire oil storage system from the centre of the city out onto a little island just off the harbour.  There is also a massive coal import industry through Galway Port.  Again, left to its own devices, I believe Galway would probably respond better than it will under the cumbersome management of a local authority.</p><p>I agree with Senator Barrett that local authorities are not exactly known for their dynamic, market-focused approach towards driving issues forward.  I am not sure that is the right way forward.  I agree with Senator Cummins that the annual report should be part of the reporting mechanism for the harbour boards locally.  I am somewhat concerned by the level of authority we are ceding to the chief executive officers of local authorities.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

For some reason, we seem to be sidelining the harbour master.  Maybe I am wrong and, if so, the Minister might correct me but it appears the harbour master's attendance at board meetings is at the discretion of the board.  Anything he or she may have to say is at the discretion of board.  The harbour master does not have a right to cast a vote at a board meeting.  Surely, the harbour master is the person who knows what is happening on the ground and, like a chief executive officer in a major company, should have the right to cast a vote at any meetings.  That is all I am willing to say on it.  Overall, I welcome the move to bring some form of democratic accountability to harbours.  Those are some of my concerns.</p></speech>

The importance of our ports and harbours cannot be over-emphasised, as has been mentioned by many of my colleagues.  Ports which are not a requirement as commercial ports for the area in which they are located should be developed into ports of recreation and amenity.  A river flowing through a town should enhance that town rather than, as in some instances, detract from it, perhaps due to a lack of investment in the hinterland of the river.  To be parochial, in Dundalk's case, very little if any of the limited amount of cargo coming through the port is actually for Dundalk or its immediate hinterland.  This is already well-served by the ports of Drogheda and Greenore.  Incidentally, I began my working life at the very port which contributes significantly to the economy of the entire area and the Cooley peninsula.  It is doubtful if trade through Dundalk could meet the cost of dredging the port without Government assistance.  This dredging has to take place on a fairly regular basis as far as ports go.  In the event of a transfer to Louth County Council, what body will shoulder any trading deficit or the cost of dredging the port when the need arises?</p><p>I, too, disagree with elected members of county councils being excluded from directorships.  I am not convinced this is a good idea.  I refer to the experience of elected members, and I am familiar with two or three from my 25 years on Louth County Council.  One, in particular, although not of my political persuasion, could run any port in this country given his tremendous experience, and I do not say that lightly.  To exclude a man of that calibre and with that experience from any board is wrong.  </p><p>I could not countenance costs being the responsibility of Louth County Council, which has difficulty enough in balancing its budget at present, but I admit I am not fully aware of the detail of this transfer.  However, there are a number of scenarios which will require to be addressed before the transfer actually place.  What was the recent experience of Dublin Port when it was charged with the running of the local Dundalk Port?</p><p>There is a Latin motto over the door of Ballymascanlon hotel, <i>Festina Lente.  </i>Latin scholars could probably translate it.  It means,<i></i>hasten slowly.  We should apply that motto to the transfer to Dundalk Port to Louth County Council.</p></speech>

In general, an updating of ports policy is welcome and on this basis, I welcome this legislation.  However, the Minister will be aware that politicians in the west have had particular difficulty with the legislation, specifically the decision which still remains active, to place Galway on the lowest rung of ports in this country.  I, therefore, very much welcome the Minister's decision not to sign any commencement order until planning decisions are finalised in Galway and elsewhere.  However, while this is welcome, I wish to bring some of the concerns of the people in Galway to the Minister's attention.  They and I would be interested to know the commercial or economic reasons for the proposed transfer of ownership.  They are of the view that there is little or no benefit to such a transfer.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's view on that issue.  There is also a general concern that for a city of its size and potential and for a port serving a vast area of the coastline, the absence of a modern national port is unacceptable.  If this comes to pass, as outlined, there will be no national port from Foynes to Donegal and, as stated, in the other House, Foynes is nearer to Cork than it is to Galway.</p> <p>Access to TEN-T funding was mentioned in previous debates.  In the D&aacute;il, the Minister of State was at pains to point out that Galway or a local authority port would still be eligible.  However, the legislation seems to have Drogheda, D&uacute;n Laoghaire and Galway remaining as limited companies with their shareholding held by the CEO of the local authority.  Only the first two seem to have been included with Dublin Port as eligible for TEN-T funding.  It would, therefore, seem to those involved that Galway has been excluded and is, therefore, the only commercial port of its size in the country to be excluded from TEN-T funding.  The Minister will be aware that this can amount to up to 20% of capital expenditure for the proposed extension of Galway Port.  What reassurance can the Minister offer the people of Galway that they will not be disadvantaged when seeking funding? </p> <p>While the Minister's decision not to sign a commencement order is welcome, the issue still remains outstanding pending the expansion of Galway Port.  My view is that the port of Galway should have been afforded the same status as Waterford and Rosslare Ports, that is, tier 2 status.  The decision would appear to have been taken without any regard to future capacity and made on the present tonnage and capacity.  Galway needs to be a national port and eligible for TEN-T funding.  The Minister should be aware that the effect of not being a tier 1 or a tier 2 port will make it extremely difficult to attract investment funds for the port's extension as potential investors in the sector will look to national port.</p> <p>I see no provision in the Bill setting out the criteria for any port to be upgraded to a tier 1 or a tier 2 port.  If this were in place, the people of Galway could see what is required in order to benefit from an upgrading.  It would bring much clarity to the situation.  Will the Minister look again at the legislation in this regard to see whether it would be possible to insert a section on what the requirements would be to move between designations?  Galway Port has the potential to become a major employer and a major source of revenue, not only for Galway but for the western region.  This is not a flight of fancy; it is a fact.  There is significant cruise ship business going untapped.  To attract this investment, there is a need for an upgrade of the port and it is vital that it achieves tier 2 status to do this.  The current proposal has the potential to hamstring any future development by making investment in the port unattractive.  I urge the Minister to examine my constructive suggestion and to include a provision to enable a port to upgrade if it meets these suitable criteria.  Again, I thank the Minister for his decision to postpone the signing of the commencement order.</p></speech>

I will address some of the common themes raised with me and then possibly address some of the specific matters raised by Senators.  I thank Members for offering broad support for the Bill.  </p><p>A core theme that emerged in the points made by colleagues was the role of councillors in local authorities.  There are two ways by which a transfer can take place.  The first is complete dissolution, by which method the company is merged with the local authority its entirety.  The concerns raised by Senators are more likely to emerge in the second model which is referred to in the Bill as a transfer of shareholding.  It means that the company will be transferred to the local authority, with the key difference being the shareholding will be held by the local authority as opposed to the Minister of the day.  In that context, I respectfully suggest the potential in the past for a perceived conflict of interest, let alone an actual conflict of interest, could become even bigger.  I will give an example of what I am referring to.  </p><p>Let us take a scenario in which the accounts of the company are being laid in front of the local authority, as required.  This involves their being laid in front of a body of which a director of the company issuing the accounts could be a member.  The director could find himself or herself in a position where he or she might not be able to engage in detail on the accounts, but questions would be raised concerning whether it was appropriate for accounts to be laid in front of the local authority of which the director was a member.</p></speech>

The answer is I have great faith in the ability of members of local authorities to exercise that power.  We are going to be in a situation where a local authority will be able to quiz the chairman of the board of a port or harbour.  If I am conferring that power on it, which represents a very significant change in its relationship with a port, is it not enough for me to confer it without requiring it to exercise it?  I would expect local authorities to exercise the power far more regularly than once a year.  </p> <p>On the different situations that could develop, an aspect that perhaps was not touched on enough on Second Stage - it can be dealt with at a later point; Senators understandably and correctly focused on the steps we were taking towards democratic accountability through the auspices of the local authority - was the great benefit to be gained in proper planning and the integration of a port into the local authority unit and community in which it was located.  I look at the issue raised by Senator Hildegarde Naughton and other colleagues about the port in Galway and pose the question as to whether it would be a more effective use of resources and a better way of handling the future of the port to recognise its needs and look at how it could be integrated into the overall development of the city and county through the local authority.  It appears obvious that local authorities in integrating harbours and ports into the decisions they will make will provide opportunities for joined-up government and the integrated planning about which many of us speak in other areas of economic and public life.</p> <p>On democratic accountability, I suggest to Senators that the wins and benefits being offered to all members of local authorities in terms of their ability to exercise their democratic mandate comprehensively outweigh any concern they might have about individual members losing their ability to raise matters with a board.  I contend that given the strengthened powers local authority assemblies will have, it makes it even more inappropriate for somebody to be on a board of a body that will now be accountable to the body to which he or she was elected - the local authority.  </p> <p>Senator Ned O'Sullivan asked about what could happen in the case of hidden debts.  This is the very reason there will be a due diligence process in which the local authorities and the harbour and port companies will participate in order that these matters can be identified and dealt with before a transfer takes place.  Senator Pat O'Neill has made the point that this is a continuation of port policy.  I listened to what Senator Terry Brennan said to me.  He said I should "make haste slowly."  I respectfully make the point that this is the continuation of a policy published in 2013 and that we are moving at a deliberate pace rather than being hasty.  </p> <p>Senator Pat O'Neill's main substantive point was about the potential privatisation of ports.  The Bill makes it very clear that the ability to dispose of a share extends only to a maximum figure of 49%.  There are two contingencies in this respect which I might explore further with Members on Committee Stage.  As things stand, with the potential exception of two developments taking place that would require ministerial consent, 51% of the company must remain in public ownership.  This is consistent with what I have said about airports also, that assets such as this, subject to a Government changing its mind - any future Government will have this ability - should remain in majority State ownership.  Due to the development for which we have provided, they will be able to be maintained in State ownership and have the ability to raise funding through the issuing of equity.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Paschal Donohoe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2244"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2244&amp;amp;pid=PaschalDonohoe&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is laid out in some detail in the sections, on which we will go into detail on Committee Stage.<br/><br/>In response to the point Senator Sean D. Barrett put to me, as he can appreciate - we can go into the matter in more detail later - the sections of the Competition Authority's report, in particular on Dublin Port, deal with competition within it.  In fairness, the Senator did acknowledge this.  The Bill is focused primarily on ports of regional significance, as opposed to competition within a port of national significance, namely, Dublin Port.  I have written to the Competition Authority and believe my letter is on my Department's website.  We can use it as we get into the Bill in more detail as it passes through the House.  I agree that there is a need for more competition within national ports.  An existing challenge is to recognise legal ownership and existing rights.  I wish to see competition increased.<br/><br/>Senator Sean D. Barrett also made a point about how we could maintain commercial focus.  Both he and Senator Gerard P. Craughwell inquired as to whether local authorities really had the reputation for efficiency that others alleged they had.  My own honest analysis in dealing with this matter is that we will see a greater impetus for regional development from local authorities in dealing with ports of regional significance.  In terms of how the commercial focus and ethos will be maintained, in the method of complete dissolution commercial responsibility for ports and the commercial consequences will sit directly with the local authorities, which of itself will create the impetus for at least the maintenance of a commercial ethos.  On those ports that we will transfer as a corporate entity, a company, the board of directors will still be in place and they they will continue to generate and drive the commercial ethos.  When I visit ports, as I do on a regular basis, I am confident that there is definitely a commercial ethos and I do not think the Bill contains anything that will change the position.<br/><br/>Senator M&aacute;ir&iacute;a Cahill welcomed the oversight function within the Bill, which is an important development, as it it something we seek to address.  I think I have addressed most of the issues raised by Senator Kathryn Reilly.  She made a point about the role of the local authority chief executive <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the role of local authority members.  The Bill makes reference to both.  It is fair to say though that because the structure of local government and the functions of the executive and members are not my responsibility &ndash; they are the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly &ndash; I have integrated the governance structures of the ports, depending on how they are integrated into the existing ways in which local authorities are organised, but I still contend strongly that the change will result in significantly more powers for local authority members than is the case.<br/><br/>I have touched on some of the points raised by Senator Maurice Cummins on the role of members.  I look forward to debating the issue further in due course.  <br/><br/>In response to Senators Gerard P. Craughwell and Hildegarde Naughton, I will handle both of their contributions together because each of them spoke about the future of Galway Port.  I emphasise one point very strongly to each of them and thank them for raising the issue in the Seanad.  Each of them mentioned trans-European transport network, TEN-T, funding and its importance.  The definition of how ports can access TEN-T funding is completely independent of the Bill.  We have ports that are integrated into local authorities the length and breadth of Europe that can access TEN-T funding.  The challenge is that TEN-T funding is determined by the European Union which has a requirement &quot;that ports have to handle 0.1% of total European Union freight or passenger numbers&quot;.  Regardless of the designation I offer ports, that is the criterion they must meet.  As is the case with any criterion, what the Commission has done is used an historical base in looking at the performance of various ports in meeting the criteria.  One point I must emphasise to each of the Senators is that the ability to access TEN-T funding is not affected by the designation of ports in the Bill.  One either accesses TEN-T funding or one does not and it is determined by the European Commission.  At times, my Department and I offer support to ports all over the country to help them to do this.<br/><br/>The decision I announced in the D&aacute;il earlier &ndash; as the Acting Chairman is ringing a bell behind me I will conclude promptly &ndash; on the 18 month period before the Minister of the day will sign the commencement order, was made to give space to allow all matters relating to due diligence and transfer to be addressed.  On the planning process, that is a matter completely independent of me as Minister.  I absolutely respect the role of An Bord Plean&aacute;la in making decisions on this matter, as it will, and also that it will take whatever amount of time it needs to make a decision.  It is a matter for it to decide and it will make the decision independently of me.<br/><br/>I heard what Senator Terry Brennan said about Louth County Council.  He put a point to me about what would happen with a trading deficit and the answer is that it depends primarily on how the company would be transferred.  If it is transferred through the shareholding transfer method, in other words, it is an existing company, and maintains its existence as a company, it will still be a matter for the board of directors of the company.  If the port is completely integrated into or amalgamated with the local authority, it will be a matter for the local authority.<br/><br/>On the question of dredging, a need in all ports - I should have referred to the matter when responding to Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill - Government policy is that we cannot and do not make funding available to meet the infrastructural needs of ports or harbours.  It is a matter for them.  It is for the local authority to fund the future dredging of any port, as is the case at present.<br/><br/>I have covered nearly all of the issues Senators put to me.  I thank them for their broad support for the Bill and look forward to having the opportunity to work with the House to, I hope, allow its passage.</p></speech>

First, it provided a stable funding base for the local authority sector, incorporating appropriate elements of local authority responsibility.  As such, it strongly reinforced local democratic decision making and encouraged greater efficiency by local authorities on behalf of their electorates.  Second, it delivered significant structural reform through broadening the base for taxation in a manner which does not directly impact on employment.  Accordingly, it contributed to meeting immediate financial requirements of the EU-IMF programme in place at the time of its inception.  The local property tax has met this objective and has replaced some of the revenue from transaction-based taxes with an annual recurring property tax.</p> <p>We know only too well how our reliance on transaction-based taxes proved to be an unstable source of Government revenue in the past.  By contrast, international experience has shown that property taxes are a secure and stable source of funding.  No one will deny that stability in its public finances is precisely what Ireland needs, now and into the future.  Moreover, the local property tax enables us to achieve our goals in a manner which does not directly impact on employment.  The Government has been steadfast in its determination to do everything in its power to protect and support the creation of jobs.  As a measure which is a tax on assets, not employment, the local property tax does not adversely affect job creation.</p> <p>Due to its importance, and conscious of the concerns of homeowners over increasing property prices and potential effects on their local property tax liabilities, especially in urban areas, the Minister for Finance asked Dr. Don Thornhill to review the operation of the local property tax and, in particular, any impacts on local property tax liabilities due to recent property price developments.  Dr. Thornhill has a distinguished record of public service and chaired the inter-departmental group on the design of a local property tax in 2012.  In his report, published on budget day, Dr. Thornhill made several recommendations.  His central recommendation is for a revised system whereby a minimum level of local property tax revenues in each local authority area would be determined by the Government, ideally having regard to the apportionment between local authority areas of the historic yield.  This, in turn, would allow for the estimation of local property tax rates for each local authority area and the application of these by taxpayers and Revenue.  Local authorities could adjust this rate upwards by a factor of up to 15%.  This new system was recommended by Dr. Thornhill with a possible interim deferral of the next valuation date until November 2018 or November 2019.</p> <p>In his 2016 Budget Statement, the Minister for Finance announced he would be proposing to the Government that the postponement of the revaluation date for the local property tax from 2016 to 2019.  This postponement means that homeowners will not be faced with significant increases in their local property tax in 2017 as a result of increased property values.  The postponement also gives sufficient time for the other recommendations in Dr. Thornhill's report to be considered fully by the next Government.  It is appropriate the next Government, whatever its composition, is given the opportunity to deal with that report.  The postponement of the revaluation date - alongside the publication of the report and the mandate the next Government will receive - provides the opportunity and the space in which that can happen.</p> <p>The Bill will give effect to the postponement of the revaluation date of residential property for local property tax purposes.  It will also give effect to two of the recommendations in Dr. Thornhill's report, involving local property tax relief for properties affected by pyrite and relief for properties occupied by persons with disabilities.  The Bill provides for a relaxation, in certain limited circumstances, of the requirement for the certification of pyrite damage by a competent person for the purpose of local property tax relief.  In addition, on reliefs for properties occupied by persons with disabilities, the changes being administered by the Revenue, under their care and management provisions, will be covered by this Bill, dispensing formally with a requirement that adaptions to property had to have been grant-aided by a local authority.  Eligibility for local property tax exemption for properties occupied by incapacitated persons is being relaxed so that they will no longer, for example, have to have been the recipient of a court award or an award from the Injuries Board.  Issues relating to the implementation of other recommendations in the Thornhill review report will be a matter for consideration by the next Government.</p> <p>Section 2 concerns a minor technical amendment to section 3 of the principal Act to correct an omission in a cross-reference to the sections contained in Part 2 of the Act.</p> <p>Section 3 amends section 8 of the principal Act, which relates to an exemption from the charge to local property tax for second-hand properties purchased during the year 2013 and occupied by the purchaser as his or her main residence.  The section, as introduced, specifies the period of exemption as the liability dates in the years 2013 to 2015, inclusive, which dates correspond to the years 2013 to 2016, inclusive.  The general rule, as contained in section 14 of the principal Act, for the treatment of properties exempt on a particular valuation date, is that they continue to be exempt until the following valuation date.  As a result of the retention of the current valuation date of 1 May 2013 for an additional three years, the next valuation date will be 1 November 2019 instead of 1 November 2016.  The amendment is required to change the reference in section 8 to the year 2016 to the year 2019 in line with the postponement of the next valuation date until 1 November 2019.</p> <p>Section 4 amends section 9 of the principal Act, which relates to an exemption from the charge to local property tax for new properties purchased from a builder in the period from 1 January 2013 to 31 October 2019, the date immediately preceding the deferred valuation date of 1 November 2019.  Again, this will bring the principal Act into line with the decision to postpone the revaluation date.</p> <p>Section 5 amends section 10A of the principal Act, which relates to an exemption from the charge to local property tax for certain properties that have been damaged by pyrite.  As recommended by Dr. Thornhill, this exemption is being extended to include some additional situations.  Up to now, the exemption has been available for those properties that have been certified by a competent person, such as an engineer, as having significant pyrite damage following assessment and measurement in accordance with regulations made by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Revenue is precluded from approving an exemption where a property owner has not obtained the required certificate of damage.  Dr. Thornhill recommended the exemption continue on this basis.  However, he considered it should be extended to certain properties which have been shown to have the required level of damage but which have not been certified by a competent person in accordance with the relevant regulations.</p> <p>When the exemption was introduced, it was envisaged that all properties which would be accepted into the remediation scheme to be operated by the Pyrite Resolution Board, would undergo testing of the under-floor hard-core building material and certification of the level of pyrite damage.  However, in some cases, the board can be satisfied that the property has the required level of damage without carrying out such testing to verify this.  In the absence of testing, the certificate of damage completed by a competent person required by Revenue may not be available.  For this reason, Dr. Thornhill recommended that evidence of acceptance into the remediation scheme be accepted by Revenue in lieu of this certificate.</p> <p>Dr. Thornhill also considered that properties which are remediated as a result of a successful claim against an insurance company should be exempt.  This could happen where builders have insured their properties against structural defects or where property owners have insurance policies which provide cover for structural defects.  The rationale for extending this exemption is that an insurance company would only pay out on foot of a claim for the cost of remediating a property where it was satisfied that the presence of pyrite had actually caused significant damage to the property.  A similar rationale underlies the recommendation that the exemption be extended to those properties that are remediated by the builder or property developer who built the particular property.  It was considered that remediation, or the provision of the funds for remediation, would happen only where the builder was satisfied that the presence of pyrite had actually caused significant damage to a property.  While builders may unilaterally volunteer to remediate a damaged property, remediation may also come about following the institution of legal proceedings against a builder or against the person who provided the building material containing the pyrite.</p> <p>The changes are being implemented retrospectively.  Accordingly, in the case of remediation by the Pyrite Resolution Board, the effective date will be the date of acceptance into the remediation scheme.  In the case of remediation by insurance companies and builders, the effective date will be when the remediation has been completed and certified or when sufficient funds to carry out the remediation have been provided by the relevant party.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Harris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2338"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is about ensuring the people who were originally meant to benefit from the exemption can do so without having undergo too much bureaucracy while ensuring we keep the exemption targeted at those at whom it was originally targeted.<br/><br/>Section 6<b></b>amends section 10B of the principal Act which relates to an exemption for residential properties that are acquired because of their suitability for occupation as a residence by certain severely incapacitated individuals or those properties that are adapted to make them more suitable for this purpose.  Eligibility for the exemption depends on an individual being permanently and totally incapacitated, because of a mental or physical infirmity, from being able to maintain himself or herself.  When this exemption was introduced, an incapacitated individual - I do not like the word &quot;incapacitated&quot; but it is the word that is used legally - was required to have received an award from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board or a court in respect of a personal injury or, alternatively, to be a beneficiary under a trust that was established specifically for the benefit of the individual.  However, in practice, there are individuals who are permanently and totally incapacitated to such an extent that they are unable to maintain themselves and whose condition is so severe that it dictates the type of property they can live in and who would be eligible for the exemption were it not for the fact they have not received the required award or benefited from a public trust fund.  For this reason, the Minister for Finance decided in May 2014 to relax these conditions.  The exemption no longer depends on the receipt of an award from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board or a court or the establishment of a public trust fund for the incapacitated individual's benefit.  Instead, the nature and extent of the individual's incapacity is established by the submission of relevant information to Revenue.  The individual's doctor is required to provide information in relation to the individual's condition and why the particular property or adaptation was considered to be necessary.  The Minister for Finance asked Revenue to implement this new procedure on an administrative basis until he had the opportunity to make the necessary legislative amendments.  We are now proposing to make those legislative amendments through this section.<br/><br/>With respect to section 7, the Government agreed to the Minister for Finance's proposal to postpone the next valuation date for local property tax from 2016 to 2019 in line with a recommendation made by Dr. Thornhill in his recent review.  The valuation date is the date on which property owners are required to establish the market value of their properties.  Section 7 amends section 13 of the principal Act to retain the current valuation date of 1 May 2013 for an additional three years up to and including 2019.  The next valuation date will be 1 November 2019 instead of 1 November 2016.  This postponement means that property owners will not be faced with significant increases in their local property tax liability in 2017 as a result of increased property values since May 2013.  It also allows sufficient time, as I outlined, for the other recommendations made by Dr. Thornhill to be considered and implemented in whatever way the incoming Government considers fit.<br/><br/>Section 8<b></b>amends section 14 of the principal Act which contains the general rule in regard to the treatment of properties that are exempt on a particular valuation date.  Such properties continue to be exempt until the following valuation date.<br/><br/>Section 9 amends section 15A of the principal Act which relates to a relief that is available in respect of certain properties that are adapted to make them more suitable for occupation by a person with a disability.  The relief takes the form of a reduction in the chargeable value of a property where the adaptation work has the effect of increasing the chargeable value.  A condition for the relief, as introduced, was that the adaptation work be grant-aided under one of the local authority schemes available for this purpose.  However, in practice, as we all know, there are people with a disability who occupy properties that have been adapted to make them more suitable for this purpose but where, for various reasons, the adaptation work was not necessarily grant-aided by a local authority.  For this reason, the Minister decided in May 2014 to relax this particular condition.  The relief no longer depends on the receipt of a local authority grant.  Instead, the nature and extent of the disability is established by the submission of relevant information to the Revenue Commissioners.  The disabled person's doctor is required to provide information in relation to the disability and why the particular adaptation was considered to make the property more suitable for occupation by that person.  At the request of the Minister for Finance, similar to other amendments, Revenue has implemented this procedure on an administrative basis.  This section now gives effect to this procedure on a retrospective basis.<br/><br/>In addition to this new procedure, Dr. Thornhill recommended a change to the way in which the allowable reduction in the chargeable value of a property is calculated.  Currently, the allowable reduction is linked to the maximum grant that would have been payable under the relevant local authority scheme and to the amount of the increase in the chargeable value of a property that is attributable to the adaptation work that was carried out.  This is being changed to a reduction of a fixed amount of &euro;50,000, which coincides with the width of the local property tax valuation bands.  This change will ensure that most people who carry out adaptation work that increases the chargeable value of their property will benefit from a reduction in their local property tax liability of the amount attributable to each one band increase in value, which is &euro;90.  This new method of calculating the allowable reduction in the chargeable value of a property is being implemented with effect from the next liability date of 1 November 2016 in regard to local property tax that will be payable for 2017.<br/><br/>Section 10 amends section 35 of the principal Act which relates to the submission of returns to Revenue by liable persons in relation to residential properties.  The information to be included on a return includes, for example, the liable person's assessment of the market value of the property, a claim for an exemption or a deferral of payment and the preferred payment method.  In the normal course, a liable person who submits a return in relation to a particular valuation date does not have to submit another return until the following valuation date when the market value of the property has to be reassessed, unless their circumstances change in the intervening period.  As a result of the retention of the 1 May 2013 valuation date for an additional three years, the number of years for which returns do not have to be submitted is also extended.  This amendment provides for that extended period that includes 2019 and brings the law in line with the announcement by the Minister.<br/><br/>Section 11 amends section 153 of the principal Act which contains the list of bodies from whom Revenue may request information.  Revenue can only request information that it reasonably requires for the purposes of establishing, maintaining and ensuring the accuracy of its register of residential properties and its administration of local property tax.  The list of such bodies includes, for example, the Local Government Management Agency, the Private Residential Tenancies Board, the Minister for Social Protection and the National Asset Management Agency.  Following on from other amendments made in this Bill, this amendment adds three new bodies to the list from whom information may be requested to verify eligibility for an exemption being claimed by a liable person.  The Pyrite Resolution Board may be asked to provide information on properties accepted into its remediation scheme.  The Personal Injuries Assessment Board and the Courts Service of Ireland may be asked for information on awards made to certain incapacitated individuals.<br/><br/>Overall, this Bill primarily seeks to achieve three objectives.  First, it seeks to postpone the revaluation date until 1 November 2019.  Second, it seeks to lessen the burden of proof required for an exemption for properties affected by pyrite and reduce the bureaucracy, difficulty and expenses some people have incurred in trying to avail of that.  Third, it seeks to relax the conditions for people with disabilities with respect to the properties they require to live in or that they require to adapt to live in.  I hope the Bill will receive broad support from Members on all sides of the House.</p></speech>

I am particularly disappointed the House has only been given one and a half hours to debate all Stages of this Bill.  We have tabled amendments to it, as has Sinn F&eacute;in, to improve it but we will probably will not have the time to consider them.  I sincerely regret taking all Stages of this Bill today as there is a good deal in it.  I and my party agree with the main thrust of it with regard to the suspension of the revaluation date.  We have called for that for some time and that is to be welcomed.</p> <p>In the six minutes allocated to me, I wish to point to areas in respect of which an incoming Government would have to further change the legislation because it does not go far enough.  The premise of the local property tax with respect to the way it is structured is that it is valuation based.  We consider that model is incorrect because it mitigates against mainly urban dwellers.  It should have been either a site value tax or based on the square footage of the house.  The owners of two-bedroomed or three-bedroomed houses in Dublin are paying multiples with respect to the property tax paid by the owners of five-bedroomed or six-bedroomed houses elsewhere.  That is not a fair way to levy the tax.  </p> <p>A glaring omission in the Bill is the lack of inclusion of an ability to pay clause.  The Minister is only allowing people to defer payment and, for that facility, they will be charged 4% per annum compound interest.  I have met many people, as I am sure the Minister of State has, who are what is termed asset rich but cash poor.  Many of them are elderly and live in large family homes and many of those people in my area of north Dublin are living on the State pension.  Those people are not been granted an exemption, all they are being offered is a deferral, for which facility they will be charged a penal interest rate of 4%.  That should have been changed.  I have tabled amendments, which we will probably not get to debate, that would deal with that aspect.  Will the Minister of State take that point on board?  The inclusion of an ability to pay clause would assist a person who is out of work or a person who is in mortgage arrears.  The issue of mortgage arrears situation is not dealt with in the Bill.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Darragh O'Brien:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2178"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->On behalf of my party, I have tabled an amendment that would deal with people in mortgage arrears.  If they cannot pay a mortgage, it is absolutely ridiculous that they would be expected to pay the local property tax.  That should not be the case.</p><p>I welcome the broad thrust of what the Minister of State said regarding the pyrite exemption.  The biggest issue is the scheme itself because to get an exemption, one must be accepted into the scheme.  Fewer than 400 homes have been accepted into the scheme but thousands of houses are affected.  The scheme is cumbersome.  I met officials from the Housing Agency and the Pyrite Resolution Board, PRB, two weeks ago in Leinster House.  The pyrite exemption should be administered on a self-assessment basis.  It is a self-assessed tax and people should be able to say they have pyrite in their properties.  The problem with the definition is the reference to significant levels of pyrite damage.  Leaving aside the damage, a house with a significant level of pyrite is valueless.  It has no value, whether the damage is evident in cracks and so on.</p><p>I welcomed the establishment of the PRB at the time but a house has to be in category 2 to be accepted into the scheme, which means it must have significant levels of damage.  This means only 400 homes are in the scheme.  However, thousands of homes are in category 1, which means they have a high level of pyrite, which has not shown yet to be at a significant level.  Those people's homes are valueless and they should not have to pay the LPT.  The proposed extension should include them.  If this was done on a self-assessment basis, Revenue officials would be able to conduct spot checks, like they do with everything else, to ensure people are being honest.</p><p>The problem with this is the Minister of State will look to the PRB to share details with him and it will point to 400 cases.  That is not how this was meant to work.  I recently discussed this with officials from the Housing Agency and the PRB in the Custom House.  The definition should refer to significant levels of pyrite, not significant damage, because these houses will need to be fixed anyway.  I ask the Minister of State to examine this.  My party has made a commitment to introduce a full exemption for homes with significant levels of pyrite that may not have presented with damage at this stage.  They cannot be sold because they are valueless.  One cannot sell a house that has pyrite whether it has significant cracking or not.</p><p>I drafted the Management Fees (Local Property Tax) Relief Bill 2015.  I have tabled an amendment, which we will not get to because of the brief time the Government has seen fit to allocate for this legislation, that would deal with the cases of people who pay management fees and property tax.  There should be a partial exemption for management fees.</p></speech>

They pay for their light and insurance and they pay into sinking funds for their estates.  My Bill was defeated in the other House and, therefore, could not be introduced here because it was a cost on the Exchequer.</p> <p>My amendment in this regard would provide for a partial exemption on a principal private residence only.  The exemption would be equal to one third of the management fee or &euro;300, or one third of the LPT.  The maximum relief, therefore, would be &euro;300.  That is sensible and fully costed.  The Minister of State's officials can check this but the cost would be approximately &euro;15 million.</p> <p>Many people living in apartments and homes on managed estates feel they are being hit on the double and they are correct.  There is no provision in the legislation to deal with that.  I hope we get to my amendment but it is unlikely.  In addition, the interest rate on a deferral at 4% is too high.</p> <p>I will support the Bill on the basis that it freezes the revaluation date but it is sorely lacking in other detail that could have made a difference for those who cannot afford to pay the LPT, those whose homes are valueless and those who live on managed estates and who are effectively being taxed on the double and paying a tax for services that they do not derive.  I thank the Minister of State for introducing the legislation.  It is a pity the House only has an hour and a half to debate all Stages.</p></speech>

One has to look positively on the Bill and the provisions outlined by him.  The LPT reliefs for houses damaged and undermined by pyrite and for houses in which people with disabilities reside are a humane, honest and up-front way of dealing with these issues.  One must also welcome the certainty that there will be no increase in the LPT before November 2019.  All households will welcome that.  I also welcome the exemption for all new properties purchased between 2013 and 2016.</p> <p>Could the LPT be abused by insurance companies?  Hypothetically, people could value their homes between &euro;90,000 and &euro;150,000 but when it comes to insuring the house, it will cost the same if the value is between &euro;150,000 and &euro;250,000.  That is the way bands are applied for home insurance.  If somebody had the misfortune to have his or her home destroyed, could the insurance company say, "You had your home insured with us for &euro;250,000, yet it was only valued at &euro;150,000 for the purposes of the LPT"?  Is there room to address this issue in the legislation?  I am fearful of insurance companies exploiting this scenario.</p></speech>

I wonder what he would think of this tax on people.  It is not even a rational tax because it is subject to the arbitrary fluctuations of the market.  How fair is that?  It is not fair at all because it does not relate to ability to pay or the initial cost and, most perniciously of all, it takes into account improvements that people make.  It is an example of rack-renting on the part of the Government.  If one dares to improve one's house, the value goes up and one is fined for it by the Government.

It is not but why should it be?  It impacts on house owners.  What about people - I declare an interest - like me?  Luckily, I can afford to pay these taxes for the time being but when I retire with the very reduced pension I get from this place I may not be about to do so.  That is thanks to the cowardice of the Government in giving in and letting the Civil Service off with all their increments, allowances and every other bloody thing but stripping everything away from us here.  We are less than the majority of middle-ranking civil servants.  That is what the Government thinks of us.  Civil servants, having managed to stream all their allowances into their income and preserve their increments, are now, according to <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>, determined to get away from us and sever the link completely because we are so stupid and mealy-mouthed about being paid a decent wage.

Come the revolution, indeed.  As the Minister of State has already said, there are three aspects of the Bill that are welcome.  It is important to state that incomes will not rise in accordance with property values between November 2016 and November 2019, particularly in the Dublin region.  It is important to acknowledge that if we did not adjust property valuations, we would be significantly increasing taxation on people.  Therefore, it is important to welcome this Bill.</p> <p>Like Senator Darragh O'Brien, I very much welcome the allowances being given for buildings that suffer from pyrite damage.  I agree with the Senator that we are not going far enough in that respect.  In estates suffering from pyrite damage, people will not be able to sell their properties which are, in effect, valueless.  When we look at valuations, that must be taken into account.</p> <p>On the adaptation grants, the allowances being made are most welcome.  We live in an aging society in which people are living longer and we want them to live at home.  When people make adjustments to their properties to allow that to happen, they should be rewarded instead of penalised for doing so.  People have been living in fear of property tax.  It is important that we give them some solace about what we, as a Government, intend to do.  While this legislation may not be perfect, I welcome it and would very much welcome a broader discussion on the issue of the Thornhill report and on whether we should be using, as Senator Darragh O'Brien said, a site valuation tax or a tax based on square footage.  It is an important debate to have.  </p> <p>I very much welcome the broadening of the tax base.  Numerous reports have called for a broadening of the Irish tax base for a considerable period of time.  Like many others, I have protested over the years against a tax system which is based far too much on income and transaction tax and which does not place half enough emphasis on asset values.  We talk about the three Fs but the fact is that Ireland is one of the few sophisticated economies in the world that did not have a property tax until very recently.  We are all aware of certain individuals who could give Cinderella a run for her money in terms of their ability to disappear at midnight.  They do not have a tax code applied to them because they do not exceed 190 days residence here yet their children go to the same schools as my children, they drive on the same roads and some of them were born in the same hospitals as my children.  It is just not good enough.  We need to have a tax system that takes this into account appropriately.</p> <p>Ultimately, one of the problems with the system we put in place is that it is neither fish nor fowl - it is not a property tax or a local services tax.  I am in favour of the fact that 85% of the tax is spent in the local area.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Aideen Hayden:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2384"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2384&amp;amp;pid=AideenHayden&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->For example, I very much agree that apartment owners, who constitute a very considerable number of people who live in the Dublin region, do not have the fact that they pay very high management costs taken into account when their property tax is assessed.  It is very important to consider that housing is more expensive in the Dublin region.  People who live in the region must pay more for their homes and use more of their disposable incomes to put a roof over their heads.  There is nothing about the local property tax system which takes this into account.</p><p>It is very important to bear in mind that many people living in negative equity in urban areas - houses in Galway are particularly expensive - are paying property tax based on a gross value of properties in respect of which they may have substantial debts.  Such issues must be addressed.  There should be a taxation system which takes into account the net value.  I have no difficulty with people being taxed on the disposal of an asset and paying on the basis of any gain they make.  I have a significant problem with people paying what is really a tax on their income based on what, for them, is not a value but which, in some cases, is actually a loss.  However, we are not here today to discuss that issue.</p><p>I wish to refer to a final issue.  The tax is based on the curtilage of up to one acre.  If somebody is running a business, such as a farm or a market garden, that is fine.  However, there are many people who live in counties surrounding Dublin and who trot out their ponies on their additional four acres of land.  No charge is levied on that amenity value.</p></speech>

As somebody who lives in Dublin, who is very well aware of the costs involved and who deals with housing-related matters all the time, I am of the view that our tax must be fair.  When amenity value is not subjected to tax, then it is not a fair system.  There is a need to have an appraisal of this tax.  I believe it must be amended.  Valuations should be fair and take into account the realities of the lives that people in this country live.</p></speech>

It was not written in stone by the European Union and International Monetary Fund.  The local property tax has not been about the provision of improved local services, particularly as approximately 30% of the revenue collected in 2014 was diverted to Irish Water.</p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il supports the main provision of the Bill, which is the postponement of the implementation of the revaluation date for the local property tax to November 2019.  We have been calling for this since 2014 and the Government previously voted down Fianna F&aacute;il amendments that would have dealt with the issue before now.  Failure to amend the valuation date would have resulted in massively increased local property tax bills.</p> <p>There are still many problems in the operation of the local property tax, including a need to address the issue of ability to pay.  Fianna F&aacute;il is committed to a review of the property tax which will take account of this.  We are also committed to providing relief for homeowners who pay management fees to fund many services ordinarily provided by the local council.  The Government has dragged its heels on exempting homeowners affected by pyrite from the local property tax.</p> <p>The Bill does not address this issue of double taxation on apartment owners who pay management fees and local property tax.  A typical two-bedroom apartment in Dublin will attract management fees of &euro;1,200 to &euro;1,400 per annum, which may be equivalent to an additional month's mortgage.  Apartment owners and residents of other managed complexes provide many services, ranging from lighting to maintenance of road surfaces, footpaths and green spaces through the annual management fee.  These services are ordinarily provided by local councils in housing estates but apartment owners must pay the same level of local property tax.  A credit should be provided against the local property tax for up to a third of the liability or &euro;300, whichever is lower, in cases where the apartment owner has paid their management fees in full.</p> <p>I draw the attention of the Minister of the State to the inability to pay of those on squeezed household incomes.  There are still many problems relating to the operation of a local property tax, including a need to address the issue of ability to pay.  As I stated earlier, Fianna F&aacute;il is committed to a review of the property tax which will take account of this.  I wish put on the record the text of our proposed Committee Stage amendment tabled in the name of Senator Darragh O'Brien.</p></speech>

I also checked the Department website and realised the amount of work put into this by Dr. Don Thornhill.  He is somebody who has served the State well and even many years after that, he is willing to give time to it.  I mentioned another man yesterday, Dr. T.K. Whitaker, to whom I spoke last night and who is 99 today.  I rang Dr. Whitaker to congratulate him and tell him that legislation which contemplates his 1985 recommendation in respect of a project relating to prisons passed Second Stage yesterday.  That is a reminder of the people who serve the State well, even after their retirement.</p> <p>I disagree with Senator Norris in this instance because I approve of this good Bill.  I am particularly happy to see that the Government has delayed any review of property taxes until 2019.  There are one or two issues nevertheless.  Official figures recently indicated that more than 2,000 homeowners applied for an exemption from the local property tax based on the fact that their homes are affected by pyrite.  Fewer than 80 people were successful in obtaining the exemption, which I do not understand.  That is a success rate of only 5%.  It is estimated that up to 20,000 houses could be damaged by this substance, as Senator Darragh O'Brien noted.  I note the Minister for Finance indicated that many people were not granted the exemption as they did not "provide the required level of supporting documentation".  Why is the onus on the homeowner to prove something?  I am not sure if that principle makes sense.  In particular, I do not understand why a homeowner must declare the value of the home in order to calculate the local property tax, and this figure is accepted by the Revenue Commissioners.  If an exemption is requested, the homeowner is not believed and he or she must prove his or her case.  This seems like something of a dichotomy because people whose homes are affected by pyrite may also be required to obtain an engineer's report, which could be extremely costly.  The Minister of State touched on some exemptions but it is not fair to allow people to declare the value of their homes so that the information can be used by the Revenue Commissioners.  At the same time, however, they are not believed when they state that their homes have been affected by pyrite.  I would love to get a comment from the Minister of State on that matter.</p> <p>What happens when a house is uninhabitable and people are seeking an exemption from the local property tax?  It is relatively common that an older person may die and his or her house is left to go rack and ruin.  The person who owns the house might ask for an exemption because there might be no electricity or water connection as a result of the fact that nobody has been living in it for several years.  However, the Revenue Commissioners would not believe this information.  People may be obliged to provide documentary evidence to support this declaration, such an engineer's certificate or photographs.  At the same time, the Revenue Commissioners have confirmed that it is not possible for them to provide a prescriptive list of criteria that would need to be met for a property to be deemed unsuitable for use as a dwelling.  In effect, the Revenue Commissioners make the property owner come up with all the information but will not even give the list of elements they would consider to render a house uninhabited.  It is unfair as it does not look after the customer, who is the taxpayer.</p> <p>With both of these cases - where a house has pyrite or is inhabitable - the Revenue should accept the homeowner's case and not presume that the customer is being deceitful.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Feargal Quinn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1972"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1972&amp;amp;pid=FergalQuinn&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The onus should be placed on Revenue.  It if doubts a homeowner, it should send inspectors to ask questions.  It is collecting masses of money through this new tax.  It is estimated more than &euro;1 billion will have been collected by the end of the year.  I do not understand why Revenue allows a person to value his or her home and believes that figure for the most part but will not believe a person if he or she seeks an exemption.  I would be interested in hearing the Minister of State's thoughts on that procedure.</p><p>The Minister of State is welcome.  I like the Bill and what it aims to do, but there are some questions that need to be answered.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-12-08a.166" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1155" speakername="Kathryn Reilly" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015120800002#DD00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State.  I see that some of the amendments we have tabled have been ruled out of order, while there are others we will probably not reach.  This is obviously not a tax with which we agree.  While we do not oppose the Bill because there are some elements that are important in the granting of relief in pyrite remediation and for people with disabilities, we are opposed to the underlying principle which the legislation seeks to amend as it concerns property tax.</p> <p>We are withdrawing some of our amendments, particularly those in which we oppose sections of the Bill.  These amendments were originally to be submitted together to remove chunks of the Bill to repeal the local property tax in its entirely.  Therefore, we will not be pushing them.  However, we will be discussing other amendments, if we reach that Stage of the Bill.</p> <p>Davy has predicted that by 2019 the average house price will have risen by &euro;68,000, which means that the average family could be paying &euro;180 extra per year in local property tax.  People are not stupid and realise this change is coming down the line.  One of the dangers identified in the Thornhill report on the local property tax was that the longer revaluations were left, the harder it would be to make them as the bigger the jump would be.  It also pointed to the possibility of legal challenges similar to that in the 1980s to the agricultural rates system.</p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in believes the local property tax model is broken and unfair and has always stated this.  Given the rushed nature of this legislation and the limited time we have to discuss it, we will not have time to reach the amendments tabled or to discuss the rationale behind what we attempted to do.  When reading up on the legislation, I noted that it was stated in one national newspaper that the local property tax was on life support and that the next Government would have to make a quick decision on whether to revive it or kill it off.  The effect of accepting our amendments as a group would be the abolition of the local property tax.  That is my party's commitment, if elected to government.  We tabled legislation which was rejected, but it is very much a firm promise by which we stand.</p> <p>As mentioned, the Thornhill report contained warnings about the existing exemptions and suggested they be abolished and that a new valuation method be developed to stop the local property tax from losing legitimacy, or, as I said, facing a legal challenge.  Dr. Don Thornhill said that unless the tax was put on a fair basis, it would either wither away or face legal challenges.  He suggested a new way of setting the tax based on the funding needs of local authorities.  What is the Minister of State's view of this?  He said in a speech on the report that the recommendations made in the Thornhill report would be considered by the incoming Government.  What does he envisage for the local property tax post-2019?  What is Fine Gael's view and what are its plans post-election, should it be in government?  In the context of the Thornhill report's recommendations, what would the Minister of State like to see being done?  Will he take on board elements of the report?  Will Fine Gael abandon the tax, which is what we believe should be done?</p> <p>As other Senators mentioned, the Bill contains new measures to remedy the pyrite exemption scheme.  Only 5% of applicants have been successful and the Department has admitted that the scheme is flawed and that it costs more to complete the necessary paperwork than the exemption is worth.  I do not believe we will have time to properly scrutinise the changes, but I hope they mean that families affected will received what was promised to them.</p> <p>I am disappointed that the opportunity was not used to make a move to introduce a similar exemption scheme for those affected by the mica block issue in County Donegal or for the residents of Longboat Quay and Riverwalk Court who find their homes practically valueless through no fault of their own.  It is not acceptable that we are leaving it to the residents to declare themselves exempt.  They need a clear signal that any such declaration will be met with a very positive response from Revenue.  I understand there has been some progress made, but a total exemption, rather than a partial exemption by charging them at the lowest band rate, is warranted.</p> <p>As I said, we will support the Bill, or, rather, that we will not oppose it.  While it has some important element, we oppose the local property tax.  It is our commitment that, if elected, we will abolish it.</p></speech>

Pyrite was a problem in Canada, as well as in Ireland.  We gave some papers to the then Minister, Mr. Hogan, when he was dealing with the issue.  What happened was that builders there sued the quarries that h ad supplied them with the defective materials to build houses.  That is how the money was recouped.  I do not know how the State became involved in dealing with what was a failure in the construction industry.  Let us examine this issue in order that, next time round, if people supply faulty building materials to builders, it will be a matter between the builders and quarry companies.  That is how the problem was handled in Canada.</p> <p>I support the freeze the Minister has provided for.  However, we have to be careful, particularly given the way it is being presented in some places.  Ireland was not a collection of tax dodgers until 2008; in fact, we were running the country with a surplus and the debt-to-GDP ratio was 25%.  However, we needed to beware what was happening in banking which led us to the problems encountered.  The Government wants to broaden the tax base.  My favourites in broadening the tax base would be having a low rate of corporate taxation, with no deductions and no allowances, in order to tackle inversion and all such things.  For very rich people, that is how the personal tax system works also.  Let us put out of business the tax lawyers and accountants and let us have a rate of tax that would be paid by everybody, as happens in the case of those in the PAYE system.</p> <p>Would I choose to tax property to the extent some advocate?  The answer is no for the simple reason that in our lifetimes we have seen house prices go from two and a half times to 12 times people's incomes at their peak.  They are probably back to about six times their incomes now.  Senator Aideen Hayden is one of the experts in the House on these matters and knows that that figure is very high by OECD standards.  The Government is choosing part of the tax base that will drive people into serious income difficulties because property prices are rising so rapidly.  That suits the Department of Finance, of course, but we speak on behalf of citizens, not on behalf of those whose job it is to collect revenues.</p> <p>Development levies were supposed to be set aside, but they have not been.  An annual payment was supposed to replace development levies, which income source was supposed to be insecure, yet they seem to be as large as ever.   No credit was given to those who had paid their property taxes in a lump sum at the point of purchase when we were designing the local property tax which is not that closely related to people's incomes.  If somebody wins the lotto and decides to buy a house in a neighbourhood, none of the other people living in it will have won the lotto, but the purchase price paid could set the market price which would not reflect the incomes of others.  </p> <p>The local property tax also does not reflect the incomes of people when they retire.  People buy a house in which to live.  The fixation we have with assets in Ireland, including seeing asset price as part of the tax base, is misplaced.  That the local property tax is not related to income, to the fact that people get old, that others buy houses in a neighbourhood at inflated prices or that bankers could go crazy again, as they did in the past, means it has no strong relation with ability to pay.</p> <p>I support the Minister of State in catering for people with disabilities.  This is most important and he has my support in that regard.  The freeze is also good.</p> <p>With regard to the pyrite exemption, let us look at the other route.  Why should taxpayers bail out quarries and builders?  For what is house insurance supposed to be?  Why does the private sector not take the risk?</p> <p>There should not be too many property taxes because of the in-built deficiencies.  The local property tax receive a great accolade from the wing in the Department of Finance that loves collecting taxes and which has been very successful at it, as we have seen in recent years.  However, it has to be related to ability to pay and that relationship is somewhat tenuous at present.</p></speech>

I understand the valuation is being deferred to 2019.  It is admirable that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, reached out to Dr. Thornhill.  I know of some of his previous work in the public service and he is a formidable public servant.  I also welcome the fact the Minister of State is seeking waivers for people with disabilities and houses affected by pyrite.  I echo Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s points about pyrite.</p><p>What is a definition of a disability?  Will this include blindness or people with intellectual disabilities?  They may not have a claim because they may have been born that way but they should.  Homes made valueless by natural disasters, such as flooding, should be exempt.  I hope the Minister of State will take that on board.  In Craughwell, some people&rsquo;s homes have been wiped out.  The same happened in Claregalway and Carnmore in 2009 but the Office of Public Works, OPW, has done work since and they were fine.  I do not know who was sitting on the job but in certain areas, work was not done.  It is appalling to think property tax and water bills are being sent to those homes, which are uninhabitable.  It would be very wise if the Minister of State asked the councils to identify affected homes and if a letter of comfort was sent to them stating that they are exempt until they are habitable again.  It is a minuscule amount given the horrors they face.</p><p>I tabled a Commencement Matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Finance, which the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government took, looking for a credit for any family paying management charges against their property tax.  This is a big issue.  For example, in Lackagh, Turloughmore, families are paying &euro;600 a year in management charges and maybe &euro;250 in property tax.  They agreed to pay the property tax on the basis that local services, such as grass cutting and lighting, etc., would be provided but nothing has changed.  They do not see any value and believe they are getting nothing for paying their property tax.  They feel duped.  Families in the Merlin Park area are paying up to &euro;2,000 a year in management charges.  They have no case against the management company, which must provide the services.  They thought the local authority would provide the services once the property tax kicked in and that they would get some credit.  However, the Government has stripped councils dry and they are in very bad shape.  I have seen the income for councils, which has steadily decreased since 2008.  The amount they get from the property tax barely keeps them ticking over.  Everyone feels duped.  The councils are in terrible shape and cannot meet their needs.  The home owner is, to some extent, blaming the council but it all goes back to the Departments of the Environment, Community and Local Government and Finance.  This will be a serious election issue.  I asked for a credit on a sliding scale against the property tax for anybody paying both management charges and property tax.  The Minister gave a very cheeky response to the Commencement Matter saying no credit would be given.  I was disappointed and the Minister of State should reconsider that.</p><p>To some extent, the Minister of State could justify having a local property tax and water tax during an emergency.  According to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, the emergency is partly over and yet when the new universal social charge, USC, rates come into effect, the people at the top rate will pay 49.5% in tax.  This is a very high tax economy with little to show for it.  It could be justified during the emergency when we were in bad financial shape.  The economy is said to be growing, although I am not completely convinced we are out of the emergency but the Minister of State must get his story right.  He cannot have it every way.  I would like him to respond to the questions about the credit for people paying management charges and councils paying property tax on rented properties and to indicate whether they pay on vacant properties because the long turnaround is not good enough.</p></speech>

It is clear that the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s decision to allow the next Government the space, and to seek the mandate from the people, to make any necessary amendments or tweaks to the policy of local property tax, LPT, is prudent.  My view and that of the Minister and the Government is that LPT is an important form of taxation and revenue.  It provides a stable source of funding.  Most people, except Sinn F&eacute;in, broadly accept that, with views on some amendments and tweaks.  We will have the opportunity to debate that during the election campaign.</p> <p>I join with Senators in thanking Dr. Thornhill for his work.  I thank Senator Quinn for sharing the information that it is Dr. T. K. Whitaker&rsquo;s 99th birthday today.  I send him my best wishes.  It is lovely to have an opportunity to pay tribute to two very fine public servants.</p> <p>The introduction of the LPT tax in 2013 was the largest extension of self-assessment in the history of the State with more than 1.3 million taxpayers obliged to file LPT returns and pay tax in respect of approximately 1.9 million properties.  The first valuation date was 1 May 2013 and the valuations declared on that date have defined the liabilities for 2013-16.  The next valuation date was due on 1 November 2016 and it was envisaged that would set the rates for 2017-19.  This Bill, in its simplest form, will defer that valuation from 2016 to 2019.  This postponement means in real terms that home owners will not be faced with significant increases in their LPT in 2017 as a result of increased property values and will provide space for the debate that Senator Hayden alluded to in terms of her own views on how she would like to see the tax evolve over time.  The LPT is producing a stable revenue yield for local authorities, although the rates are modest by international comparisons.  The charging structure of LPT is progressive, as the basic rate of 0.18% applies up to property values of &euro;1 million, with the higher rate of 0.25% applying on the portion of value above the &euro;1 million threshold.  The introduction of a property tax is part of a broader approach to taxation of property which aims to replace some of the revenue raised from transaction-based tax.</p> <p>Senator Norris, who wanted to trivialise the issue of income tax, by talking about the weather, misses the point entirely.  There is copious documentation and there are international studies he can read which describe that when work is taxed and governments continue to heap tax on income, it affects employment.  The Senator can read them and come back to me with his views.</p></speech>

From 1 January 2015, local authorities have had the discretion to vary the local property tax rate by plus or minus 15%.  Several authorities have exercised this option and between its inception and the end of 2015, the LPT is expected to have contributed more than &euro;1 billion to the funding of local authorities.  I note, however, that some will apply a smaller, or no, rate reduction in 2016.  This is an example of local authorities being empowered to make decisions about their communities, deciding whether the national rate is good enough or whether it should be put up by 15% because they want to improve local facilities, such as providing new pavements or a playground, or whether they should give households a break and reduce the rate by 15%.  Local authorities have made different decisions.  That is the purpose of empowering local government to make those decisions.  It is a local tax.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Harris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2338"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> In regard to compliance rates, Dr. Thornhill's recent review indicates that the compliance rates for the local property tax in the years 2013, 2014 and 2015 are estimated to be more than 95% and the number of compliant properties are estimated to be at 1.87 million, 1.87 million and 1.86 million for 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively.  This level of compliance reflects positively on the strategic and operational management of the local property tax and demonstrates public confidence in our Revenue Commissioners and, indeed, the effectiveness of the Revenue Commissioners in doing the job they are entrusted to do by the State.</p><p>For individuals on low incomes, the local property tax legislation provides for the possibility of deferring the charge in some cases.  To qualify for a deferral, the residential property must be occupied as a sole or main residence.  The income thresholds for a full deferral are &euro;15,000 for a single person and &euro;25,000 for a couple who are married persons, civil partners or cohabitants.  An increased income threshold applies in the cases of properties occupied as a sole or main residence that is subject to a mortgage.  In such cases, the gross income thresholds may be increased by 80% of the mortgage interest payment.  A deferral option in qualifying cases in this regard will apply until the end of 2017 and will assist individuals currently in mortgage distress.  Furthermore, a deferral of up to 50% of the local property tax liability is possible where the gross income of the liable person does not exceed &euro;25,000 for a single person or &euro;35,000 for married persons, civil partners or cohabitants.  A deferral of 50% of the local property tax liability is also available where gross income does not exceed the above thresholds, as increased by 80% of the gross mortgage interest payments that a liable person expects to make by the end of the year for which the gross income is being estimated.  This mortgage linked partial deferral will also be available until 31 December 2017.</p><p>I will now try to deal with some of the issues raised.  I do not want to get into all of the flooding issues now but Senator Healy Eames raised an important issue in regard to Galway.  The Dunkellin flood relief scheme is a priority scheme, for which funding is in place.  We are waiting for An Bord Plean&aacute;la to make a decision in regard to planning.  I do not want to say anything that will interfere in that process but I hope the decision is made as quickly as possible so that we can get on with that work because I know how much the people of Craughwell are suffering and have suffered in the past.  I take the point the Senator made in that regard. </p><p>On the issue of disability, this is a self-assessment tax.  Disability, as defined in the Disability Act 2005 in regard to a person, means a substantial restriction in the capacity of the person to carry on a profession, business or occupation in the State or to participate in social or cultural life in the State by reason of an enduring, physical, sensory, mental health or intellectual impairment.  In regard to a deaf or blind person, I cannot be overly prescriptive on this, as it is self-assessment.  However, it is about whether the home needs to be adapted and whether that has added value or whether the person needs to live in a particular type of house to meet his or her disability needs.  However, what this legislation is doing is lessening that burden and easing those restrictions on people so that they do not have to jump through as many bureaucratic hoops.  If the Senator has specific cases to pursue with me, she should feel free to do so.</p><p>In response to Senator Norris, all of the LPT raised goes to the councils.  At least 80% of the amount raised in a local authority area goes to that council area and the rest is distributed to other local authority areas.  In other words, the wealthier councils support the less wealthy.  This decision was taken when the Act was introduced.  Senator Quinn made a point regarding derelict houses.  I am advised that the LPT is a self-assessment tax and it is, therefore, up to the home owner to decide that the house is uninhabitable.  Revenue must have the authority for ensuring compliance or anybody could say his or her house is uninhabitable.  Common sense must prevail.  Revenue has the opportunity to check the veracity of such assessments if it considers there is a need to do so.  It is up to Revenue to make that decision.  Situations vary and must be considered on a case by case basis.</p><p>Senator Reilly asked for my view on the Thornhill report in regard to local property tax.  We will outline that in detail for her in our manifesto and during the election campaign.  However, I can inform her that we will not be making any false promises to abolish property taxes.  We believe property tax is a stable form of income.  I also believe this Bill addresses a number of concerns in regard to pyrite, the assessment date and disability.  However, there is a need for a debate on the future of this tax, what form it should take and how it will deal with rising property prices post-2019.</p><p>Senator Barrett made a point he feels strongly about in regard to inversions and international taxation.  The OECD BEPS process provides an opportunity for us.  Country by country reporting will enable the Revenue Commissioners to have information available to them, not just on what a multinational company pays in this country but also in every other country in the process.  That will give our tax authority a level of insight and overview that neither it nor other authorities have had up to this point.</p><p>I have tried to cover most of the points raised.  There are some points on which we disagree and we may get to them on the next Stage of the Bill.</p></speech>

The Minister of State knows we do not agree with the property tax, do not believe it is working and that is why we are calling for a review of it.  We believe it should be removed completely.  The raft of amendments we submitted were to be read together.  However, they were not included as we wished.  The reason behind the amendments was the hope the tax would be repealed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-12-08a.185" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1106" speakername="Simon Harris" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015120800002#FF01400"><p>I thank the Senator for putting forward these amendments.  I am advised that the local property tax is forecast to collect &euro;440 million in 2015.  These receipts would be lost if local property tax was abolished and would need to be found elsewhere.  This would represent a substantial loss to the Exchequer, particularly as under the terms of the Stability and Growth Pact, Ireland may not introduce discretionary revenue reductions unless they are matched by other revenue increases or expenditure.  I look forward to hearing Sinn F&eacute;in outline what those expenditure reductions or revenue increases would be.  This means that the Government must carefully consider any tax changes, as any reductions will have to be offset elsewhere.</p> <p>I am further advised that there would also be significant administrative issues and costs associated with such a measure for Revenue.  Senators will be aware that the introduction of a value based property tax was part of our obligation under a bailout programme at the time.  Regardless of that, it is a stable source of income.  It should be noted that the arguments in favour of a property tax go well beyond any obligations under an EU-IMF programme.  It is part of a broader approach to taxation.  The aim is to replace some of the revenue from transaction based taxes, including stamp duty on property, which had proven to be an unstable source of revenue, with an annual recurring property tax which international experience has shown to be a stable source of funding.  The taxation of property through recurring annual tax is less economically distortional than the imposition of tax on either income or capital.  This is supported by economic literature and OECD analysis.  The recent OECD economics department working paper No. 1270 shows that property taxes are less harmful than other types of taxation, particularly for Ireland.  Therefore, the Government does not intend to repeat the mistakes of the past and I am not in a position to accept the amendments.</p></speech>

This makes sense to me and this proposal would go some way towards dealing with the ability to pay issue, a provision which is not covered in this Bill.  The amendment is clear.  People proven to be in arrears should be exempt from property tax for the period they are in arrears until the arrears resolution process is completed.</p></speech>

The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act of 2012, as amended, provides for reliefs from LPT in such circumstances, whereby a person may opt to defer or partially defer payment of the tax.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Harris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2338"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Where a person qualifies for a full deferral, 100% of the liability can be deferred.  Where a person qualifies for partial deferral, 50% of the liability can be deferred and the balance of 50% of the tax must be paid.  Relief may apply under one of three separate categories: income threshold for individuals whose income is under a certain limit; personal insolvency where a debt settlement or personal insolvency arrangement has been formally agreed with the Insolvency Service of Ireland; and hardship grounds.  Where a person does not qualify for a deferral under the other categories and has had both an unexpected and unavoidable significant financial loss or expense, as a result of which they cannot pay the local property tax, LPT, without causing excessive financial hardship, that person can apply for a full or partial deferral.  Where the deferral criteria are met, liable persons can opt to defer the full LPT until financial circumstances improve or the property is sold, whichever is first.</p><p>Conditions for deferral of the charge specify that the residential property must be the sole or main residence of the person.  Where their estimated gross income from all sources does not exceed &euro;15,000 for a single person or &euro;25,000 for a couple during the year covered by the return, they will be eligible to apply for a full deferral of the LPT charge.  In addition, for income-stressed owner occupiers who have an outstanding mortgage, an adjusted gross income limit will apply.  In these cases, the income thresholds of &euro;15,000 or &euro;25,000 may be increased by 80% of the annual mortgage interest payments.  </p><p>It is important to make clear that this is not an exemption from the LPT.  Interest of 4% per annum, half of the normal Revenue interest rate, is charged on the deferred amount and it does remain a charge on the property until discharged.  Any amount deferred will, however, be a relatively small part of the overall value of a property, even where the deferral lasts for a number of years.  Owner occupiers may be eligible to apply for a partial deferral where the gross income from all sources is less than &euro;25,000 in the case of a single person and &euro;35,000 in the case of a couple.  </p><p>I do not want to use up the Senators' time.  I am satisfied that the provisions which are in place, which give the Revenue Commissioners scope to permit deferrals in cases of hardship, are sufficient to target the cases in need.  For that reason, and given that to extend provision for deferral or exemption from the tax in the manner suggested by the Senator's amendment would decrease the yield and would, in return, require others to pay a higher rate of tax to make up for that loss, I am not persuaded to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 1 would put in place an appeals mechanism for pension scheme members where trustees have decided upon reduced benefits for members, and such appeals mechanism could ensure that any category of such pension scheme members have not been unfairly treated in any restructuring arrangement.  At present, as Members are aware, deferred and retired members in particular generally do not have a seat at the table and a particular instance of this was with the airport pension scheme, that is, the Irish aviation superannuation, IAS, scheme.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Darragh O'Brien:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2178"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> It makes absolute sense to put in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill a provision for an appeals mechanism in respect of any scheme member who feels that he or she has been disproportionately affected by any restructuring in the pension scheme.  I gave the example of the deferred pensioners in the IAS scheme, many of whom suffered cuts of up to 60% in their provision.  I am sure the Minister of State will have received correspondence on the matter with factual information from those concerned.  They have not had any mechanism to appeal the move.  There has been nothing bar writing to trustees and stating their cases.  It is a particular problem for retired members who are generally not represented by their trade union.  Again, in the situation of the airport pension scheme, one of the unions was particularly disgraceful because it returned union subscriptions to its retired members.  These are people who had been members of the union for all of their working lives.  The union took such action simply on the basis that it was trying to get the best deal for its active members who were continuing in the scheme.  Therefore, an independent proper appeals mechanism would be a way forward and that is why I have tabled my amendment.  Its aim is to ensure that other schemes cannot have a situation where their scheme needs to be restructured.  I argued the toss on the IAS scheme in that I did not believe it needed to be restructured as it is, but that debate is for another day.  My amendment would give some recourse to scheme members.  I am interested in hearing the views of the Minister of State.</p></speech>

Once notified, the scheme members or those representing the scheme members are entitled to make written submissions to the Pensions Authority which will consider any submission prior to making a direction.  Groups representing the interests of pensioners and deferred scheme members have a right to appeal a direction by the Pensions Authority to the High Court on a point of law, which rarely takes place.  I remind the Senator we have had that discussion previously.  Earlier this year, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection approved measures to facilitate engagement between the trustees of a pension scheme and groups representing the interests of pensioner and deferred scheme members.</p> <p>Recently measures have been created and guidance has been provided for trustees.  There is a need for further engagement with trustees and maybe assistance and guidance.  I accept that we must and should keep this matter under review.  If current mechanisms prove that they are inefficient or incapable of dealing with the matter then we may look at introducing an appeals mechanism, as proposed by the Senator.  At this stage I do not accept the amendment but I shall ask my officials to constantly keep this matter under review.  If it is felt necessary, at a later stage, or it becomes apparent that there is a need to have such an appeals mechanism, then we will come back to the Senator.  I reassure him that we will keep this matter under constant review.  I thank him for highlighting the matter and making the argument for same. </p></speech>

I appreciate his response and its bona fides.  However, the reality of the situation is that we have living proof of what has happened to specific groups of pension scheme members.  They have been disproportionately cut yet had no recourse.  In many instances, particularly with larger companies, while the trustees belong to a separate body from the company and the scheme is held under trust as a separate entity to the company, the reality is that all of the weight and power is vested with the employers and also with the current employee representatives.  The provision has not worked and will not work currently as it stands, which is proven by the IAS scheme.  Opposition to an appeals mechanism is probably due to the fact that the Seanad and the Government do not want an amended Social Welfare and Pensions Bill to go back to the D&aacute;il because of the legislation programme of the D&aacute;il.</p> <p>I have debated this matter at length with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection although we have not had any engagement since the wind-up of the IAS scheme, which I do not take personally.  I do not think it is coincidental either that she does not propose to attend the House this week to take any Stage of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill.  I appreciate the Minister of State's direct engagement with the Chamber and know that he has listened to us but I will press my amendment.  The only way to have a proper appeals mechanism is to have it written into law.  Unfortunately, in many instances when a member writes to a scheme's trustee it is not worth the paper it is written on.  If the trustee of the scheme and the employer have decided effectively and have put a proposal forward as to what will happen by way of restructuring then it will happen and it is used as proof.  The Minister of State's officials know all of this as well, the Department knows it as does the pensions section of the Department.  Unfortunately, this is not the only time it will happen and in saying that I do not mean to be the prophet of doom.  I intend to press my amendment. </p></speech>

We discussed on Committee stage the general thrust on any scheme not being allowed to be rewound should it have not reached 90% funding.  This would mitigate against what happened in relation to the IAS scheme, whereby the scheme was run down over two years, during which time the scheme deficit doubled from &euro;350 million to over &euro;700 million, resulting in the employer and the owners, which included a 25% shareholding on the part of the State, being allowed to write off a liability of &euro;760 million.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Darragh O'Brien:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2178"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->From there, the State was able to sell its stake for &euro;342 million on the back of the pension scheme members - active, deferred and retired - who have all suffered severe cuts under this scheme.  It is now the case in most western European countries, including the UK, that a scheme cannot be wound down unless it has reached a 90% funding standard.  That is a very important benchmark to set down.  As a result of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2013 and the State Airports (Shannon Group) Act 2014, every major employer in this country with a sizeable pension scheme, particularly those with defined benefit schemes, is now shown how to get out of its liabilities.  Such employers can run the scheme down, apply to the Pensions Authority and say that it scheme is underfunded, pull the rug out from under the members who have paid in - many on a compulsory basis since they became employees - and reduce their benefits.  Who profits from this?  The answer is the shareholder and the owner.  This is going to happen with other commercial semi-State companies and it will also happen with private companies.  Those who advised the Government and the trustees on the IAS scheme are advising other companies across the State.  This is the first time any Government has legislated - in this instance, under the State Airports (Shannon Group) Act 2014 - to change a private pension scheme.  That never happened before.</p><p>What was done - namely, the enactment of the State Airports (Shannon Group) Act 2014 and the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2013, which brought in single insolvency - has had massive ramifications for 15,000 families across the country and it will have a similar impact on tens of thousands of others.  I will not detain the House but I remind Senators that single insolvency is where a profitable company with hundreds of millions of euro in the bank can wind down its pension scheme and, effectively, extract its own liabilities from that scheme overnight.  That is what is happening.  A double insolvency involves an unprofitable company with an unprofitable pension scheme, as was the case with Waterford Crystal.  In many instances, when a company is not profitable and when it and its pension scheme are making a loss, benefits are reduced and everything cannot be paid out in one go.  People understand that situation.  However, profitable companies are being allowed to shirk their responsibilities and a roadmap has been set down in legislation for every major employer or small employer to do the same.  This is the first scheme in respect of which what I have outlined has happened.  It is important to include in the Bill a stipulation to the effect that "The IAS Scheme shall not be allowed to close its pension scheme except where the scheme has reached a minimum 90 per cent funding standard." because this will set down a marker for others.  I intend to press Amendment No. 2.  Will the Minister of State indicate what is wrong with setting a 90% funding standard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-12-08a.223" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1200" speakername="Averil Power" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015120800002#LL00200"><p>I support this amendment.  The Minister of State is aware that this issue has been debated on several occasions in the House in recent years.  This is his final opportunity to do the right thing by members of the IAS pension scheme.  It is absolutely horrific that people who worked for years with Aer Lingus, the Dublin Airport Authority and other aspects of the airlines at Dublin Airport have endured savage cuts to their pensions.  Deferred members were enticed to leave jobs with the authority and the airline on the basis of early retirement schemes and on foot of a promise that they would receive a good defined benefit pension later on and enjoy a level of certainty regarding their entitlements.  Just before they reached pension age, many of them discovered they had only a fraction of the pension they had been led to believe they were entitled to.  That is a shocking and dreadful situation in which to leave people and it is incredibly unfair.  As Senator Darragh O'Brien stated, it is also out of touch with international standards in this area.  The OECD recommended that all of its member states should ensure that pension funds cannot be shut down unless they are 90% funded.  That is the standard in other countries.</p> <p>As I have done on previous occasions, I would make the distinction between single and double insolvency arrangements.  If both the scheme and the company are insolvent and the company does not have the money to put into the scheme, then that is fair enough.  It is unfortunate for any employee to find himself or herself in a situation where the company for which he or she works has gone bust.  However, Aer Lingus is a profitable company and it has been able to walk away from honouring the entitlements which were promised over many years to its staff under the IAS scheme.  That is outrageous.  These are people who were forced to be part of the scheme, who made contributions from their wages for many years and who then had their pension entitlements removed at the last minute.</p> <p>I have pleaded before with the Minister of State on this issue to please do the right thing.  Of all the cuts that have been introduced in the past few years, those made to these people's pensions are absolutely shocking.  There is no justification for those cuts.  While it has been airline staff who have been hit so far, a great many pensioners will find themselves in trouble in years to come if companies see this as a precedent which allows them to walk away from their obligations.  I am sure that is not the legacy the Minister of State would wish to leave behind after his time in government.  As matters stand, that is how it will be.  I again plead with him to do the right thing at this final stage and to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

The Minister of State would, if he had the freedom, accept these amendments but I believe he is under orders from higher up not do anything about it.  That is shameful and I am sorry the Labour Minister of State has to take this on the chin because we are talking about the equitable treatment of people.  I have spoken many times on this issue and do not want to be guilty of too much repetition.  However, it is difficult to see how anybody could object to the equitable treatment of pensioners.  How can a Government stand against that?  The Government has intervened disastrously in this matter.  It has stuck its nose into the affairs of a limited company and intervened against the interests of the employees.  Aer Lingus is a profitable company.  How can a profitable company absolve itself of its responsibility towards long-term employees who generated its profits?  This is terribly shocking.  It brings back the worst of previous catastrophes such as the Irish Shipping situation.  We never thought we would see that again.  I thought the Irish Shipping people were treated disgracefully and I marched alongside them.  It is a real blot on the record of this Government that it should sustain the ill-treatment of pensioners in Aer Lingus.  I support both of these amendments and will be voting in favour of them.  If the Minister of State was sitting on this side of the House, I know he would be one of the first through the lobbies to vote for their acceptance.  I sympathise with the Minister of State but I call shame on the Government.</p></speech>

I will not go into detail because, quite rightly, the three Senators and Senator Mooney have debated this matter at length in the House with the T&aacute;naiste.  There are unintentional consequences regarding this amendment in that it would: have an impact on company debt, investment and growth; affect an employer's ability to raise funds; give a competitive advantage to employers which have never provided a pension scheme and those which have risk-free defined contribution schemes; and prompt well-funded schemes to be wound up in order to avoid further debt.  I could read out a whole page of unintentional consequences relating to increasing the funding standard which would mainly benefit companies that have never provided pension schemes.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Kevin Humphreys:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2289"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We could undermine the financial viability of companies that have provided a pension scheme.  The option of raising it must be thought out very carefully.</p><p>Senators Darragh O'Brien and Power argued their point very well with the senior Minister during the earlier debates on the Bill and I do not propose to revisit the relevant issues.  I will not be accepting the amendments.  I am very aware of the problems that arose with regard to the Aer Lingus superannuation scheme, often referred to as the IAS scheme.  As was made clear during the debate on the State Airports (Shannon Group) Bill 2014, no Minister could impose or prescribe solutions for the difficulties in the IAS scheme.  These problems were always a matter for resolution by the trustees, employers, members and the Pensions Authority.  In November 2014 the trustees of the IAS scheme applied to the Pensions Authority for a section 50 direction and submitted a funding proposal to address the deficit in the scheme.  The trustees' proposal was later approved by the Pensions Authority and implemented on 31 December 2014.  This involved the freezing of the scheme and a reduction in benefits for members.  The employers' contribution was very substantial, amounting to &euro;262 million.  Given that a solution has now been adopted for this long-running problem, it would not be appropriate to accept these amendments.</p></speech>

The Minister of State's note also made reference to risk-free defined contribution schemes but there is no such thing.  Defined contribution schemes are also at risk.  The idea that defined benefit is bad and defined contribution is good is nonsense and officials in the Department need to get real about that.  Defined benefit schemes are no longer in favour because they cost employers too much.  It is as simple as that.  According to the LCP pensions accounting briefing, as at 31 December 2014 there was only one defined benefit scheme that was close to 90% funded.  In the vast majority of schemes, the funding levels have reduced at a time when investment returns have increased substantially.  Why has that happened?  It is because all pension funds are going to do this now.</p> <p>The Minister of State said that in the case of the IAS scheme, the employer made a significant contribution to resolve the scheme's problems.  However, he did not mention the fact that the employer and the active members were told not to direct any more funds into the scheme.  A new scheme was set up but the liabilities of the original scheme were left with the retired and deferred members and the scheme was starved of funds.  We are supposed to jump up and down on hearing that the employer made a significant contribution to the scheme but that is ridiculous.  The whole process was designed to fatten up the company and remove the pension liability in advance of the sale of the State's share in Aer Lingus.  That is why the Government got involved.  It could not float Aer Lingus when it was still saddled with the bulk of the &euro;760 million deficit in the IAS scheme.  This process involving the Pensions Authority, the Department, the employer and the Government bordered on collusion.  Indeed, I would include the Office of the President in this regard because the President signed this into law in a matter of three days.  It was all done to allow the flotation statement to be released and to facilitate the sale of the State's share.</p></speech>

While I thank the Minister of State for responding, I again ask him what is wrong with setting a 90% funding standard which is, as Senator Power pointed out, the OECD standard.  Most other western European countries abide by that standard.  What is wrong with it?  There is nothing wrong with it and we should apply it here.  I will be pressing the amendment.</p></speech>

Some seem to want to have a bigger hole in their pension funds than others.  When Senator Darragh O'Brien raised this issue first, he said, to his credit, that this was part of the sale of Aer Lingus and that the company was being fattened up.  I regret that I did not take those comments more seriously at the time because the major beneficiary is now British Airways, which has acquired Aer Lingus for a song.  We no longer have a national airline and British Airways now has a monopoly from Heathrow to every airport on the island of Ireland.  The Minister of State made reference to unintended consequences but the slide on the pension fund started a process which has resulted in British Airways being left with a broad smile on its face, having acquired Aer Lingus for a very small price.  We must pay attention to how trustees can become, as some aggrieved pensioners would argue, agents of management and do not act in the long-term interests of the members of pension schemes.  Whatever the cause, the consequences are not good for this outer, offshore island.  Senator Darragh O'Brien was a good prophet in terms of what lay ahead in this situation.</p></speech>

The small-scale measures contained in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill are not sufficient to offset the regressive budgets introduced by the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government since it took office in 2011.  The Government has been responsible for 40 deep and wide-ranging cuts, the effects of which still will be felt by households throughout the country in 2016.</p></speech>

The regulation of charitable organisations is an important issue and I recognise the work they do here and abroad.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-12-08a.265" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1172" speakername="Aideen Hayden" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015120800002#RR00300"><p>I thank our colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il for raising this matter.  As someone who comes from the voluntary sector, I believe it is a very important issue.  Charitable organisations have a number of aspects.  We must acknowledge the role charitable organisations - a term I do not particularly like because it is probably more correct to call them voluntary organisations - play in the public domain.  There is a significant number of charitable organisations which play a very significant role in the delivery of what would be regarded as fundamental social services, be they in health, education, disability or housing.  We should sometimes ask ourselves whether some of the services being delivered by the voluntary sector should be delivered by mainstream bodies.  It is certainly something which came to a head at the Committee of Public Accounts in the context of the Rehab Group when it became clear that block grants were being given to certain organisations with insufficient scrutiny as to how this money was being disbursed.  This gives a significant amount of power to the organisations concerned because, in effect, they can spend Government moneys which, if being spent by a Government Department, would be subject to far more scrutiny and be far more highly regulated.</p> <p>I agree we need to regulate our voluntary sector.  In that respect, I welcome the code of governance for the voluntary sector that has become the norm for most fully functioning NGOs.  Most organisations which work in the public domain, of which I am aware, adhere to the code of conduct for the voluntary sector.  Government also has a responsibility in respect of funding.  Many voluntary organisations front-load their activities and find themselves waiting seven, eight, nine or ten months into the year before they are even advised as to what their funding will be for the year in which they have already expended resources.  It is very important to note that voluntary organisations, like other organisations, have staff who have families and who are paying mortgages.  The idea of moving to multi-annual funding for voluntary organisations is critical and this Government has gone some way in that respect, which is very welcome.  </p> <p>There are three issues I wish to highlight.  What do we expect our voluntary sector to do?  Do we expect it to deliver mainstream services or do we expect it to fill gaps which are not filled by Government or the State sector?  We must also ask ourselves whether it is fair not to fund voluntary organisations appropriately and to have most of our voluntary organisations highly dependent on charitable resources and forced to raise most of their money privately.  Few charities in this country do not get Government funding in some size, shape or form.  Therefore, there is an enormous onus on them to be absolutely clear and transparent as to how those resources are spent.  As such, it has taken a very long time for Governments to require the type of governance in the voluntary sector that should be best practice.  We need to move our voluntary sector into the 21st century in a number of ways, with governance being chief among them.</p></speech>

I was taken by surprise when I suggested it be included on the Order of Business and the Leader very graciously allocated us the time for it this evening.  The point I was making on the Order of Business was that Christmas, as we all know, is a time of celebration and goodwill for most people but that there are many people who will not benefit from that mood of celebration.  I am thinking of families, some of whom do not even have a home they can call their own.  Other families are facing eviction because of their mortgage repayments.  There are thousands of families who are making ends meet against all the odds with a pittance of an income each week.  We see heroic parents who are almost shielding their children from the ravages of poverty and all the disadvantages that go with it.  If one puts oneself in the position of vulnerable people at any time of the year but particularly at this time of the year when radio, newspapers and television feature glitter and excitement, one can see that money is required to be able to engage with that.  If one puts oneself in the position of people who are barely making ends meet at the moment, where does one turn if one needs assistance?  I am talking about assistance just to survive - food and heat.  One must turn to the charities.</p> <p>I am very impressed by some charities, particularly the Simon Community.  The more I listen to it, the more I engage with it and the more of its work I see, the more I see that it is exceptional.  I feel the same about the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  I cannot remember the name of the brother in the charity which provides hot meals for people every day but every time I see him on television, he comes across as an example of what a good Christian should be.  The numbers availing of those meals are increasing.  One is talking about thousands.  When the television cameras go in, we see all the volunteers.  There is no sense of charity about it.  It is a sense of responding to a community need.  We see the volunteers preparing and serving the meals and there is a dignity for the people who come in.  We will never have to do that.  We are pretty well-off.  It is charities like these which are doing the outstanding work.</p> <p>I look at the young volunteers of the Simon Community who go out on the streets at night trying to find people who have gone off the radar of society.  Nobody really knows about them and nobody engages with them.  They are just there.  If one walks the streets and comes across those people, one wonders how human nature allowed such a thing to develop.  These people are human beings and are entitled to dignity in the very same way as the rest of us.  We do not know their stories but whenever we hear an individual's story, it is usually about a person who came from a very good home and a very good family but something just went wrong.  Something happened that put him or her in that position.  When one thinks about it, it could be any of us.  When one sees them there, one only thinks of them as a statistic.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1968"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1968&amp;amp;pid=LabhrasOMurchu&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> The only real, human contact these people have is with volunteers from the Simon Community who go out, talk, engage and bring a hot drink and food to them.  These young volunteers do that all the time and one can only believe that those people on the street have a slight glimmer of hope left.  It beggars belief that anybody can sleep in a doorway on the street at the height of winter.  When I requested the opportunity to discuss this matter, it was to acknowledge the work of the charities and to also show support.  I presume Senators talk to these people and get messages from them.  They will tell Senators of their experience.  Where would one get a better survey of an impoverished situation than from those who are dealing with it at the coalface?  The volunteers will also talk about their concerns, which are exceptionally serious.  They are able to point us, as legislators, in the right direction to do the right thing at the right time and to do it with a degree of generosity.  </p><p>The other important thing is resources, which may have been touched on just before I came in.  My understanding is that most of these charities depend on voluntary contributions - a few euro here and there.  If the money does not come, the services they provide cannot be provided and the recipients of those services are once again ignored and left to one side.  As a legislator, I say to all legislators, particularly those at decision-making level, we should engage with those who provide hot meals, visit the homeless on the streets, and work with people who are living in homes.  It is our duty as legislators.  Much can be done through legislation and finance but one has to engage with the people who give the best value for money.  The volunteers I know of are young, personable, educated and doing well in life.  They have a spirit which says they have done well so they will give some of their time to the vulnerable who have problems, for whatever reason.  They give more than just time and compassion - a sense of camaraderie is created.  Surely, if a volunteer gives their services for free, they are the people who should get resources from the State.  I would hate to think that hot dinners were no longer available.  That is just an example.  Who else will provide that?  </p><p>I am not saying we will set the world on fire here this evening but I feel for once that this House is ideally suited to discuss this issue.  I thank the Leader for making it possible.  I would like to think the Simon Community and all such bodies will become aware that we stopped for a moment in the midst of all the work on legislation and all the frenzy and reflected on how lucky we are to have such organisations.  It is really part of our heritage and tradition because of our own history to look after people who are not well looked after.  Every time I watch television on Christmas Day and see people coming in for a lunch organised by a charity, I see the smiles on the faces of those people and the sense that they are a valuable part of society.  I think they should be considered when we are planning budgets and looking at how to distribute the finances of the State.</p><p>I am not making this into a partisan issue because it is not that type of issue.  I am talking about the future.  We should stop for a moment and acknowledge that we are lucky there are hundreds of people providing this service on a voluntary basis, a service that nobody else is giving.  We are giving dignity back to people.  We never know when there will be a good outcome.  We all know of good stories.  Christmas is a giving time; it is a time when somebody came along and helped someone who seemed to be absolutely gone in society.  I have read many stories and received many personal letters from people who, because of one act of kindness, got the courage to take the next step and the one after that.  Many of these people eventually become part of the charity that helped them by volunteering with it.  One never knows where a good deed will lead.  It is not right that, when all that good will, voluntary service and commitment exist, they may not have sufficient resources to keep it going or bring it to fruition.  </p><p>I selected this time of the year because it is an emotional time.  It is a time that we all look forward to, for example because people are visiting or returning from other lands.  There is that kind of spirit.  I hope it continues beyond Christmas and that we might some day seriously consider, when talking about funding, asking the representatives of those charities to come in and meet us here or at an Oireachtas committee.  It would be better if they came in here.  I would love to hear from the brother I mentioned earlier because he seems like a lovely character.  He got the freedom of Dublin City recently and I would love to have him come in and tell us of his experiences.  One will find he has no bitterness or recriminations.  It would be great to engage with him.  I would also love to hear from some of the young people who go out on the street and meet those living rough.  They are the people at the coalface and it would be wonderful to create the opportunity here to listen to them.  It would be good for Senators, the Seanad and the democratic system because the people coming in would appreciate the fact that we gave them the time and opportunity.  </p><p>In conclusion, I feel this can only be for the good.  It is a first step in the right direction.  There is not a single Senator here who does not contribute to the concept of engagement with charities, which do such good work.  We should not engage with them in a patronising manner but help and support them and enter into a partnership with them in their work in tackling extreme poverty.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-12-08a.268" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1118" speakername="Michael Mullins" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015120800002#SS00200"><p>I thank the Senator for raising the issue this morning on the Order of Business and I acknowledge and thank the Leader for acceding to the request to have a discussion this evening on the role charitable organisations play in this country.  It is appropriate at this time of year to acknowledge the huge amount of voluntary work being done by so many people throughout the country who are helping to make a better life for the less fortunate in their communities.  It is a time of year when we focus on those who are underprivileged and in need.</p> <p>The volunteers and organisations that run these charities are working around the clock, 365 days of the year so it is appropriate to acknowledge the work being done and encourage everybody in the country who can afford a little to give a little more, particularly at this time of year.  During the year, when we get all those requests through the post that we sometimes ignore, we should look at the work being done by these organisations and see our way to contributing to their incredible work.  In many cases where there is deprivation and poverty, it is not always because there is not sufficient income going into the house from the State but because it is poorly managed.  There are also other issues and it is then that organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul step in to make a difference to the lives of these people.  I am aware of many situations where people have been given a helping hand that has meant much and turned their life around.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael Mullins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2368"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2368&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMullins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They, in turn, have made huge contributions to the organisation that helped them and, indeed, to other organisations in the community.  I wonder sometimes whether the State becomes too reliant on charitable organisations to run services.  That is probably a debate for another day but, in many cases, people's lives would be much the poorer if not for the tremendous work done by these organisations.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; mentioned the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Simon Community.  In my home town, the Simon Community now has a presence and I have visited its volunteers on a number of occasions to witness the difference they are making to people's lives.  Other organisations such as COPE are based in Galway as well and they help people with serious housing issues.</p><p>The recession of the past number of years has caused added hardship for many people.  People who would never have been dependent on charitable organisations have had occasion to look for help and that has not been easy for them, but the discreet way their requests have been handled by the organisations has been important for people to maintain their dignity.  Hopefully, when they get over the crisis, they will turn their lives around again and will experience better times.</p><p>I recognise all the good work done by these organisations while also thinking of the tremendous work done by Irish volunteers abroad and the contributions they made to organisations such as Tr&oacute;caire, Concern and GOAL, which are helping the most deprived people in the world to get the basics in life.  Through Irish Aid, the people through their taxes, which are managed by government, are helping them.  The significant voluntary contributions we make to those organisations are a major factor in improving the lives of the poorest people in the world.  As a people, we are generous.</p><p>However, a number of scandals unfolded in recent years relating to charities and some people used the difficulties that arose as reason not to give as much as they once did.  The improvements made and the tightening up of legislation to regulate the charitable sector are critical to restoring people's confidence.  There has to be total openness and transparency in how charitable organisations are run.  This works well at local level through organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, which manages its finances tightly and exhibits good accountability.</p><p>It is probably a matter for another debate but I wonder sometimes whether too many organisations are fulfilling the same role.  Perhaps we should have a debate on the streamlining or merger of some of them.  In addition, significant resources are expended on chief executive officers and high powered staff and I wonder whether rationalisation would give a better outcome.  Generally, the charitable sector does an amazing job.  The volunteers, including those who have been mentioned such Fr. Kevin in the Peter McVerry Trust and all the Fr. Kevins in other parts of the country, will make a big difference to the lives of many people this Christmas.  I encourage everyone to think about this and I encourage those of us who can afford a little more to give a little more this Christmas and make a difference to the lives of those who depend on additional support over and above what the State can afford to give.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-12-08a.270" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1196" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015120800002#TT00200"><p>I thank Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; for asking for this debate and I acknowledge the Leader for facilitating it.  All the organisations that have been mentioned such as the Simon Community and the Peter McVerry Trust should be commended for the work they do.  I cannot understand how people can motivate themselves on a wet winter's night to go out knocking on doors on behalf of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and to hand over cheques without asking questions and while accepting the humanity of those who are in these homes and the poverty in which they may be living.  I am particularly struck by centres that take in mothers and children who have been subject to domestic violence.  Unfortunately, there are not enough of those facilities.</p> <p>I would like to focus on the micro-charitable work that is being done.  Senators Mullins and &Oacute; Murch&uacute; have both referred to the volunteers from organisations who go out at night on to our streets.  I have had experience of dealing with alcoholics and it is pretty harrowing to see people so dehumanised that all they crave is the next drink and to try to find humanity in oneself to understand that.  That is difficult to do with somebody one loves.  I cannot understand how young kids volunteering on behalf of these organisations go out every night with soup, sleeping bags and blankets.  When I walk down Grafton Street or another street in Dublin and I see somebody curled up in a doorway, I think for a moment, "My God, is that not awful?" and then I turn my head the other way because I am so petrified that one day I could end up there because there is a thin line between what keeps us comfortable in our lives and what drives us over the edge.</p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; eloquently described how when families break down, hopelessness creeps in where once there was happiness and hope.  It is difficult to look at a guy lying on a street corner somewhere in a wet sleeping bag, probably after defecating himself, without any hope and with nothing to think of but drink or drugs the following morning.  These lovely young volunteers then come along and give them tea and bread.</p> <p>I compliment the Government parties in so far as they have tried to provide accommodation but, sadly, we need to find a way of giving these people rooms which they can lock overnight and which make them feel secure.  Peter McVerry says every time he speaks to me that many of the young homeless people feel safer on the street than in a hostel.  I do not know how to tackle that.</p> <p>I join colleagues in commending the work being done by these charitable groups.  Perhaps Senator Mullins is correct that there are one or two too many and that money going on the salaries of the chief executive officers would be better spent on the ground.  That is a debate for another day but, as we approach Christmas, we should remember a few things.  The first is the excitement in children's eyes as they walk through shopping centres looking at toys and so on.  Can people imagine what it must be like to be the mother or father of children who cannot do this or who if they can, have nothing to look forward to?  I agree with Senators Mullins and &Oacute; Murch&uacute; that we should, if we can, send a few bob that way over the Christmas.  It is not just for Christmas; it will go on forever more.</p></speech>

It is important that we give recognition to people who work in voluntary organisations.  The great change that has occurred in recessionary times was the swing back to voluntary organisations.  It is important as the economy picks up that we do not lose that and that we encourage people as much as possible to make a contribution, either financially or by giving their time.  It is easy to give a financial contribution; it is more difficult to give up time, but it is important that we give time because it brings us all back down to ground level to see how the other half of society lives.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colm Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2353"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->An organisation which I assist a little in sourcing funds provides, through 65 volunteers, education services every day for over 45 young people who have dropped out of school.  Some of the volunteers are retired teachers who want to give something back.  Others are students who are studying for the higher diploma in social science and so on.  They give freely of their time to assist the organisation in providing one-to-one education for these 45 young people who otherwise would be out on the streets.  Some of them are as young as ten years old and have no real support at home.  As I said, my involvement in the group is in the context of sourcing funding.  It was set up by the Christian Brothers and, like a number of similar organisations, is now part of the system.  </p><p>The current health budget is &euro;13.2 billion, of which over &euro;3.25 billion is paid to 2,600 organisations across a wide spectrum of services.  All of these organisations, including hospitals such as the Mercy and South Infirmary hospitals in Cork, were set up many years ago on a voluntary basis and are now very much dependent on State funding.  It is important that all voluntary organisations are given recognition.  As I said, there are 2,600 organisations in operation, each of which was established many years ago on a voluntary basis and has since become part of the system.  It is important that they are supported.  </p><p>It is important in the context of our discussion of this issue that, as stated by Senator Michael Mullins, we ensure where there is duplication organisations are encouraged to work together.  It is only by working together that we can bring about improvements in service provision.  While organisations such as Simon and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul have made a huge contribution during the years, particularly in the past six to seven years, it is important that the work being done on a voluntary basis by people involved in sports such as the GAA, soccer, rugby, camogie and basketball be not forgotten.  During my time as Lord Mayor I visited one such club one Saturday when there were more than 40 volunteers caring for and training young people in their chosen sport.  Another centre that I visited during my time as Lord Mayor which, again, was being supported by volunteers was providing meals for up to 75 people who had no family or other support.  It is important that in the run-up to Christmas, particularly on Christmas day, that we all play our part and do not simply adopt the view that it is somebody else's problem.  It is important we ensure everyone makes it through Christmas and that we remain mindful of the need for voluntary care after Christmas also.</p><p>There has been much talk about our economic recovery.  It is important that we do not make the same mistakes made during the boom times and that we realise there are people who find it difficult to address the problems they are experiencing and need support in dealing with them.  We should provide that support, where possible.  We all have a part to play in that regard, even if only for two or three hours a week.  We must all contribute at some stage every week.  </p><p>I thank Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; for raising this matter.  It is important that we have this discussion and that we look to the future in terms of how we will encourage more people to become involved in the voluntary sector, be it through sport, social activities or assisting people who are living on the streets.  We need to plan for how we are going to encourage people, particularly young people, to become involved.</p></speech>

Seanad &Eacute;ireann should be about promoting the meitheal, as in the case of the organisation Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; leads which has spread its wings throughout the world.  Those involved in the charity and voluntary sector have done likewise.  Our missionaries have travelled all over the world, including to the poorest areas.  A nun from County Clare initiated the Aborigine revolution in Australia many years ago.  The meitheal tradition of Irish people is profound.</p> <p>The charity sector experienced a difficult period for a couple of years following the worthwhile and important investigation carried out by the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is now stronger as a result of that experience.  There must be accountability in it and all elements of society, including politics.  Last Friday I had the great privilege of officially opening a research centre in the University of Limerick, the SOLA project, which offers modules and training courses to develop excellence in the community, voluntary and charity sectors.  Many charities are doing phenomenal work, but they do not necessarily have the required administrative structures, training or expertise to be used to full advantage in the areas in which they are engaged.  What the SOLA project has already achieved in this regard is phenomenal.  One person has completed a PhD on the Garda vetting process.  The recommendations made in their thesis could be used to advise on how the Garda vetting process could be improved to ensure it will achieve what it has set out to achieve from all perspectives, including from that of safety in the community and voluntary sectors.</p> <p>The Charities Act was necessary legislation and I would like to see all elements fully implemented.  The principal behind a charities regulator is important.  Every &euro;1 collected, whether at a cake sale or in another event, should be properly accounted for because, ultimately, it is money from citizens.  The millions of hours spent every week and month by decent Irish people who have huge community spirit in the charities and voluntary sectors have had the profound effect of moving towards the creation of a more equal society.  We do not yet have an equal society, but it is at least more equal in that people are no longer experiencing hunger.  Those who dedicate themselves 24 hours a day, seven days a week, year-in and year-out, to these sectors are the unsung heroes of the country.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Some do an hour or a day a week, while others operate on a full-time basis.  Thousands of fit and healthy retired people are working on a voluntary basis in our charities every week.  The meals on wheels service which started in Dublin but which has spread right across the country delivers hot meals to older people.  These meals are delivered by decent, caring volunteers who seldom look for recognition.  They are just happy to know they have an impact on the lives of others.</p><p>As part of the Oireachtas and as we celebrate the decade of commemorations and approach the 100th anniversary of the Easter Rising 1916, the Seanad has a role to play.  We must partner and support our charities and provide them with a forum for discourse.  We have the facility to invite them to the Oireachtas and to engage with and listen to them, let them tell their stories, let them reflect on their experiences and allow us consider how our great State can partner with them in all-party, non-political way.  The Seanad should grasp the opportunity to be involved in these voluntary, community, administrative and cultural areas.  Perhaps it will not happen in the lifetime of this Seanad but it could become a theme for the next term to consider how we can equip, support, engage with and facilitate our charity and voluntary sector.</p><p>I commend Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and all of the Members who cared enough about this issue to come in and speak on it this evening.  The topic was not part of our schedule, but there was unanimous agreement that we should have these statements on this extremely important issue.</p></speech>

T&aacute; s&eacute; f&iacute;or-t&aacute;bhachtach go bpl&eacute;imis &eacute;.</p> <p>It is to Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;'s credit that he raised this issue this morning and it is important that we gather and speak on it.  Somebody once said that justice alone is never enough to solve the great problems that face mankind.  It can be all too fashionable these days to talk and to reduce our public discourse to the language of rights.  As important as the issues of equality and people's demands for their rights are, neither justice nor the mere granting of or recognition of rights fulfil our duty to others.  Charity often becomes a bad term because it can be portrayed as something patronising or as something that fails to recognise people's rights.  In fact, we owe a duty of charity to other people.  Charity is but an old word for love.  We all know that unless there is love and fraternity between people, we do not have a real society.</p> <p>It is important that at this time of the year we do not just honour those who are engaged in charitable activities on our behalf but that we step up our individual, personal commitment to involvement with charitable organisations in whatever way possible.  In fairness to my colleagues in Leinster House, I believe that politicians, perhaps more than other classes or groups within society, tend to make themselves available to charitable organisations to support their work in different ways.</p> <p>It is also important to remember that while we have serious problems here at home, people in other countries face far greater difficulties.  I think of persecuted minorities from the Middle East and elsewhere who do not have homes this Christmas because they have been driven from them.  Indeed, Christmas has been abolished in some of the places from which they have come.  One thinks of people who still suffer from chronic malnutrition, those who are deprived of education and so on.  We must maintain our global focus.  We are coming out of a difficult recessionary period but I hope we can recover some of the ground that has been lost in terms of Ireland's contribution to overseas development aid.</p> <p>I will conclude by recalling that on Thursday last the Oireachtas human dignity group presented the human dignity award for this year to Mr. Barney Curley, famous for his exploits at the expense of bookies.  However, he is a man who has dedicated himself almost completely over the past 20 years to raising money for schools and hospitals in countries in Africa, particularly Zambia.  This is due in part to his encounters with Irish missionaries working in those countries.  It was interesting that Mr. Curley was reluctant to receive the award.  He was eventually persuaded to do so when he realised that it would be one small way of drawing attention to the important projects Direct Aid for Africa, DAFA, the charity he founded, has under way.  Indeed, he concluded his words of thanks last Thursday at the celebratory dinner with an exhortation to all present not to forget their neighbour, the person isolated or alone who might be in need of a visit in the coming weeks.  That, he said, is what human dignity is all about.  It was a fitting comment from a fitting and worthy recipient of the human dignity award.</p></speech>
