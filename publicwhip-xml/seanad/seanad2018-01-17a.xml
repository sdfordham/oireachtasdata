I could give so many more but this example particularly captures the crisis we have at the hospital in so many respects.  A 92-year-old man with pneumonia and an underlying heart condition is gravely ill but for 22 hours he did not have a hospital bed.  There are so many examples and not a day goes by that in Donegal we do not speak with families and loved ones about usually elderly parents, aunts or uncles being stuck in this position.  It is an absolute scandal and the Government is well aware of this.</p> <p>Last year there were almost 5,000 people on trolleys at Letterkenny University Hospital, which means almost 5,000 human beings were denied dignity and the service to which they are entitled.  That is twice the number from 2016, so the crisis doubled in scale.  These are the highest numbers since the records of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, began.  There was an appeal from the Letterkenny hospital management to re-open the 19-bed short stay ward and approximately &euro;1.8 million was applied for.  The Department was told about the crisis we are facing and why these beds needed to be re-opened but there has been absolute silence from the Government.</p> <p>The issues at the Letterkenny hospital are much bigger.  Deputy Pearse Doherty and I submitted a report last year on the need to invest in Letterkenny hospital, documenting years of historic funding discrimination.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2321"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2321&amp;amp;pid=PadraigMacLochlainn&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Letterkenny University Hospital is the sixth largest hospital in the State.  The way it has been treated is wrong.  The same applies to the treatment meted out to doctors and nurses who are always praised by the public, and I mean the people who managed to get into the hospital.  The difficulty is that everyone concerned is being failed and has been let down by the Government.  I hope to hear today from the Minister of State that he will sanction funding amounting to &euro;1.8 million so that the 19 beds can re-open thus ending the trolley crisis at the hospital.</p><p>The problem in Donegal at Letterkenny University Hospital has been made worse by the fact that one in four beds in the community hospitals located across the county were closed during the period when the Minister of State's party was in government.  As many as one in four beds in community hospitals have been closed and one in three nurses let go.  Therefore, we have a community hospital primary care infrastructure that has been starved of resources.  That situation has a knock-on effect on the hospital, which is also starved of resources.  The very least the Minister of State can do, as a gesture of goodwill, is give them the resources they need to re-open the short-stay ward that has 19 beds.  I urge him to deal with the current crisis and then he can address the wider issue of funding neglect.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-01-17a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018011700002#C00200"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.</p> <p>First, I wish to acknowledge the distress for patients and their families, and the impact on staff, caused by overcrowded conditions in some of our hospital emergency departments, including the one in Letterkenny.</p> <p>Tackling overcrowding in emergency departments is a key commitment of this Government.  As part of budget 2018, an extra &euro;30 million was made available to respond to winter pressures in 2017, with a further &euro;40 million being provided in 2018.  As part of these measures, nearly 150 additional beds have been opened this winter in Beaumont Hospital, St. James's Hospital, Naas General Hospital, St. Luke's General Hospital in Kilkenny, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, and in Limerick and Galway.  Further beds will open throughout 2018, including at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, which will see new emergency department and ward capacity come onstream in 2018.</p> <p>Part of this funding will also be focused on supporting older people to remain in their own homes by providing additional home care packages and additional transitional care beds per week over the winter period.  These measures have already been rolled out to targeted hospitals nationally thus helping to alleviate some of the pressure our hospitals are currently experiencing.</p> <p>In terms of the specific query raised concerning Letterkenny University Hospital, I am aware that a proposal for additional beds in Letterkenny was submitted as part of the winter plan for 2017-18.  I have been informed by my officials that these additional beds have not been funded under the winter plan for 2017-18.  However, my Department is undertaking a health system capacity review, in line with the Programme for a Partnership Government commitment, the findings of which are due to be published early this year.  The review will provide an evidence base for future capacity decisions.</p> <p>It is important to note that the public hospital system has seen a growing demand for care, and Letterkenny follows this trend.  Emergency department attendances at Letterkenny were up by over 1% at the end of 2017, including an almost 5% increase in emergency department attendances by people over 75 years, when compared with 2016.  Notwithstanding the pressure on the emergency department at the Letterkenny hospital, it is worth noting that patient experience times in Letterkenny are above the national average.  That means patients complete their episode of care more quickly in the emergency department in Letterkenny, which goes back to the point raised by the Senator about the staff, doctors and nurses who work in the hospital. </p> <p>I shall conclude by noting the commitment given by this Government to develop and improve services at Letterkenny University Hospital, as evidenced by the significant level of investment in capital projects in recent years.  These developments include multiple remedial works following flooding in 2013, a new state-of-the-art blood science laboratory in 2015, a new medical academy and a clinical skills laboratory opened last year.</p> <p>In addition, the HSE has advised that several important staffing posts are currently being progressed, including for a second consultant endocrinologist and advanced nurse practitioners.</p></speech>

He acknowledged that an application for funding amounting to &euro;1.8 million was received to re-open the 19 beds.  The provision would take some of the pressures off the nurses and doctors who must work in impossible conditions every single day they work in the emergency ward.  He has acknowledged the application has been received but the scheme will not be funded.  He also mentioned that an evidence-based health system capacity review is under way.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2321"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2321&amp;amp;pid=PadraigMacLochlainn&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->What more evidence does the Department of Health need?  The numbers have doubled since 2016.</p><p>When the Fine Gael Party entered office in 2011, there were hundreds of people on trolleys in hospitals in County Donegal.  Most of those on trolleys at the time were elderly people who had worked and paid taxes all their lives and who expected to be treated with dignity when they got older.  Now, the numbers on trolleys in hospitals in County Donegal runs to thousands.  In 2017, almost 5,000 citizens ended up on trolleys in Letterkenny University Hospital.  How can this evidence not be more clear in terms of the need to invest in more beds in that hospital?  It is an absolute sin that a ward of 19 beds is lying empty when it could be put into service and we could solve this current crisis at the hospital.  The Government refuses to invest &euro;1.8 million in that hospital.  The Minister of State's response is unacceptable.  I appreciate that he is taking guidance from hospital management in Letterkenny, but it is an insult to the intelligence of the people of County Donegal to talk about 5,000 people on trolleys, some of whom were processed more quickly in Donegal than in other hospitals.  The Minister of State knows that is not an acceptable response.  I consider him to be a decent human being.  The response he delivered is indecent and intolerable.  I appeal to the Minister of State to deal immediately with this matter so that the funding sought to reopen the short-stay ward and bring the 19 beds into operation will be forthcoming.  That will take the pressure off the heroic nurses and doctors who are dealing with this crisis.  Then we should address the wider issue of Letterkenny hospital later this year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-01-17a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018011700002#D00200"><p>I thank Senator Mac Lochlainn.  I appreciate his frustration.  I also appreciate his role as a public representative; he is doing a very fine job.  He has brought this issue to the notice of the Seanad with passion and conviction.  I agree with him and I support him on the principle of opening transitional care beds.  That is the way to deal with the issue in the future and that is the way to take the pressure off emergency departments.  We need to invest more in that area.</p> <p>Last year, an additional &euro;30 million was invested in transitional beds.  However, this was not sufficient to open additional beds in all the locations in which we wanted to open them.  The HSE must work to strict criteria in deciding where to open these beds.  For a variety of reasons, it is not always possible to open beds.  In my constituency, there are 25 empty beds that are not in operation due to union issues and objections.  There are a number of considerations involved - I am not suggesting that this is an issue with Letterkenny - but there are myriad reasons why beds can and cannot be opened at a given time and why beds were opened in some places and not in others.  The budget was &euro;30 million in 2017 and an allocation of an additional &euro;40 million was made in the 2018 budget to deal with the winter overcrowding in this coming year.  I cannot give the Senator any commitment because, as he knows, this is an operational matter for the HSE.  However, I can guarantee that the position of Letterkenny University Hospital will be looked at very seriously again.  As resource allow and as other matters fall into line, I hope we can open additional step-down care beds in Letterkenny.  That is the practical solution to the problem.</p></speech>

Ba mhaith liom labhairt faoin seirbh&iacute;s sl&aacute;inte.  T&aacute; c&uacute;pla ceisteanna simpl&iacute; agam.  Dh&aacute; seachtain &oacute; shin bh&iacute; sc&eacute;al dochreidte sa <i>Sunday Business Post</i>.  People were rightly shocked to see the headline &quot;Life or Death: Top doctors say life support now being 'rationed' &quot; in a newspaper at the weekend.  The relevant story by Susan Mitchell, which was published in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>, goes on to state that doctors were forced to make &quot;tough decisions&quot; and prioritise some critically ill patients.  It is clearly stated in the article that the crisis stems from a shortage of intensive care beds in hospitals.</p><p>I preface my concerns about the problems relating to the intensive care units by stating that the vast majority of people who use the public health system have extremely positive experiences.  Let us look at what has been said about the intensive care unit, ICU care.  Dr. Tom Ryan, a consultant in intensive care and anesthesia in St. James's Hospital is president of the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, IHCA.  Two weeks ago, Dr. Ryan noted that we are effectively rationing life support.  Dr. Ryan is a senior medical professional who knows what he is speaking about.  Dr. Emily O'Connor is President of the Irish Association of Emergency Medicine and a consultant in emergency medicine in Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown.  She stated that doctors were having to make &quot;tough decisions about which critically ill patients to prioritise.&quot;.  I could quote from members of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, SIPTU and other unions who are on the front line in intensive care units.  The Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland have repeatedly warned about cuts in bed capacity and the impact on patient safety.  What do unnecessary risks or tough decisions actually mean?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Keith Swanick:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2459"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2459&amp;amp;pid=KeithSwanick&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The absence of a post-operative bed in an intensive care unit, ICU, means that critical life-saving surgery is delayed, deferred or - God forbid - cancelled.  No doctor ever wants to be in this position.  It runs contrary to our Hippocratic oath, contrary to the guidelines of the Medical Council, and contrary to the reasons many of us decided to get into medicine and health care.  Doctors routinely have to sit down with family members and loved ones and say that in their professional opinion, having reviewed and assessed all of the options, the likelihood of survival is slim.  Some of us have to give this bad news thousands of time in our professional lives.  I can remember the first time I had such a conversation.  I assure the Minister of State that it never gets easier.  I never thought that one of these reasons might be that an ICU bed was not available.  </p><p>In 2018 we were told by the Government that we were the richest in Europe and had the fastest growing economy in the eurozone.  There is something profoundly sick about the fact that ICU beds are being rationed.  This is why the type of problems being experienced within ICUs is so alarming.  The failure to provide emergency surgery because of the absence of an ICU bed is nothing short of a national scandal.  There can be no surprise that there is a shortage of ICU beds.  It was highlighted for the HSE in 2009, but cuts of &euro;576 million have been made to the capital budget for acute hospital care in the last ten years.  What makes it worse in the case of ICUs is that it directly impacts upon serious elective surgery, such as procedures for treating cancer, and hinders doctors from escalating really medically sick patients, for example a patient with pneumonia, from the medical ward into an ICU bed.  </p><p>Knowing what I know and speaking to people on the front line I can only conclude that the medical outcomes of people have been compromised and that people are dying as a result.  This is a very serious thing to say but it is unfortunately the case.  People are dying as a result of the absence of ICU beds.</p></speech>

I recognise the ongoing challenges this presents and also its impact on patient flow within emergency departments.  Currently, the annual national adult critical care bed capacity census reports a capacity of 240 adult critical care beds as of 30 September 2017.  The HSE national service plan for 2018 recognises that, following the organisation of hospitals into hospital groups, it is clear that critical care capacity building is required in the hub hospitals in order to meet the ongoing and increasing critical care requirements of complex, multi-specialty, severely critically ill patients.</p> <p>I assure the Senator that the 2018 service plan identifies increase of critical care capacity as a priority for this year.  In particular it identifies the opening of additional high-dependency and critical care capacity at Cork University Hospital and the Mater Hospital as specific priority actions.  Hospital groups are also facilitating the implementation of the national critical care nursing workforce plan, Career Pathway, to recruit nursing graduates.</p> <p>The Senator may also be aware that my Department is undertaking a health system capacity review, in line with the Programme for a Partnership Government commitment, which is examining health service capacity across all key areas of primary care, acute care and services for older people.  This includes examining current and future demand, capacity for adult critical care and the need for additional adult critical care capacity up to 2031, taking into account demographic growth.</p></speech>

It is worth noting that the HSE commissioned the Prospectus report in 2009, which recommended that the number of ICU beds be increased by 45% immediately and be doubled by 2020.  These recommendations have not been acted upon and no additional ICU beds have been provided.  An additional 1,500 acute hospital beds have also been closed.  Dr. Fergal Hickey, who was a consultant in emergency medicine in Sligo University Hospital, said that an estimated 300 to 350 patients - real people - are dying every year due to a shortage of critical care beds.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Keith Swanick:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2459"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2459&amp;amp;pid=KeithSwanick&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Does the Minister of State agree that the number of ICU beds must increase?  What timeframe does the Government have for this?  Does the Minister of State agree with the hospital consultants that the number of additional acute hospital beds that are required to provide an internationally accepted standard in Ireland is 4,000?  By OECD standards, Ireland is one of the top spending countries in health.  Something is seriously wrong when the number of acute hospital beds here is one of the lowest of all OECD countries.  That is the fundamental problem.</p></speech>

I absolutely agree with the Senator.  I acknowledge the issue and, as I said earlier, it is recognised as a priority for the year ahead by the individual hospital groups.  The implementation of hospital groups facilitates further reorganisation of these services across hospitals in line with the hub-and-spoke model.  Over the medium to long term, the health service capacity review will provide the basis for determining the extent of the capacity requirements over the next 15 years and the type of capacity needed.  The findings will also inform the development of a new ten-year national development plan.  Work on the HSE capacity review is at an advanced stage and I expect to receive the final report very shortly.  I intend to bring the report to the Government and have it published as soon as possible thereafter.</p> <p>The Government is committed to making tangible and sustainable improvements in our health services.  The health service capacity review was a key element of this and the Sl&aacute;intecare report provides a framework and direction of travel for improvement.  The Government has already given its approval to move ahead with the establishment of a Sl&aacute;intecare programme office in the Department of Health.  The role of executive director of the Sl&aacute;intecare programme office was advertised on Friday 12 January, as the Senator is aware, by the Public Appointments Service.</p> <p>On his specific question about consultants and the 4,000 beds, the Senator will appreciate that prior to the publication of the capacity review it would not be appropriate for me to comment on any numbers or figures in that regard.</p></speech>

I especially wish to acknowledge that the Minister is responsible for CL&Aacute;R and that it was he who reopened the programme in 2016.  While the Minister might be based in Dublin 4, he is certainly working hard for rural communities.  It is interesting to note that the CL&Aacute;R covers a programme relating to various counties or parts of counties: Cavan, Clare, Cork, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Kilkenny, Laois, Roscommon, Sligo, Tipperary, Waterford, Westmeath, Wicklow and all of County Leitrim, which is the only entire country within CL&Aacute;R.  It is an important measure.  It ties in with the Government's commitment to the Action Plan for Rural Development.  I am very aware of all the objectives of that.  It is important that we hear how the 2017 programme went, what are the Minister's intentions for funding the CL&Aacute;R programme and any plans for bringing it forward into 2018.  It is an important programme in the context of rural development and it acknowledges that there is a need for investment in rural communities.  I thank the Minister.</p></speech>

I am glad the Senator has a concern.  I appreciate that and the support which he and the others gave me in the Seanad when we discussed rural issues before Christmas.</p> <p>The CL&Aacute;R programme provides funding for small-scale infrastructural projects in disadvantaged rural areas that have experienced significant levels of depopulation.  The aim of CL&Aacute;R is to support the sustainable development of identified CL&Aacute;R areas with the aim of attracting people to live and work there.  The funding works in conjunction with local funding and on the basis of locally identified priorities.</p> <p>The programme was originally launched in October 2001 to provide for targeted investment in disadvantaged rural areas.  The areas originally selected for inclusion in the programme were those which suffered the greatest population decline from 1926 to 1996, with the exception of the Cooley Peninsula, which was included on the basis of the serious difficulties caused in that area by foot and mouth disease.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Michael Ring:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1000"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1000&amp;amp;pid=MichaelRing&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The average population loss in the original CL&Aacute;R regions over the period 1926 to 1996 was 50%.  In 2006, an analysis of the 2002 census data was carried out by the National Institute for Regional and Spatial Analysis at Maynooth University and the programme was extended to include areas with an average population loss of 35% between 1926 and 2002.  CL&Aacute;R was effectively closed to new applications from 2010 and all funding provided over the period 2010 to 2015 was in respect of prior commitments.  However, the Government relaunched the CL&Aacute;R programme on 6 October 2016 based on the original areas outlined above, with a focus on three separate measures.  The first measure concerned safety measures for schools and community or sports facilities, the second measure concerned playgrounds and multi-use games areas and the third measure concerned local access roads.</p><p>On 1 December 2016, the allocation of &euro;8.293 million to 651 successful projects under the programme was announced.  The 2017 CL&Aacute;R programme, with an indicative allocation of &euro;5 million, was launched on 31 March 2017 with a closing date of 5 May 2017.  Funding for the programme was available in 2017 under four separate measures.  The first measure concerned support for school and community safety measures, the second measure concerned play areas, the third measure concerned targeted community infrastructure and the fourth measure concerned first responder supports.  In total, more than 500 applications were received, to the value of &euro;15 million, across the four measures.  Applications under the first, second and third measures were submitted through the local authorities while applications under the fourth measure were submitted from voluntary organisations involved in community-based response to emergency situations.  In total, just over &euro;7 million was allocated to 231 successful projects, across the four measures, ranging from pedestrian crossings at rural schools to emergency response vehicles.</p><p>However, in order to ensure that the CL&Aacute;R programme continues to target the most appropriate rural areas, I am committed to carrying out a review of the areas covered under the CL&Aacute;R programme during 2018 in light of the most up-to-date population position as published by the Central Statistics Office in 2017.  I have secured a budget of &euro;5 million for CL&Aacute;R for 2018 and decisions regarding the measures that might be funded for 2018 will be made available shortly.</p></speech>

Will the Minister release or publish the national map setting out the CL&Aacute;R areas?  Some people are still in doubt about that.  It is also important to keep local councils informed of what is going on.  Departments tend to engage with local authority executives but not necessarily local elected members.  The Minister will appreciate that his party has a large number of local members, both elected and non-elected, who are very active in rural communities throughout the country.  Therefore, given that there have been some changes since the last one two years ago, could we get the map?  I also ask that local authorities are kept informed about the work because it is really positive, and it is important that it is made known.  I thank the Minister for attending and giving us his time.</p></speech>

Every local authority area has its map because they have to consider these maps when making their application under the CL&Aacute;R programme.  The Senator made a valid point.  In my area, there are towns and, in particular, villages that are in CL&Aacute;R and others that are not in it but should be.  I have to be careful how I put it but there are villages where one would feel they have a better standard of living and more people are working and employed there than in other areas.  I saw it myself.  An area that made an application for a scheme did not qualify because it was not in the CL&Aacute;R programme.  I would consider this area to suffer major disadvantage.  Therefore, I intend to carry out a review of the scheme.</p> <p>One of the best aspects of the scheme is the first responder supports.  Last week, we provided funding of more than &euro;500,000 to doctors who are on-call and make themselves available in a voluntary capacity.  Renault sponsored a number of vehicles throughout the country and I helped to fit out the equipment.  These first responders, as they are called when there is an accident, have saved many lives in rural parts of Ireland.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Michael Ring:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1000"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1000&amp;amp;pid=MichaelRing&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is the Order of Malta and there are many other voluntary organisations.  They give of their time to provide a service to communities and they are expected to also collect money for vehicles that can cost anything up to &euro;100,000, which does not make sense to me and that is why I brought in this scheme.  Last year I asked the local authorities and the communities if they wanted to make an application for a miscellaneous scheme.  I will do the same again this year.  I did it on the basis that if there was something I felt several communities needed I could consider a scheme for the following year.</p><p>I would love to have more money for the CL&Aacute;R programme.  It was one of the better schemes in respect of local authority expenditure and how it worked.  I intend to open it again early in the new year along with the local improvement scheme, LIS.  I will review the overall context of the CL&Aacute;R programme, who is in and who is out.  We need to have guidelines because we want to identify and target the disadvantaged areas, particularly in CL&Aacute;R.</p></speech>

We are half way through that programme and farmers have shown significant interest in it.  To date almost 12,000 farmers have applied to the scheme which is positive because the scheme helps them modernise.  </p> <p>Half way through TAMS II, however, only 10% of the money has been drawn down.  There are many applications in the system.  I have asked before that we expand it by including generators but today I want it to be expanded to include cattle passes.  Farmers on fragmented farm holdings, some in dairy, which have expanded, have unfortunately seen large numbers of animals cross roads, main roads and by-roads.  It is dangerous.  It is also a drain on manpower if a herd is crossing a road.  Labour is a problem on farms.  We have a real commitment and vision in the food policy, Food 2025.  There has been a large increase in the volume produced on dairy farms in recent years.  A step towards helping these farmers modernise their systems would be to expand TAMS II to include cattle passes, which would in turn help with labour and health and safety problems.</p></speech>

These measures were launched under the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 and are co-funded under the European agricultural fund for rural development, EAFRD.  The measures provide grants for capital investment in physical assets to assist the Irish agriculture sector to respond to a range of policy challenges.  The six measures initially launched were: the young farmers capital investment scheme; the dairy equipment scheme; the organic capital investment scheme; the animal welfare, safety and nutrient storage scheme; the low emission slurry spreading scheme; and the pig and poultry investment scheme.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Michael Creed:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=259"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=259&amp;amp;pid=MichaelCreed&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> The objectives of the scheme include enabling growth and competitiveness in the sector, addressing environmental and climate change issues, supporting the increased efficiency of holdings and improving animal health and welfare.  In addition to these objectives, the young farmer capital investment scheme aims to address one of the key structural issues in the sector by specifically targeting support at young trained farmers, offering them a higher rate of grant aid at 60%, compared to the standard rate of 40%.  </p><p>In March of last year an additional measure, the tillage capital investment scheme, was added to the list of measures.  One of the objectives of this scheme is to facilitate the tillage sector to develop a targeted and precise approach, focusing on environmental dividends, efficiency and growth.  There is a huge variety of items available under the suite of seven targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, measures. </p><p>In all measures, applications and payment claims must be made online, either by the farmer or by an advisor authorised to act on the farmer's behalf.  The final allocation in respect of TAMS II for the full rural development programme will be in the region of &euro;395 million.  In order to encourage the drawdown of funding, provide increased budget certainty and ensure that all farmers can avail of funding over the entire period of the rural development programme, from the sixth tranche onward the length of time in which to undertake the works approved was reduced from the three-year period in previous tranches to six months for mobile equipment and 12 months for fixed building works.  The period for the completion of works approved or to be approved under previous tranches remains unchanged.  I am delighted that the scheme has proved to be so popular with Irish farmers, with more than 15,500 applications submitted to date.  Of these, more than 12,500, 80% of the total, have been approved to commence work. </p><p>The figures are much lower where payment claims are concerned.  It is open to approved applicants to submit an online payment claim as soon as they are in a position to do so.  Within the approved deadline, the timing of the submission of a payment claim is entirely a matter for individual farmers, and when they carry out the approved works is up to them.  To date, just 3,500 payment claims have been submitted.  The Department has actively encouraged all approved applicants to submit payment claims, including by contacting approved applicants individually by text message.  I would urge all approved applicants who have completed their works to submit a payment claim as soon as they are in a position to do so.  </p><p>To date, payments have issued in more than 2,600 cases, amounting to a total of more than &euro;36.5 million.  All payment claims are examined and paid as soon as possible after they have been submitted.  Where any issue arises with a payment claim, the applicant concerned is contacted directly by the Department to resolve outstanding issues.  All 12,500 approvals issued represent potential outstanding liabilities for the Department.  Until these approvals mature to payment stage, or the timeframe of the approval expires, a budgetary provision must be available to make payments.  Until the budgetary position becomes clearer, it is not possible to consider adding additional items, including cattle underpasses, to the comprehensive list of investment items already available under the suite of seven TAMS II measures.  It is not proposed, therefore, to add any additional items at this time. </p></speech>

He is right in saying that it is a very important scheme, and the uptake among farmers, with more than 12,500 applying, is very much welcomed.  Again, it comes down to the payment and the actual payment scheme.  In many ways it is in the farmers' hands.  They must move the projects forward and trigger the payment.  When will the Minister have an indication of whether there will be money left over from the scheme?  Does he know a date on which these applications will mature and will not be drawn down?  I expect that a cohort of applications in the system will not be drawn down.</p> <p>Do we know the date on which this cohort will fall off the system?  We might then know when the funds assigned to them would be made available, and thus be able to extend the scheme to cattle passes or even agricultural generators.  I know it is an issue of timing, and I appreciate that the Minister is under pressure, but it is important that at some point we get a budgetary figure and amend it appropriately.</p></speech>

The scheme is extremely attractive and successful, not least because of the level of grant aid, but also because of the range of projects covered under it, which are myriad across a number of sectors in agriculture.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Michael Creed:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=259"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=259&amp;amp;pid=MichaelCreed&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A total of 15,500 applications have been made under it.  Some 12,500 applications have been approved but in only in the region of 2,500 of those approved have payments been claimed.  The problem for the Department is getting certainty around the intentions of those who have approvals outstanding but where no claims have been submitted.  We have applied a time limit to more recent tranches of applications whereby an applicant has a six month period for an application for mobile equipment and a 12 month approval period for buildings.</p><p>The unfortunate reality for a substantial number of applications prior to that stage is that they have had a three year approval process and that three year process has not begun to expire yet.  It is probable that a number of those approvals will not proceed.  Currently, they may be resubmitted at a later stage but it makes it difficult to consider at this point in time whether there is sufficient head room to consider other items under the rural development programme and the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS.  There is no shortage of asks.  </p><p>I appreciate the points the Senator has raised here and with me privately about underpasses.  I accept the principle of the point made, namely, that the absence of underpasses makes it difficult to farm fragmented holdings, particularly dairy holdings where crossing busy roads multiple times each day is necessary.</p><p>There is no shortage of asks in respect of TAMS.  The Deputy also mentioned generators and that is another area where there is interest.  The list of asks is very long but until we get greater financial certainty around what are the intentions of numerous approved applicants whose applications are timed to expire as this year progresses, we will not have sufficient clarity as to what head room is available.</p></speech>

Yesterday the Garda apologised to her family but we must call on the Government and the State to apologise to her and her family for what was a gross and unbelievable miscarriage of justice.</p> <p>I was two at the time.  I learned yesterday from various journalists who attended the tribunal how the family and Joanna were bullied by garda&iacute; and coerced into signing statements on the matter.  She was traumatised by the tribunal and by arms of the State on the matter.  When she was vindicated by her blood samples which showed she was not the mother of the child, they came up with a theory of superfecundation, a word the whole country looked up yesterday.  The mind boggles; it was like seeing a horror movie mixed with an episode of "Father Ted".  It is time for the State to clean up its act and treat women properly.  The State's treatment of women has been awful.  It is something we need to look at very clearly and carefully.  I hope the Government takes it on board and issues an apology to Ms Hayes and her family immediately.</p> <p>The second issue I will raise is the housing crisis.  We did not see an improvement over the Christmas period.  There are 91,000 people on social housing lists and over 3,000 children living in homeless accommodation.  The Minister is coming out with figures and changing the goalposts.  He is contradicting himself left, right and centre.  Every day in all of our clinics, the biggest issue we hear about is housing and homelessness.  It cannot continue this way.  We need to see proper action, a proper plan and a State-wide social housing programme.  I call on the Government to initiate one without delay.  I ask the Government to implement an ambitious, city-wide or State-wide house building programme.</p></speech>

The first is the fodder crisis.  The Leader indicated that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine will come to the Seanad.  We should ask him to specifically address the fodder crisis in the north and west as a result of the bad weather.  The Minister spoke at some length at the IFA annual general meeting yesterday.  The Taoiseach attended the AGM yesterday and expressed some concerns about a number of issues in agriculture.  That resonated very well with the IFA.  It is indebted to him.  It appreciates the Taoiseach and the Minister attending its annual general meeting yesterday.  It is a sign of their enormous interest in rural Ireland and agriculture.  That is important.  There has been some suggestion by the IFA and other organisations that a voucher scheme for supplementary nuts, silage or hay should be introduced.  It needs to be done.  There needs to be a single strong message in the Department's response to the situation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I would appreciate if the Leader could do that.<br/><br/>I acknowledge the sad passing of a former Senator, Dr. Maurice Hayes, who served two terms in the Seanad.  I know we will have another opportunity to pay tribute to him.  He was a very proud Ulsterman.  He was a personal friend of mine.  I worked closely with him and served with him on the National Forum for Europe for over five years.  He brought amazing skills.  That is for another day.  I acknowledge that on our first day back since his passing.<br/><br/>I wish to raise an issue that appeared in today's Inside Politics digest of <i>The Irish Times</i>.  I will not mention the journalist's name because that is not appropriate.  More important is the issue.  It stated:</p><blockquote>The Seanad is back from its Christmas break and will ease into the day at 2.30 pm with commencement matters, followed by the order of business, otherwise known as the procession of windbagging.</blockquote><p>I think that is grossly offensive and grossly insulting.  People will say a clever politician would not get up and criticise the media for fear that he or she would not get coverage or support.</p></speech>

I see enough journalists around this House every day, but I do not see them in here.  I do not see them commenting about what we do on Commencement Matters.  I am more interested in people taking the time to come in here and listen.  They do not even have to come into this Chamber.  They have the privilege, as many of us have, of looking at proceedings on monitors in their offices.  I recognise the media have an enormous job and make an enormous contribution, and we need to work together.  As we start another year, I ask them to get up here, take the time to get on with the real job of journalism, which is not walking the back corridors of Leinster House but being in here listening to constructive and positive debate in which we partake.</p><p>I want to send that important message out, particularly to <i>The Irish Times</i>journalists who are spending a lot of time talking about their tracker poll on the referendum.  They are spending a lot of time sending emails and looking for responses.  Let them get up here and deal with the real work that is exercising the people of this country on a daily basis, namely, housing, employment - to a lesser extent - and education.  There are bigger issues that we need to look at.  I appeal to journalists, particularly political journalists, to get into these Houses and do the real job of journalism and report about work.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the absolute injustice and torture she suffered at the hands of the institutions.  One can only come to the conclusion that there was absolute collusion between individuals working in those institutions to be complicit in her torture over months and years.  That must never happen again.  One thing that has improved in a sense is that now people are not willing to stand by and let these things happen.  However, it shows the younger generation exactly how women were treated in this State.  We hope it will never happen again.</p> <p>There should be an inquiry into the behaviour of those involved in making the decisions that led to the treatment of Joanne Hayes.  It is not something that can be let lie.  I am very conscious that behind this there is a woman and a family, who must have control of what happens from here on in.  She should be substantially compensated.  She can never be truly adequately compensated for what has happened to her, but she should have a say in that.  I do not want this just to be another outcry which is then dropped.  It needs to be brought to a conclusion once and for all.  Those who behaved in the way that they did need to be held accountable.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I commend my own colleague, Deputy Louise O'Reilly, our spokesperson on health, on bringing together today the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, the Irish Association of Emergency Medicine, IAEM, the Irish National Midwives Organisation, INMO, and SIPTU representing the care workers, to tell us their experiences of working inside the emergency departments of this State.  What they said was not news to any of us.  However, it really brought it home that, across the board, the clinicians and the workers are working in a very dangerous and toxic environment, both for themselves and for the patients they see.  They are really concerned that we need an accelerated programme of reinstating beds.  They have the solutions.  That is why we do not need the review of the bed capacity.  We do not need any more evidence.  The evidence is already there.  </p><p>I would encourage people working inside the system to come forward.  They have been targeted in the past.  I know myself when we have had community campaigns, where individual nurses who supported the campaigns, either to keep hospitals open or to keep beds open, have been targeted.  That must stop.  We must have a critical mass working with the public and a critical mass of workers to come forward to say that these situations are dangerous and they can no longer go on.  </p><p>I ask the Minister for Health to come into the House, maybe even to specifically address the situation of workers.  It is not good enough that every time the Minister is coming all the beds are cleared and everything is made to look rosy.  The management within some of these hospitals are telling clinicians and nurses that if they do not like it, they can leave it.  We have to stand up for workers in these situations.</p></speech>

Even though we all know there is a crisis, it is just shocking to hear the stories.  That is what was really most upsetting.  I refer in particular to the choice of who can have a bed, whether it be a 90 year-old woman who is very sick with a bad chest infection or a 45 year-old woman who might have breast cancer.  They have to choose which one gets the hospital bed.  It really is shocking to think that this is going on in this day and age.  There were many more stories like that.  It is awful.  I have had relatives myself who have had to wait two days to get a hospital bed.</p><p>I want to highlight an issue around homelessness and the short notice period that tenants are facing if landlords attempt to evict them.  The notice periods for rental properties range from 28 days for tenants in the property less than six months to 56 days for tenants <i>in situ</i>for two to three years.  In the current housing crisis, with so few available rental properties, it is obvious that these notice periods are not enough for anyone to get alternative accommodation.  It is very worrying.  I know that myself.  We all have adult children and it is very worrying that they cannot seem to get accommodation these days.  Perhaps we can get the Minister in to give us an update on what has been going on and what kind of work has been done, if at all possible.  It would put us all in the picture.  </p><p>Today though, I mostly want to express my sympathy to Ms Joanne Hayes, and indeed the whole Hayes family, for the trauma  they suffered.  It is being revisited now with the reopening of the case of the killing of the Caherciveen baby.  The Hayes family were forced by the garda&iacute; to sign statements.  A group of garda&iacute; had already decided that Ms Hayes had killed a baby found on the beach in Caherciveen.  It should be remembered that Ms Hayes had told the garda&iacute; where she had placed her stillborn child and this was ignored.  I welcome the fact that an investigation into the death of the baby found in Caherciveen is now being reopened because of new DNA evidence.  However, this investigation could have been carried out 34 years ago if the garda&iacute; involved had believed Ms Hayes.  The methods used by garda&iacute; involved in the case to extract confessions should also be investigated and other cases examined which relied on statements given to these garda&iacute; should be examined.  I mostly want to express my sympathy today to Ms Joanne Hayes and her family. </p></speech>

I am glad to see it reopened.  However, I do think a State apology would be appropriate.  Like others, I was too young to know the details of the case at the time.  I do remember in school hearing about it and being aware even then of the immensely brutal way in which Ms Hayes was treated by the garda&iacute;.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->At the time a "heavy gang" was operating within the Garda and there was quite a notorious culture with regard to the extraction of confessions.  Mr. Brendan Kennelly at the time described the treatment of Joanne Hayes as being akin to a medieval witch hunt.  At the time, there were a number of appalling cases in which the State failed women, particularly young women.  I am thinking about the Ann Lovett tragedy that occurred around the same time.  It was just the year after the eighth amendment had been passed and Members will have a debate on the committee's report on that today.  Perhaps it is a time for us to reflect, looking back on those events decades ago, on how the State mistreated women and how we hope things have changed.  A State apology would reflect that change and give recognition to the immense injustice done to Joanne Hayes and her family at the time.</p><p>I ask for a debate on the ongoing crisis in Syria.  Unfortunately, we saw some very sad developments over the Christmas break as there is a real and ongoing humanitarian crisis in Ghouta and Idlib.  Members will have a debate on foreign affairs in the coming weeks and I might raise this with the Minister in that context.  I will certainly raise it at the foreign affairs committee.  It is important that Ireland should do as much as we can to highlight the extreme emergencies of east Ghouta and Idlib and the immense pressure on civilians.  I know quite a number of patients are awaiting medical evacuations in besieged eastern Ghouta but despite quite a bit of public focus on that crisis over Christmas, only 29 of those patients have been evacuated and at least 529 more still require urgent medical treatment.  It is a similar position for people awaiting medical treatment in Idlib, where there are increasing civilian casualties.  It is a somewhat forgotten tragedy in the sense that public focus has shifted somewhat from it but I hope we can raise it with the Minister in a debate in this House in the coming weeks.</p><p>I welcome the announcement in the legislative programme for this term that we will have progress on the gender pay gap transparency legislation.  I had the pleasure of speaking at a symposium on the gender pay gap last week organised by the Ministers responsible for justice and business and enterprise.  They gave assurances and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, in particular indicated he would progress our Private Members' Bill, which has passed through Second and Committee Stages in this House with Government support.  I ask the Leader to make inquiries as to when we might see the Bill on Report Stage and if it can be debated in Government time or it needs to be discussed in Private Members' time as a Labour Bill.</p></speech>

We are now fortunate as a nation to have additional funds for the health service.  However, there must be acknowledgement from people that having had so many cuts and the reality of the troika in town, which was checking reports every three months and was not prepared to write the cheque for the following three months if the report did not come in as expected, we have much ground to make up.  One cannot possibly hope, within a couple of years, to restore our service on the basis of getting back to an OECD average when there were so many years in which we were so far behind.</p> <p>Beds are of course an issue but reform is equally important.  We must move away from an illness-based health service towards prevention and early intervention.  That means there should be a new GP contract and restoration of the cuts made on foot of the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation.  Everybody experienced those but they have not been reversed at all in general practice, which is having a very negative effect.  We also need more access to diagnostics for GPs.  I want to be able to look after my patients by ordering an X-ray or ultrasound so as to manage the problem without them ever having to go to hospital, if possible.  We need more home help and day hospitals, where people can be absolutely assured that a procedure will take place because the bed would not be occupied from the night before.  There is a wonderful opportunity for outpatient follow-up to be carried out in the community, nearer patients.</p> <p>There are many other matters that could be addressed but I will not get into them because I wish to raise an issue I have raised a number of times before.  It is the anomaly in the pension system brought about by previously passed legislation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator James Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2180"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The anomaly has resulted in upwards of 36,000 pensioners being discriminated against, many of whom are women who took time out of work to raise children, who are the future of our nation, or looked after loved ones who otherwise would have ended up in State care thus costing the State considerable sums of money.  Not alone have they lost out by giving this service that was born out of love, they are now being penalised for saving the State money. </p><p>I am very much encouraged by what the Minister for Employment and Social Affairs has said and hope that she will bring this issue to Cabinet this week.  I also hope, arising from that, restoration will be made immediately in terms of current pay and that the back pay issue can be resolved over a slightly longer period.  It is important to remember that for many of these people, who are mainly women, time is not on their side so we need to urgently address this injustice.  </p></speech>

I hope everyone has a productive, healthy and happy year going forward.  I also congratulate the Leader of the House on his recent marriage.  I congratulate him and his new husband.</p> <p>I wish to refer to the proposed worldwide ban on the importation of plastics by China, which is an issue that is becoming more relevant by the day.  China proposes to ban imports from Ireland and many other countries.  I understand that 95% of this country's plastic waste has gone to China in recent years.  Therefore, it is important that we invite the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment to this House to discuss the measures that are being taken and will be taken to resolve the issue.  There have been fires in recycling depots here in the past number of years.  We do not need the stockpiling of various types of plastics to develop.  I refer to the more useful ones that are recyclable and the other plastics that tend to end up in the process as well.  </p> <p>Notwithstanding all of that, Ireland has come a long way with the introduction of the plastic bag tax, better light bulbs, pay-by-weight waste collection, a ban on the use of smoky coal and the introduction of a recycling scheme for waste electrical and electronic equipment, WEEE.  All of these measures were implemented by previous Fianna F&aacute;il Governments.  We need to consider how we generate waste now.  We must come up with ways to reduce, reuse and recycle as much as possible because landfill is a thing of the past.  The new thermal treatment plant, waste to energy incinerator or whatever one wishes to call it, which depends on one's perspective, is located in Dublin.  It is operating at capacity despite all of the talk that it would not even be half full when it opened.  I remain to be corrected on that aspect but that is my understanding of the issue.  </p> <p>It is important that the Leader arranges a debate on the matter with the Minister soon because waste is a health issue.  Health affects people when they are unwell and housing affects people, particularly if they do not have a house.  However, every single household in the country produces waste so each household should be encouraged to have many ways to responsibly dispose of their waste.  By that I mean in such a way as to minimise the amount of waste that goes to landfill or is incinerated.</p> <p>We need to talk to producers about banning certain types of packaging that is not recyclable.  For example, the polystyrene sheets that are used to wrap food and provide pizza bases and fast-food boxes.  Many producers are using more sustainable packaging but some do not.  We should aim towards households and businesses being able to say they have a strategy where they do not have residual waste for landfill or incineration, that as much of what we consume is reusable and, ideally, a reduced amount of packaging.  We have all heard about people getting packages over Christmas that comprised of huge cardboard boxes that had a huge amount of paper inside or plastic packaging to wrap a tiny product.  I call on the Leader to arrange a debate, as a matter of urgency.  I am conscious that the Green Party has prepared a Waste Reduction Bill but that is not why I have raised this issue.  I note that the Green Party has called for a discussion on waste reduction.  Waste is a topic that affects every house in this country and must be tackled, as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

My colleague and the Leader's colleague, Senator Noone, was charged with the responsibility of chairing the all-party Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.  She did it as a professional and worked hard.  It is probably a bit unfair of me to mention her while she is sitting here in the Chamber.  She was subjected to the most vile attacks on social media over the past few days, which is outrageous.  The woman did nothing but the job she had been given by the Taoiseach.  I gather the attacks did not come from Ireland but Massachusetts in America.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

Will these outsiders be interfering in Irish social issues?  </p><p>Let me tell the House that I had the pleasure this week of having two people removed from Twitter for ongoing attacks on me.  Can I advise Senator Noone that she do the same.  If we see one of our Seanad colleagues being attacked, we should have the courage to stand up for him or her.  They are only doing a job.  Nobody in Parliament likes having to deal with difficult issues, but like it or lump it, we have to do it.  That is what we are paid to do.</p><p>I had the pleasure of attending the retirement of Sergeant Major Noel O'Callaghan in Athlone recently.  Mr. O'Callaghan is one of our finest soldiers.  He has a major issue with the raising and lowering of our national flag.  Some time ago the Taoiseach said there was no need to lower the flag.  It is a great military ceremony every day to have the flag raised and lowered in a military barracks.  Mr. O'Callaghan is correct in what he says, namely, there are national flags in tatters hanging out of buildings all over the country.  That is not just disrespectful, it is disgusting to witness. </p><p>I ask the Taoiseach to reconsider this and return to raising the flag at sunrise and lowering it at sunset and giving it the respect to which it is entitled.</p><p>I wish Members a happy new year.</p></speech>

As a young fellow, I followed the tribunal and was quite shocked at the behaviour back then.</p></speech>

Kerry is a big county.  I listened very carefully to &quot;Prime Time&quot; last night and to the journalists who wrote the book about that particular incident.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a lot of questions to answer about not dealing with this situation in the 1990s.  DNA and DNA profiling was available in the 1990s.  Mr. Gerard Colleran was quite right in what he said last night in that the garda&iacute; have serious questions to answer as to why they did not deal with this particular case in the 1990s.</p><p>It is absolutely appropriate that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na apologised to Ms Joanne Hayes.  It was also appropriate that the Taoiseach apologised to Ms Joanne Hayes from Strasbourg today.  I have no doubt that in the fullness of time, an appropriate State apology will be delivered in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the State by the Taoiseach.  It is the appropriate thing to do.</p><p>I also noted the Taoiseach's comments that in due course the State will engage with Ms Joanne Hayes's representatives as regards compensation.  I believe the Garda has not answered the questions in full.  An answer and an explanation is required to the very pertinent questions that Mr. Gerard Colleran asked on &quot;Prime Time&quot; as to why this did not happen in the 1990s, even though the Garda had been asked <i>ad nauseam</i>to reopen the case and to use modern science, such as DNA profiling.  Why was it not done in the 1990s?  I would like an answer to that.  The people of Ireland deserve an answer.</p></speech>

Following on from Senator Craughwell raising the issue of social media, he is a big guy and is well able to deal with social media.</p> <p>I wish to address the seeming U-turn in the proposed appointment, the first of its kind for Ireland, of a digital safety commissioner to oversee and hold Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Snapchat and so on to account in respect of our vulnerable children.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator M&aacute;ire Devine:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2468"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2468&amp;amp;pid=MaireDevine&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This issue has been discussed at length by the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs.  We have worked on it and discussed it with witnesses in recent months.  It came to our attention yesterday that the Taoiseach has been quoted as saying that the initiative has been shelved.  This issue is not just about children and youth affairs, it is also involves all aspects of the mental health of children and adults.  Will the Leader clarify whether the appointment of a digital commissioner - which was promised by the Minister for Communications, Climate Change and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, and supported by the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs - is to be shelved?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-01-17a.72" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1409" speakername="Colm Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018011700002#U00200"><p>If one goes back five or six years, one will find that clear targets for the creation of jobs were set out by the Government.  People were very sceptical that those targets could be achieved.  It is interesting that the CSO publication in recent days gave the figures for the third quarter of 2017, which show that there are now 2.2 million people at work.  That is an increase of 48,000 year on year.  It is a huge achievement for this country and for the people who are to the fore in creating jobs, whether from companies abroad or companies based in Ireland, but also for the various State agencies that have assisted in the creation of those jobs and that have put forward a very positive image of Ireland to the international community.  We should be congratulating everyone involved, namely, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and every other State agency that played a part in this.  We should also be congratulating the people who have worked to provide those additional jobs.  Long may what is happening continue.  We have an extra 48,000 jobs compared to this time last year.</p> <p>The second issue I wish to raise is that of a report published by the Ombudsman in recent days in respect of the treatment abroad scheme.  That scheme is a little different from the cross-border health scheme.  I was involved in bringing forward the cross-border health scheme at European level.  The treatment abroad scheme covers instances where a treatment is not available in this country and medical practitioners have recommended that a person receive treatment abroad.  The Ombudsman found that the way decisions taken by those administering the treatment abroad scheme have been managed has not been in the best interest of the people who are looking for that treatment.  There have been a number of cases where I have had to threaten judicial review in respect of decisions.  I make no apologies for having to do that.  It is important.  There are 17 or 18 recommendations in the Ombudsman's report.  He has set a deadline of the end of February for them to be implemented.  It is very important that they are implemented, that the report is given serious consideration and that the issues raised in it are dealt with.  If someone is looking for medical treatment abroad, it is obvious that he or she has quite a serious issue and is not able to get treatment here.</p> <p>I ask the Leader to convey to the Department of Health and the HSE our view that it is important that the recommendations of the report are implemented and that it does not become another report which just sits on a shelf.  This is about people's health, their care and their treatment.</p></speech>

I hope he and his partner have long and happy years together.  It is a wonderful occasion.  Well done.</p><p>I also want to refer to a very serious issue occurrence in Carraroe a week ago last Friday when a two year old toddler began choking.  An ambulance was called and the family were told it was on its way.  An uncle of the child came to the house and saw that the child was very distressed.  Due to previous situations that had happened in the area, he decided that they should bundle the child into the car and get to the hospital as quickly as possible.  They did that.  They kept in contact with the ambulance service.  The ambulance was to meet them<i>en route</i>.  That did not happen.  They took the initiative and rang a garda, a friend of the family, who sent a colleague of his who was on duty to meet them at the halfway point on the road to Galway city.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2363"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2363&amp;amp;pid=TrevorOClochartaigh&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They met at Spiddal, the child was brought in the Garda car and the ambulance met with them outside the city in Rahoon, on the way to the hospital.  The child was lost twice on the way to the hospital; he had to be resuscitated twice.  It was a very serious scenario and it raises some serious issues for the family.  The first is around the protocols for call-outs.  As there is an ambulance station in Carraroe, which is within five minutes of the family's house, why was no ambulance crew available for the child?  Why did it take 50 minutes for an ambulance to get only as far as Rahoon, which is on the outskirts of the city, when it had been called?  It would have taken another 50 minutes to get to Carraroe had the family not taken the initiative themselves.</p><p>There is also a fire brigade station in the area.  There are two emergency medical technicians on that crew and people who are trained in emergency first response.  If an ambulance is going to take such a long time, why is there no protocol to call these services to the scene to intervene as quickly as possible?  This service would also have a blue light vehicle that could have been used in that emergency scenario to bring the child to hospital.</p><p>We certainly need a very serious discussion around the provision of ambulance services in rural areas.  We have a vocal campaign in north Connemara, in the Leenane area, where there is concern over the lack of cover by ambulance services.  We are also concerned that ambulances are possibly being held up outside the accident and emergency department at University Hospital Galway.  We often see a number of ambulances waiting - sometimes six, seven or eight - and it is my understanding that an ambulance cannot be released until the patient is on the trolley and in the hospital system.  The ambulances are therefore held up.</p><p>Why was there such an inordinate delay in getting an ambulance to this family?  They were extremely distressed.  Thankfully there was a positive outcome; the child had to undergo a minor procedure and has recovered but it was a very touch and go situation.  We want to avoid any more of those happening in the future but we really need to address the issues.  I am aware that the Minister, Deputy Harris, has been spoken to about the issue in Galway and the north Connemara situation.  Promises have been made and it has been put back to the National Ambulance Service, whose response to this situation was that it was not an absolute emergency.  An infant potentially choking in the back of the car certainly is a very serious situation and I cannot understand why it is not being dealt with.  I would like to see this investigated fully.  Perhaps the Minister could be asked to come to the House for a debate around those services.</p></speech>

The 1918 general election and meeting of the First D&aacute;il on 21 January 1919 transformed this island and changed the course of our history.  It was a transformative time in terms of universal suffrage.  The Representation of the People Act 1918 caused the electorate to almost triple.  It also saw our first female representative elected, namely, Countess Markievicz.</p> <p>I remind Members that when, in 1998, all the people voted by a majority - and by majorities North and South - in favour of the Good Friday Agreement, it was the first occasion since the historic 1918 election that the people of this island had voted on the same day on the same issue of their constitutional status.</p> <p>In May 2017, the Declaration of Independence Day Bill, which I drafted, was supported through Second Stage in the Seanad by Members from all sides.  We are awaiting Committee and Remaining Stages.  Senator Horkan stated during that debate that time is of the essence if we are to have the legislation through the Oireachtas before the centenary of the meeting of the First D&aacute;il and the Declaration of Independence on 21 January 1919.</p> <p>I ask the Leader to work to see that the legislation is back in the Seanad as quickly as possible in order that we can formally recognise these truly historic events.</p></speech>

I wish him and his husband Conchobhar the very best for their future together.</p> <p>Ireland had, and still has, a lot to be proud of but our past shows there are a lot of shameful chapters about which we should be embarrassed and by which we should be shamed.  During public discussion and discourse in recent years, we have heard about the Magdalen laundries, the mother and baby homes and now the Kerry babies' case and the treatment that was meted out to Joanne Hayes.  These are all shameful episodes in Irish history.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paudie Coffey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2237"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2237&amp;amp;pid=PaudieCoffey&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I want to raise another shameful episode that has received public attention in recent times.  It relates to a man named Billy Kenneally, a convicted paedophile, in Waterford.  The victims are seeking a commission of inquiry to investigate who knew what at the time he, and possibly others, was abusing young children in Waterford.  I am raising the issue because it is a serious one.  These victims are brave men who revealed their identity in order to raise awareness around the issue and to ensure that we have full transparency, accountability and justice in this particular case of abuse.  It is well known that people in authority at the time knew about the abuse and allowed it to continue.  People in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the clergy and State agencies, as well as in the political system, were aware that this abuser was running rampant in the Waterford area and abusing young children.  These brave young men stepped forward when they discovered this paedophile was still a basketball coach.  They went public, took on this case and the man was convicted.</p><p>These men are fathers of children themselves, as are many of us here, and there is an obligation on us as a society to ensure that there is full justice and transparency around this case.  I have spoken to the Minister for Justice and Equality and he has acknowledged the need for a commission of inquiry.  He understands the pain and suffering that the victims have endured and he is currently engaged with the Attorney General to find a way forward to ensure that this commission is established.  However, I ask the Seanad for its support to ensure that these victims are supported and their stories heard in the full light of day, that there is full transparency and justice, and that the people of authority who knew what was going on are brought before the commission to ensure it never happens again.  We all have an obligation in this regard.  I support to these brave victims.  We must ensure they get the commission of inquiry they so badly want.</p></speech>

However, a category of people who, by definition, cannot get medical treatment abroad are those in need of intensive care treatment, that is, patients needing critical care support in our hospitals.  It is disturbing to learn that 300 people a year may be dying because of a lack of intensive care beds.  It is disturbing to learn that Ireland has 3.7 beds per 1,000 of population.  This is about two thirds of the OECD rate.  Germany has eight beds per 1,000.  It is disturbing to hear and to learn that, in some cases, people are missing out on life saving organ transplants because of the bed shortage and that there is a higher mortality for patients who, due to the shortage, are placed in unsuitable locations.</p> <p>This strikes me because we will be discussing the pro-life issue and what it means to be truly pro-life later on.  Our hospital care system is not very pro-life in the way that it is operating.  I am not faulting medical staff, who are doing their best.  In fact, they are the ones who are pointing out a situation where, apart from the possible impact on patients, there is also the possible negative psychological impact on medics of having to choose, in some cases, who gets care because of the shortage.  </p> <p>Dr. Emily O'Connor of the Irish Association of Emergency Medicine states that they have to make very tough decisions regarding which critically ill patients to prioritise.  She stated: "It is no exaggeration to say this can mean the difference between someone being offered the opportunity of critical care or not."  In other words, if one person gets the bed, someone else loses it.  This is in a First World society, where potentially 300 people are losing their lives for the want of beds.  We hear so much about this in the hospital system but we need to let it sink in.  I am worried that we are seeing a system that has been allowed to degrade to such a point that those who have dedicated their lives to healing the wounds of others are being forced to decide which of their patients is to be let die due to a lack of resources.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Are we there?

He made some very valid points about waste and the disposal thereof.  There is a fundamental issue in the use of plastics and we have to try to move away from using plastic to the extent that we do, as a world.  The waters of the world are becoming oestrogenised because of the amount of oestrogen in plastic.  This will be a serious issue down the road.  It is more than a waste issue it is a fundamental issue.  Young Fine Gael, YFG, launched an idea for plastic coffee cups.  Many outlets now allow customers use reusable cups.  YFG has suggested imposing a levy on plastic cups like the levy Fianna F&aacute;il introduced on plastic bags.  Ours has become a much more disposable society.  That is a good idea and should be followed up.</p> <p>I thank Senator Craughwell for supporting me on social media and again here.  Sad to say, one gets used to the abuse.  I mute people and do not see it and do not give them the satisfaction of blocking them because they want to be able to say that I blocked them.  I just ignore them for the most part.  We have to learn to ignore it rather than constantly try to fight it.  Sometimes people will not agree with me or do not like what I represent.  That is life.  It is a difficult part of the job.  The Senator's comments are valid.  The mute button, however, is one for everyone to consider.  It was Senator Richmond who pointed it out to me because I was not aware of it.  One does not have to block them because much of the time they want that. </p> <p>I agree with Senator Devine about the digital commissioner.  I too would like to know the story because it has come up often.  As far as I know there was strong support for that from Government.  I would be very supportive of having a digital commissioner.  I am not sure the Leader would know about that today but I encourage us to have a debate on it and if possible a debate soon on the environmental area, in respect of the previous issue I raised. </p></speech>

What happened to that lady was horrific and we all need to make sure that it never happens again.</p> <p>I call on on the Minister for Justice and Equality to come to the Chamber to allay my fears regarding the digital age of consent for children.  According to a report arising from pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of Data Protection Bill 2017 carried out by the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality last November, the digital age of consent - the age at which a child can consent to use online services - should be set at 13 years.  The new EU general data protection regulation comes into effect on 25 May 2018 and I am concerned that many parents do not know that their children will be treated as adults online from the age of 13.  This must be investigated further, and I know that there is time to do so.  If a parent is told that, from 26 May next, his or her 13 year old will become an adult online, he or she might cry.  A child of 13 cannot consent to a medical procedure, drink alcohol or vote.  However, we are suggesting that children roam the worldwide web alone just because they have reached an age adopted from social media companies.  While I understand that an official age has not yet been set before the EU general date protection regulation comes into effect on 25 May, I cannot agree that 13 is a suitable age.  From where did it come?  We need much more debate on this matter and we cannot let it slide as a result of our own ignorance.</p> <p>It worries me that experts like Dr. Mary Aiken and Professor Barry O'Sullivan are concerned about the report's recommendation of this age, which will be the lowest digital age of consent in Europe.  They are concerned that parents are not aware of this provision and have had no part to play in this.  Children are able to use technology, but can they be responsible at 13?  A 13 year old could not be left on O'Connell Street and told to go shopping and look after himself or herself.  Why are we allowing 13 year olds to navigate the Internet alone?  The age of 16 is a much more appropriate age of consent and would be more in line with consent and maturity. </p> <p>Recently, shareholders in a popular tech company called for more help for parents to regulate children's use of devices.  I agree that parents cannot do this alone.  We live in a changing world.  Current studies show that the time children spend using these devices is excessive.</p></speech>

I also join everyone else in congratulating the Leader, Senator Buttimer, on his recent marriage and in wishing him well.</p> <p>I want to raise a specific issue.  There have been quite a number of debates on health.  I wish to refer to the city where I reside, Limerick.  People speak about issues relating to management and systems.  The biggest single issue in Limerick and the mid-west is bed capacity.  A report by Teamwork Management Services was completed prior to a reconfiguration which took place in 2009 and which involved the closure of accident and emergency departments at Ennis, Nenagh and St. John's Hospital in Limerick.  This pushed demand into the existing accident and emergency department at University Hospital Limerick.  Apart from addressing the closure of the three accident and emergency departments, the report outlined the need for 138 new co-location beds to be put in place at University Hospital Limerick.  That never happened.  I have worked with the management of University Hospital Limerick.  A welcome proposal has been to put in place 96 acute beds at the hospital has been put forward.  It suggests that these beds be located directly alongside the new emergency department, which works well but which has major capacity issues.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Kieran O'Donnell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2207"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2207&amp;amp;pid=KieranODonnell&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In working with management, I secured funding to enable the design for the project to get under way a number of months ago.  I would like that 96-acute-bed unit to be included in the capital plan that is currently being reviewed.  I have written to the Minister for Health and the HSE about this.  Ultimately, without University Hospital Limerick having these extra beds, it will be impossible for it to deal with the overcrowding in its accident and emergency department and meet the needs of our increasing older population.  The fundamental problem in University Hospital Limerick is bed capacity.  I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and the HSE corporate team from Mr. Tony O'Brien down to ensure that this 96-acute-bed unit is included in the revised capital plan.</p></speech>

I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to come into the House for us to have a substantive debate on public transport provision in Dublin.  The key issue as it relates to my area is with respect to the Luas.  Since the Luas has been operational, it has become a victim of its own success.  People in Sandyford have to get the Luas four or five stops out of town to be guaranteed that they can get on the Luas at rush hour.  We need to have a proper debate to make sure that public transport is adequate in this city, that we are meeting the demands of a growing population and that we will be able to factor in the increased housing provision and increased office provision to make sure that all transport modes, particularly the Luas, are up to standard.  We should debate that issue as soon as possible.</p></speech>

It is a blot on our collective past.  It is a horror.  It is not something that we should try to write out of history, deny or engage in some sort of mental gymnastics to pretend it did not happen.  It did happen.  We should be collectively ashamed of it and make amends in the future.</p> <p>I wish to briefly raise two other matters.  The first matter is the ever-remaining threat of Brexit.  It remains a constant threat to our country but it also remains a threat to the Border community where I live in a very particular way.  There is a risk of complacency now that we might get somewhat smug about it and think the matter is solved.  In that regard, I am happy that our committee here is continuing.  I am also happy that the Taoiseach spoke about it strongly today in the European Parliament and sought to gain the help of our European colleagues to ensure that the agreement with the UK is hammered into real practice.  I want an assurance from the Leader that we will have constant monitoring of the Brexit debate because the people I represent and the entire economic and social life of my community stand to be dislocated and destroyed by Brexit.  I would be negligent if I did not ask the Leader to assure me of the constant monitoring of this issue.  When the Taoiseach comes to this House, I ask that it be the number one item on the agenda and that we get assurances from him as to what is being practically done.</p> <p>I wish to raise a not-unrelated matter, which is very important to my community and to the west.  Farmers are experiencing a crisis because of the weather conditions we have had.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Joe O'Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1610"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1610&amp;amp;pid=JoeOReilly&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Farmers face a very serious fodder crisis which is causing great mental distress, animal welfare problems and financial hardship of mammoth proportions.  They are trying to bring fodder up from the south and east where it is more plentiful and transporting it to Cavan and Monaghan, west Cavan in particular.  If one purchases silage at &euro;25 a bale in the south and includes the transportation bill, it is very serious.  I ask through the Leader that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine subsidises the transport of fodder from areas of plenty to those of great need.  I have farmers watching the Houses today who expect a solution to this real hardship.  This is a real human tragedy and an animal welfare issue and I ask the Leader to deal with it urgently.  There should be no casual procrastination on this one.</p></speech>

I wish also to be associated with the expressions of sympathy on the death of former Senator Maurice Hayes with whom I served in the House for ten years.  He made some very valuable contributions in the House.  I know the Leader will organise expressions of sympathy in the House at a later date.  I also express my condolences to the family of the late Peter Sutherland, who was a great Irishman and statesman and who sadly passed away at a very young age also.</p> <p>I support the call by Senator O&rsquo;Reilly for a debate on agriculture.  I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to come to the House in the very near future to debate agriculture.  As Senator O&rsquo;Reilly said, we face a fodder crisis.  We never had such severe and harsh weather with a lot of rain as we have had over the past number of months.  We had a very poor harvest in some areas last September which has culminated in a fodder shortage.  Bringing fodder to the west and north is very costly.  Senator O&rsquo;Reilly has asked the Minister to provide compensation for the transport of the fodder and I agree .  I hope we have a debate here in the very near future on this very serious issue.  As Senator O&rsquo;Reilly said, it is a human issue and an animal welfare issue.</p> <p>I support Senator Horkan in relation to waste plastic.  Europe will have to look at the packaging of products.  There is far too much packaging used for many products.  While China will not take our plastic, a great many of the products which come to Europe are generated there.  They are culprits in this regard also.  I support Senator Horkan's call for a debate on this issue.  We could look at incineration and see how the two incinerators in the country are working, whether there are problems and if they are viable.  We should look at what we can do on packaging.  The vast majority of packaging should be recyclable or biodegradable.  Those are issues which could be dealt with not only nationally, but also in Europe.  I support the call for a debate.</p></speech>

Recently, the Minister announced that &euro;33 million would be spent on tourism development in the midlands.  The problem is that it does not have any staff there.  A tourism centre is required in Mullingar that would take just about six people.  Tourism is hugely important in the rest of Ireland but the midlands are left stranded.  It is by far the weakest area.  All that is required is an investment in the region of &euro;400,000 for six people to go and develop tourism in the midlands region.  It certainly has many tourism attractions, primarily east of the Shannon, quite frankly, but the focus is on the Shannon.  I have been asked and petitioned to raise this in the Seanad and request the same.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-01-17a.127" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1391" speakername="Jerry Buttimer" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018011700002#BB00300"><p>I thank the 22 Members of the House for their contributions to the Order of Business and wish them a very happy, prosperous and peaceful new year.  I hope we can work collectively to serve the people who elected us to serve and work on behalf of them.  I begin by joining with Members of the House who expressed their sympathy to the family on the death of the late Maurice Hayes, a former Senator.  He was indeed a most prolific and prodigious Member of the House.  We will honour his work and contribution to civic life in this country on another day but I pay tribute to him today.  Equally, I join in the words of commendation on the passing of the former Attorney General and European Commissioner, Peter Sutherland.  He was a statesman.  It is a pity his words and writings were not listened to more carefully.  I had the pleasure of meeting him on a number of occasions.  He was a most courteous, personable and tremendous person and I extend my sympathies to his family.</p> <p>Senators Ardagh, Conway-Walsh, Black, Bacik, Conway, Murnane O'Connor and O'Reilly raised the apology made to Joanne Hayes yesterday by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As Leader of the House, I join in welcoming the apology by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and indeed the remarks of the Taoiseach today in Strasbourg where he apologised on behalf of the State.  Certainly the Hayes family, which has requested privacy, deserve to have that but equally, the way it was treated by an arm of the State and by the State itself left an awful lot to be desired.  Senator Ardagh made reference to Joanne Hayes's age when that event took place.  From looking at the media reports of the tribunal of inquiry and the Garda inquiry, the way she was treated was extraordinary.  As the T&aacute;naiste said today, the matter of compensation is something the Government will discuss.  Senator O'Reilly is correct.  This did happen.  We should collectively be ashamed of the way she was treated.  It was a dark period in our country.  If we cast our minds back, and the "Prime Time" programme last night depicted the imagery of that time, and compare it with where we are today, I certainly hope we are a much better, gentler and kinder nation.  I certainly think the issue is one that has not and cannot be left.</p> <p>Equally, a young baby who was killed is in a grave today in Kerry and the Garda investigation is continuing.  There is a need for anyone with information about the tragic death of Baby John to come forward.  As Leader of the House, I appeal to anybody with information, particularly the family of Baby John, to come forward to the Garda.  They will be dealt with compassionately and in a very caring way.  The distress caused by that event to those people also needs to be exorcised.  Joanne Hayes was the subject of a very prolonged scandal and ordeal that was simply wrong, as the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, noted and we need to put that right.  </p> <p>Senators Conway-Walsh, Black, Reilly, Colm Burke, Mullen and &Oacute; Clochartaigh raised the issue of health.  I agree with all Members of the House that we do need more bed capacity.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Why I got exercised at Senator Mullen in particular is that the use of language is important in terms of those who work in, those who administer, those who are ministerial appointments and Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas who are concerned or interested in health.  Nobody accepts that there should be anybody on a trolley.  Equally, nobody accepts there should be people waiting inordinately for treatment.</p><p>I will put this on the record of the House.  For the information of Senator Mullen, I am not being defensive at all.  As a patient, as the relative of a patient in a hospital, as somebody who worked in the hospital system and as somebody who chaired a health committee, I know, probably more than most, the workings of the health system.  The previous Government and this Government, in particular, have opened more beds for the first time in a decade.  Some 227 new beds have been opened.  If it was a matter of funding alone, the problems in the health system would have been solved.  There has been a 20% increase in funding over the past three years.  The highest health budget in the history of the State was published in October 2017.  If it was about funding or political accountability, the matter would be solved right now.  To resolve the matter requires the collective working, not just of one part but of all parts, of the health systems.</p><p>Let me put it in context, as Senator Colm Burke rightly said.  This point needs to be re-emphasised.  Life expectancy has increased by two and a half years.  In our country alone, 63,000 people go through outpatient departments and 23,000 go through accident and emergency departments.  There are 16,000 day case procedures, along with inpatient activity.  What is our mortality rate?  There is increasing staffing and an increasing health budget, and HIQA is doing its job in terms of increasing standards.  We are making progress.  We are not regressing, in terms of health expenditure.  We are actually increasing health expenditure.  Whether in terms of primary care under the previous Government or this Government, more primary care units have been opened.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, is in the Gallery about to speak on another matter.  This is the Minister who has increased the funding for disability and for social care.  One should not come in here and state Government is not doing X or Y.</p></speech>

There is a Government plan on health.  There is increased investment.  There is an increase in staffing and there is a restoration of pay.  What we must do now is commit ourselves further in the face of increased demand to see how we can make the health system deliver more for people, whether it is in the case of investment in increased intensive care beds or whether it is in the case of organ donation, the model of which this Government is changing.  Under the previous Government, the health committee that I chaired held hearings on that issue and produced a report.  Some Members of this House did not agree with it.  There is investment beginning to take place from regression and let us not say there is nothing being done when there is.</p> <p>Senator Ardagh raised the issue of housing.  I would be happy to have the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, come to the House in regard to the issue of housing.  Once again, we are seeing progress being made, although I accept it is slow progress.  There is progress being made in terms of investment, in terms of the houses being constructed and in terms of Government commitment of prioritising the social housing need of our people.  That is a fact, not an opinion.  Multi-annual funding and the highest budget in the history of the State for housing were delivered in the most recent budget.  This is fact, not fiction.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I accept progress will be slow but we cannot come out of a crash and start building houses again at the rate we should have been building them.  Equally, there is an obligation and duty on the banks, the construction sector and the Government with local authorities to make sure we expedite the building of social housing units.<br/><br/>Senators Boyhan, Burke and O'Reilly raised the issue of agriculture and fodder.  I welcome the remarks by the Minister, Deputy Creed, yesterday at the IFA AGM regarding a transport subsidy for farmers affected by the fodder crisis.  There will be a debate in the House next week on agriculture and Members can contribute to it.  <br/><br/>Senator Boyhan also raised the issue of <i>The Irish Times</i>political digest and the use of windbagging by Members of the House.  We could all perhaps be accused of that.  I will make the point on a serious level.  We can have robust debate and disagreements but it is the prerogative of every Member of the House to come in here and raise a matter of extreme importance on the Order of Business.  That is what the Order of Business is about.  It is about Members raising matters of importance on behalf of constituents, communities or on their own behalf; it is not about windbagging.  It is about being able to come in here and articulate a viewpoint on behalf of citizens and communities.  It is important.  Senator Boyhan is right.  There is an element within the media who are now starting on a very slow race to the bottom while commenting on what we do.  I will give the example of the political tracker on the eighth amendment.  One can track what one's political representative is saying or doing.  That is a very cynical approach to the issue.  It is a substantive issue that requires debate.  I appeal to members of the media who report in this House.  We can have colour pieces but this is about issues being raised by Members.</p></speech>

I am replying to the 22 Members.</p> <p>The issue of Syria is a very important one.  We will have a debate on foreign affairs next week or the week after.  Senator Bacik raised an important matter.  I noted her remarks on the gender pay gap and I am happy to have the Minister come to the House on that.  The Minister replied in the D&aacute;il today to a parliamentary question on the commission.  I noted the Senator's remarks.  I will be happy to have that debate in Government time if we can.</p> <p>Senator Reilly raised the issue of the Army and pensions.  The Minister, Deputy Doherty, has committed to that issue in terms of the restoration and the anomaly.  Equally, in terms of the new GP contract and the FEMPI measures, the Minister, Deputy Harris, is committed to their reversal.  </p> <p>Senators Horkan, Noone and Paddy Burke raised the issue of recycling our plastics in China.  I agree with all of them on the issue.  It is a matter that will not go away.  It requires urgent action at European and national level.  As Senator Horkan and Burke said, the issue of the sourcing of the product in China is one it is important to get right.  As Senator Horkan said, the Minister, Deputy Naughten, has set up a recycling ambassador programme with 650 workshops across the country.  The issue of education is important for us as a State because if one looks at the figures for contamination of the dry recyclable bin, it is around 38% or 28%, which is a huge figure.  The principle behind the Waste Reduction Bill is one we all subscribe to but I am happy for the Minister to come to the House to have the debate the Senators require.  </p> <p>I join Senator Craughwell in condemning the abuse on social media of any Member of the House whatever his or her viewpoint.  We are all subjected to it irrespective of who we are and there must be a certain level of decorum and respect on any forum of debate.  I do not support the trolling of Senator Noone by outside of the State groups from Massachusetts who have been advised to intervene in the debate.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Irrespective on one's viewpoint, Senator Noone has shown herself to be a very competent and professional Chair of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, as she has been as a Member of this House having been elected on a number of occasions.  No Member of the House should be subjected to the abuse she has received in recent weeks.</p><p>Senator Craughwell also raised the very important issue of our national flag.  I wish Sergeant Major O'Callaghan well in his retirement.  The raising and lowering of the national flag is important.  There should be adherence to criteria regarding the standard and quality of the flag on public buildings.</p><p>Senators Devine and Noone raised the issue of the digital commissioner.  Before Christmas the Taoiseach stated that he was not proceeding with the appointment of the digital commissioner as of now.  He called on the technology companies to be more proactive and that is as much as I know.  Perhaps Senators Devine and Noone might raise the issue as a Commencement matter to get it addressed.</p><p>I join Senator Colm Burke in welcoming the creation of the 48,000 new jobs and the fact that more people are back in work in our country today.  Like him, I hope that the recommendations from the Ombudsman's report on the treatment abroad scheme will be implemented.  I know it is a serious and complex issue.  It goes back to people being able to access treatment.  I heard remarks attributed to Mr. John Hennessy of the HSE this morning on the radio.  I certainly hope the Department of Health and the HSE take seriously the Ombudsman's report and implement it.</p><p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh, who had to leave, made reference to the distressing story of the young child in Carraroe.  I do not have the information to hand.  Certainly there are protocols that need to be followed.  I suggest he raise this as a Commencement matter.  I would be happy to have the issue taken back to the Minister and the HSE.</p><p>Senator Swanick raised the very important issue of the transformation that took place as a consequence of the sitting of the First D&aacute;il in 1919 and the legislation around the declaration of independence Bill.  I would be happy to liaise with the Senator afterwards on the progression of the Bill.</p><p>Senator Coffey raised the issue of the commission of investigation into Bill Kenneally.  I know the Senator has spoken and written to the Minister for Justice and Equality.  It is a very serious matter and one on which the victims, who very bravely came forward, deserve to have answers.  It is unacceptable to have any delay in justice or any collusion in the obstruction of justice by anybody.  In this matter we must support the victims.  I know the Senator has been very proactive in this matter.  I would be very happy to have the Minister come to the House.  I know from talking to the Minister and listening to the Taoiseach's remarks on it, that the Government is committed to uncovering the truth as to what happened.</p><p>Senator Murnane O'Connor raised the issue of the data protection Bill.  I am not aware of the transcript of the work in the committee, other than what she said today.  We have to be very careful and very proactive on the matter.  As we all know, increasing numbers of young people are engaging on social media.  It is a fact of modern life that social media and the digital world are becoming more prevalent and accessible at a younger age for people.  We need to see action on it.</p><p>Senator Kieran O'Donnell raised the issue of Limerick.  I think I have addressed the issue of bed capacity that he commented on.</p><p>Further to what Senator Richmond said, I would be happy for the Minister, Deputy Ross, to come to the House on the provision of public transport in south Dublin.  The point he makes in the context of Sandyford is that it is disheartening that people have to go four or five stops away from the city centre to be able to get on the Luas.  That is a matter for the Luas management, Dublin City Council and the Minister to come together on.  I will have the debate at an early opportunity.</p><p>I congratulate Senator Richmond and his wife on the birth of Luke Thomas, who I know has brought them great joy and happiness.  I wish him and his new family every success and joy.</p><p>I am very pleased the Seanad committee on Brexit has been given an extension to its work thanks to the work of the Seanad CPP.  It is important that Brexit features prominently in this House and I am happy to do that.</p><p>Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh raised the issue of the work of F&aacute;ilte Ireland in the provision of tourism.</p></speech>
