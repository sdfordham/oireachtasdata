She had an horrific childhood, with horrors we can only imagine and which we have heard of through the years about the Magdalen laundries.  She protected her small sister and got out of there at the age of 16, never to return.  She married happily and has children of her own.  She is blind.  She asked her children to never allow her back into institutional care.  Unfortunately, this is what is being offered by the wonderful staff at St. James's Hospital, who have cared for Mary.  They have said she will probably need institutional care as opposed to home care.  She wants to go home and she is familiar with that environment, given her disability of being blind.  She had a wonderful life going in and out of social events, having hairdos and being in her local community.  She was a very independent woman.</p> <p>Since the news was broken last week by the staff in the hospital, she has experienced extreme distress.  She is crying and cannot eat.  She just wants her wishes to be fulfilled in that she can be cared for at home with whatever time she has left.  She needs more than the average home care package.  I know there are difficulties with these packages but I plead for the Minister of State to work with the other Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, on this and meet the family.  We should look at the benefit to the State, as the cost of hospital bed stay is approximately &euro;6,000 per week, the cost of residential care could be up to &euro;2,000 per week and the cost of a home care package is significantly lower.</p> <p>I would like a commitment from the Ministers of State, including Deputy Finian McGrath, who is aware of this, to meet the family and work out the best option in order to fulfil her request for whatever time this woman has left.  We need to have compassion and empathy and we must act in the best interests and wishes of Mary.</p></speech>

She referred to a particular case.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Jim Daly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2328"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2328&amp;amp;pid=JimDaly&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I believe that it would be inappropriate to discuss an individual's circumstances in public in the Seanad.  I appreciate this is a distressing time for the individual.  However, I have been advised that the HSE is working closely with the family and that a range of resources is needed which are difficult to source.</p><p>The HSE has operational responsibility for planning, managing and delivering home and other community-based services for older people.  In addition to the mainstream home help service, which offers support for personal care and help with domestic chores, enhanced home care is provided through home care packages.  All those applying for home care are assessed and provided with a service, if appropriate, as soon as possible having regard to their assessed needs and availability of resources.  Priority is given to people due to be discharged from acute hospitals who are in a position to return home with supports.  However, the resources available for home care services, while significant, are limited and, with the increase in our elderly population, demand is growing year on year.  In budget 2018, a further &euro;37 million has been made available for older people's services, comprising &euro;5 million in funding in 2017 and &euro;32 million next year, to further strengthen supports for older people, particularly to facilitate speedier discharge from acute hospitals over the winter period.  A significant proportion of this additional funding will go towards home care services.  There will always be a cohort of people for whom residential nursing home care provides the best option to meet their health care needs.  The nursing homes support scheme continues to be the main pathway through which most people enter residential care.  The scheme will continue to be a key support ensuring that older people have access to high-quality care in a location of their choosing.  Improving home care services in order that people can live with confidence, dignity and security in their own homes for as long as possible is a key commitment of the Government.  Home supports are crucial to helping older people, and indeed people of all ages, with particular care needs to remain where they want to be, at home in the surroundings with which they are most familiar and comfortable.  The Government is planning to establish a new statutory home care scheme and a system of regulation for home care services.  The Department is currently engaged in a detailed process to progress these issues.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and I launched a public consultation process on the financing and regulation of home care in July of this year.  The public consultation is just the start of the broader process of engagement by the Department with interested individuals, groups and service providers on the future of home care.  The Government is committed to progressing the development of a regulatory and funding model for home care services as quickly as possible, though I should point out that it is a complex undertaking and will require a significant amount of detailed preparation.</p></speech>

Her daughter lives with her, other daughters and sons live in the vicinity and they already have made alterations to their homes to accept their mother home for whatever time she has left.  Will the Minister of State give a commitment that he will meet the family, who are sitting in the Gallery here today, and try to come up with a package that is suitable for all?</p></speech>

I think the Senator knows that.  As a Minister of State, I do not decide, and nor does the Senator, about resources.  That is not a decision for us.  I manage the Department from a macro level but individual resources are administered by the HSE.  It would not be appropriate for me as Minister of State to direct the HSE as to what families should get the resources that are available.  That is a matter for the HSE.</p></speech>

It is brief.  I am raising this issue on behalf of public representatives in Athy, County Kildare.  I have some claim to fame there in that my family is originally from there and is in business and in the commercial life of the town itself in Duke Street.  I know it well.  As I am there on a weekly basis, I am very familiar with County Kildare and with Athy in particular.  It was once a very successful market town and a particularly attractive town.  It is served by wonderful public transport because there is a train service there.  It is a town that from the 1960s right up to the present has seen a diminishing of employment and economic activity.  However, it has great prospects being so near to Dublin and there is a great potential future in respect of the provision for the Athy ring road.  My understanding is that An Bord Plean&aacute;la has now given the go-ahead.  There were planning issues and difficulties but they have been resolved.  Kildare County Council is keen to get on with this project.  People want to see this road put in as quickly as possible, subject to the available finances.  They want to know where this project is on the priority list for the Minister's capital programme in the context of the town's renewal and revitalisation and in respect of capitalising on its potential.  It is an important hub for people doing business and living there and it has good transport connections.  We are trying to find out what is the status of the ring road in the grand scheme of things and what sort of funding has been identified.  Where is the priority in getting this initiative and this road up and running?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-11-29a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017112900002#B00600"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this important subject.  Although I get an enormous number of requests of this sort as Topical Issues in the D&aacute;il and as Commencement matters here, it does matter.  It would be wrong for me to say that when the Senator raises matters of this sort, they are disregarded, disposed of or ignored or that we are going through the motions.  There are hundreds and perhaps thousands of roads that potentially could be brought to my attention but when they are, it does make an impact, not just on me but on the Department.  It puts the issue immediately on the radar.  What Senator Boyhan is doing today is useful and I hope will be beneficial in sorting out the problem of traffic congestion in Athy.</p> <p>The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is a statutory function of the local authority in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  Works on such roads are a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of projects to be funded from these moneys is a matter for each local authority.  Ireland has just under 100,000 km of road in its network and the maintenance and improvement of national, regional and local roads places a substantial financial burden on local authorities and on the Exchequer.  The national financial position meant there were very large reductions in Exchequer funding available for roads expenditure after the financial crisis.  Consequently, the focus has had to be on maintenance and renewal, rather than major new improvements in recent years and I envisage that this emphasis on maintaining the assets will continue into the next capital plan period.  The Building on Recovery capital plan 2016-2021 and the capital plan review allocations mark a significant step in terms of restoring funding to the levels needed to maintain the road network in a steady-state condition and allowing for some investment in road improvement schemes.  The Athy southern distributor road is one of the improvement projects designed to address bottlenecks on the road network included in the capital plan.  Following An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s approval, to which the Senator referred, of the project in October, the next stage is for Kildare County Council to do the detailed project design and to prepare the contract documents.  Under the Department&rsquo;s funding programme for the regional and local road improvement projects included in the capital plan, it is anticipated that the main construction contract for the Athy project will start in mid-2020.  It is hoped that it will be completed, I hope this answers the question, by 2022.  It is likely that some advance works contracts will be undertaken in 2018 and 2019 in advance of the main contract.  In addition, land purchase will proceed.  </p> <p>That should give the Senator the type of timetable we are thinking about, barring any upsets which we do not anticipate now that An Bord Plean&aacute;la has gone through the process.  </p></speech>

It has been helpful as it gives a focus and an indicative timeline.  The local council and people living there are keen to know and at least there is no ambiguity now.  We have an indicative timeline for it and in respect of the role of Kildare County Council.  When one talks to a council it can say one thing while one hears another from the Minister.  We at least have the basis for something now and I want to thank the Minister for dealing with that.</p></speech>

T&aacute; m&eacute; s&aacute;sta c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute; faoi sc&eacute;im na gc&uacute;nt&oacute;ir&iacute; teanga agus t&aacute; c&uacute;pla ceisteanna simpl&iacute; agam faoin sc&eacute;im.</p> <p>As the Minister of State will know from recent parliamentary questions submitted by my colleague, Deputy Dara Calleary, this is an issue which is affecting primary schools in Gaeltacht areas.  It is my understanding that the objective of the c&uacute;nt&oacute;ir&iacute; teanga scheme is to reinforce Irish as a spoken language among young people in the Gaeltacht.  Schools have been fortunate to have the opportunity to have native Irish speakers visit on a daily basis to give their expertise in spoken Irish to the children.  Many of the schools feel that this is a vital cog in their wheels.  Two organisations, Muintearas Teoranta and Oidhreacht Chorca Dhuibhne Teoranta, manage the scheme on behalf of the Department and deliver it, for the most part, through the network of Gaeltacht primary schools.  </p> <p>The school about which I have been contacted is scoil n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Dubh Thuama in Erris.  This school has availed of the c&uacute;nt&oacute;ir&iacute; teanga scheme in the past and is very eager to have it reinstated in the school.  Last June the school signed up to the new Department of Education and Skills policy for Gaeltacht schools, that all subjects would continue to be taught through Irish and would continue to be adhered to in the junior classrooms.  In other words, junior and senior infant classes would be immersed fully in the Irish language.</p> <p>Unfortunately, when September allocations came around scoil n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Dubh Thuama was not included in the scheme and the school has not been briefed on why it was not chosen.  Following on from a response to a parliamentary question issued to Deputy Dara Calleary, it is clear that an allocation of &euro;551,830 was made in order to facilitate the provision of the scheme to the same schools that participated in the scheme in 2016-17.  I find it hard to understand, as does the school in question, why the schools from the 2016-17 scheme were automatically returned to the 2017-18 scheme and no other applications were accepted.  The school is also very confused by the fact that three out of the seven schools that also signed up to the new Department of Education and Skills policy for Gaeltacht schools were not allocated funding from the c&uacute;nt&oacute;ir&iacute; teanga scheme while schools that have not signed up to the policy have been given allocations.</p> <p>I ask the Minister of State to clarify the qualifying criteria for the provision of a language assistant as part of the c&uacute;nt&oacute;ir&iacute; teanga scheme.</p></speech>

Under the scheme, c&uacute;nt&oacute;ir&iacute; teanga or language assistants, who are fluent Irish speakers, provide support to Gaeltacht schools in order to further support language acquisition and enrichment opportunities for school age children within the school setting.</p> <p>Gabhaim m'aitheantas leis na daoine a bh&iacute;onn ag obair in achan scoil f&aacute; choinne a ngealltanas don teanga fosta.  I would like to acknowledge the commitment and dedication to the language shown by all of the people who are working on these schemes.  The focus of the scheme is on activities that contribute primarily to the enrichment and acquisition of language opportunities including storytelling, rhymes, small plays, games and so forth rather than learning opportunities in the context of the curriculum.  T&aacute; na daoine ag obair ar ruda&iacute; go neamhfhoirmi&uacute;il, that is, the informal aspects of learning.  This practical support greatly assists participant schools in their efforts to create such learning opportunities and helps to underpin the Irish language as the foremost community and family language in Gaeltacht areas.  Caithfear a r&aacute; go bhfuil na daoine ag &uacute;s&aacute;id na teanga achan l&aacute; sa scoil i mbeala&iacute; neamhfhoirmi&uacute;il.  For those who use it every day in an informal setting, it is of great benefit to their learning experience and their joy and love for the language.  The overall measure is being implemented in support of the implementation of the 20-year strategy for the Irish language as it relates to the Gaeltacht.  </p> <p>In order to qualify for recognition under sc&eacute;im na gc&uacute;nt&oacute;ir&iacute; teanga, which is administered on behalf of my Department by Muintearas Teoranta and Oidhreacht Chorca Dhuibhne Teoranta, schools must be situated in a Gaeltacht area and operate through the medium of Irish.  The scheme is currently operating in 107 Gaeltacht schools and 93 language assistants are engaged in delivering the scheme.</p> <p>Funding of &euro;784,442 has been approved for 2017-18.  Bh&iacute; an uimhir ch&eacute;anna i gceist f&aacute; choinne 2016-17.  From this allocation, t&aacute; &euro;548,613 ceadaithe do Mhuintearas Teoranta, at&aacute; ag obair sna Gaeltachta&iacute; i nD&uacute;n na nGall, Maigh Eo, Gaillimh, agus i R&aacute;th Chairn agus Baile Ghib i gContae na M&iacute; agus t&aacute; &euro;232,629 ceadaithe d'Oidhreacht Chorca Dhuibhne, at&aacute; ag obair i gCiarra&iacute;, Corcaigh agus Port L&aacute;irge.  </p> <p>Buna&iacute;odh Oidhreacht Chorca Dhuibhne Teoranta in 1980 agus t&aacute; s&eacute; i mbun an teanga a spreagadh go dt&iacute; seo.  Oidhreacht Chorca Dhuibhne was established in 1980 and it has been promoting the language to this present day.  Oidhreacht Chorca Dhuibhne Teoranta is a subsidiary of Comharchumann Forbartha Chorca Dhuibhne that operates under the umbrella of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  The organisation is operating from l&aacute;r-ionad forbartha Bhaile an Fheirt&eacute;araigh for which the Department approved grant funding of &euro;1.7 million in 2013.  T&aacute; Muintearas Teoranta ag obair sa phobal ag cur traen&aacute;il ar f&aacute;il.  Is fochomhlacht &eacute; de chuid &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  It works as a subsidiary of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  The organisation's headquarters is in Tir an Fhia, Leitir M&oacute;ir, Contae na Gaillimhe; and it has sub-offices in the Donegal, Mayo and Kerry Gaeltacht areas.  Education is provided to all age groups in the community, from pre-school to adult lifelong learning.  Muintearas Teoranta is working in all aspects of education, training and services for the Gaeltacht community.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Joe McHugh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2018"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2018&amp;amp;pid=JoeMcHugh&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Gabhaim m'aitheantas ar&iacute;s chuig Muintearas Teoranta agus an dream at&aacute; lonnaithe i gCorca Dhuibhne d&aacute; tiomantas thar na blianta, that is, their commitment down through the years to the scheme.

In recent years, these organisations have focused on opportunities offered by communicative modern technology for remote communities.  As matters stand, the demand from Gaeltacht schools to participate in the language assistants scheme is greater than the Department&rsquo;s capacity to meet the demand within the relevant subhead which funds the scheme.  Notwithstanding this challenge, I should point out that in order to further strengthen the scheme in the context of the implementation of the language planning process as set out under the Gaeltacht Act 2012 agus faoin Pholasa&iacute; don Oideachas Gaeltachta 2017-2022, which is being spearheaded by the Department of Education and Skills, my Department intends to undertake a review of the scheme.  Among the issues to be addressed as part of this review will be the qualifying criteria that should apply in the case of schools that are participating in the scheme or that wish to participate in the scheme sa todhcha&iacute;.  This will address the issue raised by the Senator here today. </p><p>The issue of how best to advance the recommendations emerging from the review will be carefully considered in due course in the context of how best to ensure effective support of both the language planning process and the Polasa&iacute; don Oideachas Gaeltachta within na hacmhainn&iacute; at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il, that is, the available resources.  Without prejudice to the outcome of the review, consideration will also need to be given as to how best to address the matter of schools which have, for whatever reason, not yet opted to participate in the scheme being rolled at Gaeltacht schools level by the Department of Education and Skills le taca&iacute;ocht a thabairt don pholasa&iacute;.</p></speech>

I also understand that not all Gaeltacht schools can be facilitated due to the Department's capacity.  However, with regards to scoil n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Dubh Thuama, it is important to realise that it has opted to participate in the scheme in the past but for some reason it has now been excluded.  I know that the Minister of State has visited Erris.  I have met the Minister of State there before.  I encourage him to examine this school in particular.  The Irish language is alive and well in Erris.  We want to nurture it for our kids and the next generation.  I would be grateful for any available feedback in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

The Senator might just seol a r&iacute;omphost.  He might send on a wee email with the details of the specific school and I will certainly follow up on it.  While I would like to see for all Gaeltacht primary schools that it would not be based on a selective process, certain schools are selected due to the financial resources that are available.  I have visited schools and seen the scheme working.  Muintearas Teoranta covers the Donegal Gaeltacht areas.  Consider the resources that are on our doorsteps.  These are people who are not teachers.  They do not need qualifications or PhDs.  However, they have the language and are sharing it with primary schoolchildren in an informal setting, and this is the way to go.</p> <p>I would like every school in the Gaeltacht to be covered by the scheme.  I would also like every school in the country to be covered by it.  Within the review, there will be a linkage with the Department of Education and Skills.  It will take significant resources to do and we cannot bite it all off in one go.  As the Senator says, given Irish is alive and well in Erris and other areas outside the Gaeltacht, we need to approach it in this way.  This is a common-sense way of keeping the language alive and it is absolutely wonderful to see schools embracing the scheme.  I have more of an insight into the work of Muintearas Teoranta because it is based in County Donegal but I want to acknowledge the two organisations for their efforts.  They will be a fundamental part of the review.  On the issue raised by the Senator, we are trying to cover every school eventually but it is subject to resources.</p> <p>Mar fhocal scoir, gabhaim m'atheantas ar&iacute;s leis na daoine at&aacute; ag obair agus at&aacute; p&aacute;irteach sa sc&eacute;im seo agus leis na c&uacute;nt&oacute;ir&iacute; teanga.  T&aacute; siad ag coim&eacute;ad an teanga beo agus in &aacute;it n&iacute;os fearr.  T&aacute; m&eacute; d&oacute;chasach go mbeidh an athbhreithni&uacute; ag dul ar aghaidh sa bhliain &uacute;r.  B'fh&eacute;idir go mbeidh smaoineamh ann achan scoil a bheith cl&uacute;daithe faoin sc&eacute;im seo agus go mbeidh an sc&eacute;im seo ina sc&eacute;im ph&iacute;ol&oacute;tach f&aacute; choinne an t&iacute;r agus f&aacute; choinne scoileanna at&aacute; taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht.</p> <p>T&aacute; tuismitheoir&iacute; ag str&aacute;c&aacute;il.  Parents are struggling.  The children come home from school and not everyone has Irish and is able to speak the language but there is no shortage of love and demand from people who want their children to do it.  We therefore must consider every possible opportunity to encourage them.  A nice Ulster word we use for encouragement is "uchtach".  I learned it from a Connemara man.  We have to provide the resources so that we can be ag spreagadh na daoine and motivating and encouraging them.  This scheme works.  I have seen it working.  T&aacute; an t-&eacute;ileamh ann.  The demand is there and there needs to be an obligation to provide for the school the Senator mentioned in a fair way.  I hope the review will point to the benefits of what is happening, given where we have come from and what it has done and how the language can be grown just by using it daily.</p> <p>We all have had our different experiences learning Irish.  We all have our different stories.  Perhaps we concentrated too much on writing or reading it rather than vocabulary and opportunities to speak the language.  I acknowledge those in this House who are making an effort in this regard.  Every single usher, with their varying degrees of Irish, is using it.  T&aacute; siad ag d&eacute;anamh iarrachta.  T&aacute; na daoine uilig timpeall na t&iacute;re ag d&eacute;anamh a seacht nd&iacute;chill fosta.  Everyone is doing their level best to learn the language by even using just a couple of words.</p> <p>Now this is my final word, that is, mo fhocal scoir.  M&aacute; t&aacute; c&uacute;pla focal n&oacute; l&iacute;ofacht agat sa Ghaeilge, &uacute;s&aacute;id an teanga.  N&aacute; b&iacute; buartha.  Do not be nervous.  N&aacute; b&iacute;odh eagla oraibh fosta.  Do not be afraid of making mistakes - ag d&eacute;anamh bot&uacute;n.  I encourage those in the Seanad to use it.  It happens to a great degree.  Even those with no Irish who cannot string two words together can read it.  Further, they can use the services available to this House.  We have a translation service across the road in Kildare House.  They are a very good team and they are listening to us here today.  They are ready to translate.  They are ready to do the business.  The Senator opened his contribution this morning with a few lines as Gaeilge and should be commended on it.  Three years ago, I was unable to string two words together.  Knowing the value the language can give to us as people, we can grow with the language.  We have a responsibility.  T&aacute; an dualgas orainn uilig.  We have a responsibility don ch&eacute;ad ghl&uacute;in eile -  for the next generation - to hold it.  Our job as legislators is to work on this scheme.  This scheme worked and it will work in the future.  T&aacute; m&eacute; d&oacute;chasach.  Beidh an dearcadh dearfa fosta.  T&aacute; br&oacute;n orm.  I went on a wee bit there.  I got carried away.  I am sorry about that. </p></speech>

We learn this through the Garda Representative Association, GRA, whose members were told last night to go home from their stations.  This essentially gives the green light to criminals to go about their business to the detriment of good citizens.  This is especially worrying as we face into the Christmas period when presents will be left in homes and cars and pick-pocketing in general is on the increase.  Having attended many policing forum meetings in Dublin South-Central, I have seen that among the primary concerns for residents is the lack of policing on the streets; community policing; garda&iacute; on the beat; and garda&iacute; on bikes to deter such crimes as burglaries and assaults.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider reinstating this budget as the cessation of overtime is very much a regressive policing step.</p> <p>I would like to sympathise with the family and friends of the man who died sleeping rough in Ranelagh yesterday, an area that happens to be very close to the constituency office of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  The latest figures for rough sleeping found that, as of 7 November, 184 people were sleeping rough in Dublin city, amounting to a huge 30% increase since April.  The fact that the homelessness crisis is spiralling out of control is a damning indictment of our Government and of the track records of the Ministers responsible.  I  commend the Islamic Cultural Centre in Clonskeagh for opening its doors to those sleeping rough during both Storm Ophelia and the recent cold spell.</p> <p>As we all know, the elephant in the room here is the lack of housing supply, particularly with regard to social and affordable homes.  We have seen no less than six failed housing policies to date, among them the failed development contribution rebate scheme; the failed vacant site levy; the failed vacant homes action plan; the failed local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF; the failed repair and leasing scheme; and last but not least the failed Part V social housing scheme.  More than 120,000 people nationwide are on the housing list.  We need to start thinking bigger and have more ambitious plans because the current rate of building will not so much as scratch the surface of this huge list and issue.  I again call on the Minister to come into the House to address these matters.</p></speech>

Tomorrow, the Supreme Court will sit again on the very important case of NVH <i>v.</i>the Minister for Justice and Equality.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Billy Lawless:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2485"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2485&amp;amp;pid=BillyLawless&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This decision, as I highlighted in this Chamber on 4 October this year, included judgment of profound significance and compassion.  It was delivered by Mr. Justice Donal O'Donnell.  He stated:</p><blockquote>In my view, the point has been reached when it cannot be said that the legitimate differences between an asylum seeker and a citizen can continue to justify the exclusion of an asylum seeker from the possibility of employment.  The damage to the individual's self worth, and sense of themselves, is exactly the damage which the constitutional right seeks to guard against.  The affidavit evidence of depression, frustration and lack of self-belief bears that out.</blockquote><p>The Supreme Court provided a period of six months for the Oireachtas to remedy what it determined to be an unconstitutional state of affairs and that time is up tomorrow.  The court may strike down the absolute prohibition on work for asylum seekers as being repugnant to the Constitution.  When the Minister was before this House, Members were informed that the interdepartmental task force led by his Department would report back in advance of the submissions the State intended to make before the court.  I ask the Leader if he will update the House as to what the Minister intends to tell the Supreme Court tomorrow.  Will asylum seekers have a right to work in this country or will they not?  If so, when and how?  Will legislation be put through these Houses?  The Minister confirmed to this House that adults living in direct provision &quot;will also see their capacity for economic independence enhanced in line with the finding of the Supreme Court&quot;.  How is this to be put into effect?  When the Minister came before the House, he committed to &quot;delivering an international protection system in Ireland that provides for decisions on applications in the shortest possible timeframes&quot;.  If there was a legal or practical limitation upon the amount of time during which an application for asylum status could be processed, particularly now that it appears the undocumented will be given the right to work, this would be a much fairer state of affairs to regularise our asylum process.  In the facts of the Supreme Court case, the undocumented person was in the system for more than eight years, with no entitlement to work.<br/><br/>On another issue, as I have stated previously in this House, how can those of us who advocate for the undocumented Irish abroad, which is a strategic and diplomatic imperative of this Government and previous ones before it, in good conscience ignore what is an even worse state of affairs for the undocumented in Ireland?</p></speech>

I ask for the Minister for Justice and Equality to come into the House to make a statement on what progress has been made to regularise undocumented immigrants in Ireland.

Garda&iacute; were sent home last night from stations after being told that there was no money to pay for them to work.  There is an urgent need for a Supplementary Estimate.  The Garda Representative Association, GRA, described it as an open door for criminals in Dublin.  This cannot be allowed.  I know of people across this city who wish for rain because it will keep young thugs off the streets, yet we are now talking about not having adequate numbers of garda&iacute; on the streets in the capital city over the Christmas period.  This is totally unacceptable.  It is like every gurrier's Christmas present coming together.  It is just not acceptable that the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, would allow the capital city to go unpoliced over the Christmas period.  I propose an amendment to Standing Orders, that the Minister for Justice and Equality should attend this House today.</p></speech>

To say that I am alarmed would be an understatement.  Assistant Commissioner Pat Leahy stated that there would be no overtime in the country between now and Christmas except for work on certain Kinahan gang affairs.  Mr. Leahy seems like an honourable and honest man and I would like to see him move up to Commissioner.  He would be an ideal choice because he tells the truth about what is happening.  It was important that we be alerted to the situation.</p> <p>Mr. Kieran O'Neill of the Garda Representative Association, GRA, spoke on today's "Morning Ireland" and expressed the seriousness of the situation.  To declare an interest, the GRA is my nominating body.  Indeed, it is the nominating body of four Senators.  We must listen to its concerns because it put us here from a nomination point of view.</p> <p>What Mr. O'Neill said was fair and honourable.  He is concerned about what is happening.  Garda&iacute; were sent home from stations last night because there was no overtime.  It is a serious threat to the security and safety of the State and our citizens.</p> <p>Mr. Leahy is the most straightforward and honourable man.  When he talked about Stepaside Garda station, he said that it was not his priority.</p></speech>

I also wish to discuss the policing issue.  It will affect many major urban centres, particularly Dublin.  Garda&iacute; went home yesterday distraught, annoyed and frustrated at the fact that their work regarding the security of the State and its citizens would be compromised.</p> <p>Garda sources have told me that assistant commissioners around the country were told that their budgets for all policing would be cut.  The Minister needs to attend the House today.  I will support any move to bring him in, as these cuts have been greeted with shock by rank-and-file garda&iacute;.  This is an important issue.  We need to know who sanctioned these cuts.</p> <p>Last week, a colleague of mine who owns a jewellery shop in D&uacute;n Laoghaire was beaten over the head by an armed man who had already had his passport confiscated by the Garda and is now on the run.  That shop owner was beaten to a pulp while he was trying to get on with running his business.  There are serious concerns with confidence.  The public demands garda&iacute; on our streets.</p> <p>Today, the 2017 Supplementary Estimates for the public services arrived on my desk.  The Garda is listed on the first page with &euro;44.2 million.  It reads: "Estimate of the amount required in the year ending 31 December 2017, for the salaries and expenses of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na".  The Minister should attend the House today to explain what that means.</p></speech>

If the Taoiseach had not demanded a trawl of the Department, we would not have had this discovery.  I know a little about discovery.  During my many triumphant legal actions, we sought discovery against RT&Eacute; and RT&Eacute; was forced to disclose information, including tape recordings, that destroyed its case.  It had to do it.  I understand it to be a criminal offence not to comply with an order for discovery.  Third, a senior garda met Deputy McGuinness, who is a most honourable man, in a car park in an attempt to influence the business of a committee.</p> <p>Here are three issues in respect of which there should be accountability, and much more so than the political accountability, searching for heads and political jockeying there has been regarding political figures.

The point that we are trying to make is that this is an equal House in the Parliament.  It should be treated so and with the respect that we deserve.  We all have a mandate.  We are all here with the job of holding the Government to account regardless of whether it likes that.  Many times, Ministers of State have been sent here to cover issues on which they have not been fully briefed.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2363"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2363&amp;amp;pid=TrevorOClochartaigh&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Senior Ministers have been sent here to speak on portfolios which are not their own and this is not good enough.  When we have scandals such as we have seen in the past week, which nearly brought the Government down, the least the Taoiseach can do is come into this House and account for his actions.  I give credit to Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, who came in last week, answered questions and took statements.  She was not afraid to come in but I do not know whether the Taoiseach is.  I note that Drew Nelson has made it as far as this House, and Nicola Sturgeon was able to make it here.  We have a &euro;5 million communications unit so perhaps it could send an email to the Taoiseach to tell him how to get here.</p></speech>

The reimbursement process is broken and Ireland is now one of the worst countries in Europe for speed of access to new medications.  Orphan drugs, in particular, are a serious casualty of the process as they are currently assessed through the same mechanism as all pharmaceutical products.  Due to their small numbers, the companies involved enter into negotiations with a weaker hand which, when dealing with the HSE, often means they are left behind.</p> <p>It does not help that a committee to evaluate drugs for rare diseases has yet to be set up, three years after a Government report recommended its establishment.  Senator Reilly launched the national rare diseases plan and I commend him on that but it was back in 2014, 1,247 days ago.  It now has a chairperson but no members and it is not expected to be in place before the first quarter of 2018.  One drug in particular, vimizim, is the first effective treatment for mucopolysaccharidosis and it has thus far given patients a quality of life they would not otherwise have experienced but it will no longer be available after 5 December.  Today I had the honour to meet with Grace McIntyre and her parents Padraig and Barbara, who are in the Visitors Gallery.  This little nine year old girl, who has no life without vimizim, is one of two children in Ireland who are participating in a compassionate programme provided by Biomarin, the pharmaceutical company, but her parents are extremely fearful for her future and are living in limbo, not knowing what will happen to their daughter after 5 December.  Can the Leader imagine how they are facing into Christmas this year?  We need an urgent debate on this matter. </p></speech>

The first is the necessity to have a debate here with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan.  This time last week we on this side of the House were accused of all sorts of things relating to the former Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.  We were accused of skullduggery and there were all sorts of pantomime moves when we asked for accountability.  In fairness to the Minister, she came into the House and we had a debate.  We are respectfully asking for a debate with the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, on the actions he has taken as Minister and on Garda overtime.  In Dublin city, where I live, we had a very successful Garda operation recently when garda&iacute; intercepted what appears to have been a shooting about to take place and they seized some firearms.  The second most senior garda in the city is suggesting that the reopening of Stepaside Garda station is well down his list of priorities and now we hear that Garda overtime has been cancelled for the foreseeable future, which means the situation as regards law and order and policing is quite stark, so a debate with the Minister is warranted.</p> <p>I also want to raise the issue of homelessness, though I know it has been raised before.  In recent days, many people watching the political goings-on would not have been too impressed by how the Oireachtas was brought to the edge of disaster, with a Christmas election threatened.  Two homeless people have died in Dublin in the past week and I believe the total is seven over the past 12 weeks.  The people would want their politicians to engage on this issue with the same level of seriousness as we engaged in the issue relating to the former Minister and T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and the emails in the Department of Justice.  People are literally dying on our streets and I respectfully ask that we come together to have a discussion with the Minister for Housing on the issue of homelessness.  We would not need to be party-political on the issue but we need to treat it with the seriousness it deserves.  The people of Ireland would expect all Members of the Oireachtas to take it as seriously as, if not more seriously than, the issue which convulsed the Houses in recent days.</p></speech>

Anybody who participates in an attempt to destroy the reputation of a decent, honest man deserves everything that is coming to them but Fintan O'Toole writes in <i>The Irish Times</i>today about the subversion of this State by faceless, grey beards who hide behind the political system, namely, the officials of this country.  What do they do when they get caught out?  They retire and take off with their pensions.  We need to investigate the question of ethics.  We have had a senior garda walk out of a job with a pension into a fat job somewhere else in a policing authority, without any accountability for what took place under her stewardship.  We have had similar stories in respect of other civil servants.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

I have five simple questions on what happens to the recommendations of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces following his retirement and as we await for the position to be filled.  A lieutenant colonel's career was destroyed because of a mathematical error and we have failed to find out what happened in that case.  A young captain is waiting for promotion while, again, a recommendation from the ombudsman is rejected.  </p><p>It is time that we opened the veil on the Sir Humphreys that operate in this State.  They are bringing down politicians all over the place.  The Leader may smile but they have taken out one of his Ministers, and if we count the last Government they have taken out two.  They sit back and smile knowing that the Government members are there for a short while but they are there forever.  They have no right to decide what will and will not be released.  How dare they behave the way that they have?  I call on the Leader to ask the Taoiseach to take control of the Department and make it answerable to this House and to the State.</p></speech>

Yesterday, SADAKA held an excellent conference which unfortunately I was only able to attend briefly.  It had contributions from across the political spectrum and all were welcome.  I remind the Leader that I requested a debate on the Palestinian issue, which is more important than ever.  The Palestinian people are calling for us to do what has already been agreed, namely to recognise the State of Palestine.  I implore the Leader to arrange such a debate as soon as possible.</p> <p>To return to the question of bringing the Taoiseach into the House, the previous speaker gave another eloquent reason why we should do so.  Fundamental questions need to be answered.  This House is asking for answers and for the Taoiseach to come before it and provide those answers.  There is a huge puzzle here particularly given that the Taoiseach had the email in question as early as Friday evening or Saturday, yet it took him a further three days to acknowledge what had to happen, namely that the T&aacute;naiste had to resign.  It is pertinent to note that, according to Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, Deputy M&iacute;che&aacute;l Martin had the email on Saturday.  I must ask what was Deputy Martin doing with the Taoiseach for three days after he first knew that the T&aacute;naiste would have to resign.  Was he trying to stich up a deal that would keep the T&aacute;naiste in place until such time as the email was revealed and public opinion recognised that she should step down?  Fianna F&aacute;il has significant questions to answer.  Is this why it does not support our call for the Taoiseach to come to the Chamber?</p></speech>

Threats of fines from the Government do not go far enough.  For over 20 years these banks have been able to hoodwink us and it is not acceptable.  What the banks are doing is wrong.  We all agree on that, across the parties.  Bankers deal in money and they hurt people most in their pockets.  The bankers should be instructed to wipe away debt on their customers' homes as they did on the millions owed by billionaires.  We have no way to bring back lost homes, put marriages back together or bring back deceased loved ones but we can change how the banks behave in the future by hitting them where it hurts and by giving stability to families in the future.  I call the Minister for Finance to come before the House to address this.  I have concerns.  We need to play hardball with these bankers and give families stability.</p></speech>

It is not to diminish the harsh reality faced by people in this city, and across the State and across Ireland in its entirety, as the homelessness crisis continues and we face into the winter months.  Yet it pales into insignificance compared to what the people of Palestine, and especially Gaza, will face this winter.  They will be without electricity, access to health care or the basics that many of us take for granted here.  At all times, but especially as we approach Christmas, we should do our best to express solidarity with the Palestinian people.</p> <p>Solidarity can take many different forms.  It can go from raising it on the floor of Parliament to hosting a public meeting, attending a protest, observing a boycott or informing oneself about what is happening to the people of Palestine and what they are forced to endure.  There is a particular onus on the people of Ireland given our own experience of conflict to share one form of solidarity, which is how we learned to transform our society out of conflict and build reconciliation.  The best expression of solidarity with the Palestinian people is to work and commit ourself to ensuring a just and peaceful settlement for the people there.</p></speech>

The Leader agreed to my request that the debate be extended beyond the original 45 minutes.  We are looking at the allocation of some &euro;64 million next year to the horse and greyhound racing fund.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2261"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2261&amp;amp;pid=BrianODomhnaill&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There are major issues within the greyhound sector.  The Irish Greyhound Board will receive in the region of &euro;307,000 in subvention per week next year.  I ask that sufficient time be granted this evening so all interested Senators can partake in the debate.  More important, I ask that the Minister stay to answer questions.  I am not sure whether this can be facilitated.</p><p>I agree with Senator Gerard Craughwell on the approach of trying to get a political scalp.  It is not the right way to serve our country in the best interest of citizens.  Trying to take someone else out will not improve the accountability of the Government or the governance of our country, nor will it help those who require State services most.  We must fundamentally rethink how we do government and how civil servants respond to requests from Ministers, this House and the D&aacute;il, particularly at a very senior level.  We must remember that the senior civil servants in this jurisdiction are not accountable at the ballot box.  Therefore, serious questions arise over responsiveness, accountability, and the way organisations are managed, controlled and run.</p><p>There is a big question whose answer eludes us all - the question of whether the Department of Justice and Equality has been captured by the senior management within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We can all give our opinion or view.  There is now a requirement, as we approach 100 years of independence, to review our Civil Service and determine whether it is fit for purpose?  Is senior management held to account or not?  This thinking could extend to the local government sector.  In my view, senior management across the local authorities is not held to account by councillors because the latter do not have the power to do so.  Therefore, there is a real need to examine this.</p><p>It is easy to go after a politician, ask another Minister to step down, or go after the current Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charlie Flanagan.  That is not the right approach here.  If we are to do the State some service &mdash; what happened over the weekend certainly did &mdash; we should be looking further than the political system.  We must consider the core realm of responsibility across all Departments, which is at senior civil servant level.</p></speech>

The Senator does not like the facts.  Some 1,400 garda&iacute; were recruited since Templemore was re-opened.  To put matters in context, the overtime budget for the Garda for 2017 is &euro;130 million.  The budget for 2018 provides &euro;100 million for overtime.  The management and utilisation of the resources of the force are a matter for the Garda but, in saying that, it was disturbing and disappointing to hear the remarks that were made this morning.  In that context and considering the gravity of the situation, I am accepting the amendment by Senator Humphreys to invite the Minister to the House this evening.  I will be happy to do so.  I accede to such requests by Members of the House on many occasions.</p> <p>Senators &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and Ardagh raised the very tragic loss of life of two citizens of our State on the streets of Dublin this week.  These two deaths occurred in very difficult and different circumstances.  We should not judge the reasons the people passed away.  It is important to put in context that all of us in this House, irrespective of our political ideologies or views, are committed to having and want to have the issues of homelessness and rough sleeping dealt with and addressed.  That is why Rebuilding Ireland has taken an agency-based, multi-annual funding approach.  It is why the Department, with the Dublin regional authorities, announced, through the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, an additional 200 emergency beds.  Of these, 50 will be permanent.  Equally, it is important to recognise that the Government is taking action through the cold weather initiative, not only in Dublin but also on the streets of Cork, Galway and elsewhere.  It is important to recognise that work is being done.  The deaths are tragic and we should not use them as a political football.  On behalf of the House, we extend our sympathies to all the families who have lost loved ones this week.  We are working on and committed to having the issue addressed.</p> <p>Senator Billy Lawless raised the very important matter of the Supreme Court decision.  It is important to note that the Government has established the interagency task force to examine the implications of the judgment and to put in place an appropriate response and solution by the Government.  As the House knows, earlier this month the Government opted to accept the recommendation to opt into the recast EU reception conditions directive.  In saying that, it is important that we have a debate in the House, as Senators Lawless and &Oacute; Clochartaigh rightly said.</p> <p>Both Senators Lawless and &Oacute; Clochartaigh have raised the issue of the undocumented Irish in America in this House.  It is important that there be a consistent approach.  I fully subscribe to that.  I will be happy to have a debate on it as soon as possible in the House.</p> <p>I want to group the Sinn F&eacute;in contributions on the Taoiseach's appearance in the House.  If people choose to listen to me, I shall reiterate a point I made on a number of occasions.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I do not operate on the basis of misinformation.  I requested that the Taoiseach come to the House, and he has agreed.  It is a matter of finding a suitable date and I have no issue in doing that.  I have never hidden behind a veil of anybody not coming to the House, and the proof of that can be seen today with the Minister, Deputy Humphreys.</p><p>I will not accept the amendment to the Order of Business from the Sinn F&eacute;in Party, not because there is an element of fear or hiding but because it is about finding a suitable date for the Taoiseach to come to the House.  When I have arranged that, the Taoiseach will be here before us, as the former Taoiseach was before he retired from office.  I will work to have that done before the Christmas recess, if possible, or early in the new year.  We have been in contact with the Office of the Taoiseach about a range of issues, not just the events of this week.</p><p>As regards the single transferable Sinn F&eacute;in speech, the Sinn F&eacute;in Senators can come back with another amendment or reply tomorrow.  I understand the need to make political charges and engage in opportunism.  That is what Senators try to do sometimes, and I accept that.</p><p>As a former Deputy and current Senator, I am very much aware of the importance of and need for Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  As Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell said last week, we should not ape the D&aacute;il.  Constitutionally, we have a different set of requirements and duties, and it is important to recognise that.  People should familiarise themselves with the Constitution.  I have no issue bringing Members and Ministers into the House to discuss a range of issues. </p><p>If Members come in to make political charges, that is fine.  We have lost a T&aacute;naiste and Minister yesterday on the basis of pure political opportunism by Sinn F&eacute;in, which brought down and Executive in the North and will not go into government in the South.  The directive for the budget in the North allocated money to increase pay for front-line health staff, but the money cannot be spent because there is no Minister to sign a directive.  Sinn F&eacute;in comes to the House purporting to represent workers' rights when that is happening to workers in the North.  That is the reality.</p></speech>

It is incumbent upon the banks to work with everybody to ensure that no family is removed from their home.  It is important that we all work to ensure that there is a resolution which allows families to remain in their homes.  We had a debate on tracker mortgages last week.

I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy John Paul Phelan, to the Chamber.  I also welcome the delegation from Monaghan.  I wish in particular to mention the three councillors from the Carrickmacross and Castleblaney areas, P&aacute;draig, P.J. and Aidan, as well as the former Ceann Comhairle, Dr. Rory O'Hanlon.  Deputy Niamh Smyth is also present.  I welcome all those from Carrickmacross who are present.</p> <p>This amendment to the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978 is a very important amendment to existing legislation which enables a tenant under certain prescribed conditions the opportunity to buy out the freehold of their premises.  I am delighted to be able to introduce this Bill which seeks to amend sections 9 and 10 of the Act.  I know this will be very welcomed in my constituency because it directly affects a lot of businesses on the west side of Carrickmacross and indeed many other towns and cities throughout the country.  The need for the amendment has arisen from a Supreme Court ruling in 2012.  A recent documentary produced and edited by Pat Byrne of Carraige Productions and presented by Michael Fisher highlighted the issues which arose from very protracted litigation between the O'Gorman family of Carrickmacross and what is known locally as the Shirley Estate.  The documentary covers the story of Gus O'Gorman, a local supermarket owner, to buy out his freehold, and the struggles he had which went through every level of the courts from the County Registrar all the way to the Supreme Court.  Gus and his con Cathal are here with us today.  I pay tribute to the O'Gorman family for their huge effort and commitment to the issue.  Part of the reason we are here today is because of them.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Robbie Gallagher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2471"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It highlighted the problem that any remaining tenant with a qualifying lease would have, on the face of it, in buying the freehold under the existing legislation.  Tenants who had thought they could buy out the freehold in the premises they occupy would find they may not be able to do so in light of the interpretation of the Supreme Court in respect of two key elements, namely, what buildings were involved and what constituted a "predecessor in title".  This amendment will seek to resolve these issues and enable a tenant to go forward and buy out the lease, giving such people business certainty to be able to reinvest and grow businesses.  It will also confirm the original intention of both Houses of the Oireachtas, which was to confer rights on tenants who had long occupation of premises and had developed such premises at their own expense.</p><p>The interest created by the documentary referred to earlier has brought the landlord and tenant issue sharply into focus.  I give special credit to Mr. Pat Byrne, who is responsible for that documentary.  He put his heart and soul into what was a very impressive piece of work.  In no small way did it contribute to us being here today.  It highlighted the fact that a number of lawyers, both in the academic world and in practice, had serious reservations regarding the judgment of the Supreme Court.  Arising from a meeting that was set up with Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Callaghan by the former Ceann Comhairle, Dr. Rory O&rsquo;Hanlon, Mr. Byrne introduced Professor John Wylie, the leading academic on all matters relating to land law and who featured in the documentary, to Mr. Tony Donagher, a Carrickmacross-based solicitor, who was also interviewed in the documentary.  Together, over the summer, they have provided the draft Bill I am introducing today.</p><p>I thank my fellow Oireachtas Members from all parties, including the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, and Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in for their support with this proposed amendment.  I also thank the county councillors from the Carrickmacross and Castleblayney municipal district, some of whom are here today.  I also mention Deputies Brendan Smith and Niamh Smyth.  Many other people have helped to get this Bill to where it is today and I thank them sincerely for their work in this regard.</p><p>I hope this Bill passes through here successfully today in order that businesspeople in Carrickmacross on the west side of the street will finally get total control of their buildings and put their minds at rest in order that they can continue in the knowledge of business certainty in future.</p></speech>

J. and Aidan to the House, as well as the former Ceann Comhairle, Dr. Rory O'Hanlon, and Deputy Niamh Smyth.  The O'Gorman family have really been committed to making good the law as it relates to ground rents.</p> <p>Ground rent is still paid in parts of the country and we are very familiar with the Marquess of Ely's estate, Lord Lucan's estate and the estate we are discussing, the Shirley estate.  It is a payment for the ground on which a property is built.  Generally, the freehold titles in Ireland tend to be owned by local authorities, but in certain areas around the country we have these miscellaneous estates left over from before independence.</p> <p>The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act 1978 gives a lessee a general right to acquire a fee simple interest.  This is an important right for many reasons.  Lending institutions, for example, will not give loans on a leasehold property that has fewer than 70 years left to run.  In other words, a leasehold title with fewer than 70 years left is not considered good marketable title.  House owners eliminate this as a problem generally by acquiring the freehold.  It is very easy to do this with local authorities, but it is much more difficult when one comes across more difficult landlords that own the reversionary interests.  Uncertainty has followed the Supreme Court case highlighted by my colleague, and this gives rise to the need for the amendments contained in this Bill.  The Supreme Court decision has been widely criticised by both academics and legal practitioners.  Mr. Wylie, the leading expert on land law has described the decision as "odd" and "surprising".  Nonetheless, the position needs to be rectified and that needs to be done through amending legislation, which is before the House today.</p> <p>In 2012, the Supreme Court interpreted two sections of the Act in such a manner as to hamper severely the ability of leaseholders, such as the O'Gormans in the Gallery today, to secure the compulsory sale of the fee simple.  The interpretations related to what buildings were involved and what constituted a predecessor in title.  The two amendments provided for in the Bill specifically address these two matters.  The amendments sought in this Bill will confirm the original intention of the Oireachtas, which was to confer rights on tenants who had long occupation of premises and who had developed those premises at their own expense.  The Supreme Court decision has created great uncertainty, particularly for business owners who are reluctant to invest in their premises as it is unclear whether they would be successful in an application to acquire compulsorily the fee simple in the premises.</p></speech>

I support the Private Members' Bill from my colleague, Senator Robbie Gallagher, and congratulate him on bringing the Bill before the House.  I welcome in the Gallery Mr. Gus O'Gorman and his son, Cathal, who were instrumental in bringing this to the fore.  They fought very bravely in the Supreme Court.  It is quite amazing these ground rents still exist nearly 100 years on from achieving our constitutional freedom.  When I was in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in 1982, I discovered the GPO was owned by some British landlord, which was quite amazing at the time.  I believe it has been bought out since, or at least I hope it was bought out before the 1916 ceremonies.  I also welcome my former colleague, Dr. Rory O'Hanlon, a former Minister and Ceann Comhairle.  It has been 30 years since he and I served in the Department of Health.  It was between 1987 and 1989 and we worked very well in that Department in a very difficult period.  I also welcome to the House P&aacute;draig, P. J. and Aidan, as well as Deputy Niamh Smyth, who is from the Monaghan area.</p> <p>I am quite hopeful the Minister will welcome and support this amending Bill, which is very practical.  It demonstrates new politics, in a way, as we can bring forward a Private Members' Bill and get support from the Government side.  In the past this would have been opposed, as it was with my Registration of Wills Bill.  I hope this might be brought forward as well with this great new relationship, which is very positive.  I am sure Dr. O'Hanlon is particularly surprised to see this new politics in action.  It is a true indication of how active it is when we see such goodwill on the opposite side in this regard.</p></speech>

I also welcome the opportunity debate this Bill.  I commend the Bill's sponsor, Senator Robbie Gallagher, on bringing it to the House because it is an example of how the Seanad can work together to identify problems and barriers felt by our citizens, bringing forth legislation that we can work on.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paudie Coffey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2237"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2237&amp;amp;pid=PaudieCoffey&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As Senators are aware, legislation is not always perfect when first presented and I am sure the Bill before us is not perfect.  I come from a locality, Portlaw, County Waterford, where people have experienced many difficulties with the transfer of lands and ownership issues arising from ground rents and the problems they present.  With the greatest respect to the property rights of landlords and others, it is important in a modern society to have legal mechanisms that allow businesses, residents and citizens to transact business in an efficient manner without encountering expensive court challenges and problems such as those experienced by the O'Gorman family.  I, too, acknowledge the members of the O'Gorman family and the delegation present in the Visitors Gallery who have, I expect, provided the motivation for this legislation.  I also think of the many citizens around the country who have experienced similar problems.  I support the Bill for this reason and my party is generally supportive of it.</p><p>I will leave it to the Minister of State to set out the detailed reasons we will not oppose the Bill as it stands.  I am sure he will outline any amendments or clarifications that may be required to progress it to the next Stage.  This is an example of how Senators from all sides can work together.</p><p>Senator Leyden referred to new politics.  The newer Senators may be less adversarial that Senator Leyden and others with whom we have had many a row.  It is good that we can work together to progress legislation in a positive manner.  I recognise the work done by various people.  I thank Senator Gallagher for acknowledging the work done by the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys.  I also acknowledge the work done by my party colleague, Councillor Aidan Campbell, who is present in the Gallery.  It is important that councillors provide feedback to the House on the problems experienced by their electors.</p><p>It is up to the Minister and Government of the day, in this case, the Minister of State, Deputy John Paul Phelan, to respond to the legislation.  I hope the Government will introduce amendments that will strengthen the Bill and further the objectives of its proposers and sponsors. </p><p>While this is not the Minister of State's area of responsibility, all of us are aware of the problems caused by old title deeds when older properties are being transferred, purchased or transacted.  In such circumstances, people submit applications to the land registry office.  While the land registry system is extremely good for those who are in the system and having their file dealt with, there is a long waiting time to have files processed.  This is an important issue, although it may fall within the remit of another Department.  I ask the Minister of State to use his good offices in this respect, given that the Bill is before the Houses and there is a new focus on those seeking to transact business in a legal and proper way who encounter barriers because old legislation needs to be updated or as a result of outdated bureaucracy related to ground rents and title deeds.  It is important that resources are invested in land registry offices to clean up title deeds and allow people to transact business.</p><p>I refer to the example of a community group in my local area which wishes to renovate a property.  Although it qualifies for State grants, the old title deeds to the property have raised issues regarding leaseholds and ground rents which need to be clarified.  This is a complex area with which, I suspect, solicitors must often wrangle.  I mean no disrespect to solicitors who must do their job and I know the Acting Chairman, Senator Noone, is a solicitor.  These types of issues cause untold frustration for people who are trying to progress property transactions.  We need to modernise the processing system for property in the land registry.  </p><p>I commend Senator Gallagher on his Bill, which the Fine Gael Party supports and will not oppose on Second Stage.  The Minister of State will speak in detail on some clarifications and amendments the Government will introduce. </p></speech>

Cuireann muid f&aacute;ilte roimh an mBille seo sa Seanad inniu, &aacute;fach.</p> <p>I pay tribute again to the work of the Shirley Tenants Action Group in Carrickmacross which has been active on this issue.  The initial case taken by Mr. Gus O'Gorman many years ago highlighted the need for new legislation to amend the 1978 Act.  Such legislation has been promised in Fianna F&aacute;il Party manifestos since that time.  My colleague, Teachta Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, has consistently asked, almost since entering the D&aacute;il in 1997, when a Bill would be published.  It is hard to believe the economic development of part of Carrickmacross is being held up by an absentee landlord who is currently basking in the Isle of Man.</p> <p>Last year, it was revealed that the State was paying ground rent to landlords such as the Earl of Pembroke for buildings on Merrion Square and the Duke of Leinster who owns land where the National Library of Ireland is located.  These ground rents, which are a legacy of our colonial past, are also known as leaseholds.  The State's ground rent bill for Iveagh House, in which the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade presides, is paid to an absentee landlord.  The same applies to Dublin Castle.  In these years of the centenary we are perpetuating a system that is a hangover of colonialism.  The money involved is relatively small.  The ground rent for Iveagh House is a mere &euro;257, while the ground rent for the Four Courts is a mere &euro;200 and the bill for Dublin Castle is only &euro;7.  However, there are 250,000 ground rents in the State which have an impact on individual home owners who wish to sell their homes but must require the freehold to do so.</p> <p>This is not simply a question of being hostile to English landlords.  The majority of ground leases are on private households, which means they are paid by people who own their home but do not always own the land on which it is built.  The formula for the new ground rent per annum is computed on the basis of the open value rental value of the house.  Many of those who find themselves in this invidious position are elderly and have no income other than their pension. </p> <p>Many Irish developers built houses before 1978.  Sisk, for example, continues to collect ground rents from a large number of households in Dublin.  Many of the properties in question have leases of 999 years and many of those who wish to buy out the ground rent complain of high fees such as search and lawyer fees which can put them off engaging in the process in the first instance.  No one knows the true position because many householders who owe ground rents are older people who are afraid to speak publicly and do not wish to refuse to pay.  Many fear that when the lease ends they will not be able to afford to buy out the lease or pay the substantial increase in ground rent which may be demanded.</p> <p>I hope the Bill succeeds in highlighting the vulnerable nature of tenancy in general.  Ground rent landlords demand money for nothing.  They are parasites gorging themselves on the sweat and tears of ordinary working people.  They have no place in a just society and it is to our shame that we have allowed this system to persist for so long. </p> <p>Another illustration of the peculiar attitude of successive Governments to landlordism is the reluctance to tackle landlords in the private rented sector.  The demands of tenants in the private rented sector in recent years, namely, a fair rent and security of tenure, do not differ significantly from the demands made by peasant farmers in the 19th century.  It is not, as we often told, a question of balancing the rights of tenants and landlords as the home of the former is merely the business interest of the latter.  I note that even on the Order of Business this morning the issue of evictions was raised by Senator Murnane O'Connor.  An eviction of a person today is no different from the reality depicted in the iconic photographs of evictions taken during the late 1880s, except today we do not see the faces of the evicted and their voices are not recorded.  The Government certainly does not hear them.  </p> <p>Davitt was guided by the motto, "Let justice be done though the heavens fall".  I doubt he would be impressed by the propensity of successive Governments to prostrate themselves in the interests of unfettered landlordism.  It is time to take up Davitt's fight again and ensure justice is done.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports this legislation.  Perhaps in the days ahead we will also discuss the claims made by landlords who are not resident in the State to our rivers, lakes, mineral supplies and other natural resources.</p></speech>

The apparently unanimous support for the Bill across the House shows its importance.  The point that often is lost is that while this is not a big headline-getter and is not top-of-the-bill news, it is a major crisis for those whom it involves, when they come across the problem of exchange of holdings.  There has been much talk here this morning, in the aftermath of the weekend we had, about new politics and how we in the Senate can work together.  However, with this Bill alone, Senator Gallagher has shown the effectiveness of the old politics of the Senator working with the councillor and the people on the ground who are affected by problems.  By introducing legislation and bringing it to this Stage, he has demonstrated that.  It does not have to be all new politics - the old system can be equally effective.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-11-29a.286" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1265" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017112900002#S00200"><p>At the outset, I wish to acknowledge the former Ceann Comhairle.  When I was a Member of this House, he was the Ceann Comhairle of the other House.  I did not have any opportunity to cross him then and I do not think I will have any opportunity to cross him now.  I also acknowledge the other people from Monaghan who are here; Councillor Campbell, whom I have known for years, and in particular the O'Gormans.  I was actually studying land law in the King's Inns when the Shirley <i>v. </i>O'Gorman case was happening.  I must state that I found the study of land law quite tedious even though I am a farmer's son.  However, the facts, issues and matters that are contained therein are fundamental for Irish people.  I refer to the ability to one one's own house or property and note the foundation of the State has its origins in the battle for the land, as it was, at the end of the 19th century, and the subsequent Land Acts that led to most landed estates being broken up. </p><p>Right across the country, however, not least in my own part of the south east, the issue of ground rents still remains contentious.  I went to school not in County Kilkenny but in New Ross, County Wexford.  The Tottenham estate still owns much of the ground rent in that particular town.  I commend Senators Gallagher, Ardagh and Swanick on their proposal of this Bill, and state from the outset that the Government will not be opposing it.  In principle, we agree with what the Senators are trying to address.  It contains proposals to amend the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978 to facilitate acquisition of freehold titles by lessees and ground rent tenants.  I also acknowledge the efforts of Senator Coffey.  The Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Humphreys, has been in contact with me about this before.  While I am taking this Bill for the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, it is fair to say that the local government area for which I am responsible also encroaches on this area.</p><p>That said, I must admit a vested interest in this regard.  I bought a house in Dublin before the economic collapse and am what one might term an accidental landlord.  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh's comments, likening people who are renting out private houses at present with the old British landlords and the ground rent landlords across the country, were outrageous.  Lest we forget, many of the people who own these ground rents are Irish citizens, not British landlords.  Some are British, as outlined by Senator Ardagh, but a lot of them are people who are residents or citizens here.  However, it is correct and proper to amend this Act from 1978, the year I was born. Moreover, I commend the O'Gormans.  It is good to see that they are here.  They took a long legal road to assert their rights and they represent many citizens across the country who find themselves in a similar situation. </p><p>I add, however, that the Bill requires detailed scrutiny to ensure its consistency with the property rights safeguards in the Constitution, as well as coherence with other statutory provisions governing the purchase of ground rents.  The Minister informs me that his Department is consulting with the Office of the Attorney General on these issues.  Arising from this, he expects to be in a position to table a number of Committee Stage amendments in due course.</p><p>As Senators will be aware, the rights of tenants occupying property under long leases to acquire freehold title has been a contentious issue since at least the 19th century.  Such tenants normally pay a small yearly rent to the ground rent landlord and the issues that arise are the nature and extent of the tenant's right to acquire the freehold title.  </p><p>Statutory reforms since the 1960s have strengthened the rights of such tenants to acquire a freehold in the property.The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act 1967 gave statutory effect to the principal recommendation of the report of the Ground Rents Commission chaired by Judge Conroy.  Under the Act, certain ground rent tenants, including both business and residential tenants, acquired the right to purchase the ground rent in their property.</p><p>The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act 1978 prohibited the creation of new ground rents in respect of dwellings.  Leases after that date are only valid if they operate as a renewal of an existing lease.  The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978 gave the Land Registry, now the Property Registration Authority, responsibility for operating a low-cost scheme for tenants acquiring the freehold of dwelling-houses.  </p><p>To date, more than 80,000 ground rents have been bought out under this statutory scheme.  These important statutes seek to establish an appropriate balance between a tenant's right to acquire the freehold title for reasons of public interest on the one hand, and the property rights of ground rent landlords, that are protected under Article 40.3 and Article 43 of the Constitution on the other. </p><p>The Private Members' Bill we are discussing today seeks to address what are seen as adverse consequences for ground rent tenants arising from the Supreme Court ruling of 2012.  On 2 February 2012, the Supreme Court delivered its judgment in the protracted legal proceedings of Shirley <i>v</i>O'Gorman, which concerned the right of ground rent tenants to purchase ground rents in their properties in certain circumstances.  The case arose from an application to acquire freehold title in Carrickmacross, County Monaghan.  While the tenant's application in this case was ultimately successful, the manner in which the Supreme Court interpreted certain technical provisions of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978 effectively narrowed the scope of the ground rents purchase scheme under that Act.  The ruling means that certain ground rent tenants who had been eligible to acquire the freehold title in their properties may no longer be able to do so.  This narrowing of the grounds on which a ground rent tenant is permitted to acquire freehold title affects other ground rent tenants in Carrickmacross and elsewhere in the State.  As mentioned earlier, a ground rent tenant's right to acquire the freehold in property, that is, to purchase the ground rent, was first introduced in the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act 1967.  While this legislation remains relevant in the case of many commercial properties, the later Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978 contains the statutory rules that generally apply to acquisition of the freehold title in the case of dwellings.</p><p>Sections 9 and 10 of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978 specify the criteria that determine a ground rent tenant's eligibility to acquire the freehold title in the case of dwellings.  Section 9 provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that such tenants have a right to acquire freehold title where there are permanent buildings on the land, these buildings are not an &quot;improvement&quot; within the meaning of the Act, and one of the conditions set out in section 10 also applies to the property.</p><p>One of the most widely used conditions in section 10, condition no. 2, is where the lease in question is for a period of less than 50 years and the annual ground rent is less than the rateable valuation of the property.  Moreover, while this condition recognises that there were buildings already on the land when such a lease was granted, there is a statutory presumption arising from the fact that the rent is at a low level to the effect that the buildings were not erected by the ground rent landlord or the landlord's predecessor in title.  However, that presumption may be rebutted in any particular case.</p><p>In its ruling in the Shirley <i>v</i>O'Gorman case, the Supreme Court took the view that the ground rent tenant is ineligible to acquire the freehold unless all the buildings had been built by him or her and not by the landlord.  The court also ruled that the definition of &quot;predecessors in title&quot; should be interpreted in a wide manner to include works by all previous owners, that is, not only the ground rent landlord but also any earlier tenants of the property in cases in which the landlord had taken repossession between tenancies.</p><p>The overall effect of the ruling in the Shirley <i>v</i>O'Gorman case is to narrow the scope of the ground rent purchase scheme.  The Private Members' Bill before the House today seeks to address the matters arising from the Supreme Court in this ruling by means of amendments to sections 9 and 10 of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978.  In Section 9, the Bill proposes to repeal both subsection 1(b) and subsection 2, which contain the &quot;improvement&quot; conditions.  Instead, the Bill proposes the insertion of a revised definition of &quot;permanent buildings&quot; in a new subsection 6.  It would provide that the right to acquire the freehold would in future apply where additions, alterations or extensions to the original buildings had caused it to lose its original identity or had caused an extension in its usable area by not less than 50%.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy John Paul Phelan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2004"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2004&amp;amp;pid=JohnPaulPhelan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In addition, the Bill proposes an amendment to condition 2 in section 10 that would seek to make it clear that the reference to "predecessor in title" would exclude any building works carried out by any previous tenants of the property.</p><p>There is merit in the Bill's objective to broaden ground rents tenants' right to acquire the fee simple of property and that is why the Government has decided not to oppose it today.  In fact, we are quite supportive of what the Bill seeks to do.  However, as I mentioned earlier, a number of references in the Bill require careful scrutiny to ensure that they do not clash with existing ground rent legislation.  The Minister refers particularly to references to "extension of its usable area" and "previous holder of the lessee's interest".  The Minister is, of course, anxious to ensure that any amendments to ground rents legislation will not lead to further litigation challenging its constitutionality.  That is why I have indicated that certain Committee Stage amendments may be required following completion of the examination that is currently taking place in the Office of the Attorney General.</p><p>As I have stated, the Government supports broadly the policy objective in terms of the gaps the Bill seeks to fill and will not be opposing it on Second Stage.  Moreover, any future amendments that may be tabled at later Stages will seek to ensure that the Bill's provisions are coherent with other ground rents legislation and consistent with the Constitution.</p></speech>

There is much talk nowadays about new politics.  This is an example of good politics.  This is a good idea that is shared by all political classes and people are rowing in behind it.  Legislation can address an issue that has been hanging over not just Carrickmacross but many other towns throughout the country.  I acknowledge all the work that has been done by everyone involved in this particular issue in Carrickmacross for many is the long year.  It is down to their collective efforts that we are here today discussing this issue.  I look forward to the Bill moving on to Committee Stage.  I note the Minister of State's comments about having a job of work to do at his end.  Based on the input of legal experts throughout the country, I am confident the Minister of State's job of work will be a short one and I look forward to dealing with the Bill on Committee Stage and early in the new year in order that we can move it forward again.

The 2017 statement is the second such statement under the Act.  In addition to the oral report, I am arranging for a written statement to be laid before the Houses in advance of the statutory deadline of 10 December.  The Act prescribes that the annual transition statement should include an overview of the mitigation and adaptation policy measures adopted by the Government, details on emission inventories and projections, and a report on compliance with Ireland's obligations under EU law and relevant international agreements.  I will address these elements during my statement.</p> <p>As reported by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, on Monday, Ireland's emissions increased by 3.5% between 2015 and 2016.  This is disappointing and highlights the urgent need to decouple economic growth from carbon emissions and energy demand.  Our economy remains the strongest performer in the EU, with GDP increasing by 5.2% in 2016, and we are once again approaching full employment, all of which puts pressure on emissions, especially in terms of transport, energy use and construction.  The EPA expects Ireland's emissions to continue to increase until at least the end of the decade, which makes it even more imperative that Ireland take further steps to arrest this trend.</p> <p>The Government's framework for taking action to reduce our emissions is the national mitigation plan, which sets out more than 70 individual measures to reduce emissions.  Progress on the implementation of these measures is reported in the annual transition statement.  The plan also provides the framework for further work on the medium to long-term measures to make the necessary deeper emission reductions in future decades.  The mitigation plan is not a static document and must be formally reviewed once every five years.</p></speech>

They must be consulted.  As part of the effort to engage with communities, I am leading a national dialogue on climate action, which will help to drive awareness around specific steps that people can take in their daily lives to try to tackle climate change.  The dialogue will provide an ongoing opportunity to capture the views and concerns of citizens around the country as we work to achieve the national transition objective.  The climate dialogue will build on the work that has already commenced in the Citizens' Assembly and feed into the overall process.</p> <p>We are in the process of completing the national adaptation framework, which is covered under the annual transition statement.  I will shortly submit a final framework to the Government for approval.  This will provide a clear strategy to Departments and local government for preparing and implementing adaptation plans and strategies within their own jurisdictions.</p> <p>One of the main questions facing everyone is how to make a meaningful contribution to this challenge.  How can any country, particularly a small one like Ireland, make a practical difference?  Small countries do not have the capacity or resources to do everything, but we can do some things well and show an example that others can follow.  Small countries face unique challenges, but these also provide opportunities for unique solutions.  The Paris Agreement is about every country, great and small, taking action.</p> <p>Prior to attending COP23 in Bonn, I received approval from the Government to join the NDC Partnership, which allows Ireland and other countries to share our understanding, knowledge, experiences and technologies that we have developed so that member states across the world can benefit and learn from one another about the measures that can be taken.</p> <p>I am trying to engage with the public in a meaningful way and to connect the global and long-term challenge of climate change with the here and now.  One of the main challenges facing us is how to convince people that we need to take steps now that will benefit their children and grandchildren.  The difficulty is that people and governments tend to kick the can down the road in that respect.</p> <p>A practical example of dealing with the challenges here and now in a way that benefits us today as well as the overall climate agenda is the national clean air strategy.  That strategy is a fundamental building block for meeting our challenges because it brings the climate issue into every home.  Last year, the then Secretary General of the UN, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, said: "Clean energy policies reduce air pollution [...] Human health and the environment both win."  This is why I believe that air quality is central to Ireland's energy efficiency programme and overall climate agenda.</p> <p>In March, Ireland hosted the first clean air dialogue with the European Commission in Dublin to promote actions to improve air quality and contribute to Ireland's implementation of the EU's clean air legislation.  Air pollution is not just an environmental or climate problem.  It threatens our natural resources, and the one big natural resource that Ireland has is its people, so it threatens their health and well-being.  Consider the economic costs of lost work days and health care.  Given that air quality is directly associated with an average of four deaths in Ireland every day and one in five children in this country suffers asthma, it must be a priority for the Government.</p> <p>Our new clean air strategy is already being acted upon.  We are doubling the number of air monitoring stations across the country.</p></speech>
