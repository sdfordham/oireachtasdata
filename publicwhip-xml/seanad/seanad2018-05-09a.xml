I raise the need for the Minister to make a statement on the need for legislation governing the long-term detention of people in psychiatric institutions given the recent decision of the Court of Appeal.</p> <p>I supplied the Minister and the office with material that I will go through very briefly, although I am sure the Minister is up to speed on this issue.  Mr. Justice Gerard Hogan found that section 15(3) of the Mental Health Act 2001 was unconstitutional because it allowed for involuntary patients to have their detention extended for up to 12 months without an effective procedure to have their detention independently reviewed within a reasonable time.  This is very serious and it was covered by the national media in the last few weeks.</p> <p>What is more important, and I had a look at the various briefing papers on it this morning, is that Mr. Justice Hogan went on to say that there needs to be an immediate and imperative response from the Oireachtas and the Government to bring in fresh legislation.  That is the position.  The judge talked about and recommended legislative change, which we should undertake.  It is an important finding by the judge in terms of long-term detention of people, particularly people with mental illness and other issues.  We need to provide care for people that is appropriate to their needs, having regard to their case history and their decisions and to why they are being detained in the first place and the independent validation of that.</p> <p>This learned judge has raised a very genuine issue of concern.  He has identified that the Oireachtas needs to do something in terms of legislation.  I know these things do not happen overnight but I would like to hear what the Government's intention is in this regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-05-09a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018050900002#A00600"><p>Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh.  I would like to thank Senator Boyhan for raising this issue, which is important and topical at the moment.  The Government and I have noted the important judgment by the Court of Appeal last week that renewal orders by mental health tribunals under section 15(3) of the Mental Health Act 2001 breach Article 40.4.1 of the Constitution.  This clearly raises certain questions and these are being examined in detail by my Department, in conjunction with relevant agencies, including the HSE, the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and the Mental Health Commission, which has responsibility for the regulation and independent review of admission and renewal orders by mental health tribunals.  We are currently awaiting the advice of senior counsel before initiating formal discussions on next steps.  The declaration of unconstitutionality by the Court of Appeal stands suspended until 8 November 2018, which allows time to give full and proper consideration to this matter.  In summing up his judgment, Mr. Justice Hogan stated that section 15(3) was adjudged to be:</p><blockquote>unconstitutional because of the fact that there is no mechanism where by virtue of the Mental Health Act 2001 or otherwise, whereby the patient can seek an independent review of his mental health status within a reasonable lime.  The constitutional objection, therefore, is not as such to the fact that the renewal orders in question have lasted for six or even twelve months.  It is rather that the renewal order may be renewed for these periods of time without the necessary safeguard of the possibility of an independent review within a timely period.</blockquote> <p>As of 23 April 2018, there were approximately 78 patients who were the subject of 12 month renewal orders.  I acknowledge that this judgment seeks to balance human rights and personal liberty against the need to have regard for the personal welfare and safety of the individual and of the public.  The issue of the appropriate length of admission and renewal orders was already being considered by my Department in the context of the ongoing review of the Mental Health Act 2001.  Recommendations to shorten the time periods involved are included in the report of the expert group which reviewed the Mental Health Act 2001 and was published in 2015.  The broad thrust of the changes recommended by the expert group have been accepted.  Work is progressing in the Department on these important amendments.  A text of the Bill is to be significantly progressed by the end of 2018.</p><p>In conclusion, the declaration of unconstitutionality by the Court of Appeal stands suspended until 8 November 2018, which allows time to give full and proper consideration to this matter.</p></speech>

That is all very reasonable.  This may be an issue that is appropriate to one of the committees, perhaps the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care.  I intend to talk to Senator Joan Freeman and I know that committee is meeting today.  She might try to put this matter on the committee's schedule.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is important that the courts suspended the declaration of unconstitutionality for six months until 8 November to allow the laws to be enacted.  Mr. Justice Gerard Hogan said that he wants to avoid any potential catastrophic consequences as a result of this judgment.  He was allowing time.  We have time and it would be appropriate to come back at some point to see how it is progressing.  It is serious.  I know the Minister of State will work on it and, having thought about his response, I intend to seek to have this matter brought up at the appropriate joint committee because it is an issue that needs to be kept live.  We do not want to be back here in November asking what we will do now.  There is a lead in time to address this but I thank the Minister of State for his engagement in the matter.</p></speech>

As I have said repeatedly, I always appreciate opportunities to engage with this House on any of these issues.  As the Senator rightly pointed out, this is a particularly important issue and it requires attention.  The Senator is very earnest in wanting to flag it early to ensure we deal with it properly and appropriately.  I am more than willing to work with the Senator and with whatever committee.  If the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care decides to discuss this legislation, I will co-operate with it to assist with that and ensure we have a timely response.  I share the Senator's appreciation of the judgment from the judge and the responsibility it places on these Houses to deal with that appropriately.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-05-09a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1409" speakername="Colm Burke" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018050900002#B00400"><p>I thank the Minister for taking time out of her busy schedule to deal with this matter.  The issue I raise is the community employment scheme and the current rules that apply.  The particular one I raise is where someone has reached 66 years of age and he or she is no longer entitled to continue on in the community employment scheme.  There is a problem now in community employment schemes around the country.  At least seven or eight community associations have contacted me.  They have people who are very good but they are retiring.  In one case, the person has reached 66 years of age while in other cases it is because the people have fulfilled the three year time period and they are not entitled to renew it because they are under 60 years of age.  We are concerned because these are community associations that are providing a very valuable service to the local community in all sorts of ways.  The person who had reached 66 years of age was a chef and was providing meals for elderly people in the community a number of days a week but it is not possible to get someone to replace him.  Many community associations are not able to get people to replace those who are retiring.</p> <p>I ask for a review of this position.  We are extending the time a person can stay working in the public service after the retirement age but we have not made the same facility available to people who are employed under a community employment scheme.  Can a review be undertaken and can we make the necessary amendments to accommodate these voluntary organisations that are providing a very valuable service?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-05-09a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018050900002#B00500"><p>I thank the Senator.  He already knows that the retirement arrangements announced last year by Government that affected public service employees have only been introduced to increase the compulsory retirement age from 65 years for certain categories of public servants.  The Government also agreed that in advance of the legislation coming into effect, interim arrangements could be introduced for serving public servants, enabling those reaching 65 years of age to remain in place, if they want to, until they reach the age of eligibility for the contributory State pension, which is currently 66 years of age.  Our community employment, CE, participants and supervisors are employees of the limited companies for which they work and they receive public funding in the community and the voluntary sector.  Therefore, my Department is not the employer of the CE participants or the supervisors.  Therefore, such employees are not public sector workers.</p> <p>In general, eligible participants can remain on CE until the working day before their birthday at which they reach the State pension age, which is currently 66 years, provided they have not exceeded their overall lifetime CE participation limit of six years, or seven years for those in receipt of a qualifying disability linked social welfare payment.</p> <p>A CE supervisor can remain on a CE scheme until the working day before his or her birthday at which they reach State pension age.  The age at which the pension becomes available to a person, as per section 7 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 is as follows: 66 years of age for those people born on or before 1 January 1955; 67 years of age for those born on or after 1 January 1955; and 68 years for those born on or after 1 January 1961.</p> <p>As per the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011, the State pension's age will increase to 67 on 1 January 2021 and to 68 on 1 January 2028.  As the age limit for participation on a CE scheme is linked to the age at which the State pension becomes available, CE participants and supervisors will be able to remain until the working day before their birthday, at which stage they reach the State pensionable age, provided they have not exceeded their overall lifetime period of participation of six or seven years, respectively.</p> <p>I refer to the specific case the Senator raised.  While I am not in an position to offer an extension to the particular gentleman the Senator is speaking about, I am very concerned that the continuity of the service is maintained in the Senator's area.  I would be grateful if he give me the details privately of the person, the scheme and the service being provided.</p> <p>I have been somewhat frustrated in the last year in this job of not being able to change and relax what I feel are the participation rules within CE.  The reason is that I probably na&iuml;vely thought I could have a set of rules for the people who are in the activation role within our CE schemes and a different set of rules for participation for people who were probably ideally involved in a social inclusive or public and community service-type role.  I started to do an analysis of the over 900 schemes, thinking they would easily slot in to one category or the other.  Unfortunately, I have discovered that no one scheme slots into any nice niche category because they all provide a range of both activation and social inclusion.</p> <p>It is fair to govern an entire CE scheme on the basis of activation rules when they provide such a huge and valuable public service through social inclusion with a very large number of people who would not be able to work or participate in their communities in any other format.  I also mention self-esteem, sanity and all the other good, positive mental health-related reasons with allowing someone to continue to contribute in his or her community and society.  These are the reasons I feel we should have a separate set of rules that govern the social inclusive part.  As the funding for the schemes that comes from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is totally based on activation, I am finding it difficult to square that circle but I will not stop until I square that circle.</p> <p>Be assured that I recognise the huge value our CE schemes offer for a variety of reasons and that there is need for different adjudication for different roles within those CE schemes.  I will not stop until I find a way to address that issue.</p></speech>

The other scheme I raised is a community organisation that has over 46 acres of community grounds because there are lot of different organisations working there, all on a voluntary basis.  The person on community employment supervises the maintenance and does all that work.  Now his time is up.  He has done his three years and it cannot be extended, as I understand it.  The big problem is that the scheme cannot get anyone to replace him.  It has tried extremely hard over the last six months to line up someone but it cannot get anyone.  The scheme is concerned that it will not have someone employed and it would not have the funding to employ someone directly because everything it does is voluntary.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colm Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2353"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If they get a grant for &euro;1,000 they will borrow another &euro;5,000 to get the project done so it is really a challenge for community organisations right around the country.</p></speech>

From 1 June, anybody who is currently engaged with JobPath can also apply for CE places or T&uacute;s places.  I do not think that will solve the problem, however, because I have not had large numbers of people on JobPath banging down my door demanding CE places.  We will still have difficulty recruiting people to CE jobs while we are sending away people who want to be on CE.  That makes no sense to me whatsoever.</p> <p>The only commitment I can give the Senator is that I am going to fix this.  There is no obvious fix for me right now but I will continue to work until I fix it.  I ask the Senator for the name of the person who has come to the end of the three-year service.  I will have a look into it for him.</p></speech>

They are in good health and are enjoying their job and would love to continue in their job after they reach 65.  At the moment, the Department is looking at legislation and reviewing the situation but if these people were to go back into employment in the public service they would have to start on point 1 of the scale again, as if they were new employees.  The experience they have built up over the years has to be taken into account and I am concerned that we are losing people with experience from some organisations.  When people want to stay on, everything should be done to encourage them and to allow them to stay in employment for a few more years to give something back to the organisations for which they worked.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-05-09a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1267" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018050900002#C00500"><p>As the Senator is aware, on December 2017, at the request of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, the Government agreed that the compulsory retirement age of most public servants recruited before 1 April 2004 should be increased to age 70.  This is the only group of public servants who currently have a compulsory retirement age of lower than 70.  The decision arose on foot of a review of the current statutory and operational considerations giving rise to barriers to extended participation in the public service workforce, which was carried out by my Department with public service employers last year.</p> <p>Primary legislation is required for the changes approved by Government to be implemented.  The Attorney General&rsquo;s office has been asked to prioritise the drafting of the necessary legislation so that the new compulsory retirement age will become effective as soon as possible.  The drafting process is under way and the Bill is on the list of priority legislation for publication in the current session.  Indeed, I understand that the drafting of the legislation is significantly advanced with an expected publication date, subject to Government approval, of next month.  It is not possible to determine the length of time it will take for a Bill to be drafted and pass through both Houses of the Oireachtas, given the need for meticulous drafting, ongoing detailed policy considerations, and the scheduling requirements of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Bill is, however, being treated as a priority and I know that the Minister intends to bring forward the necessary legislation as soon as possible.</p> <p>The Minister wrote to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach earlier this year requesting it to undertake pre-legislative scrutiny on the general scheme of the Bill at an early date.  In response, the committee indicated that, while it does not intend to undertake pre-legislative scrutiny on this Bill, it will engage fully on the draft legislation in the context of the formal legislative process.  This approach is likely to facilitate passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas and the Minister has welcomed the support of the committee in this regard.</p> <p>The new compulsory retirement age will not come into effect until the necessary legislation is commenced.  In order to make some accommodation for public servants who reach the age of 65 in the period between the Government decision of 5 December and the commencement of the necessary legislation, the Government approved some limited interim arrangements which became effective from the date of the Government decision.  The interim arrangements, which have to respect the current statutory position of the compulsory retirement age of 65, will, through "retire and re-hire", enable pre-2004 public servants who reach the age of 65 to remain in employment until they reach the age of eligibility for the State pension contributory, which is currently 66, subject to certain conditions.  Details of these interim implementation arrangements have been put in place by the relevant sectors.</p></speech>

It is good news but, in the meantime, people want to stay on.  I understand that the Minister has put interim measures in place and I would like to find out what they are.  It is very unfair to expect someone to go back to point 1 on the scale.  People who have given their time and commitment to a job need to be looked after.  It is because they love their job that they want to stay on.  Perhaps I could talk to the Department about this issue.</p></speech>

The passage of the proposed legislation will, I believe, address any misgivings of public servants regarding the current temporary arrangements.  However, those temporary arrangements must respect the current compulsory statutory retirement age of 65.  Once the legislation is commenced, public servants who choose to remain beyond the age of 65 will not be in the position of having retired and been re-hired as is currently the case.</p> <p>It is intended that the new legislation will allow for the retention of public servants who reach the age of 65 following the commencement of the legislation on current terms and conditions.  Additional service will count towards pension accrual subject to the statutory maximum of 40 years and pension entitlements will then become payable at the date of retirement.  Finally, both the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and I look forward to securing early passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas and we ask the indulgence of this and the other House for its speedy passage.</p></speech>

This morning I was absolutely shocked and horrified after learning that more than 500 people in Dublin have been warned by garda&iacute; that their lives are in danger.  Unfortunately, many of these people are involved in the drugs trade and many of the threats are gang related.  There seems to be no end in sight or plan put in place by the Government to counter the scourge of drug-related crime in our city.  The people living in the inner city and the communities of the inner city should not have to live in fear on a daily basis.  We learn that of the 500, 11 are in imminent danger and Garda resources are now deployed on a preservation-of-life beat.  What is most worrying is that the assistant commissioner, Pat Leahy, intimated that the Hutch and Kinahan feud was unlikely to end any time soon.  I call on the Minister to come to the House to address the matter and outline how the Government plans to support inner-city communities who are affected by this scourge.</p><p>The second issue I will raise is housing and homelessness statistics.  It is a subject I have raised on many occasions in the House and I reiterate calls for the Minister of Housing, Planning and Local Government to come to the House and confirm whether he instructed local authorities to amend or reclassify homeless figures in any way.  Why was there a deliberate attempt by the Minister to reduce the figures of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government by misrepresenting people's situations?  We all know from our clinics there has not been a massive increase or recovery in the social housing lists across the country.  Does the Minister find the monthly publishing of these lists and accountability tiring and troublesome?  We need to know exactly what is going on here.</p><p>In the meantime, we know rents are increasing, house prices are spiralling and the State is contemplating the acquisition of private lands when there are huge tranches of public lands lying idle where houses could be built.  Another facet is new-build houses.  If any Member has been on <i>daft.ie</i>or <i>myhome.ie, </i>they will see that a lot of the new-build estates are shown as price on application, POA.  It is really worrying because it seems that developers are making up prices on a weekly basis.  Prices start off at &euro;500,000 for a two-bedroom apartment and we are now seeing two-bedroom apartments in parts of Dublin going for up to &euro;800,000.  There needs to be some measures in place so developers do not just throw out prices.  There needs to be some transparency for consumers because it is not fair.  We need to see fairness in the market.  As we do not have supply, people are able to make hay but ultimately people need to be able to afford houses at a fair and transparent price.</p></speech>

I understand its members met briefly today and elected a chairman, my colleague, Senator Michael McDowell.  I wish all of them well.  It is a difficult job.   I presume it is based on the Manning report.  I cannot pre-empt it because I do not know what its full terms of reference are.  The sooner we know them the better.  I wish Senator McDowell well.  He has vast experience in government.  I wish the entire committee, which is representative of all groups in both Houses of the Oireachtas, well.</p></speech>

It is an unpublished report called the Mulcahy report and is a report into very serious allegations of corruption in planning in Donegal.  The report is on the Minister's desk.  I undertook yesterday to seek further details about it.  I am now satisfied it has been on the Minister's desk since June 2017.  It has very serious implications.  It is in the public domain.  It suggests with regard to colleagues who submitted applications that there was interference.  There were suggestions of forgery of signatures to do with planning.  There was a suggestion that major planning documents were destroyed and that recommendations of planners were destroyed and done away with.  This came out through a whistleblower who formally made these complaints.</p><p>Two investigations were established into these matters.  A final report called the Mulcahy report was delivered to the Minister.  It is very important that we have the Minister in at some point in the very near future to discuss this report or put it into the public domain.  It is unfair for Donegal County Council, its staff and members to have this report hanging over their heads.  I ask that as soon as we can some sort of statement can be issued.  The Minister might give us some indication of his intentions and how he intends to deal with this report but, more importantly, what recommendations will come out of it.</p></speech>

It symbolises its ineptitude to deal with the horrific situation that presents for women.  The words "contempt" and "unfeeling" come to mind when I see the response of the Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar.  It is certainly not the response that I or other women I speak with would expect from a State leader.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Women have died and others are fighting for their lives while the Government fails to act decisively to hold those in a position of responsibility and authority to account.  The women and families affected by this scandal are speaking but the Government is just not listening.  I have spent the past two days in the finance committee questioning the State Claims Agency, and today in the health committee with the Ministers and the HSE.  I have come to the conclusion that the web of unaccountability and the lack of transparency and clear communication pathways are beginning to look like an aerial shot of spaghetti junction on a very foggy day.  This is just not good enough.</p><p>I also ask for the Minister for Finance to come into the House to discuss the approach of the State Claims Agency regarding medical negligence.  There are further questions to be asked in this area but the Minister also needs to take on board the suggestion from my party colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, that the HSE and the State Claims Agency address the situation with the two private American companies rather than have individual women and their families go through legal battles with profit-maximising companies.  The person who presided over the confusion, and played a key part in the decision to contract out these key services to these private American companies, must go and must go now.  He has presided over negligence, concealment and misinformation with the most serious consequences for women and their families.  If we do not do this we are left with the question, "What would it take to hold the head of the HSE to account?"</p></speech>

I wish to ask that the representatives of all groups attend that meeting and vote to remove Standing Order 41.  This is one clear example of Seanad reform that this House can take itself so I ask everybody to attend the meeting and vote to remove Standing Order 41.  If we are serious about Seanad reform we can do this.</p> <p>I extend my congratulations to Senator McDowell on being made chairman.  It was a rocky road to get there and I understand it was opposed by former colleagues but I am sure he will do a good job as he is a very effective lawyer.  I hope, however, that he has learned from the idiotic Bill he introduced, which I do not believe he even read.  It contained nonsensical things such as a requirement to pay &euro;1,000 to stand for Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  What a laughable piece of tripe.  The way it dealt with universities was also nonsense.  Senator McDowell is a very good advocate and can take a brief on the hoof so I hope he has learned from his experiences in the House and from the forensic analysis I did of his lamentable Bill.</p> <p>I also understand that former Senator and now Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, has put himself on this committee.</p></speech>

I have withheld public comment on Deputy Ross but his attitude to the Seanad has, in the past, been marked by a mischievous note and I hope that will be absent from the deliberations of this committee.  As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport - and whatever you are having yourself - his hands will be pretty much full if he was doing his ministerial job.  I am perfectly entitled to say that.

May is mental health awareness month and mental health affects all of us.  There are lots of events across the country to encourage us all to talk more openly about our mental health struggles and experiences.  Pieta House's Darkness into Light 2018 initiative, created by our colleague, Senator Joan Freeman, will take place on Saturday, 12 May at 4.15 a.m. across Ireland.  Last year, 180,000 people walked to promote suicide prevention and to tackle the stigma that leads people to the doors of Pieta House centres.  This year marks the ninth year of the event, which is growing every year.  I will join my family and friends to talk and walk from the dark of night into the morning light to raise awareness.</p> <p>Tomorrow, 10 May, in my own county we will celebrate Hello Carlow Day, when the Carlow Mental Health Association and local business and community groups are encouraging everyone to ask "How are you?"  Little things such as these can really effect change.  Someone asked me recently what mental health was to me.  To me, mental health is in my head.  If I feel I have a conversation with the voice in my head I know I can get through the day.  The days when I cannot talk to that voice and discuss my worries, air my fears and review my emotions, are the days I feel really alone and I worry about my mental health.  That is why I place so much importance on talking.  Maybe it will not be enough but maybe it will be.  Maybe just one conversation will save someone so it is never a bad idea to talk about what is inside one's head and I encourage everybody to support our local events to raise awareness of mental health struggles across society.  I encourage all of us to check in on one another to ask how we are, because that conversation could be the one that changes the course of our day.</p></speech>

My colleague, Senator Conway-Walsh, outlined exactly the approach this State takes to its citizens when they find themselves in conflict or needing to make a claim.</p> <p>Two years ago, I brought the case of Lieutenant Colonel John Hamill to the Seanad and we had two Commencement debates on his issue.  The Ombudsman for the Defence Forces found that he had been wronged but, despite the ruling of the ombudsman, the Department of Defence has sat on its hands and refused to deal with the man by giving him the solution he deserves.  It is outrageous that the Department of Defence uses public money in this way.  The only way this man will now get redress is through the courts and by exposing himself to a massive court battle to get what the ombudsman said he was entitled to.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

The Leader and I and most Members of the House will have seen State and semi-State agencies using the public purse to fight unwinnable court cases.  Why?  It is because it is not their money they are fighting with.  Lieutenant Colonel Hamill served with distinction for this State.  An ombudsman found in his favour that he had been wronged and that he was forced out of the Army at the age of 58 when he should have been promoted to colonel.  What has he to do to vindicate his right?  He has to go to the High Court and expose himself to risk.  That is wrong in every sense of the word and makes me ask how many more citizens are having to sit on their hands and suck up some injustice that was done to them, purely because they do not have the deep pockets the State has.  It is time we kicked this debate out in the open.  I agree with Senator Conway-Walsh.  The State Claims Agency seems to do whatever the hell it wants and that feeds into every other Department.  I would appreciate if the Leader could organise a debate on that issue.</p></speech>

I attended a briefing last Thursday evening, when the report was published.  This has been and continues to be a very difficult time for the 16 families involved.</p> <p>Many of the challenges highlighted in the report indicate that inadequate levels of staffing impacted on training, staff support available and the escalation of more complex cases.  There are almost 150 recommendations in this report.  I was informed last Thursday evening that 90% of them are either implemented or in progress.  Significant improvements have been made to ensure that we have high-quality maternity services at Portiuncula.  One of the most important points made at that meeting was that they are trying to create better working relationships and a better clinical maternity network, particularly with Galway University Hospital.  This is very important in terms of escalating more complex cases.</p> <p>In respect of the difficulties that have arisen in cervical screening, open disclosure is and should be a basic requirement.  This report found that disclosure was unsatisfactory in 17 out of the 18 cases.  As we discussed last week, withholding information from these families, like other women and individuals whom we may not even know about yet, is completely disgraceful and unacceptable.  This must have been very distressing for the families involved.  I have spoken with many families across our region who emphasised that there is excellent care provided at Portiuncula maternity unit and that significant progress has been made through the implementation group that has been established.  Some 17 additional posts have been put in place across obstetrics, anaesthetics and paediatrics. </p> <p>It is important that the Minister, Deputy Harris, comes to the Seanad to discuss maternity services in the context of this review and more generally, in order to ensure that we provide the highest possible standards for mothers and babies.</p></speech>

Some 92% of the Irish population is still expressing support for the EU and EU membership.  It is important that we acknowledge it.  It has come a long way since the foundation in 1951 of the European Coal and Steel Community.  I am sure some of my colleagues who are members of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs will be mentioning Europe Day.</p> <p>If we are going to have a Seanad reform committee, I am delighted that Senator McDowell is to chair it.  I am not so sure I am delighted with some of the other members of whom I was informed this afternoon.  They have obviously done everything in their own constituency, which is where I live, and have so much time on their hands that they can reflect on Seanad reform.  I hope that the committee does not just consider how one gets into this Chamber but also examines what the Seanad could be doing that it is not doing and what it could be doing better.  It is not the Cathaoirleach's or the chairman's fault, but all I have heard so far is about how Senators get in here.  I have heard nothing about what they do when they are here, or what they could be doing and so on.  </p> <p>I heard a speech by the Taoiseach last night in which he mentioned climate change in the course of a much broader debate.  He fairly brushed over the fact that we will not meet our 2020 targets or even our 2030 targets but that we should make our 2050 targets.  It is probably easy to say that we will meet targets 32 years from now.  From 2020, I understand we will be facing fines of between &euro;300 million and &euro;600 million a year.  Surely it would be better if we could achieve the targets.  We should do whatever we need to do in terms of electric vehicles, building insulation of public buildings and private housing and so on.  We should try to mitigate against whatever fines we are going to have to pay.  I call on the Leader to bring in the Minister, Deputy Naughten, to have a debate on climate change and where we are going.  It is not about agriculture or vehicles only.  Let us try to make sure that we mitigate against the worst effects of having to pay these fines and, equally, that we improve the quality of the planet for generations to come.</p></speech>

I assure all Members of the House that this group, which has yet to convene and have a full meeting, will be open to all suggestions from everywhere in this House and will not have a closed mind.  I think I can guarantee that.</p> <p>In response to what Senator Horkan has just said, the Manning report does refer to the role of the Seanad and has ambitious aims to involve the Seanad in European matters, not just looking at secondary legislation but giving some teeth in Irish parliamentary procedure to the Lisbon treaty proposals and other things.  I think it was an English Prime Minister who said, "Reform, reform - aren't things bad enough already?" Whatever worthwhile reform emerges from this process will take time to implement.  A deep and well-organised reform should not cause too much fluttering in the dovecotes here as regards the next election to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</p> <p>I have been reading in the newspapers over the last few days about Dublin City Council's proposals to consider knocking down a lot of its apartment buildings because they are old or whatever.  The funny thing is that the older they are, the better they are.  The communities in them are more settled.  Dublin City Council should not be so devoid of ideas that it would now start to cannibalise its own existing apartment buildings, such as Mercer House off St. Stephen's Green, which are fine buildings.  If there is something needed to modernise them, it should be done.  What we need is more houses, not to be knocking down existing apartment buildings.  The irony is this that with places like Fatima Mansions, St. Theresa's Gardens, O'Devaney Gardens and the like, and some of Ballymun, the more recently a big development has been carried out by Dublin City Council, the worse it has turned out to be in terms of the overall environment for living.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I want to put on record my strong opposition to the idea that Dublin City Council should start to devour its own decent buildings to create space for replacement buildings when there is plenty of land in Dublin, including land that can be acquired via compulsory purchase orders, if necessary, to provide decent homes in the city centre for people who want to have a decent way of life and access to affordable and social housing.</p></speech>

It is an encouraging statistic, but far more encouraging is that, in the 18 to 24 years bracket, the figure is 97%.  If North Korea made these figures up, we would still struggle to believe them.</p> <p>Something that is discouraging, however, is the Irish population's lack of linguistic skills in second, third or fourth languages.  Will the Leader call on the Minister for Education and Skills to attend the House to discuss a strategy that encourages young and not-so-young Irish people to take up additional languages, specifically European ones like French, Spanish, Polish and beyond?  As we embark upon the post-Brexit era when our exposure to and reliance on the Continent will grow, it is important that Irish people not simply do so with an ability in English, a lesser ability as Gaeilge and no third or fourth language.  This is putting us behind the curve economically and socially on a European level.</p></speech>

A company called Go Safe, whose parent company is based on the Isle of Man, won the contract, which came into effect on 1 May 2017 and will last for six years with a 12-month extension.  The value of the contract over seven years is just over &euro;100 million.  It is due for renewal in 2023 or 2024.  The number of hours cameras are in place is roughly 90,000 annually plus an additional 1,500 hours per month.  That is approximately &euro;160 that the company is paid every hour.  In some ways, that is not bad going.</p> <p>I would like the Minister for Justice and Equality to outline to the House the strategy, the contract, who is behind the Go Safe parent company, what other company is involved, what Go Safe's strategy is and how it decides where to place speed vans.  I would also like him to give an outline per county, road or partial road and to tell us what the company is doing.  The Irish people are entitled to this information.  I believe that many of them are quietly asking these questions.  Time and again, people are flashing their lights to signal that there is a speed van ahead.  I am not saying the vans do not do a good job, but there are questions of accountability, so I would appreciate it if the Minister was invited to attend.</p></speech>

I raised it at the health committee this morning and want to do so again now.  It relates to pending cases.  I agree with my colleague about having the Minister attend to deal with a number of issues around maternity care and CervicalCheck.  At the committee meeting, someone asked about the need for legislation.  I do not believe there is a need, but the HSE and the State Claims Agency could reach settlements in those pending cases where there is clear evidence of negligence.  The State Claims Agency could then step into the shoes of the claimant in order to recover the moneys from the company that provided the analysis, be it in the US or elsewhere.  This would be done instead of forcing people to go through court processes and delays.  We need to give this suggestion serious consideration.  At this morning's meeting, I asked the Minister to address it.</p> <p>The House should debate maternity services and whether there other issues of which we should be mindful if we are to ensure that a catastrophe like the recent one does not recur.  The health service faces many challenges, for example, recruitment of consultants and the need to compete with other jurisdictions just to retain medical and nursing staff.  It would be appropriate for the House to debate these matters and the question of how to proceed.  Linked with Senator Hopkins's point, Portiuncula Hospital recently advertised a consultant obstetrician's position for which there were no applicants.  Indeed, there are many consultant positions for which there are no applicants.  We should examine this issue now instead of waiting to respond to another catastrophe.  I support my colleague in seeking that debate.</p></speech>

Allegations of nepotism and other corrupt practices have been coming out from Donegal County Council for more than a decade, with whistleblowers risking their livelihoods and standing to release information about low standards and shady practices.  The former Green Party Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Mr. John Gormley, commissioned reviews of such allegations in Donegal, Carlow and Offaly only to have the reviews killed by the Minister in the next Government, Commissioner Phil Hogan.  Subsequent internal reviews claimed to find nothing, yet these were rejected by the courts and an independent report was ordered.  That report has sat for almost a year gathering dust in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p> <p>Past Green Party Members of this Chamber and the D&aacute;il, such as Ms D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca, Mr. Paul Gogarty and Mr. Trevor Sargent, have had a proud record of standing against low standards in local government.  They were often told that they were doing it wrong, not adhering to protocol and not observing their place, yet they were eventually vindicated.  My Green Party colleague, Dublin City Council member, Mr. Patrick Costello, is taking up the fight and has lodged a request to access the report in question under the Aarhus Convention.</p> <p>We have seen the consequences of the corruption in planning that has been exposed by various tribunals in recent decades.  The last thing I want to see is another lengthy and costly tribunal, yet that is exactly what the Minister's delay will end up causing.  When will the independent report be published and what remedial measures will be taken by the Government to tackle these problems?</p></speech>

It is the biggest issue.  We need to try to bring confidence to the system because currently that confidence is draining from it.  There are issues as people are forced to go down legal avenues, which is totally unacceptable when there is a clear matter of accountability to be sorted.  Senator Burke has raised the issue quite capably and there must be movement on it.  We cannot drag families through the courts, as we have seen in the past few days.</p><p>I listened with some sadness to an interview on RT&Eacute; radio yesterday with Mr. Stephen Teap from Cork and his story of how his poor wife, Irene, was lost.  She was one of the 17 women who died.  These are very serious cases and accountability at the very top is required.  We need to do the right thing in this regard.  The accountability from the top man needs to be there and he must be straight.  The Health Service Executive, HSE, boss needs to consider what he is doing.  The lack of compassion is a major issue.  It is something we must consider as a Government.  The boss of the HSE must take responsibility for this decision.  It is sad and I hope we can get some closure for the people who have lost their loved ones.  We should be able to put a process in place to put confidence back into the system.  Sadly, that confidence is lacking currently.  I would welcome an opportunity to discuss the matters raised by Senator Burke, in particular.  We do not want these families going down the legal avenue.  There must be a more sympathetic way of doing business rather than putting these people through a court case to get what is due to them from this sad issue.</p><p>Counselling services must also be put in place.  Those of us who listened to that man's interview know he had no counselling when he got the news about how his wife was misdiagnosed.  The HSE must seriously look at that.  It must consider the whole family and the patient rather than having the clinical approach of providing information and seeing what can be done.  There are many questions and we must learn from them.  We must welcome the scoping inquiry, which is positive, and we need to learn fast how to deal with people, especially those affected by this very sad affair.</p></speech>

Perhaps this was covered by a Member previously on the Order of Business but it is quite startling.  It is noticeable that more and more of the resources of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the city go towards preventing killings due to the internecine feuding going on between the infamous Kinahan and Hutch people.  There are other minor feuds as well.  I reside for half the week on the north side of the inner city and I am becoming more aware of the increasing licentiousness, rough and untold behaviour on the streets of our city in broad daylight, and not even late at night.  I am here 11 years.  The Garda need every possible resource it can be given to deal with this.</p><p>Some may say these guys are criminals and it is no big deal what they do to each other.  That may or may not be the case.  There is a danger to innocent lives and to people caught in the crossfire who are living in fear.  Security is being compromised and people are afraid to speak out or move in certain areas of the city, which is a worrying trend.  It might be timely to have a debate on Dublin city crime and perhaps Garda funding and resources in general.</p></speech>

Have I heard correctly that a Cabinet Minister will sit on the committee?  It is surely a first.  I very much welcome Senator McDowell's indication that he is open to all sorts of suggestions.  We all have ideas for the Seanad.  Perhaps the Leader will outline in his response how his hands are tied, if they are at all, and the terms of reference.  Is there any general information he can give us?</p></speech>

I am afraid his head will swell.  I offer my congratulations as Cathaoirleach of Seanad &Eacute;ireann to the Senator.  I am sure he will treat his work with the attention it deserves and the results will be something of credit to the Senator in the decades to come.</p></speech>

As I stated in my opening comments - I have not demurred despite the commentary of some - we will all work to bring reform to Seanad &Eacute;ireann in a collective and collaborative manner.  It is what we will do and I wish the Senator every success in his endeavour.</p> <p>I join with Senators Horkan and Richmond in welcoming Europe Day.  There was great news last night with Mr. Ryan O'Shaughnessy qualifying for the Eurovision finals next Saturday night.</p></speech>

On Europe Day is it not great that we can celebrate our participation in Europe and the Eurovision song contest final?  As Senator Horkan rightly stated, it celebrates the importance of Europe to us as a nation.  Survey results have indicated that 92% of our people want to remain in Europe, which sends a positive message to all of us as Europeans.  We are at the heart of Europe.</p><p>Senators Ardagh and Ned O'Sullivan raised the issue of threats to life as detailed in <i>The Irish Times </i>report this morning.  I reiterate that gangland crime has no place in a civilised society and any threat to life, as described by both Senators, is to be condemned out of hand.  It should not and is not being tolerated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I remind Senator Ardagh, in particular, that this Government set up Operation Hybrid with the Garda in the context of the Kinahan-Hutch feud.  There were increased resources for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and new legislation around the Criminal Assets Bureau.  I remind the House that the previous Government reopened Templemore and we have seen an increase in the number of garda&iacute;.  We have also seen a commitment to the civilianisation of the force to allow more garda&iacute; on the street.  There is a commitment to have 800 new members in 2018.  Garda numbers increased to 13,551 by the end of last year, an increase of 600 in that year.  I encourage people to become aware of the facts.</p><p>We have seen an increase in resourcing around overtime and expenditure for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There has been &euro;1.65 billion allocated to the Garda Vote for overtime in 2018, which is an increase of 2%.  A Supplementary Estimate was brought forward yesterday by the Minister, Deputy Flanagan.  It is important to recognise that we must stand up to crime and criminals.  We must stand with people in communities in the inner city, as mentioned by Senators Ned O'Sullivan and Ardagh.  Suggesting the Government is doing nothing is incorrect.  Members should cast their minds back to the Garda special crime task force established in 2016, which was again aimed at targeting those crime gangs in our capital city.  The work is supported by the increase in resources by the Government.  I accept we need to do more and I will always stand up for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>
