I raise the need for the Minister to make a statement on the need for legislation governing the long-term detention of people in psychiatric institutions given the recent decision of the Court of Appeal.</p> <p>I supplied the Minister and the office with material that I will go through very briefly, although I am sure the Minister is up to speed on this issue.  Mr. Justice Gerard Hogan found that section 15(3) of the Mental Health Act 2001 was unconstitutional because it allowed for involuntary patients to have their detention extended for up to 12 months without an effective procedure to have their detention independently reviewed within a reasonable time.  This is very serious and it was covered by the national media in the last few weeks.</p> <p>What is more important, and I had a look at the various briefing papers on it this morning, is that Mr. Justice Hogan went on to say that there needs to be an immediate and imperative response from the Oireachtas and the Government to bring in fresh legislation.  That is the position.  The judge talked about and recommended legislative change, which we should undertake.  It is an important finding by the judge in terms of long-term detention of people, particularly people with mental illness and other issues.  We need to provide care for people that is appropriate to their needs, having regard to their case history and their decisions and to why they are being detained in the first place and the independent validation of that.</p> <p>This learned judge has raised a very genuine issue of concern.  He has identified that the Oireachtas needs to do something in terms of legislation.  I know these things do not happen overnight but I would like to hear what the Government's intention is in this regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-05-09a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018050900002#A00600"><p>Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh.  I would like to thank Senator Boyhan for raising this issue, which is important and topical at the moment.  The Government and I have noted the important judgment by the Court of Appeal last week that renewal orders by mental health tribunals under section 15(3) of the Mental Health Act 2001 breach Article 40.4.1 of the Constitution.  This clearly raises certain questions and these are being examined in detail by my Department, in conjunction with relevant agencies, including the HSE, the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and the Mental Health Commission, which has responsibility for the regulation and independent review of admission and renewal orders by mental health tribunals.  We are currently awaiting the advice of senior counsel before initiating formal discussions on next steps.  The declaration of unconstitutionality by the Court of Appeal stands suspended until 8 November 2018, which allows time to give full and proper consideration to this matter.  In summing up his judgment, Mr. Justice Hogan stated that section 15(3) was adjudged to be:</p><blockquote>unconstitutional because of the fact that there is no mechanism where by virtue of the Mental Health Act 2001 or otherwise, whereby the patient can seek an independent review of his mental health status within a reasonable lime.  The constitutional objection, therefore, is not as such to the fact that the renewal orders in question have lasted for six or even twelve months.  It is rather that the renewal order may be renewed for these periods of time without the necessary safeguard of the possibility of an independent review within a timely period.</blockquote> <p>As of 23 April 2018, there were approximately 78 patients who were the subject of 12 month renewal orders.  I acknowledge that this judgment seeks to balance human rights and personal liberty against the need to have regard for the personal welfare and safety of the individual and of the public.  The issue of the appropriate length of admission and renewal orders was already being considered by my Department in the context of the ongoing review of the Mental Health Act 2001.  Recommendations to shorten the time periods involved are included in the report of the expert group which reviewed the Mental Health Act 2001 and was published in 2015.  The broad thrust of the changes recommended by the expert group have been accepted.  Work is progressing in the Department on these important amendments.  A text of the Bill is to be significantly progressed by the end of 2018.</p><p>In conclusion, the declaration of unconstitutionality by the Court of Appeal stands suspended until 8 November 2018, which allows time to give full and proper consideration to this matter.</p></speech>

That is all very reasonable.  This may be an issue that is appropriate to one of the committees, perhaps the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care.  I intend to talk to Senator Joan Freeman and I know that committee is meeting today.  She might try to put this matter on the committee's schedule.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is important that the courts suspended the declaration of unconstitutionality for six months until 8 November to allow the laws to be enacted.  Mr. Justice Gerard Hogan said that he wants to avoid any potential catastrophic consequences as a result of this judgment.  He was allowing time.  We have time and it would be appropriate to come back at some point to see how it is progressing.  It is serious.  I know the Minister of State will work on it and, having thought about his response, I intend to seek to have this matter brought up at the appropriate joint committee because it is an issue that needs to be kept live.  We do not want to be back here in November asking what we will do now.  There is a lead in time to address this but I thank the Minister of State for his engagement in the matter.</p></speech>

As I have said repeatedly, I always appreciate opportunities to engage with this House on any of these issues.  As the Senator rightly pointed out, this is a particularly important issue and it requires attention.  The Senator is very earnest in wanting to flag it early to ensure we deal with it properly and appropriately.  I am more than willing to work with the Senator and with whatever committee.  If the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care decides to discuss this legislation, I will co-operate with it to assist with that and ensure we have a timely response.  I share the Senator's appreciation of the judgment from the judge and the responsibility it places on these Houses to deal with that appropriately.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-05-09a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1409" speakername="Colm Burke" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018050900002#B00400"><p>I thank the Minister for taking time out of her busy schedule to deal with this matter.  The issue I raise is the community employment scheme and the current rules that apply.  The particular one I raise is where someone has reached 66 years of age and he or she is no longer entitled to continue on in the community employment scheme.  There is a problem now in community employment schemes around the country.  At least seven or eight community associations have contacted me.  They have people who are very good but they are retiring.  In one case, the person has reached 66 years of age while in other cases it is because the people have fulfilled the three year time period and they are not entitled to renew it because they are under 60 years of age.  We are concerned because these are community associations that are providing a very valuable service to the local community in all sorts of ways.  The person who had reached 66 years of age was a chef and was providing meals for elderly people in the community a number of days a week but it is not possible to get someone to replace him.  Many community associations are not able to get people to replace those who are retiring.</p> <p>I ask for a review of this position.  We are extending the time a person can stay working in the public service after the retirement age but we have not made the same facility available to people who are employed under a community employment scheme.  Can a review be undertaken and can we make the necessary amendments to accommodate these voluntary organisations that are providing a very valuable service?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-05-09a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018050900002#B00500"><p>I thank the Senator.  He already knows that the retirement arrangements announced last year by Government that affected public service employees have only been introduced to increase the compulsory retirement age from 65 years for certain categories of public servants.  The Government also agreed that in advance of the legislation coming into effect, interim arrangements could be introduced for serving public servants, enabling those reaching 65 years of age to remain in place, if they want to, until they reach the age of eligibility for the contributory State pension, which is currently 66 years of age.  Our community employment, CE, participants and supervisors are employees of the limited companies for which they work and they receive public funding in the community and the voluntary sector.  Therefore, my Department is not the employer of the CE participants or the supervisors.  Therefore, such employees are not public sector workers.</p> <p>In general, eligible participants can remain on CE until the working day before their birthday at which they reach the State pension age, which is currently 66 years, provided they have not exceeded their overall lifetime CE participation limit of six years, or seven years for those in receipt of a qualifying disability linked social welfare payment.</p> <p>A CE supervisor can remain on a CE scheme until the working day before his or her birthday at which they reach State pension age.  The age at which the pension becomes available to a person, as per section 7 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 is as follows: 66 years of age for those people born on or before 1 January 1955; 67 years of age for those born on or after 1 January 1955; and 68 years for those born on or after 1 January 1961.</p> <p>As per the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011, the State pension's age will increase to 67 on 1 January 2021 and to 68 on 1 January 2028.  As the age limit for participation on a CE scheme is linked to the age at which the State pension becomes available, CE participants and supervisors will be able to remain until the working day before their birthday, at which stage they reach the State pensionable age, provided they have not exceeded their overall lifetime period of participation of six or seven years, respectively.</p> <p>I refer to the specific case the Senator raised.  While I am not in an position to offer an extension to the particular gentleman the Senator is speaking about, I am very concerned that the continuity of the service is maintained in the Senator's area.  I would be grateful if he give me the details privately of the person, the scheme and the service being provided.</p> <p>I have been somewhat frustrated in the last year in this job of not being able to change and relax what I feel are the participation rules within CE.  The reason is that I probably na&iuml;vely thought I could have a set of rules for the people who are in the activation role within our CE schemes and a different set of rules for participation for people who were probably ideally involved in a social inclusive or public and community service-type role.  I started to do an analysis of the over 900 schemes, thinking they would easily slot in to one category or the other.  Unfortunately, I have discovered that no one scheme slots into any nice niche category because they all provide a range of both activation and social inclusion.</p> <p>It is fair to govern an entire CE scheme on the basis of activation rules when they provide such a huge and valuable public service through social inclusion with a very large number of people who would not be able to work or participate in their communities in any other format.  I also mention self-esteem, sanity and all the other good, positive mental health-related reasons with allowing someone to continue to contribute in his or her community and society.  These are the reasons I feel we should have a separate set of rules that govern the social inclusive part.  As the funding for the schemes that comes from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is totally based on activation, I am finding it difficult to square that circle but I will not stop until I square that circle.</p> <p>Be assured that I recognise the huge value our CE schemes offer for a variety of reasons and that there is need for different adjudication for different roles within those CE schemes.  I will not stop until I find a way to address that issue.</p></speech>

The other scheme I raised is a community organisation that has over 46 acres of community grounds because there are lot of different organisations working there, all on a voluntary basis.  The person on community employment supervises the maintenance and does all that work.  Now his time is up.  He has done his three years and it cannot be extended, as I understand it.  The big problem is that the scheme cannot get anyone to replace him.  It has tried extremely hard over the last six months to line up someone but it cannot get anyone.  The scheme is concerned that it will not have someone employed and it would not have the funding to employ someone directly because everything it does is voluntary.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colm Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2353"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If they get a grant for &euro;1,000 they will borrow another &euro;5,000 to get the project done so it is really a challenge for community organisations right around the country.</p></speech>

From 1 June, anybody who is currently engaged with JobPath can also apply for CE places or T&uacute;s places.  I do not think that will solve the problem, however, because I have not had large numbers of people on JobPath banging down my door demanding CE places.  We will still have difficulty recruiting people to CE jobs while we are sending away people who want to be on CE.  That makes no sense to me whatsoever.</p> <p>The only commitment I can give the Senator is that I am going to fix this.  There is no obvious fix for me right now but I will continue to work until I fix it.  I ask the Senator for the name of the person who has come to the end of the three-year service.  I will have a look into it for him.</p></speech>

They are in good health and are enjoying their job and would love to continue in their job after they reach 65.  At the moment, the Department is looking at legislation and reviewing the situation but if these people were to go back into employment in the public service they would have to start on point 1 of the scale again, as if they were new employees.  The experience they have built up over the years has to be taken into account and I am concerned that we are losing people with experience from some organisations.  When people want to stay on, everything should be done to encourage them and to allow them to stay in employment for a few more years to give something back to the organisations for which they worked.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-05-09a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1267" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018050900002#C00500"><p>As the Senator is aware, on December 2017, at the request of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, the Government agreed that the compulsory retirement age of most public servants recruited before 1 April 2004 should be increased to age 70.  This is the only group of public servants who currently have a compulsory retirement age of lower than 70.  The decision arose on foot of a review of the current statutory and operational considerations giving rise to barriers to extended participation in the public service workforce, which was carried out by my Department with public service employers last year.</p> <p>Primary legislation is required for the changes approved by Government to be implemented.  The Attorney General&rsquo;s office has been asked to prioritise the drafting of the necessary legislation so that the new compulsory retirement age will become effective as soon as possible.  The drafting process is under way and the Bill is on the list of priority legislation for publication in the current session.  Indeed, I understand that the drafting of the legislation is significantly advanced with an expected publication date, subject to Government approval, of next month.  It is not possible to determine the length of time it will take for a Bill to be drafted and pass through both Houses of the Oireachtas, given the need for meticulous drafting, ongoing detailed policy considerations, and the scheduling requirements of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Bill is, however, being treated as a priority and I know that the Minister intends to bring forward the necessary legislation as soon as possible.</p> <p>The Minister wrote to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach earlier this year requesting it to undertake pre-legislative scrutiny on the general scheme of the Bill at an early date.  In response, the committee indicated that, while it does not intend to undertake pre-legislative scrutiny on this Bill, it will engage fully on the draft legislation in the context of the formal legislative process.  This approach is likely to facilitate passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas and the Minister has welcomed the support of the committee in this regard.</p> <p>The new compulsory retirement age will not come into effect until the necessary legislation is commenced.  In order to make some accommodation for public servants who reach the age of 65 in the period between the Government decision of 5 December and the commencement of the necessary legislation, the Government approved some limited interim arrangements which became effective from the date of the Government decision.  The interim arrangements, which have to respect the current statutory position of the compulsory retirement age of 65, will, through "retire and re-hire", enable pre-2004 public servants who reach the age of 65 to remain in employment until they reach the age of eligibility for the State pension contributory, which is currently 66, subject to certain conditions.  Details of these interim implementation arrangements have been put in place by the relevant sectors.</p></speech>

It is good news but, in the meantime, people want to stay on.  I understand that the Minister has put interim measures in place and I would like to find out what they are.  It is very unfair to expect someone to go back to point 1 on the scale.  People who have given their time and commitment to a job need to be looked after.  It is because they love their job that they want to stay on.  Perhaps I could talk to the Department about this issue.</p></speech>

The passage of the proposed legislation will, I believe, address any misgivings of public servants regarding the current temporary arrangements.  However, those temporary arrangements must respect the current compulsory statutory retirement age of 65.  Once the legislation is commenced, public servants who choose to remain beyond the age of 65 will not be in the position of having retired and been re-hired as is currently the case.</p> <p>It is intended that the new legislation will allow for the retention of public servants who reach the age of 65 following the commencement of the legislation on current terms and conditions.  Additional service will count towards pension accrual subject to the statutory maximum of 40 years and pension entitlements will then become payable at the date of retirement.  Finally, both the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and I look forward to securing early passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas and we ask the indulgence of this and the other House for its speedy passage.</p></speech>

This morning I was absolutely shocked and horrified after learning that more than 500 people in Dublin have been warned by garda&iacute; that their lives are in danger.  Unfortunately, many of these people are involved in the drugs trade and many of the threats are gang related.  There seems to be no end in sight or plan put in place by the Government to counter the scourge of drug-related crime in our city.  The people living in the inner city and the communities of the inner city should not have to live in fear on a daily basis.  We learn that of the 500, 11 are in imminent danger and Garda resources are now deployed on a preservation-of-life beat.  What is most worrying is that the assistant commissioner, Pat Leahy, intimated that the Hutch and Kinahan feud was unlikely to end any time soon.  I call on the Minister to come to the House to address the matter and outline how the Government plans to support inner-city communities who are affected by this scourge.</p><p>The second issue I will raise is housing and homelessness statistics.  It is a subject I have raised on many occasions in the House and I reiterate calls for the Minister of Housing, Planning and Local Government to come to the House and confirm whether he instructed local authorities to amend or reclassify homeless figures in any way.  Why was there a deliberate attempt by the Minister to reduce the figures of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government by misrepresenting people's situations?  We all know from our clinics there has not been a massive increase or recovery in the social housing lists across the country.  Does the Minister find the monthly publishing of these lists and accountability tiring and troublesome?  We need to know exactly what is going on here.</p><p>In the meantime, we know rents are increasing, house prices are spiralling and the State is contemplating the acquisition of private lands when there are huge tranches of public lands lying idle where houses could be built.  Another facet is new-build houses.  If any Member has been on <i>daft.ie</i>or <i>myhome.ie, </i>they will see that a lot of the new-build estates are shown as price on application, POA.  It is really worrying because it seems that developers are making up prices on a weekly basis.  Prices start off at &euro;500,000 for a two-bedroom apartment and we are now seeing two-bedroom apartments in parts of Dublin going for up to &euro;800,000.  There needs to be some measures in place so developers do not just throw out prices.  There needs to be some transparency for consumers because it is not fair.  We need to see fairness in the market.  As we do not have supply, people are able to make hay but ultimately people need to be able to afford houses at a fair and transparent price.</p></speech>

I understand its members met briefly today and elected a chairman, my colleague, Senator Michael McDowell.  I wish all of them well.  It is a difficult job.   I presume it is based on the Manning report.  I cannot pre-empt it because I do not know what its full terms of reference are.  The sooner we know them the better.  I wish Senator McDowell well.  He has vast experience in government.  I wish the entire committee, which is representative of all groups in both Houses of the Oireachtas, well.</p></speech>

It is an unpublished report called the Mulcahy report and is a report into very serious allegations of corruption in planning in Donegal.  The report is on the Minister's desk.  I undertook yesterday to seek further details about it.  I am now satisfied it has been on the Minister's desk since June 2017.  It has very serious implications.  It is in the public domain.  It suggests with regard to colleagues who submitted applications that there was interference.  There were suggestions of forgery of signatures to do with planning.  There was a suggestion that major planning documents were destroyed and that recommendations of planners were destroyed and done away with.  This came out through a whistleblower who formally made these complaints.</p><p>Two investigations were established into these matters.  A final report called the Mulcahy report was delivered to the Minister.  It is very important that we have the Minister in at some point in the very near future to discuss this report or put it into the public domain.  It is unfair for Donegal County Council, its staff and members to have this report hanging over their heads.  I ask that as soon as we can some sort of statement can be issued.  The Minister might give us some indication of his intentions and how he intends to deal with this report but, more importantly, what recommendations will come out of it.</p></speech>

It symbolises its ineptitude to deal with the horrific situation that presents for women.  The words "contempt" and "unfeeling" come to mind when I see the response of the Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar.  It is certainly not the response that I or other women I speak with would expect from a State leader.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Women have died and others are fighting for their lives while the Government fails to act decisively to hold those in a position of responsibility and authority to account.  The women and families affected by this scandal are speaking but the Government is just not listening.  I have spent the past two days in the finance committee questioning the State Claims Agency, and today in the health committee with the Ministers and the HSE.  I have come to the conclusion that the web of unaccountability and the lack of transparency and clear communication pathways are beginning to look like an aerial shot of spaghetti junction on a very foggy day.  This is just not good enough.</p><p>I also ask for the Minister for Finance to come into the House to discuss the approach of the State Claims Agency regarding medical negligence.  There are further questions to be asked in this area but the Minister also needs to take on board the suggestion from my party colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, that the HSE and the State Claims Agency address the situation with the two private American companies rather than have individual women and their families go through legal battles with profit-maximising companies.  The person who presided over the confusion, and played a key part in the decision to contract out these key services to these private American companies, must go and must go now.  He has presided over negligence, concealment and misinformation with the most serious consequences for women and their families.  If we do not do this we are left with the question, "What would it take to hold the head of the HSE to account?"</p></speech>

I wish to ask that the representatives of all groups attend that meeting and vote to remove Standing Order 41.  This is one clear example of Seanad reform that this House can take itself so I ask everybody to attend the meeting and vote to remove Standing Order 41.  If we are serious about Seanad reform we can do this.</p> <p>I extend my congratulations to Senator McDowell on being made chairman.  It was a rocky road to get there and I understand it was opposed by former colleagues but I am sure he will do a good job as he is a very effective lawyer.  I hope, however, that he has learned from the idiotic Bill he introduced, which I do not believe he even read.  It contained nonsensical things such as a requirement to pay &euro;1,000 to stand for Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  What a laughable piece of tripe.  The way it dealt with universities was also nonsense.  Senator McDowell is a very good advocate and can take a brief on the hoof so I hope he has learned from his experiences in the House and from the forensic analysis I did of his lamentable Bill.</p> <p>I also understand that former Senator and now Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, has put himself on this committee.</p></speech>

I have withheld public comment on Deputy Ross but his attitude to the Seanad has, in the past, been marked by a mischievous note and I hope that will be absent from the deliberations of this committee.  As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport - and whatever you are having yourself - his hands will be pretty much full if he was doing his ministerial job.  I am perfectly entitled to say that.

May is mental health awareness month and mental health affects all of us.  There are lots of events across the country to encourage us all to talk more openly about our mental health struggles and experiences.  Pieta House's Darkness into Light 2018 initiative, created by our colleague, Senator Joan Freeman, will take place on Saturday, 12 May at 4.15 a.m. across Ireland.  Last year, 180,000 people walked to promote suicide prevention and to tackle the stigma that leads people to the doors of Pieta House centres.  This year marks the ninth year of the event, which is growing every year.  I will join my family and friends to talk and walk from the dark of night into the morning light to raise awareness.</p> <p>Tomorrow, 10 May, in my own county we will celebrate Hello Carlow Day, when the Carlow Mental Health Association and local business and community groups are encouraging everyone to ask "How are you?"  Little things such as these can really effect change.  Someone asked me recently what mental health was to me.  To me, mental health is in my head.  If I feel I have a conversation with the voice in my head I know I can get through the day.  The days when I cannot talk to that voice and discuss my worries, air my fears and review my emotions, are the days I feel really alone and I worry about my mental health.  That is why I place so much importance on talking.  Maybe it will not be enough but maybe it will be.  Maybe just one conversation will save someone so it is never a bad idea to talk about what is inside one's head and I encourage everybody to support our local events to raise awareness of mental health struggles across society.  I encourage all of us to check in on one another to ask how we are, because that conversation could be the one that changes the course of our day.</p></speech>

My colleague, Senator Conway-Walsh, outlined exactly the approach this State takes to its citizens when they find themselves in conflict or needing to make a claim.</p> <p>Two years ago, I brought the case of Lieutenant Colonel John Hamill to the Seanad and we had two Commencement debates on his issue.  The Ombudsman for the Defence Forces found that he had been wronged but, despite the ruling of the ombudsman, the Department of Defence has sat on its hands and refused to deal with the man by giving him the solution he deserves.  It is outrageous that the Department of Defence uses public money in this way.  The only way this man will now get redress is through the courts and by exposing himself to a massive court battle to get what the ombudsman said he was entitled to.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

The Leader and I and most Members of the House will have seen State and semi-State agencies using the public purse to fight unwinnable court cases.  Why?  It is because it is not their money they are fighting with.  Lieutenant Colonel Hamill served with distinction for this State.  An ombudsman found in his favour that he had been wronged and that he was forced out of the Army at the age of 58 when he should have been promoted to colonel.  What has he to do to vindicate his right?  He has to go to the High Court and expose himself to risk.  That is wrong in every sense of the word and makes me ask how many more citizens are having to sit on their hands and suck up some injustice that was done to them, purely because they do not have the deep pockets the State has.  It is time we kicked this debate out in the open.  I agree with Senator Conway-Walsh.  The State Claims Agency seems to do whatever the hell it wants and that feeds into every other Department.  I would appreciate if the Leader could organise a debate on that issue.</p></speech>

I attended a briefing last Thursday evening, when the report was published.  This has been and continues to be a very difficult time for the 16 families involved.</p> <p>Many of the challenges highlighted in the report indicate that inadequate levels of staffing impacted on training, staff support available and the escalation of more complex cases.  There are almost 150 recommendations in this report.  I was informed last Thursday evening that 90% of them are either implemented or in progress.  Significant improvements have been made to ensure that we have high-quality maternity services at Portiuncula.  One of the most important points made at that meeting was that they are trying to create better working relationships and a better clinical maternity network, particularly with Galway University Hospital.  This is very important in terms of escalating more complex cases.</p> <p>In respect of the difficulties that have arisen in cervical screening, open disclosure is and should be a basic requirement.  This report found that disclosure was unsatisfactory in 17 out of the 18 cases.  As we discussed last week, withholding information from these families, like other women and individuals whom we may not even know about yet, is completely disgraceful and unacceptable.  This must have been very distressing for the families involved.  I have spoken with many families across our region who emphasised that there is excellent care provided at Portiuncula maternity unit and that significant progress has been made through the implementation group that has been established.  Some 17 additional posts have been put in place across obstetrics, anaesthetics and paediatrics. </p> <p>It is important that the Minister, Deputy Harris, comes to the Seanad to discuss maternity services in the context of this review and more generally, in order to ensure that we provide the highest possible standards for mothers and babies.</p></speech>

Some 92% of the Irish population is still expressing support for the EU and EU membership.  It is important that we acknowledge it.  It has come a long way since the foundation in 1951 of the European Coal and Steel Community.  I am sure some of my colleagues who are members of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs will be mentioning Europe Day.</p> <p>If we are going to have a Seanad reform committee, I am delighted that Senator McDowell is to chair it.  I am not so sure I am delighted with some of the other members of whom I was informed this afternoon.  They have obviously done everything in their own constituency, which is where I live, and have so much time on their hands that they can reflect on Seanad reform.  I hope that the committee does not just consider how one gets into this Chamber but also examines what the Seanad could be doing that it is not doing and what it could be doing better.  It is not the Cathaoirleach's or the chairman's fault, but all I have heard so far is about how Senators get in here.  I have heard nothing about what they do when they are here, or what they could be doing and so on.  </p> <p>I heard a speech by the Taoiseach last night in which he mentioned climate change in the course of a much broader debate.  He fairly brushed over the fact that we will not meet our 2020 targets or even our 2030 targets but that we should make our 2050 targets.  It is probably easy to say that we will meet targets 32 years from now.  From 2020, I understand we will be facing fines of between &euro;300 million and &euro;600 million a year.  Surely it would be better if we could achieve the targets.  We should do whatever we need to do in terms of electric vehicles, building insulation of public buildings and private housing and so on.  We should try to mitigate against whatever fines we are going to have to pay.  I call on the Leader to bring in the Minister, Deputy Naughten, to have a debate on climate change and where we are going.  It is not about agriculture or vehicles only.  Let us try to make sure that we mitigate against the worst effects of having to pay these fines and, equally, that we improve the quality of the planet for generations to come.</p></speech>

I assure all Members of the House that this group, which has yet to convene and have a full meeting, will be open to all suggestions from everywhere in this House and will not have a closed mind.  I think I can guarantee that.</p> <p>In response to what Senator Horkan has just said, the Manning report does refer to the role of the Seanad and has ambitious aims to involve the Seanad in European matters, not just looking at secondary legislation but giving some teeth in Irish parliamentary procedure to the Lisbon treaty proposals and other things.  I think it was an English Prime Minister who said, "Reform, reform - aren't things bad enough already?" Whatever worthwhile reform emerges from this process will take time to implement.  A deep and well-organised reform should not cause too much fluttering in the dovecotes here as regards the next election to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</p> <p>I have been reading in the newspapers over the last few days about Dublin City Council's proposals to consider knocking down a lot of its apartment buildings because they are old or whatever.  The funny thing is that the older they are, the better they are.  The communities in them are more settled.  Dublin City Council should not be so devoid of ideas that it would now start to cannibalise its own existing apartment buildings, such as Mercer House off St. Stephen's Green, which are fine buildings.  If there is something needed to modernise them, it should be done.  What we need is more houses, not to be knocking down existing apartment buildings.  The irony is this that with places like Fatima Mansions, St. Theresa's Gardens, O'Devaney Gardens and the like, and some of Ballymun, the more recently a big development has been carried out by Dublin City Council, the worse it has turned out to be in terms of the overall environment for living.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I want to put on record my strong opposition to the idea that Dublin City Council should start to devour its own decent buildings to create space for replacement buildings when there is plenty of land in Dublin, including land that can be acquired via compulsory purchase orders, if necessary, to provide decent homes in the city centre for people who want to have a decent way of life and access to affordable and social housing.</p></speech>

It is an encouraging statistic, but far more encouraging is that, in the 18 to 24 years bracket, the figure is 97%.  If North Korea made these figures up, we would still struggle to believe them.</p> <p>Something that is discouraging, however, is the Irish population's lack of linguistic skills in second, third or fourth languages.  Will the Leader call on the Minister for Education and Skills to attend the House to discuss a strategy that encourages young and not-so-young Irish people to take up additional languages, specifically European ones like French, Spanish, Polish and beyond?  As we embark upon the post-Brexit era when our exposure to and reliance on the Continent will grow, it is important that Irish people not simply do so with an ability in English, a lesser ability as Gaeilge and no third or fourth language.  This is putting us behind the curve economically and socially on a European level.</p></speech>

A company called Go Safe, whose parent company is based on the Isle of Man, won the contract, which came into effect on 1 May 2017 and will last for six years with a 12-month extension.  The value of the contract over seven years is just over &euro;100 million.  It is due for renewal in 2023 or 2024.  The number of hours cameras are in place is roughly 90,000 annually plus an additional 1,500 hours per month.  That is approximately &euro;160 that the company is paid every hour.  In some ways, that is not bad going.</p> <p>I would like the Minister for Justice and Equality to outline to the House the strategy, the contract, who is behind the Go Safe parent company, what other company is involved, what Go Safe's strategy is and how it decides where to place speed vans.  I would also like him to give an outline per county, road or partial road and to tell us what the company is doing.  The Irish people are entitled to this information.  I believe that many of them are quietly asking these questions.  Time and again, people are flashing their lights to signal that there is a speed van ahead.  I am not saying the vans do not do a good job, but there are questions of accountability, so I would appreciate it if the Minister was invited to attend.</p></speech>

I raised it at the health committee this morning and want to do so again now.  It relates to pending cases.  I agree with my colleague about having the Minister attend to deal with a number of issues around maternity care and CervicalCheck.  At the committee meeting, someone asked about the need for legislation.  I do not believe there is a need, but the HSE and the State Claims Agency could reach settlements in those pending cases where there is clear evidence of negligence.  The State Claims Agency could then step into the shoes of the claimant in order to recover the moneys from the company that provided the analysis, be it in the US or elsewhere.  This would be done instead of forcing people to go through court processes and delays.  We need to give this suggestion serious consideration.  At this morning's meeting, I asked the Minister to address it.</p> <p>The House should debate maternity services and whether there other issues of which we should be mindful if we are to ensure that a catastrophe like the recent one does not recur.  The health service faces many challenges, for example, recruitment of consultants and the need to compete with other jurisdictions just to retain medical and nursing staff.  It would be appropriate for the House to debate these matters and the question of how to proceed.  Linked with Senator Hopkins's point, Portiuncula Hospital recently advertised a consultant obstetrician's position for which there were no applicants.  Indeed, there are many consultant positions for which there are no applicants.  We should examine this issue now instead of waiting to respond to another catastrophe.  I support my colleague in seeking that debate.</p></speech>

Allegations of nepotism and other corrupt practices have been coming out from Donegal County Council for more than a decade, with whistleblowers risking their livelihoods and standing to release information about low standards and shady practices.  The former Green Party Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Mr. John Gormley, commissioned reviews of such allegations in Donegal, Carlow and Offaly only to have the reviews killed by the Minister in the next Government, Commissioner Phil Hogan.  Subsequent internal reviews claimed to find nothing, yet these were rejected by the courts and an independent report was ordered.  That report has sat for almost a year gathering dust in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p> <p>Past Green Party Members of this Chamber and the D&aacute;il, such as Ms D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca, Mr. Paul Gogarty and Mr. Trevor Sargent, have had a proud record of standing against low standards in local government.  They were often told that they were doing it wrong, not adhering to protocol and not observing their place, yet they were eventually vindicated.  My Green Party colleague, Dublin City Council member, Mr. Patrick Costello, is taking up the fight and has lodged a request to access the report in question under the Aarhus Convention.</p> <p>We have seen the consequences of the corruption in planning that has been exposed by various tribunals in recent decades.  The last thing I want to see is another lengthy and costly tribunal, yet that is exactly what the Minister's delay will end up causing.  When will the independent report be published and what remedial measures will be taken by the Government to tackle these problems?</p></speech>

It is the biggest issue.  We need to try to bring confidence to the system because currently that confidence is draining from it.  There are issues as people are forced to go down legal avenues, which is totally unacceptable when there is a clear matter of accountability to be sorted.  Senator Burke has raised the issue quite capably and there must be movement on it.  We cannot drag families through the courts, as we have seen in the past few days.</p><p>I listened with some sadness to an interview on RT&Eacute; radio yesterday with Mr. Stephen Teap from Cork and his story of how his poor wife, Irene, was lost.  She was one of the 17 women who died.  These are very serious cases and accountability at the very top is required.  We need to do the right thing in this regard.  The accountability from the top man needs to be there and he must be straight.  The Health Service Executive, HSE, boss needs to consider what he is doing.  The lack of compassion is a major issue.  It is something we must consider as a Government.  The boss of the HSE must take responsibility for this decision.  It is sad and I hope we can get some closure for the people who have lost their loved ones.  We should be able to put a process in place to put confidence back into the system.  Sadly, that confidence is lacking currently.  I would welcome an opportunity to discuss the matters raised by Senator Burke, in particular.  We do not want these families going down the legal avenue.  There must be a more sympathetic way of doing business rather than putting these people through a court case to get what is due to them from this sad issue.</p><p>Counselling services must also be put in place.  Those of us who listened to that man's interview know he had no counselling when he got the news about how his wife was misdiagnosed.  The HSE must seriously look at that.  It must consider the whole family and the patient rather than having the clinical approach of providing information and seeing what can be done.  There are many questions and we must learn from them.  We must welcome the scoping inquiry, which is positive, and we need to learn fast how to deal with people, especially those affected by this very sad affair.</p></speech>

Perhaps this was covered by a Member previously on the Order of Business but it is quite startling.  It is noticeable that more and more of the resources of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the city go towards preventing killings due to the internecine feuding going on between the infamous Kinahan and Hutch people.  There are other minor feuds as well.  I reside for half the week on the north side of the inner city and I am becoming more aware of the increasing licentiousness, rough and untold behaviour on the streets of our city in broad daylight, and not even late at night.  I am here 11 years.  The Garda need every possible resource it can be given to deal with this.</p><p>Some may say these guys are criminals and it is no big deal what they do to each other.  That may or may not be the case.  There is a danger to innocent lives and to people caught in the crossfire who are living in fear.  Security is being compromised and people are afraid to speak out or move in certain areas of the city, which is a worrying trend.  It might be timely to have a debate on Dublin city crime and perhaps Garda funding and resources in general.</p></speech>

Have I heard correctly that a Cabinet Minister will sit on the committee?  It is surely a first.  I very much welcome Senator McDowell's indication that he is open to all sorts of suggestions.  We all have ideas for the Seanad.  Perhaps the Leader will outline in his response how his hands are tied, if they are at all, and the terms of reference.  Is there any general information he can give us?</p></speech>

On Europe Day is it not great that we can celebrate our participation in Europe and the Eurovision song contest final?  As Senator Horkan rightly stated, it celebrates the importance of Europe to us as a nation.  Survey results have indicated that 92% of our people want to remain in Europe, which sends a positive message to all of us as Europeans.  We are at the heart of Europe.</p><p>Senators Ardagh and Ned O'Sullivan raised the issue of threats to life as detailed in <i>The Irish Times </i>report this morning.  I reiterate that gangland crime has no place in a civilised society and any threat to life, as described by both Senators, is to be condemned out of hand.  It should not and is not being tolerated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I remind Senator Ardagh, in particular, that this Government set up Operation Hybrid with the Garda in the context of the Kinahan-Hutch feud.  There were increased resources for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and new legislation around the Criminal Assets Bureau.  I remind the House that the previous Government reopened Templemore and we have seen an increase in the number of garda&iacute;.  We have also seen a commitment to the civilianisation of the force to allow more garda&iacute; on the street.  There is a commitment to have 800 new members in 2018.  Garda numbers increased to 13,551 by the end of last year, an increase of 600 in that year.  I encourage people to become aware of the facts.</p><p>We have seen an increase in resourcing around overtime and expenditure for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There has been &euro;1.65 billion allocated to the Garda Vote for overtime in 2018, which is an increase of 2%.  A Supplementary Estimate was brought forward yesterday by the Minister, Deputy Flanagan.  It is important to recognise that we must stand up to crime and criminals.  We must stand with people in communities in the inner city, as mentioned by Senators Ned O'Sullivan and Ardagh.  Suggesting the Government is doing nothing is incorrect.  Members should cast their minds back to the Garda special crime task force established in 2016, which was again aimed at targeting those crime gangs in our capital city.  The work is supported by the increase in resources by the Government.  I accept we need to do more and I will always stand up for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> The issue of homelessness was raised by Senator Ardagh.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has not in any way changed, tampered with or massaged the figures.  He commissioned a report from the Dublin Region Homeless Executive to investigate increasing numbers with a view to preparing a detailed report and recommendations.  There was an issue with Louth County Council.  The Minister is committed, as is the Government, to prioritising the tackling of the issue of homelessness.</p><p>Senators Boyhan and Grace O'Sullivan raised the issue of the Mulcahy report.  I have no information for the House regarding this particular matter.  I am happy for the Minister to come to the House on it.  If both Senators put it down as a Commencement matter, however, they may get a quicker answer.</p><p>Senators Conway-Walsh, Craughwell, Hopkins, Colm Burke and Lombard raised the issue around the cervical screening programme, the way in which women have been badly let down, the issue of the State Claims Agency and the report on Portiuncula Hospital published last week.  This is a distressing, harrowing, disgusting and tragic chapter in our nation's history.  It is imperative that we get answers and all the facts into what took place and transpired.  That is why the Government has set up a statutory inquiry.  The Government and all Members want to see accountability.  The priority is women's health and getting the answers.  The Government is listening.  That is why we want to ensure that the statutory inquiry establishes every single fact and puts things right.  It must also restore confidence in the cervical cancer screening programme and in our health system in general.</p><p>What we do not want to see happen is a race to have a head roll and then a vacuum which must be filled.  I want to see every person, not just Tony O'Brien, held to account regarding this issue.  It is easy to point the finger at Tony O'Brien.  He is just one person.  There are many different layers into which we must delve down to get the answers for the women and their families that they deserve.  That is why the Taoiseach has asked the Attorney General to settle such cases.  We cannot assume all cases will be the same.  I agree with Senators Conway-Walsh, Lombard and Craughwell that we cannot put women and their families through the harrowing experience, hardship and difficulty of going up the steps of a courthouse and into a courtroom for a prolonged time.  That day is over.  That is why the Taoiseach has asked the Attorney General, where possible, to mediate and have these cases settled.</p></speech>

That is why we have the whole issues around disclosure and accountability.  It is important, in the long term, that we avoid these cases going to court.  There is a programme of reform initiated by the Government and we will see the outcomes.  I agree with Senator Conway-Walsh that there must be complete answers.  We cannot allow for obfuscation.  I want to see the answers and I hope we will ensure this will happen.  I hope that Dr. Gabriel Scally's inquiry will be able to get to the bottom of this matter.  He said he may not be able to get all the facts.  However, he has undertaken his work.  He is an experienced medical practitioner and has a distinguished career.  I wish him well in his investigation.  From talking to the Minister for Health and his officials, I know they want to see this matter resolved on behalf of the women of Ireland and their families.</p> <p>As I said on a Bill yesterday, the Irish people go berserk when there is no accountability.  They are correct.  We need to see that happen and I know we will.  It is important we have this matter resolved.</p> <p>Senator Norris raised the issue of his motion before the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges, CPP.  In a politically charged environment - I am a fairly good man myself to be involved in political charges &ndash; this afternoon's attack on the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, was unfair.  He has never once refused to attend the House.  He has always been available to participate in this Chamber on the various debates we have asked him to attend.  I think it is unfair the way he was characterised this afternoon.</p> <p>I join with Senator Byrne in appealing to farmers to apply online for the basic payment scheme with its closing date on 15 May.  I congratulate all those involved in the town and village renewal scheme and hope those interested in it will apply this year.</p> <p>Senator Murnane O'Connor raised the issue of mental health and that May is mental health awareness month.  I wish all those participating in the Pieta House Darkness into Light event next weekend every success.  I commend all who work in the area of mental health.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, is doing a sterling job with cross-party support in this House.  Senator Murnane O'Connor is correct that talking is right.  It is important to talk and highlight the issue completely.</p> <p>Senator Craughwell also raised the issue of Lieutenant Colonel Hamill.  I have not got the information he needs but I am happy to talk to the Senator afterwards.  Where wrong is done, it should not have to be solved at the 11th hour on the steps of a courthouse.  We should seek mediation by both parties much earlier.</p></speech>

Like many of us, we would like to offer our sympathies to the families whose lives have been devastated and tragically affected by the failures of the care given to them at the hospital.  From looking at the news last Thursday night, what should have been a joyful and happy occasion turned out to be one of grief and sadness.  I thank the families for coming forward to share their experiences with the review team.  What we need now is absolute action.  We have seen changes with the appointments of staff at the hospital.  To the untrained eye, however, some of the issues involved, from reading X-rays to different functions, were not rocket science.  I was stunned when I read the report and the testimony given.  I welcome that we have seen changes.  There is lead management in place and a different model for the delivery of care, along with significant investment in the hospital.  Senator Hopkins is right that there is a need for the Minister to attend the House.  I am happy for him to attend on a debate on the national maternity strategy, an important piece of work being done by the Government and which I hope will deliver for women.</p> <p>Senator Horkan raised the important issue of climate change.  The European Commissioner, Phil Hogan, referred to it in his address to the House several weeks ago.  There is an obligation on us to have a conversation around climate change, in particular given the importance of agriculture to the country.  The farming community has a critical role to play in the issue of climate change.  I am happy for the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, to attend the House on this matter.  We must prioritise it and keep it to the forefront, in light of the fact that the US President, Donald Trump, has taken the US out of the Paris climate change agreement.</p> <p>Senator McDowell raised the issue of Dublin City Council's proposals to demolish its apartment buildings.  It is a matter for the council.  However, he is correct that we need more housing.  How we arrive at a model of delivery of housing is one that we can have a debate on and I am glad for the Minister to come to the House in that regard.</p> <p>Senator Richmond raised the issue of linguistic skills.  It is one we need to address given that we will soon be the only English language speaking country in the European Union.  It is also important we promote the use of other languages with our schoolgoing population through our curriculum.  I will be happy for the Minister to come to the House for a debate on that issue.</p> <p>Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh raised the issue of the location of speed vans.  It is important to recognise that one third of the deaths on our roads are caused by speeding.  I know from travelling around the country that the speed vans are always in the same place.  One could almost set one's clock as to when they will be at a certain location.  They are, however, in places where there are many accidents.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Having said that, they should not be used as part of a moneymaking operation either.  It is important that we all work to reduce accidents and deaths on the roads.  Perhaps that means all of us taking the foot off the pedal a little more and being more conscious of speed.  I would be happy for the Minister to come to the House to discuss speed cameras.</p><p>Senator Burke made reference to our health system and the challenges in that regard.</p><p>I have dealt with the remarks of Senators Grace O'Sullivan, Lombard, Ned O'Sullivan and Coghlan in my reply.</p><p>I will conclude by congratulating Senator McDowell on his election and I wish him well.  It is a big committee of 26 people and I hope he can herd the committee to a safe harbour to produce a report in a timely fashion.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, and call on him to address the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-05-09a.98" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018050900002#P00300"><p>On behalf of the Minister for Finance, I welcome the committee's report.  Along with the 2016 report of the Credit Union Advisory Committee, CUAC, and its forerunner, the 2012 report of the Commission on Credit Unions, it makes an important contribution to the debate on credit union reform.  The committee's report was the subject of a memo to the Government and was debated during Private Members' business on 8 March 2018.  Today's debate offers a further opportunity to discuss the report of the committee and reiterate the Government's support for the invaluable role of credit unions in Ireland.</p><p>In line with the Government's position, the Minister believes that credit unions have a key role to play in providing access to credit and other important services in local communities.  The Government has put in place a number of measures so that credit unions can continue to provide these services to their members and to ensure the stability of the sector into the future.  These measures include the establishment of the Commission on Credit Unions in 2011; the publication of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012; the establishment of the Credit Union Restructuring Board, ReBo; the availability of &euro;500 million to support the stability of the credit union movement; the introduction of the stabilisation support scheme; the request to the CUAC to review all recommendations in the commission report; and the establishment of an implementation group to oversee implementation of the CUAC's recommendations.</p><p>The CUAC reported to the Minister for Finance in June 2016 on the implementation of the recommendations of the 2012 Commission on Credit Unions report.  The CUAC found that a small number of recommendations had not been implemented and made recommendations under seven specific headings, the most relevant relating to long-term lending, consultation and engagement, and tiered regulation.  The committee's report makes 27 recommendations, many of which are common to the CUAC report, such as tiered regulation, business model development, and consultation and engagement.  Much of what the committee is recommending is already under way in terms of the work of the CUAC, the CUAC report implementation group, the Central Bank and the Department of Finance.</p><p>In response to its report and to address a number of additional areas expanded on by the committee, the Minister wrote to it in December 2017 to update it on the work of the implementation group.  A further update issued to the committee on 21 April.</p><p>Following publication of its report in June 2016, the CUAC continued working on enabling a coherent implementation plan to be devised for the implementation group, tasked with overseeing and monitoring the implementation of each recommendation within the CUAC's report.  Each of the representative bodies was invited to nominate one person to the implementation group, which held its inaugural meeting in February 2017 and has met 12 times to date.</p><p>Tiered regulation was the subject of consultation by the Central Bank, which proposed a two-tier regulatory model, that being, CP76.  As stated in the 2016 CUAC report:</p><blockquote>The Central Bank referred to submissions received in response to CP76 and indicated that it was 'unclear what form of tiered regulation the sector actually wanted', adding that the sector also indicated that the 'timing was not appropriate' for the introduction of a tiered approach, given that restructuring was in progress.  The Central Bank also noted that there were 'significant burdens on the sector at the time'.</blockquote> <p>In light of the feedback received, the Central Bank did not propose to introduce a tiered regulatory framework for credit unions at that time.  The implementation group continues to consider tiered regulation and hopes to make progress in the next few months.  However, a lack of tiered regulation should not restrict business model development nor restrict the Central Bank from delivering proportionate supervision.</p><p>A Programme for a Partnership Government recognises the potential role that credit unions can play in housing finance.  To that end, the revised regulations for credit unions, which commenced on 1 March, clarify the scope and the manner in which credit unions can support the development of social housing.  The regulations, which introduce a practical form of tiering, make provision for investment in tier 3 approved housing bodies, AHBs, by credit unions with greater than &euro;100 million in total assets through a regulated vehicle.</p><p>The implementation group has held discussions on business model development and is finalising a paper outlining some of the key areas that are being, and could be, developed further by credit unions and representative bodies without changes to regulations.  The CUAC is also focusing on this matter during 2018 and recently met a number of credit unions to discuss their business models and how they expected to grow their businesses.</p><p>In addressing the business model agenda, the Central Bank has announced the establishment of a new forum to engage directly with credit union CEOs.  The forum will give those progressive credit unions with the capability and desire to undertake business model transformation a mechanism to avail of practical regulatory support when seeking to address their commercial challenges.</p><p>On 3 November 2017, the Minister provided the joint committee with two documents prepared by the implementation group and submitted by the latter to the Central Bank.  The first document relates to section 35 of the Credit Union Act 1997, as amended, which provides for the making of loans by credit unions.  The paper details a range of proposals for consideration in the Central Bank review of section 35 that could provide for a material increase in long-term lending for those credit unions that would have the capability to do so.  The Central Bank has commenced a review of credit union lending limits and acknowledged that the matter of the limits has been highlighted in various fora as an area of regulatory review, including through the implementation group.  To inform this review, a questionnaire issued to all credit unions on 11 April 2018.</p><p>The Central Bank also proposes issuing a formal consultation paper later in the year.  This paper sets out key principles for consideration by the Central Bank that may assist in progressing the CUAC recommendation that service-level agreements be introduced.  The introduction of such an agreement is a matter for the Central Bank, but the CUAC and the implementation group have strongly recommended its introduction.  The Minister wrote to the Central Bank Governor to outline his support for these matters being progressed in early 2018 and his officials also met the Central Bank in February to progress both papers.  The Minister has extended the term of the implementation group to the end of this year to allow sufficient time for the completion of the group's current work programme.  The progress I have outlined provides a solid platform from which to proceed with future reforms.</p><p>The Government recognises the important role of credit unions as a volunteer co-operative movement in Ireland managing &euro;16.9 billion of assets and a loan book of &euro;4.5 billion at December 2017.  A Programme for a Partnership Government commits to the development of a strategy for growth and development for the credit union sector.  The Government recognises that the sector requires further support to help overcome the significant challenges it faces and has a clear policy to support the strategic growth and development of credit unions.  The Minister is committed to the implementation of all the recommendations of the CUAC report in a cohesive manner.  He looks forward to continuing to work together with all stakeholders, including the committee, to support credit unions as they progress and develop.</p></speech>

We will all be singing from the same hymn sheet where many of his comments are concerned.  Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes the report, having pushed for its publication, and everyone shares the view that credit unions are a vital part of communities across Ireland.  There is a connection to a credit union in every small and large town and parish.</p> <p>It is fair to say that there has been a great deal of change and consolidation in the sector.  In the past month or so, I attended the 50th anniversary celebration of the Stillorgan credit union, which recently merged with the Donnybrook credit union to become the South Dublin Credit Union.  They were both celebrating 50 years.  It was a great evening.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerry Horkan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2476"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2476&amp;amp;pid=GerryHorkan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It shows how far they have come and how well they have done in the context of everything that happened in the banking and finance sector.  Many credit unions probably had money on deposit in places such as Anglo Irish Bank.  If it had been let fail totally, the credit union movement could have suffered.  The larger banks could have learned from its performance and prudence and how it had behaved during the crisis.  It important that I acknowledge and include the fact that the confidence and supply agreement states a strategy for the growth and development of the credit union sector needs to be established.  That was stitched in by Fianna F&aacute;il in its discussions with Fine Gael on the formation of the Government.  </p><p>It is also important to point out that credit unions have about &euro;8 billion of what they identify as surplus funds.  These are funds available to invest in small and medium enterprises, SMEs and some of them - this gives hope to a lot of people - could be put into affordable housing projects.  I refer to those that would be sustainable, provide a return for credit unions and equally provide valuable social and affordable housing.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach -  almost of all us of here, certainly me as Vice Chairman to Deputy John McGuinness, Senators Rose Conway-Walsh and Kieran O'Donnell and the Minister of State, Deputy Michael D'Arcy, until his recent promotion, were members of the committee - deemed it to be the right time, after the financial crisis, to look at the status of credit unions.  I refer to how they had weathered the storm and reviewing the impact of the measures put in place.  </p><p>We need urgent action by the Government, the Department and the Central Bank.  We also need tiered regulation, to which the Minister of State referred.  We need the Government to show some leadership on the social and affordable housing model.  I understand the Department is a reluctant to do so and perhaps it is fair to say it is reluctant to do anything that would damage the pillar banks.  That is possibly because it has shareholdings in them but equally because it is trying to make sure they will survive.  Amidst a housing crisis, however, it is incredible that the Government seems to be allowing this opportunity to slide through its hands.  </p><p>The Minister of State has outlined much of what is in contained in the report.  It is important, however, to outline some of the main recommendations, including the need for a timely review of the framework and regulatory requirement that tiered regulation be implemented.  At the celebration of the Stillorgan and Donnybrook Credit Union, now South Dublin Credit Union, proportionate regulation was a topic of discussion - that the same standards did not necessarily have to apply to the smallest as to the largest and that the regulations applied sometimes were a little excessive and onerous.  We have to remember that many of the people involved in the credit union movement are volunteers.  They are doing it on a part-time basis and do a very professional job, but it is not all they are doing.  It important to allow the sector to have proportionate balanced regulation that would not make it difficult for it to operate.  I am not for one second advocating light touch regulation, to use that famous phase.  There is a balance to be struck.  Most of the people involved with the credit union movement get the point I am making and I am sure the Minister of State does also.   </p><p>Another recommendation made after the publication of the report in 2016 was that the implementation group meet regularly to oversee implementation of the seven key recommendations.  In identifying potential investment streams to enable the credit union movement to diversify serious consideration should be given to allowing the credit union movement to utilise assets in approved housing bodies and in the process alleviate the housing crisis.  Where applications were being made by the credit union sector concerning new business proposals, it was recommended that the Department and the registrar provide clear and explicit feedback on the merits of the applications and, crucially, identify enhancements that would support them.  It was also recommended that greater emphasis be placed on the important role of the credit union sector in ensuring the financial inclusion of citizens.  </p><p>I will mention a couple of points that the Irish League of Credit Unions, ILCU, communicated to all of us.  It is important that they be included in the debate.  They are people who are on the front line every day, experiencing the operation of the credit union movement, of which many of us are members.  The ILCU emphasises the legislative framework and the regulatory requirement for tiered regulation to ensure a proportionate application of the regulations.  I refer also to the CUAC recommendation for a full review of section 35 lending and concentration limits.  It will allow credit unions to develop and grow beyond the current permitted limits and is endorsed by the committee.  It was also pointed out that a new appeals mechanism should be introduced to allow credit unions to appeal regulatory decisions made by the Central Bank to an independent body.  The report reflects the ILCU's view that the regulator reserve ratio is a crude and blunt instrument that does not take account of the risk faced by credit unions. </p><p>On investments, the committee recommended that all parties participate constructively in the consultation paper on the credit union investment framework, CP 109, while expressing concerns that some of the proposals would limit the potential investment yields for credit unions.  It also recommended that the credit union movement be empowered to contribute to alleviating the housing crisis and that the liquidity rules were overly focusing on cash and that consideration be given to investment in bonds as liquid assets.  On levies, it was recommended that those imposed on the credit union sector be urgently reviewed transparently to ensure there was a clear rationale and legal basis for any levy imposed.  The common bond was also emphasised.  I am sure people are aware of it.  The committee recognised the common bond structure as a unique and distinct characteristic of credit unions.  For that reason, it supported retention of the common bond, as any dilution of that feature would permanently damage the credit union movement.  </p><p>It is important to acknowledge, as the Minister of State has, that the credit movement is a fantastic asset.  The Minister of State has acknowledged that.  Like any institution that involves public funds or people putting their money into it, it needs appropriate and proportionate regulation.  There has been much consolidation in the sector.  The credit union movement has served the country well and it is ready and willing to serve it well into the future.  It has ambitious targets for growth and to become involved in sectors in a measured, balanced and reasonable way to alleviate needs in society.  A lot of effort needs to be put in by departmental officials, the Minister of State and all of us to find where the blockages are and discover what the resistance is, if there is any.  Let us try to work together to deliver houses.  </p><p>I refer to using funds for people who are homeless and living in emergency accommodation.  They are not in a position to buy houses at the prices at which they are being sold, but they are looking for affordable houses.  Perhaps there is scope to provide not just social houses but also affordable houses, perhaps on a shared ownership or equity stake bais or whatever it happens to be.  It is important to acknowledge that the report states credit unions have become a part of the fabric of the financial sector.  There are 27 recommendations and I am not going to go through all of them.  We all know what they are.  I have only eight minutes in which to contribute, but I could talk for hours about this issue.  It is a good report.  Well done to the committee and those involved in the preparation of the report.  I look forward to its recommendations being implemented and the credit union movement thriving into the future.</p></speech>

I was, however, involved on the board of a credit union.  In recent years there seems to have been an effort to force amalgamations, downsize the number of credit unions and almost restrict them to the point where they cannot operate.  The report provides a way forward and is something at which we need to look.  The Minister of State will know from his own local area that credit unions are the heart and soul of communities.  Many people in their first job took out their loan for a car through their credit union.  They got their start through their credit union.  However, credit unions have moved on.  Some of them are still small local entities that look after the needs of local people, but some of them are capable of doing an awful lot more.  It is about providing them with the wherewithal to expand.</p> <p>I am thinking, in particular, of the credit unions of the Teachers' Union of Ireland, TUI, in which I was involved, the Association of Secondary School Teachers of Ireland, ASTI, the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, and the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, INTO.  All of these credit unions deal with professionals employed within a sector with guaranteed public jobs.  There is no reason they should not be involved in mortgage provision, for example.  That is something we need to look into.  We need to allow these credit unions to expand to allow young professionals to get mortgages.  The Minister of State knows this because he has his hand on the pulse and a teachers' conference wa held in Wexford this year.  Young teachers, nurses and garda&iacute; are not able to get mortgages based on their salary.  What my colleague, Senator Gerry Horkan, spoke about - shared ownership over a period of time - is something the credit unions could do.  They could provide for direct deductions at source.  We need to look at and listen to those credit unions that are now highly professionalised.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

We now need to allow it to grow.  I am particularly interested in the credit union movement investing in social housing, where possible.  I am also interested in the micro-finance issue because indigenous industry is what will keep this country going.  While it is great to have Google, eBay and so on the small start-up by one person, which expands to become an employer of ten or 15 people is also important, because ten people working in 50 companies is a lot of people working.  The SME sector can match any multinational.  Micro-finance will be important in this regard.  </p><p>I do not propose to go through the recommendations as they have been already outlined by my colleague, Senator Horkan.  Coming from a rural community the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, will be aware of the impact a good credit union can have on its community.  It can help a community to grow and, thus, it will also grow.  I am not suggesting that we should take the foot off the pedal with respect to keeping an eye on what is going on because that is vital if the credit unions are not to get into trouble.  The credit union movement came out of the economic crash pretty good in comparison with the high street banks.  There were a couple of disaster stories but overall credit unions provided the stability that people needed.  The fact that this is all done on the backs of people volunteering needs to encouraged and assisted in every way possible.  I believe that the Minister of State is dedicated and committed to this sector.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-05-09a.103" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1374" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018050900002#R00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, to the House.  He is a good friend to the Seanad and he is doing a good job as a Minister of State.  Credit unions are hugely important at rural, urban and city levels.  As an accountant, I had my own practice for many years.  I had a range of clients, many of whom, having been refused credit facilities by the local banks were able to get a loan from their local credit union, the drafts for which were lodged in the mainstream banks.  Many of those businesses are thriving today.  We owe a huge debt of gratitude to the credit union movement and those who volunteer in this sector for the service they have provided.  During difficult times in the 1990s credit unions kept alive a lot of what I would regard to be viable businesses.</p> <p>While some of the credit unions got into difficulty, many did not.  Many were run in a very prudent manner.  We currently have a mainstream banking system, which is necessary, but many of the big banks have left the market.  We now have two very large banks and a third bank, Permanent TSB, which is not really a business bank.  Previously we had a multitude of banks providing competition in the market, many of which took reckless risks, but nevertheless there was competition in the market.  There is a role for the credit union movement in filling this gap, including by way of investment in social housing but we need to find a structure to allow that to happen.  The credit union movement accepts deposits from local people and it uses those deposits to lend to other local people.  It is a very simple and straightforward model but it also has to make a return.  For many years the credit union movement would have put its money on deposit but because the return on deposits was so low some credit unions began investing in perpetual bonds at high rates of interest and this caused problems.  We have to find a sustainable model for the credit union sector.  It needs to evolve and become a lending mechanism for the small business sector.  Also, credit unions must be locally based.  In my experience, people will always repay their credit union because they invariably know who is managing it and often their families will have been involved in creating it and this builds loyalty.  This loyalty was evident right across the country in respect of the credit unions that got into trouble.  The people who had money on deposit with them were extraordinarily loyal to them.  We cannot lose that but we have to balance it with prudent management and prudent regulation, but regulation which does not strangle the sector.  </p> <p>There has been an amalgamation of some credit unions and there may be further amalgamations.  Many of these amalgamations have been sensible.  Ultimately, the purpose of the credit union is to provide a service to the people living in its area.  We cannot lose this ethos.  When a gap emerged between the banks and the credit union sector, the credit unions sought to fill that gap and they began providing loans which kept businesses and local economies going.  We may need to consider putting this service on a more formal footing and to set limits in this regard.  We cannot allow credit unions to become banks.  That is not the purpose for which they were set up.  They were set up to serve local need but consideration should be given to their providing funding towards investment in housing projects.  There is room for this investment.  It would be a secure investment for the people who deposits in the credit union movement.</p> <p>Another issue we need to examine, which comes up regularly, is the limits around the amount of money people can borrow and the limits which individual credit unions can borrow.  The current limits on short-term and long-term lending need to be reviewed.  The credit unions that got into difficulty had invested in property, which was outside of their normal area.  They got involved in development and in certain cases this got out of control and that is what caused the problem.  Their core business was not at issue.  I have dealt with credit unions for many years and I am a huge advocate for them.  The credit union is now the only financial institution outside of the post office that has a network nationally.  Every parish in Ireland has a credit union.  Some of them may have amalgamated but they are still providing a service.  We cannot lose sight of this.  The question is whether we can build on this sector in terms of allowing it to make large scale investments and thus contribute in a social way to Ireland while at the same time making a return for its members.  We need to find a way of expanding its remit into the SME sector.  I am nervous about it getting involved in the mortgage market but the idea should be looked at.  For me, it is not the core purpose of the credit union sector.</p> <p>I am glad this review took place.  The committee's work in regard to this sector is a work in progress.  I know that the Minister of State has a personal interest in this area.  I salute the credit union movement.  I had a client who even though she had a viable business could not get money from a main bank.  Every week she would go to the credit union, get a draft for &pound;1,000 and then lodge it to her account in the local bank.  We cannot lose this ethos.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Kieran O'Donnell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2207"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2207&amp;amp;pid=KieranODonnell&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Prudence is hugely important.  The credit union movement and its members have come through pain, and what we have to do is ensure we retain the ethos and network, expand the range of services in a prudent way and allow credit unions to make a contribution towards housing while not putting their members' deposits at risk in any way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-05-09a.105" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1378" speakername="Rose Conway Walsh" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018050900002#S00150"><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the Seanad to discuss the report on the credit union movement.  I welcome the publication of the report and the significant amendments that were submitted by various parties.</p> <p>As did other speakers, I commend the work of all of the volunteers and people connected to credit unions, and certainly to all of the credit unions I know, which form the very heart of many communities.  At a time when bank branches are closing and being centralised and digitised, the credit union is becoming even more important in all of our communities.  This is evident throughout the life-cycle, whether it be a student applying for a loan or an elderly person applying for bridging finance while waiting for a housing aid for older people grant where the person has been refused by the banks.  We all agree that credit unions are hugely important and becoming ever more important in our communities.</p> <p>The major problem is the disconnect between the Government's rhetoric and actual action on the credit union sector.  In October 2011, a statement was made in the Seanad that there was a potential black hole of &euro;1 billion in the credit union sector.  That prediction has since proved to be entirely inaccurate.  It was indicative of the attitude of the State and the Government to the credit union sector at the time.</p> <p>Credit unions continue to serve communities all over Ireland with member-focused products.  The report highlights the negative impact the low loan to asset ratios have on credit unions.  The section 35 limitations need to be reviewed.  This has been called for by the report and by the advisory committee.  When will that review start and when will the Minister of State report?  These limits are impacting on the ability of credit unions to lend money to their members.</p> <p>The promise of tiered regulation must be acted upon immediately.  Tiered regulation was meant to be about the proportionate application of regulations, taking into account the individuality and diversity of credit unions.  Instead we see blanket regulation imposed by the Central Bank regardless of size.  This reflects the poor relationship between the Central Bank and credit unions.  There should be a third party that could hear appeals against the Central Bank's system, which could also facilitate a form of reconciliation between the two.</p> <p>There should be movement to empower credit unions to invest in the housing crisis.  It is unacceptable that seven years in, the Government has made no movement on this.  My party has made very detailed submissions explaining exactly how this could be done.  It could be facilitated by the creation of a specific fund, from which tier 3 approved housing bodies could apply on a rolling basis for loan assistance for the purchase, renovation or building of social housing.  Funding could be approved on a 100% or perhaps a 70% basis, with the Department of Finance providing 30% of the funding through the already established approved housing body funding mechanisms.  Loans could be repaid via a 30-year availability agreement between the approved housing body and the local authority housing department.  The agreement would cover the repayment of the loan and a small premium to cover management and maintenance costs.  In the case of larger approved housing bodies, if the appropriate finance was made available, an additional 2,000 to 4,000 social housing units could be built.</p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in supports the proposal made by the Irish League of Credit Unions to allow for the provision of &euro;347 million annually in approved housing body loans, to be built up incrementally to &euro;1 billion over six years.  The composition of the fund in terms of governance and board membership could be decided following discussions between the Central Bank, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the Irish Council for Social Housing, the credit unions and the approved housing body sector.  I cannot understand why the Government has not yet looked seriously at this proposal.</p> <p>The report also states the regulatory reserve ratio is a crude instrument that does nothing to take account of the risks faced by credit unions.  The Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 states the Central Bank shall have regard to the need to ensure that requirements imposed by the regulations and made by it are effective and proportionate, having regard to the nature, scale and complexity of credit unions or the category or categories of credit unions to which the regulations will apply.</p> <p>Overall the report highlights the role that credit unions have played over 70 years, especially during the most recent financial crisis.  There are many people who would not have had any access to credit only for their local credit union.  The report does highlight some problems facing the sector, but the biggest problem is still the State.  There will always be a need for regulation, but this should reflect the unique circumstances of the credit union movement.  This has been promised for many years and I want to hear from the Minister of State today what concrete plans the Government has to bring this about urgently and make it a priority.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-05-09a.106" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1438" speakername="Anthony Lawlor" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018050900002#S00300"><p>The Minister of State is very welcome to the House.  I dealt with him on a number of occasions in the past when I was a Member of the bigger Chamber, but I am privileged to have him in here.  About seven years ago I was lucky enough to be in Benin in west Africa.  I happened to be at the first AGM of a small credit union in a village.  It was all operated by women.  It was giving out dividends and people were paying back loans.  Most of the loans taken out by the women were for small enterprises and businesses.  The reason they were establishing these little businesses was so they could afford to send their children to primary and secondary school.</p> <p>The whole ethos was that a credit union was established to help local people establish a little business, but the thing about it now is that credit unions have moved away from this.  They state they want to lend more, but when we look at the figures in the report there is a 26% loan to asset ratio whereas throughout Europe it is more likely to be 40% to 50%.  Perhaps this is something we should encourage credit unions to examine.  Credit unions can have extended loans up to ten years.  These are allowable up to 15% but across the board only 2% of loans extend to more than ten years.  Credit unions can have up to 40% short-term loans but they are still beneath this.  There are things the credit unions themselves can do to extend and increase loans because they have the capacity to do so with regard to the regulations as set down by the Central Bank.</p> <p>I was fascinated to read that many of the representative bodies stated the existing regulatory environment is not appropriate.  I remember sitting in a room when Naas Credit Union was asked to amalgamate with the defunct Newbridge Credit Union.  As Newbridge Credit Union did not adhere to the regulations in place at the time suddenly we had to put in place stronger regulations.  We have a fierce habit in this country of the pendulum swinging left to right and we can never get it to settle somewhere in the middle.  If we can get it to settle down somewhere in the middle it would be great.</p> <p>I want to speak about tiered regulation, which is something other people have raised.  I am a bit nervous about it.  If we have tiered regulation, and there is talk about three tiers or perhaps two tiers, at the point where an institution jumps from one tier to another suddenly a huge onus is placed on that small credit union to up its game and put in place the regulatory officers required by the Central Bank.  There is a cost associated with this.  There has to be a margin whereby instead of having a cut-off point there should be a couple of million euro on either side to allow an opportunity for smaller credit unions.  I am not in favour of tiered regulation because there is a role for the Irish League of Credit Unions in this.</p> <p>Recently in Kildare there was an amalgamation between Coill Dubh and Edenderry Credit Union and Leixlip Credit Union.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Anthony Lawlor:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2283"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2283&amp;amp;pid=AnthonyLawlor&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Irish League of Credit Unions wrote to the members of the credit union in Leixlip to say it could help them avoid a merger.  What did it help them with?  It could set up a regulatory body and smaller credit unions could feed into the process.  People could be involved in regulation at an individual level and the Irish League of Credit Unions could be an umbrella body for the regulation required.  The Minister might think about that.</p><p>I spoke about this issue a number of years ago in the D&aacute;il and said that, as the umbrella body, the Irish League of Credit Unions could operate the regulation required, in particular for smaller credit unions, in order to avoid them having to amalgamate.  Amalgamation means that credit unions distance themselves from the base where they started.  Customers knew the person behind the counter but they then had to deal with someone different from another organisation following amalgamation.  </p><p>I ask the Minister of State to consider tiered regulation.  I am not happy because unless there is a margin to allow smaller credit unions time and funding it will not work.  I also ask that the Irish League of Credit Unions be the umbrella body it is supposed to be.  I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-05-09a.108" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1400" speakername="P&aacute;draig MacLochlainn" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018050900002#T00200"><p>Like all Oireachtas Members, I receive an invitation every year to engage with the Irish League of Credit Unions and listen to its key priorities.  For a number of years, I have been perplexed as to why its eagerness and willingness to contribute to a house building programme in the State has not been addressed and facilitated.  It wants to play a substantial role in that and has substantial assets.</p> <p>The report we are debating refers to the average loans to assets ratio and the desire to increase that.  The credit union movement has said this is one way to address that, in partnership with the Government, and to protect the investments and savings of its shareholders.</p> <p>When we reflect on the financial crisis and the role of the banks, in particular the European Central Bank, we should note that the credit union sector is at the opposite end of the spectrum.  Senator Lawlor referred to the credit union ethos being spread throughout the world, often by Irish activists and missionaries in other countries.  It is something we should build on.  </p> <p>We have to have regulation and prudent management, and there have been small instances where that has fallen down with the movement.  The recommendations in the report need to be implemented.  The credit union movement has the potential to do even more good than it is already doing in local communities.  It wants to play a role and has been asked to do so for a number of years.  That is the key message I want to put across to the Minister of State today.</p> <p>I am sure my colleagues have dealt with other issues around tiered regulation in a better way.  In terms of housing, I have engaged with the credit union movement every year.  I ask the Minister of State, his Department officials and colleagues in the Department of the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to liaise and make this happen.  It is good for the credit union movement and our society.  I urge the Minister of State to make that happen.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-05-09a.109" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1421" speakername="James Reilly" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018050900002#T00300"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House and the opportunity to contribute to this important debate because, to my mind, credit unions have been a bulwark for many communities in this country and the saviour of many a small business.</p> <p>We are all aware that more competition is needed in the banking sector.  We are also aware that the pillar banks have moved away from communities and have moved services online.  They are more interested in bigger businesses rather than small local investors, savers and so on.  Many people, especially older people, still value face-to-face interaction.  Nobody is better placed to do that than people in the credit union movement who are part of and know their communities.  Very importantly, they know what is going on in their communities.  They live locally and, therefore, are very accessible to people.  </p> <p>I welcome many of the report's recommendations.  The Irish League of Credit Unions welcomed certain elements.  We would all be happy with strong regulation, but we want a wider opportunity for credit unions to invest in their communities.  Senator Lawlor mentioned that he had concerns about the implementation of the tiered regulation of credit unions.  My understanding of that would be that it would allow different credit unions of different sizes to avail of opportunities suitable for their balances and what they had in reserve.  I note they also want a full review of section 35 lending.  I certainly support that.  Anything which allows credit unions to develop and grow beyond the current permitted limits is to be welcomed.</p> <p>A new appeal mechanism should be introduced.  We often get the sense that the Central Bank, in which we have huge trust, sees things from a single perspective, that is, a fiscal perspective, and perhaps does not view things from a community perspective as well.  Of course, we want investors' money to be protected, but that protection should not limit the ability of credit unions to invest.</p> <p>Credit unions and others are worried that the regulatory reserve ratio is too crude and blunt an instrument which does not take into account the risks faced by credit unions.  That relates to the original point about the tiered system.</p> <p>We would like the credit union movement to be empowered to contribute to the alleviation of the housing crisis in the State.  I welcome that on 1 February the Central Bank made a decision to allow credit unions to have a role in funding social housing through tier 3 approved housing bodies.  The figure involved is only &euro;700 million, but they could invest billions of euro and fund tens of thousands of houses.</p> <p>This goes to the core of the ethos of the credit union movement.  It wants to reinvest in communities and there is no better way to do that than through housing.  Why can it not become involved in the provision of affordable and private housing and mortgages?  With proper regulation this would be a important step forward which could secure our a future in a broader sense.  One of the major challenges facing multinationals coming into the country is getting accommodation for the workers who come with them.</p> <p>Credit unions have, of course, had trouble.  I live in Rush and Rush and Lusk ran into trouble, as did Newbridge.  The key point is that levies and contributions imposed on the credit union sector have a legal basis which need to be checked.</p> <p>The committee acknowledged that the Irish League of Credit Union's savings protection scheme has provided &euro;73 million in stabilisation funds to 64 credit union without any resort to taxpayer funds.  This means that no taxpayer's money has been used to protect credit union investors and clear up the problems they have experienced, something which cannot be said about the pillar banks.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator James Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2180"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They also still have a stabilisation fund of &euro;90 million.

I believe the Minister of State's heart is in the right place and that he will look positively at this issue and afford more people the opportunity to avail of the funds available through credit unions.  Experience has shown us that they have been and continue to be the most family and customer friendly banks in Ireland today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-05-09a.111" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018050900002#U00200"><p>I thank all of the Senators who have contributed to the debate.  Any of them who has heard me speak about credit unions knows of my long-standing regard for them.  The credit union in Gorey has helped or funded every business there, from medical practices to farmers and retailers.  That has been the case less in the past two decades, but, as Senator Kieran O'Donnell said, the best of businesses traded because they had an extra credit line from the credit union.  I know that to be 100% the case in Gorey and have no doubt that the same is true for every other credit union throughout the country.  It is important, however, to be prudent.  I would not like to see credit unions getting involved in the private construction sector which is volatile.  I was involved in the banking inquiry for two years, with Senator Kieran O'Donnell and others.  The banking sector in Ireland collapsed because the construction sector was over-leveraged, particularly in the commercial real estate market.  Private guarantees were given that were not enforceable or enforced.  The mechanism is available to some of the credit unions to participate with the approved housing bodies which are State-funded to construct social housing, about which I am pleased.  The regulations were changed only six weeks ago.  There is now up to &euro;700 million available to tier 3 approved housing bodies through a regulated vehicle which can be established by any private body, including credit unions.  </p> <p>Some matters are appealable to the Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal.  The regulator is the Central Bank of Ireland.  However, not all matters can be appealed to the tribunal because the appeals body becomes the regulator, which is not possible. </p> <p>More could be done on the issue of SME lending.  The figure I have is approximately &euro;100 million, which is low.  However, one has to be careful because I am almost 100% certain that in the 1990s, when there was much less money in the country, hundreds of millions of euro were lent to SMEs.  There was not &euro;100 million lent in Gorey, but a lot of money was lent there to the SME sector.  There is almost &euro;17 billion available.  The credit unions are not pleased at having to provide that fund for very low yield investors because they get practically nothing back, which is not a good use of their funds.  They would like to have a much higher yield and return, which is understandable.  The money has to be protected.  People have money on deposit and it must be returnable.  </p> <p>The area about which I am conflicted and on which Senators Kieran O'Donnell, James Reilly and Tony Lawlor touched is the knowledge base of credit unions.  The people behind the counter in a credit union know the people who pay back the money.  While we are moving towards online systems and faceless banking - a term people do not like &ndash; credit unions know the people who pay back their loans.  I know for certain, going back to the 1990s, that there were lots of guys who did not meet the criteria, but they still got loans which were repaid because they were good for them.  That is not how the system works today, but moving away from people who know each other and whose word is their bond is the wrong direction to take.  However, that is a matter for the regulated entity.  </p> <p>The section 35 process has started and there will be consultation with the Central Bank during the year.  I cannot say when it will finish, but I hope it will be soon.  The Minister for Finance is playing and will continue to play a constructive role in support of credit unions.  I will support him in that regard.  He is continuing to progress, develop and find ways of doing business to better serve members.  There is a balance to be struck.  He will continue his engagement with the credit union movement through the well established Credit Union Advisory Committee, CUAC, to ensure the safety of members' savings, support credit unions, broaden the range of services for members and safeguard the credit union sector.  Thankfully, there was not a &euro;1 billion hole in the books of the credit union movement, but there was a concern about this at one stage.  It showed that the credit unions were more prudent than anticipated, which is good.  </p> <p>I think I have touched on most of the issues raised.  I strongly support the credit unions and hope we can get to a place where they will be more satisfied than they are now, but that does not mean that there should be light touch regulation, something I think the Acting Chairman mentioned.  It does not work because eventually somebody becomes way too clever and damages the entire sector.  When there is almost &euro;17 billion on deposit, it has to be protected or eventually somebody will do something silly.  The credit union sector is prudent and careful and has come through the crisis much better than most others.  The Minister for Finance and I support it fully, but the era of light touch regulation is over.  There will be regulation.  We want to make sure it will be prudent and strike the correct balance.</p></speech>

We will now commence the Second Stage debate on the Local Government Accountability Bill 2018.  I call Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-05-09a.116" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1382" speakername="Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018050900002#W00300"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p> <p>I also welcome the Minister of State with responsibility for the local government sector, Deputy Phelan, to the House and acknowledge the work he has done to date in listening to the concerns of local authority members across the country regarding remuneration and terms and conditions.  There was a widespread welcome for the establishment of a commission to examine the issue of remuneration and I hope that it undertakes its work programme as quickly as possible, with a conclusion reached in the autumn.  We would not want to let the commission run on too long because we do not know what the political landscape may bring.  In that context, it is vital that the conclusions of the commission are brought to bear as quickly as possible.  </p> <p>The purpose of the Bill before us is to support those same local government members who number 949 and who make a massive contribution on a daily basis to Ireland's democratic process.  I welcome Councillor Fiona McLoughlin Healy to the House this evening.  She is a member of Kildare County Council and has garnered a lot of experience in a system in Kildare of tracking representations made by councillors.  The issue of representations made by councillors is more fundamental than what is contained in this Bill because it gets to the core of Ireland's democratic system.  </p> <p>In 2017 local government in Ireland had a budget of &euro;4.4 billion expended across various services.  The budget increased in 2018 to &euro;4.8 billion and is distributed across 31 local authorities.  Over 30% of the budget is spent on housing while the roads allocation is &euro;913 million, or 19% of the overall budget.  Environmental services account for 13.6% of the budget, approximately 10% is spent on recreation and amenities, 8.7%, or &euro;415 million, is spent on development management and 7.9%, or &euro;378 million, will be spent on water this year.  The remaining budget is broken down under two subheadings, the first of which includes agriculture, education, health and welfare and the second is miscellaneous services.  Miscellaneous services is a budget line that is open to all sorts of interpretation and more transparency is required in this area but that is a debate for another day.</p> <p>Local authorities have a massive budget which is spent on crucial services for local communities all over the country.  I have brought the Local Government Accountability Bill before this House because the practitioners of democracy at the closest level to the citizen, namely, the councillors, are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain substantial answers from senior officials within the local authority system.  These senior officials are paid in excess of &euro;100,000 but according to councillors are not democratically accountable.   </p> <p>Changes were introduced at local government level under legislation passed in 2014, some of which were welcomed while others were not.  That legislation was introduced by the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, former Deputy Phil Hogan, from County Kilkenny.  The changes were brought in on the understanding that elected councillors would be better positioned to hold the chief executives of local authorities to account but that has not happened.</p> <p>I conducted research in preparation for this Bill and surveyed all local authority members across all political persuasions.  I received in excess of 80 communications from members from Fine Gael, Sinn F&eacute;in, Fianna F&aacute;il, Independent groupings, the Labour Party and so on.  The universal theme that emerged was that when councillors made representations on behalf of an individual citizen or group, they found it very difficult to get a timely response from senior officials or from the chief executive of the local authority.  The purpose of this Bill is to provide for such timely responses.  The Bill provides that an acknowledgement must be sent to the councillor making the representation on behalf of a citizen or community group within seven working days and that a substantial response must be provided within 14 working days.  That response must deal in its entirety with the issue of concern.  Under the Bill, the Minister has absolute discretion in providing for a regulation.  </p> <p>Given the Minister of State's record to date I believe he will welcome this Bill.  Indeed, I have no reason to believe that this Government will not be fully supportive of this Bill, especially as it will not impose any costs on the taxpayer.  The Bill is simply about providing more transparent and accountable local democracy, which will help the citizen and the practitioners of that democracy at a local level.  It enhances the ability of councillors to hold the executive or the council management to account.  That was the objective of the 2014 legislation introduced by the Fine Gael-led Government so I do not see why this Bill would not be supported this evening.  </p> <p>There are many State agencies which sit at arm's length from the Houses of the Oireachtas but which provide an excellent service to Deputies and Senators.  They provide timely responses to queries, often within three to four working days because of directions issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Those State agencies were clearly instructed to provide timely responses to queries from Members of the Oireachtas.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2261"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2261&amp;amp;pid=BrianODomhnaill&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The very least we could do is extend this privilege to local authority members by way of enactment of this Bill.  There are data protection issues emerging owing to the coming into force of the general data protection regulation this year.  The directive applies to Deputies and Senators who have the services of swift responses such that I do not see how it could be used to impede the process provided for in the Bill.  We are looking for fairness for local authority members, transparency for the public and democratic accountability of management at senior level, particularly chief executive officers who are managing a budget of &euro;4.8 billion this year.  This level of accountability is necessary because the chief executive officers are not accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts.  They should be, but they are not.  If councillors are finding it difficult to hold them to account in getting responses to queries, that is unacceptable.  Councillor McLoughlin Healy who is in the Visitors Gallery had to use the freedom of information process to garner a response on behalf of a constituent.  That is disgraceful.  I am assuming that the Government will support the Bill.  Any attempt to block it would be very damaging to the work of councillors as they carry out their difficult roles in dealing with complex queries on behalf of citizens.</p><p>I have received huge feedback on the Bill from citizens who are frustrated with the process.  For example, in County Donegal councillors who make representations on behalf of constituents often have to send three, four, five, six or seven emails or letters to the chief executive and senior management before they receive a response to a query.  That is unacceptable.  They are often fobbed off with a couple of acknowledgements in the hope the query will go away.  That, too, is unacceptable.  If we are to improve the level of democratic accountability in local government, we have to start somewhere.  The Bill will not resolve all issues, but it is an attempt to improve the structures in place.  I am open to suggestions from the Minister and will be happy to work with him on the Bill.  As Senators and Members of the Oireachtas, our aim is to serve our communities better and try to ensure the citizen receives a better service from the State.  Very often, we do not hear from citizens unless the system is broken.  If we had a perfectly functioning system which is probably not in place, there would be no need for politicians to make representations and we could focus solely on policy at council level or legislation at national level.  However, we do not live in that ideal vacuum; therefore, the representational route is crucial to citizens and communities.  We must ensure the system is as fluid as possible and one of the ways by which we can do this is by providing for a binding obligation.  </p><p>I hope the Minister of State will support the Bill.  I have carried out some analysis of local government systems across various jurisdictions worldwide within the context of the OECD, some of which has been published.  There are systems such as this in other jurisdictions which work effectively and there are no issues with them.  I hope there will not be an attempt by the county managers' association to block this measure, but I should not be so pessimistic as to even think that.  I look forward to hearing the contributions of the Minister of State and my colleagues.  I thank my co-sponsors, Senators Victor Boyhan, Gerard P. Craughwell and Diarmuid Wilson.  I look forward to listening to the debate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-05-09a.118" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1395" speakername="Jennifer Murnane O'Connor" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018050900002#X00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy John Paul Phelan.  As a former councillor, he is aware of the important role councillors play in communities.  I am speaking to the Bill on behalf of the 949 councillors across the country who represent people daily.  Local representatives need greater support in working for their constituents.  The Bill will provide that support.  It provides for the setting of a statutory timeframe of 14 days for replies to queries from local authority members, thereby ensuring the representative and the citizen will be heard.  </p> <p>The Bill is also about members of the public who seek the assistance of councillors daily.  When I was a councillor, I received many representations.  We must listen to the public.  In that regard, the first port of call is a councillor.  We need to ensure we represent them.  There has to be a response when representations are made on behalf of a member of the public.  We will tie the hands of the local councillor if we do not insist on this.  For some time local representatives throughout the country and their constituents have felt that they are unheard because everything seems to happen in Dublin.  Often representations are passed from one Department to another, which is unacceptable.  When a councillor, a Senator, a Deputy or a Minister makes a representation on behalf of a member of the public, he or she deserves to have them responded to quickly because that is what the member of the public expects and deserves.  </p> <p>We need to empower local representatives to ensure they can play an active role in addressing the concerns of their constituents.  We need to strengthen, rather than weaken, local democracy.  Ireland has the lowest number of councillors per head of population.  Public representatives are the first port of call for citizens.  Therefore, we need to ensure local government is strengthened.  A major change in councillors' conditions was the expansion of local electoral areas to cover much broader geographical areas.  As a result, they now represent broader and larger populations.  The Bill will reflect this change by further empowering them, which is good.  Like me, the Minister of State was a member of a town council.  The abolition of town councils has been a disaster.  Following on from their abolition, there are fewer councillors and smaller budgets but larger geographical areas.  The Bill will go a small way towards helping councillors to achieve the best results they can.    </p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il's empowering communities policy document calls for the establishment of town councils in towns with a population of over 7,500 people and the creation of new voluntary community council structures in areas with no town councils.  The abolition of town councils has been detrimental to the people.</p></speech>

We advocate having directly elected mayors with executive powers in every city and subsequently every county such that every area would have its own town council.  We need to see a return of town councils, combined with a new Cabinet-style system that would offer enhanced, effective accountability and a greater role for councillors in shaping policies.  We also need to look at overhauling the commercial rates system, combined with full implementation of the local government efficiency review and enhanced auditing facilities to ensure value for money and efficient spending.  Achieving value for money and efficient spending are crucial.  The public depends on local authorities, the Seanad and the D&aacute;il.  Local authorities are key to everything that happens in an area.  Therefore, we need to ensure councillors have their say.  We need to support them.</p> <p>I support the Bill and will be very disappointed if the Minister of State does not support it today.  As a former councillor, a Deputy and a Minister of State, he is aware of the vital role played by councillors.  He should, therefore, give the Bill his full support.</p></speech>

Most of us were councillors for a number of years and bring that experience to the House.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paudie Coffey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2237"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2237&amp;amp;pid=PaudieCoffey&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I acknowledge the work of councillors who are, in a democracy, the closest elected representatives to the citizens.  It is important that we acknowledge the mandate of locally elected members who do untold good work for their communities. </p><p>As the Minister of State, who is a democrat, knows, democracy brings accountability and with accountability is the right of elected members who have the mandate from the citizens and the electorate which represents them to make representations on behalf of the communities they represent.  How elective representatives and councillors can best function is a fundamental issue.  It is a fundamental issue that they are democrats who are elected by the people and who have a mandate.  They need to be supported to operate and represent those people efficiently and effectively.</p><p>We operate in a democracy, not a bureaucracy.  As a Member of this House, I am concerned that bureaucrats can sometimes dismiss or ignore legitimate representations made by councillors and Oireachtas Members.  We are very dependent on the co-operation of officialdom, whether in local authorities or other public agencies.  We are dependent on timely and accurate responses when representations are made.  We are also dependent on consistency in how those responses are made so that there is not favouritism in any way to one Member over another.  I fundamentally believe it boils down to respect for the mandate a councillor carries when he or she is elected.</p><p>I have to put on the record that many officials in local authorities give an excellent service and respond in an excellent way, and we should acknowledge that the vast majority of officials, from CEOs down to directors of services and the various managers of housing and local authority departments, are excellent in their responses.  There are always some outliers and that is why concerns have arisen.</p><p>The Bill is before the House today because some people do not give fundamental respect to the councillors who make recommendations to them.  I agree that is not acceptable.  The Minister can clarify the position.  Local authorities have customer charters and objectives within their corporate governance structures which require various managers within local authorities to respond in an effective and efficient way.  If they are not working, I am not sure what the sanctions are.  Is there a slap on the wrist?  Where does a councillor go if he or she is not getting adequate responses?</p><p>I served for eight years on Waterford County Council as an elected councillor.  The monthly meeting was the ultimate in accountability.  Monthly reports were provided by the management teams.  Any councillor had a remit to raise any issue in the public domain on the record and have it properly minuted and reported by the Fourth Estate.  The system worked well.</p><p>Given the significant demands on councillors and executives, the monthly meetings alone do not suffice.  There are corporate policy groups, strategic policy committees and various metropolitan and municipal district meetings.  There are opportunities for councillors to adequately raise issues of concern.  When they are raised and put on the public record, it is important that councillors get the responses they deserve.  It can be frustrating when that does not happen. </p><p>I have always believed that there should be a healthy tension at council level between the executive and council membership.  We all recognise the executive functions of the management teams and the reserve functions of councillors in terms of policy and decision-making and the adoption of development plans, estimates and the budget.  They are all very significant decision-making responsibilities of councillors and that should be reflected in the respect that officers of the councils give to those very same directors of the council, as I call them.  They are the members and directors of the board of that council.  Officials should be held to account.  If they are not doing their job and responding to councillors, we need to review the situation more closely.  While I recognise the aim and ambition of the Bill, I am not sure legislation is the correct way to go about it.  The Minister might be able to clarify that.</p><p>Freedom of information has been mentioned.  Councillors should not have to seek answers via freedom of information requests.  As I said, common decency and respect should mean that councillors are responded to in a timely and efficient way.  I understand that regulations are already in place under the Local Government Act 2001.  I am trying to be helpful.  Perhaps we should consider a review of those regulations to take into account the proposals in the Bill and the concerns people have expressed.  </p><p>Should we review and perhaps engage with the IPA, representatives of the CEOs, management of local authorities, the AILG and LAMA?  I suggest that we establish some type of committee to examine and scrutinise performance levels within local authorities and how they are responding to councillors, and engage with councillors around the country and survey them to see how responsive local authority officials are to them.  We would then get real feedback on how well the system is working.  If one has an elected mandate and raises an issue of concern which is being dismissed or ignored that is unacceptable.  </p><p>The ambition of the Bill is good, but I am not sure it is the way to go about addressing this issue.  I look forward to hearing the response of the Minister of State.  We should come together and not divide the House if possible.  We should consider a cross-party and independent approach, engaging with all of the stakeholders including, as I said, representative bodies, the IPA and management teams in local authorities, and see whether we can find a way forward which will satisfy the very real concerns of councillors in terms of having their legitimate representations addressed.</p><p>This is a worthwhile debate.  I again thank the proposers of the Bill.  We should never underestimate the importance of an elected mandate, whether it is a councillor, Deputy or Senator.  Any citizen of the State who puts his or her name on a ballot paper deserves respect.  I have been in public life for almost 20 years, having been a Senator, councillor, Deputy and former Minister of State.  I have encountered occasions where officials have ignored legitimate representations.  There should be some element of scrutiny of that and some sanction if necessary.  We cannot allow bureaucrats to dismiss or ignore the mandate of elected representatives.  This is a worthwhile debate and I look forward to hearing the contributions of others.</p></speech>

I find it hard to believe that we are discussing the Bill today and that it needs to be put forward as a Private Members' Bill.  I cannot believe it has not been passed and we need to discuss it at this stage.</p> <p>Section 237A of the Local Government Act 2001 refers to Oireachtas Members.  The current situation is very demeaning and belittling of councillors who are equally and in many cases more important as public representatives at the coalface in communities.  As Senator Coffey said, most of us were councillors and we all entered councils and joined public life because we wanted to represent and better our local communities.  It was always with the best intentions for those local communities and the people we represented that we went into representative life.  </p> <p>I remember being frustrated as a councillor.  I agree with Senator Coffey.  The vast majority of officials in councils are 100% reliable in getting back to councillors and responding.  This is not in any way tarring everyone with the one brush.  In some cases, an official did not get back to me because he or she was on leave or was transferred to a different department before getting around to dealing with my representation.  Nothing was more frustrating than not being able to get an answer for a member of the public who had contacted me about an issue and having to ask for information a second time.  That belittled councillors.  </p> <p>I note Senator Coffey's statement about having monthly meetings and the SPC.  As he knows, people come to councillors with many issues which are of a private nature.  A public meeting would be the last forum for raising such matters.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Daly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2464"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2464&amp;amp;pid=PaulDaly&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Putting something on the record at a public meeting as leverage to get an answer on the day or on the public record from which the person one is representing will benefit does not work and will not work in respect of the vast majority of representations.  Councillors receive many representations of a private nature which are not intended to be put in the public domain.  The only way to deal with the people concerned is to provide an answer.  If I do not receive the answer, they feel let down and become frustrated with the system.  I am accountable to them every five years, whereas the officials are not.  It is a matter of common decency, respect and mannerliness to get back to somebody who makes a request of a public representative.  </p><p>According to Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill's survey, many councillors are frustrated.  Officials, unfortunately, do not respond to queries and it is unfortunate, as Senator Paudie Coffey said, that this issue has to be addressed through legislation.  I cannot believe we have to do this and that there is statutory provision in that regard.  At the end of the day councillors are accountable.  All they require when they make representations is an explanation or answer.  We all appreciate and accept in our roles as public representatives that every representation we make will not have a positive outcome.  In some cases, rather than give a negative response or say something is not possible or cannot be done or that they are not prepared to do it, officials will avoid telling public representatives anything, but that does not help the councillor or the individual with the problem.  All we are seeking in the Bill is an acknowledgement of the receipt of representations within seven days and an answer within 14.  The Bill does not state the answer has to be positive, but it is only a matter of common decency to provide an answer.  I agree with the Minister of State that the vast majority of public servants are helpful and respond as soon as they can, but a number do not.  It was frustrating as a councillor when I was dealing with them.  As an elected representative, I often felt the tail was wagging the dog.  Perhaps I was an exception, but I was often frustrated regarding who had the power in the chamber.  Was it vested in the officials or where it should have been - the councillors who were elected by the people?</p><p>The Bill is straightforward and should be accepted.  It is glaring that, as Oireachtas Members, we have rights that councillors should have.  They are what Senator Brian &Oacute; D&oacute;mhnaill and his colleagues are seeking.  Most local authorities have a customer charter.  If a member of the public contacts the local authority directly, he or she must receive a reply within a specific time period to meet its ISO standard or whatever standard to which it is working, yet councillors are not regarded as customers and, as such, not covered by it.  They do not have to be given responses in accordance with the charter.  That alienates councillors, whereas members of the public can go directly to councils.  </p><p>I hope the Government will accept the Bill.  I will be disappointed if it does not.</p></speech>

They have in-depth knowledge of a particular local area, its community, infrastructure and vitality as a part of wider society.  The work we do in this House is largely focused on national issues, while their focus is largely local.  While that is the way it should be, many issues such as housing, health, the provision of local services, etc., are usually reflections of a State-wide context.  The work we do is complemented and made transparent by the different Oireachtas tools with which we may be satisfied such as governmental, ministerial or departmental responses, all of which are open to public scrutiny through parliamentary questions, the transcripts of debates and live televised debates.  That is the minimum standard for any democratic chamber that proclaims itself to be accessible to constituents.  I welcome the moves made by Dublin City Council, in particular, which live streams and records its meetings for online consumption and the swathe of other local authorities that are investigating doing the same.</p> <p>My party supports the Bill.  Its objectives are clear and provide a more grassroots aspect to local government.  When local election candidates put themselves forward, they present their proposals for how they would enhance their local community in terms of services, infrastructure and raising the standard of living.  These proposals realistically cannot be implemented without a strong relationship between councillors and council staff as they work together, rather than having two autonomous bodies attempting to resolve the same issues.  There are difficulties in that regard and the Bill works to resolve, rather than deepen, them.  According to the supporting documentation provided by Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill, there has been preliminary consultation on the legislation with councillors.  However, the Bill should proceed with full consultation with councillors and staff, with their representative groups.  The same should apply to proposed guidelines for the Minister.</p> <p>I commend local authority staff, many of whom work tirelessly with little or none of the praise or acclaim councillors receive.  For example, many of them worked diligently to ensure many young people would be registered prior to yesterday's deadline to vote in the upcoming referendum.  The objectives of the Bill, while necessary, could place greater demands on local authorities which need to be adequately resourced both with funding and staffing, particularly those that are stretched to their limits.  The Department should undertake a wider scoping exercise of local authorities to see how they could improve transparency.  Some local authorities stream their proceedings online.  South Dublin County Council has rolled out a database for its councillors in order that they can track their representations made to staff.</p> <p>Bearing in mind that the Government intends to hold a referendum on a directly elected mayor for Dublin - it is tentatively scheduled to take place in October this year - I urge the Minister of State to ensure the Bill will consider the mayoral apparatus in London and the role a new mayor of Dublin could have in ensuring the accountability of local authority staff.  What progress has been made in holding the referendum?</p> <p>My party will support the Bill and we are happy to lend our support to an excellent initiative that will enhance local democracy.  It is evident from the responses received by Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill that this is, unfortunately, an issue throughout the State and that it needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

As a co-signatory, I consider it to be a measure that will support and strengthen local democracy.  I often refer to the outstanding and unacknowledged work city and county councillors do on behalf of the people who elect them.  Not only are councillors the cornerstone of our democracy, the issues with which they deal encompass every aspect of citizens' lives.  The number of representations they receive on behalf of their constituents makes theirs a 24/7 job.  Unlike Senators, they do this without a full-time secretary or research assistant and are the most under-resourced elected members in our democracy.  More importantly, they are charged with oversight of local authority performance across all indicators, including budgets and programme performance.  To do to this work, they need timely, authoritative and reliable information which answers their queries on behalf of the public and enables them to assess how the executive is performing.  In the past decade local authorities have invested heavily in management information and reporting systems and it is now easier than ever to harvest requested information.  They should also be congratulated on putting in place customer service charters setting out clearly and unambiguously the nature and quality of service people can expect in their dealings with them.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2402"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2402&amp;amp;pid=GerardPCraughwell&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> While members of the public are customers, we must remember that councillors are also customers - very important ones - and should be afforded the same high level of service, if not higher.  It came as a large disappointment to me to learn that legislation was even needed to guarantee what was promised in those charters and to ensure a uniformly high standard of customer service to councillors across all local authorities.  We in the Oireachtas are all well looked after, in that the Local Government Act 2001 (Section 237A) Regulations 2003 set out statutory provisions for local authorities in their dealings with Members of the Oireachtas.  The regulations provide that each local authority must deal with requests for access to information by Oireachtas Members, "as expeditiously as may be and in accordance with a proper level of customer service."  It was a major oversight not to have included councillors in that regulation, so I welcome the way in which Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill's Bill addresses this serious omission.  I cannot see why local authorities could not have dedicated email addresses to deal directly and promptly with councillors' queries or why a member of staff in corporate affairs could not be assigned to deal solely with such queries, gather information from all relevant sections and feed it back to councillors within the agreed timeframe.</p><p>The successful introduction of freedom of information legislation across the local authority sector has shown us that, if a regulation makes it compulsory, information will be provided within the timelines.  It is not just the timeliness of information provision that is essential, though, but the quality and completeness of the response.  This must be guaranteed.</p><p>The proposed legislation is not a criticism of the information and query service currently being offered by local authorities to their members.  We know that many councils have excellent relationships with their councillors and go the full mile to ensure that councillors have the information they require.  These are relationships built on trust and mutual respect that facilitate a two-way flow of information and knowledge sharing.  Instead, the Bill addresses the unevenness of the essential core customer information provision across all local authorities.  It reminds us yet again of the ways in which previous legislation has failed to acknowledge fully the role and workload of city and county councillors.  This is an opportunity to redress that situation and send a strong message to councillors and the executive of local authorities that representational work at local level continues to be a valid and significant part of the democratic process.  I support the Bill and I look forward to the Minister of State's response.</p><p>When Senators discuss local authority issues, many draw attention to the fact that they have also been city or county councillors.  I am privileged, in that I have never been one, which allows me to see through a different lens.  Legislation has not been kind to councillors.</p></speech>

I have never suffered it, thank God, but I understand the theory behind it.</p> <p>Will the Minister of State look favourably on this legislation?

It sets out a new statutory framework for the reply to queries from local authority members.</p> <p>We have discussed the public's connectivity and engagement with local politics.  It is important that citizens feel that they are in touch with the local government system.  They do that via a conduit, namely, the local authority member.  I welcome that a binding obligation will be put in place whereby that member will have a full and comprehensive response from the local authority within 14 days.  I also welcome the publication of league tables.  Senator Craughwell will agree with me from his days in the teaching world that, regardless of what aspect of life one is in, be it the public sector or the private sector, competition fosters excellence.  I know that from my own days in school, particularly medical school.  As such, I welcome Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill's decision to include quarterly published league tables in this legislation.</p> <p>Major changes in councillors' conditions occurred with the geographical expansion of local authority areas.  Consequently, councillors now cover broader areas and larger populations.  This legislation would reflect the changes imposed on the councillors and empower them further, which is another reason to welcome it.</p> <p>The Government wants to reduce the size of local electoral areas, LEAs, to between five and seven seats, with provision for some even smaller areas of three or four seats in sparsely populated locations, for example, where I live in north-west Mayo.  This imposes further pressure on councillors in rural locations.  As such, the Bill is apt and timely.  As Senator Coffey stated, the Bill is about respecting our first line of democracy, namely, our councillors.  I hope that the Government will support this pertinent legislation.  I also hope for the Minister of State's acknowledgement that the Bill is supported by the AILG and LAMA.</p></speech>

I do not mean it in a bad way, but it is difficult to draft a Bill that is just two sides of one A4 page and has an explanatory memorandum that barely exceeds one page.  I congratulate Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill on being able to distil his thoughts and explanation down to one page.  This is not the most complicated idea, but it could transform the lives of some councillors when dealing with specific individuals with whom they have been having difficulties.</p> <p>With the exception of one or two of the Senators present, all of us have been members of local authorities.  I was a member for 12.5 years.  Senator Murnane O'Connor was a councillor for even longer.  Others spent a long time in local authorities before being lucky enough to be elected to this House.  We have had dealings with incredibly effective officials along the chain in every local authority department as well as good directors of services and county managers, who are now chief executives.  Senators Boyhan and Richmond were also members of my authority of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, where our experience with the bulk of staff was great.  Occasionally, however, there was a different approach.  For example, someone who was getting too many voice messages once disconnected from voicemail.</p> <p>People not getting responses is not good enough.  As Senator Paul Daly pointed out, while a response was often negative, people just wanted the answer.  I dealt with a query once to which the answer was that a lovely 200 year old tree could not be cut down simply because it was blocking someone's satellite reception.  Such questions are asked, but people are usually happy with the response once it is given and only get frustrated when they do not get one.  For example, a resident cannot have a ramp because he or she is in a cul-de-sac of eight houses.  The council's response might be that it will not spend money on putting in that ramp, but the councillor simply needs a response to give to the resident, who can then take that information and go somewhere with it.  Perhaps the resident could approach the issue in a different way or accept the response.</p> <p>Where I have been given bad responses, I have told officials that the responses do not stand up to scrutiny and need to be revisited.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerry Horkan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2476"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2476&amp;amp;pid=GerryHorkan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->On many occasions officials have done this.</p><p>I am certainly not saying most officials are bad, quite the opposite, but this is good for councillors who are experiencing frustration with individual members of staff in various local authorities throughout the country.  I read Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill's brief on what he received back from certain councillors in certain areas.  I will not go back over the debates we have had in recent months on councillors' terms and conditions as they are all on the record.  This is about this Bill.  The Government should embrace it.  I do not know what could be done to change it.  It is not overly complex in terms of regulation.  It would be a great idea.  People would receive acknowledgement within seven days and a response within 14 days.  Even if it is a holding response in certain complex situations, all of us could live with getting something.  There is the occasional official in the occasional local authority who refuses to engage or will not come back to someone or answer the phone or an email and who will give a fairly poor response to a question.  They are the exceptions, but it is very helpful of Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill, along with his colleagues, to table the Bill, and I am certainly happy to support the thrust of what he is trying to do.  I commend it to the House.</p></speech>

Before I got a letter from him I had received letters from Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in councillors, so clearly he had networked exceptionally well and I acknowledge this.  A few people told me today they had received an alert to tune in here today.  I thought this was particularly interesting, but how sad that only ten Senators are here.

I was a councillor myself and I know what is required to do the job, particularly to do it well.  I am happy to stand up and advocate for city and county councillors who work exceptionally hard.</p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy John Paul Phelan, has a brief for local government reform.  It is one of his many briefs.  I know he has vast experience of local government himself, and I do not doubt his commitment.  I want to put on the record and acknowledge the enormous work that public servants do throughout local authorities, but they have an issue.  It is not that they do not necessarily want to communicate with councillors.  They have an issue with resources.  They need more resources and staff to get on and do the job.  It is in the interests of every chief executive and county manager to work well with councillors and <i>vice versa</i>.  It is in the interests of every city and county councillor to work well with their chief executive.</p><p>This is a very simple Bill, and I do not understand what the complication is about it.  It is a Bill to provide for better replies and response times from local authority officials to local representative queries.  That is all very simple.  I would expect that for the public.  Every member of the public should also have this particular right that we are trying to achieve.  What are the aims of the Bill?  They are simple.  They are to provide a consistency of response times across the entire local government system, the introduction of a binding obligation on local authority officials to issue an acknowledgement to the member within seven working days, the introduction of a binding obligation on local authority officials to issue a comprehensive response to the member within 14 days, and the introduction of a league table scheme or system compiling data on response times from each local authority on how replies to members are delivered, to include quarterly publications.  I hope the Minister of State will stand up and fully embrace all of this.</p><p>I remind people that the AILG and LAMA are supportive of the Bill.  There are Senators in here who bellyache about reform for councillors, but I do not see them in the Chamber today.  Are they afraid to come in here and make a case for city and county councillors?  Do they simply just not give a damn?  Where are they?  Where are their excuses?  I appeal to anyone looking in today to call on all of the Senators elected to Seanad &Eacute;ireann to account for their absence this evening, when they were given an opportunity and given notice to support something very basic to support city and county councillors in their work.  It is exceptionally disappointing.  It must be exceptionally disappointing for the Minister of State to look across at every single seat empty in front of him.  That is the reality of it.  They are not empty on this side of the House.</p></speech>

It is about transparency in Government.  It is about accountability, an issue that is very prevalent this week.  Accountability has to start at the very base of democracy, and the front line of democracy is at local authority level.  We are not asking for anything huge in terms of issues such as response times, but as there has to be a response, why not set a target and why not meet it?  Why not have an obligation that elected members would get a comprehensive response to queries they make on behalf of their constituents, who are the citizens?</p> <p>What the Government is saying is it is not putting in place any targets and does not want to put any obligation on local authorities or civil servants to come back to elected members within a reasonable time.  If the Government feels the timing is not reasonable, it is welcome to table amendments and we can debate them here.  As for any idea of putting this down for another report, along with other reports that have been promised, reports do not do anything and guidelines do not do anything.  Legislation would mean obligations on local authorities, and the people who are paid by the taxpayer to deliver services on their behalf, to give timely responses.  Local authorities were forced under planning law to give responses within eight weeks and then a further four weeks, because they were not giving responses.  There was no end to a planning application until the law set down a set amount of time by which responses had to be given.  That changed the system.  People could plan and would know what they would face in terms of an application.  They had a reasonable expectation that there was a timeline within which the local authority had to respond to a planning application.</p> <p>What we are doing with the Bill is expanding this concept, which was earth-shattering at the time, so that local authorities would now have to do the same.  We have done this in the D&aacute;il and we do it here.  A question is answered for a Deputy within three working days, and it is the same here with a Commencement matter.  We are taking the requirement for a response time from local authorities with regard to planning issues, and the requirement at national level in the D&aacute;il and Seanad where a response time is required for elected members, and we are bringing it to local authority level for all issues raised by members that are covered by the legislation, and we are introducing a statutory code for this, including a requirement to reply and a timeline.  This is very reasonable and we need to ensure it is done and put in legislation so local authorities are accountable to the democratically elected people and to the citizens who put the councillors in place to represent them and their views.</p></speech>

I will not pre-empt the speech of the Minister of State, but it is important in the context of the contributions of Members on the Order of Business today that we understand that accountability means accountability.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That has many different facets, one of which means those of us who are public representatives having our queries or representations answered.  The second one is us being able to avail of information in our role as Oireachtas representatives in terms of reports, agendas and minutes of meetings.  In saying that, it is equally important we recognise that many of us have come from local authorities, as in we have been councillors and we have been involved in the process.</p><p>This is about ensuring that we enhance local government, that we consult, and that we do not alienate or divide, or do not move away from a cross-party collaborative approach to better local government.  I note Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill has had consultation with AILG and LAMA in the context of this debate.  The Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, in his speech, will lay out how we can facilitate better local government in terms of accountability for local authority members.  What Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill is trying to achieve here is to support local authority members.</p><p>Councillors, such as Councillor Deirdre Forde to whom I spoke today, would be of the view that this Bill is important and necessary.  There are misgivings in Government about the Bill and there are concerns and frustrations with it.  It is important that we get the balance right.  There is always, as Senator Coffey stated, that healthy tension between the Oireachtas and local authority.  There is also that tension between the elected member and the executive in charge of the issue.  What we are trying to do is make local government better.  For example, at one time I had a different view regarding directly-elected mayors and I have now come to the view that we should have a directly-elected mayor in Cork city under the new local government structure.  I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, on piloting in the end the new local government structure for Cork.  In fairness, the Minister of State was amenable.  He was accessible.  He had his own strongly held view, as many of us did.  They did not sometimes agree, but that is fine.  However, the Minister of State was there walking and talking with Members of the Oireachtas and with local authority members.  I am digressing for a second, but in terms of the new local government structure for Cork city, I hope we might look at how we could extend the number of councillors to be elected.  I believe we are gaining an enhanced city population base with 31 existing councillors being returned.  Some will say we have too many politicians elected.  I do not buy that argument.  My point is we need to have more local authority members elected in Cork City Council.</p><p>The other point in the explanatory memorandum worth looking at is the statutory obligation to reply to elected members.  The D&aacute;il has parliamentary questions.  There is no obligation on the Minister to come to this House on a request by a Member on the Order of Business.  Ministers do not have any statutory function to come in to answer queries from Members which, I accept, is a different debate.  I believe part of what we should try and do is to make accountability part of what we all should do.  We are accountable in terms of us going before the electorate to be voted in or voted out, and that is part of what we do.</p><p>The import of what Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill is trying to achieve in the Bill is a principle that we all share.  I certainly hope that we can avoid a split in the Oireachtas tonight on that particular issue.</p><p>I thank the Minister of State for being here.  I do not want to pre-empt his speech but when we see words such as "binding", "obligation" and "statutory", it scares everybody.  The bottom line is we need to see accountability in what everybody does.</p><p>I commend Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill for bringing the Bill to the House.  Many members of our party at local and national level are supportive of the Bill.  It is about making local government better.  It is about enhanced accountability.  It is about creating a better, efficient model of delivery of service to the elected public representative on behalf of the citizen who has put that politician into a position of importance which is called a democratic decision taken by the people.</p></speech>

Before the Opposition jumps on me completely, I will outline the reasons and outline why this, in itself, is not the end.</p> <p>At the start, Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill spoke about the setting up of the group on councillors' remuneration.  I would like to inform the House that we are just about finished with its terms of reference.  I indicated to the House that it would start in May and finish at Hallowe'en and we are still on schedule for that to happen.</p> <p>Part of that exercise is, for the first time in the history of the State, a proper scoping out of the role of a councillor, what it is now in terms of not only the legislative provisions and the reserved functions but what a councillor does and what into the future we would like to see councillors doing.  Part of that will be a full consultation with the AILG and LAMA as well as with local authority management.  Officials from the Department will be on that group, as will officials of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I am not averse to following that process, reviewing the guidelines or, indeed, for the first time, introducing regulations under section 136(3).</p> <p>The main reason the Government does not support the Bill is that the existing local government legislation largely already allows for its main aims.  It is a question of how we implement it.</p> <p>Notwithstanding the fact that I have come across some examples anecdotally of local authority official responses that have been less than timely, there is a general good response level from most local authority officials.  As I have said, I have come across a few stories regarding local representatives that are not acceptable.  I acknowledge Councillor McLoughlin Healy who is in the Gallery.  Other councillors have spoken to me about the Bill but, in the context of the review of the role, as well as the remuneration, I caution against acting in advance of the review.  It might well be that some of the provisions of this Bill need to be implemented following the completion of that review in the fall of the year but the House should not divide on the issue because everybody is in favour of information flow.  This Bill is about quality information.  Whether it is local authority staff and management deciding that an issue cannot be resolved, there is no excuse for the absence of a response in a timely fashion.</p> <p>However, I must point out that the Oireachtas is different than local authorities in the sense that parliamentary questions have a distinct role.  As part of the scoping mechanism for councillors and their role, if some sort of a comparable function could be devised at local authority level I am not averse to that proposal either.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy John Paul Phelan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2004"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2004&amp;amp;pid=JohnPaulPhelan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is why it would be better for us all to contribute to the scoping exercise that will be carried out.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-05-09a.152" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1265" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018050900002#DD00300"><p>As I stated, the Government is of the view that the existing provisions of the Local Government Act 2001, as amended, meet the principal aims of the Bill.  In particular, section 136 of the Act, which concerns the furnishing of information by the chief executive to the elected council, is applicable in this instance.  Subsection 136(1) provides that the chief executive shall, whenever requested, provide to the elected council or its cathaoirleach, municipal district members, a strategic policy committee, local community development committee, LCDC, or any joint body all information that may be in his or her possession.  Subsection 136(2) provides that the chief executive must submit a monthly management report to the council by the seventh day of each month.  Subsection 136(3), to which I have referred, states that the Minister may provide by regulations the nature and form of those management reports.  Such regulations have never been drafted but that may be the key subsection of the existing legislation under which that may be done.</p> <p>Subsection 136(4) states the Minister may issue general policy guidelines for the purposes of subsections (2), (3) and (5).  Although regulations have not been made, the Minister issued guidelines under subsection 136(4) on the preparation of monthly management reports on 2 July 2014.  There is no provision for elected members to specify additional elements to be included in the monthly management report but the guidelines issued allow for such reports to be accommodated.</p> <p>The Government is also of the view that the customer complaint guidelines for local authorities are applicable in this regard.  The guidelines, issued in July 2005, address the handling of customer complaints as an important part of service delivery in local government.  They specifically address the issue of how complaints made by elected members should be dealt with.  The guidelines endorse the practice that complaints made via elected members are handled in a similar manner to those made directly by members of the public.  That is so because local representatives are a conduit for complaints.</p> <p>As Senators pointed out, it is unacceptable that in some cases councillors in some local authorities would move to the bottom of the queue in terms of their issues being dealt with.  However, in such cases the complainant is still the member of the general public.  It is in fulfilment of their elected role that councillors are the conduit of requests from members of the general public and that role should be protected and enhanced.  At local authority level, the same approach is generally taken for dealing with representations from elected members as from members of the public and that approach is in accordance with each local authority&rsquo;s customer charter.  The customer charter was mentioned by Senator Mark Daly.  It is up to each local authority to have, draft or update a customer charter and members of each local authority have the final say in that regard.  It would be worthwhile for local authorities to review the contents of their customer charter on a regular basis.</p> <p>Although it could be argued that the aims of the Bill are consistent with the provision of high-quality customer service, its approach is disproportionate and overly prescriptive in terms of direct legislation for the range of services provided by local authorities.  I am not averse to there being a timeframe for a substantive answer to issue, but it is very rare for such a timeframe to be written into primary legislation and almost non-existent in terms of State authorities and agencies.  It may, however, be possible to specify such a timeframe through regulations or guidelines.</p> <p>In certain complex areas of policy, and where policy is in the course of development, there is a risk of damaging the efficient and effective delivery of services through such an overly-prescriptive approach as that proposed in the Bill.  Responding to correspondence is only one of the services local authorities provide in their communities and it must not take precedence over more front-line services, although it must be dealt with.  We must strike a balance between ensuring that queries are responded to and that the wide variety of services local authorities provide continue to be enhanced.  The quality of answers to representations should also be enhanced.  I am strongly of the view that the objectives of the Bill are best delivered through clarity in and adherence to local authorities&rsquo; customer service charters, in conjunction with the scoping exercise for the role of the local authority member upon which we are about to embark.  The customer service charters are broadly compatible with the response timelines in the proposed Bill but have been set locally having regard to specific circumstances, which is crucial.</p> <p>Local authorities, being autonomous bodies, are somewhat different to Departments.  Although I understand and regret that certain powers were removed from local authority members around the country, some of which powers I hope to reinstate, I am somewhat averse to imposing at a national level a specific timeframe in terms of responses to queries from elected members unless those local elected representatives collectively reach agreement at member level, followed by consultation with the executive and management.  There may be instances, of which I have no doubt that all present have heard examples, of local authorities falling below their standards.  However, customer service plans include procedures to resolve such issues as they arise and to identify and address systemic weakness.</p> <p>Furthermore, the Bill seeks to impose specific statutory standards regarding response times in a single part of the public service.  The Government is of the view that any initiative along the highly-prescriptive lines proposed in the Bill would best be developed in a holistic manner for the wider public service while bearing in mind the review process which is about to commence.</p> <p>The Government takes the view that the Bill is inconsistent with the approach set out by the Local Government Act 2001 (Section 237A) Regulations, SI 274 of 2003, in regard to the manner in which local authorities deal with Members of the Oireachtas.  The regulations aim to ensure that Members of the Oireachtas continue to be kept closely informed about local authority issues following the abolition of the dual mandate.  In the context of quality customer service for all persons in contact with local authorities, the regulations include provision for the following: the objective for each local authority when responding to Deputies and Senators to apply systems, procedures and timeframes equivalent to those used by them when communicating with local authority members; local authorities to seek to deal with requests for access to information from Deputies and Senators as promptly as possible and in accordance with a proper level of customer service; and, in dealing with correspondence by parliamentary representatives, equivalent systems, procedures and timeframes as operate for councillors should apply.  It should be stressed that those regulations do not set a statutory deadline for local authorities to process representations from Members of the Oireachtas. </p> <p>It is important to point out that in responding to representations received from elected members about their constituents, local authorities are bound by data protection and right to privacy provisions in respect of the residents with whom they are dealing.  Consequently, great care must be taken in ensuring that personal information is not released in contravention of the legislation. </p> <p>It was not possible to carry out an analysis of the cost of the Bill to local authorities within the time allowed.  It appears that there may be no additional costs to the Exchequer.  However, as local authorities aim to respond to correspondence within the prescriptive deadline imposed, there is a risk that the mandatory requirements proposed would inhibit efficient and effective delivery of services generally if resources had to be diverted to comply with this specific requirement, with consequential impacts on optimal staffing levels, particularly for the delivery of front-line services.  Potential efficiencies could be lost, with a direct cost to those paying for local government and those relying on its services.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy John Paul Phelan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2004"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2004&amp;amp;pid=JohnPaulPhelan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->These are the reasons the Government will not support the Bill.</p><p>I will comment further on the scope of the review exercise that is about to start.  Part of the scope is the possibility of additional secretarial services.  Some local authorities already provide some limited secretarial assistance.  The local authority in north Dublin, for example, provides limited secretarial services for local authority members.  One of the terms of reference being looked at is the extension of that service nationally and the extension of other research facilities in the context of the reserve function of local authority members, such as those for Members.  The administrative support would not just be secretarial; the scope would look at the value of having a person within the local authority who is responsible for conducting primary research on behalf of local authority members.  This is included in the draft terms of reference that I have already looked at.</p><p>Rather than dividing the House, because we largely agree on accurate information being provided in the fullest form that it can be within a practical timeframe, I put it to Members that the first part of the process is the full scoping exercise on the role of a councillor.  In a sense, while this legislation is deemed necessary by many Members of the House, it might be putting the cart before the horse until that review is actually completed.</p></speech>

I just caught the end of his speech but I appreciate his words.  I support the Bill and commend Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill on bringing it forward.  In recent years, there has been a significant shift in power away from our local councillors who are the people working on the ground day in, day out.  This power has shifted into the hands of officials in the council.  We need to shift this power back and this is a significant step in this regard.</p> <p>Fine Gael in government abolished town councils, which was a retrograde step.  It diminished local democracy.  Massive local electoral areas were formed and this led to an extra workload for councillors.  The Minister of State spoke of striking a balance in the workload of councillors, but if we want to attract people into public office and keep them there, we must offer more support.  I am glad to hear there are some plans in that regard.  We need a strong local democracy and this Bill is a significant step towards that.  I look forward to seeing what the Minister of State has in store.</p></speech>

The two Government Senators who spoke were constrained by officialdom in the Custom House.  Their contributions were maybe a little more muted.</p> <p>I welcome all the contributions and the engagement from my Seanad colleagues to a very real and live issue.  It was not my intention to divide the House this evening.  I am shocked that the Government is opposing the Bill, which I hoped would receive cross-party support, allowing it to go forward.  If there is a vote this evening, it is because we want to progress the issue.</p> <p>The Minister of State spoke of the scoping review that could take place within the terms of reference of the newly established pay and conditions commission for local authority members.  The view on this side of the House is that the commission was established to look solely at the pay, terms and conditions of councillors.  It was not established to look at the remit or other issues.  I would not like to see that important work diluted in any way, or for the timeframe to be extended in any way.  I could not support the dilution of that particular work.</p> <p>I am willing to work with the Department.  Last week when the Bill was published, I told the Leaders' office that I was available, even over the weekend, to meet with officials or with Government to discuss the Bill.  I believe Fine Gael councillors and Independent Alliance councillors, many of whom have spoken to me about this, are fully supportive of this Bill.  The Bill was not required as a regulation could have been made by the Minister.  However, I brought the Bill forward to try to force the issue.</p> <p>Many councillors across the State are at breaking point on this issue.  The local elections are just over 12 months away and we need action on the matter now.  It is very wrong that a councillor would end up being penalised or scapegoated by the electorate because he or she was not able to garner sufficient responses from the council on representations made.  I met with a councillor in my county last weekend.  He had made a representation to the local authority seven times and did not get a response.  The constituent, who is a citizen, and the community group he represents probably feel the councillor was not doing his job but this was not the case.  This is a fundamental issue.  I would not like to see the pay, terms and conditions issue or this issue diluted.  It is such a simple issue and it has the support of the Association of Local Government and the Local Government Management Agency.</p> <p>I carried out a survey of 949 councillors from all parties and received more than 80 responses, which were all favourable to this particular Bill.  I am available to work with the Department, but I will not sideline the Bill tonight or move it into a committee.  When that happens, very often things do not get done.</p> <p>A quote made famous in later years by Mr. John Bruton is that the pursuit of perfection is noble, but unless we are willing to settle for good, we may have to settle for nothing at all.  I am not prepared to settle for nothing at all.  While the Bill may have its imperfections, I am willing to work with the Government to iron out those imperfections on Committee Stage.  I want to see the Bill progress from here today.  The Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, is a very good and capable Minister of State, not just because he served in this House and is from Kilkenny.  I believe he has the best interests of elected local authority members at heart and, therefore, I hope he will not stand in the way of this very practical measure we are trying to bring in with this Bill.</p></speech>
