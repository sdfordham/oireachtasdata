I also thank the Minister of State for taking this matter and for all of his work to date regarding shorter and longer term flood relief measures in Crossmolina.  He travelled there and met stakeholders this week, including the Government agencies Inland Fisheries Ireland and the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, Mayo County Council, representatives of the Irish Farmers' Association, IFA, and members of the Crossmolina flood action committee.  It was a constructive meeting and it was great that the Minister of State could take the time to hear first hand from some of the people affected by the devastation caused by two floods last November and December.</p> <p>At the meeting, we were given confirmation that work was progressing on some of the shorter term measures, namely, flood defences and mitigation works, including an embankment and the building of a flood wall, and that we might see works commencing on the ground come September.  The Minister of State is pressing the issue of the provision of flood gates, which are helpful when floods are at a certain level, and has directed that a short section of the river downstream be cleared, which is welcome.</p> <p>Today is our last sitting day and it is my last opportunity to raise this Commencement matter.  There needs to be a clearing out of the river upstream of Crossmolina towards the Nephin mountain range.  People are puzzled by how the OPW, Inland Fisheries Ireland, Mayo County Council and the NPWS are not responsible.  The upstream is significant, as it is where the water comes from to flood the town.  The OPW is responsible on the far side of the bridge downstream, although, a responsibility that arises from a drainage scheme that was implemented pursuant to the Arterial Drainage Act 1945.  For people who are desperate for something to be done, it is difficult to understand how a body can be responsible on one side of the bridge but not on the other side upstream.  They know that it is not the be all and end all of solutions but they want something to be done.</p> <p>Much has been said about the need for a single authority to be responsible for rivers but we do not need a new one.  We have the OPW, which is capable and has the expertise to do the work.  Section 12 of the 1945 Act gives the Minister the power to extend upstream the drainage scheme that currently covers downstream of Crossmolina between the town and Lough Conn.  This would answer the question of who is responsible for the upstream.  Something must be done.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michelle Mulherin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We cannot simply leave people in no man's land; this is too serious.  The Minister of State has heard about the devastation of people's homes and how they were flooded, as well as the damage to businesses and how businesses are and will be reluctant to invest because of the threat of more flooding.<br/><br/>I look forward to the response of the Minister of State to a point I have flagged in this Commencement Debate matter.  What maintenance work has been done downstream where the OPW is responsible?  My understanding is that the only work done involves some trees being cut, and they were below the waterline.  To me, that is a simply a cosmetic exercise because those responsible believe something needs to be done.<br/><br/>Has a scoping exercise been carried out by the OPW?  Has an action plan been put in place?  These are more important than <i>ad hoc</i>works and would show that the OPW is carrying out maintenance as required and pursuant to section 37 of the Arterial Drainage Act.  When the OPW has a scheme it is obliged to maintain and clear the channel.  The Minister of State heard about it at the meeting.  My understanding is that in the past ten years, other than the tree cutting - a futile exercise, in my view - the OPW has not been cleaning or clearing.  All the way downstream vegetation is encroaching on the river channel.  Silt is building up and nothing is being done with any of it.  Not only is it a request on the part of the community, there is a statutory responsibility on the part of the OPW to do this work.  It should be a simple job to do it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-07-21a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1260" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016072100002#B00200"><p>I thank the Senator for the question and for the opportunity to come to the House to speak on the matter of Crossmolina.  I was down there on Monday - I will come to that later.</p> <p>The River Deal downstream from Crossmolina is part of the River Moy catchment drainage scheme carried out by the Office of Public Works between 1960 and 1971 under powers set out in the Arterial Drainage Act 1945.  As with other schemes carried out under the 1945 Act, the primary purpose was to provide outfall for the drainage of agricultural lands.  The scheme also contributed significantly to reducing the flood risk in the urban areas it serves.  The OPW continues to have statutory responsibility for maintaining completed arterial drainage schemes, including the Moy scheme, in proper repair and effective condition.  In fulfilment of this responsibility, the OPW is responsible for the maintenance of over 11,500 km of channel, 730 km of embankments, 18,500 bridges and 750 ancillary structures such as sluice gates, pumping stations and tidal barges throughout the country.  While the average cycle of maintenance is generally in the range of between four and seven years, the OPW routinely inspects all channels and structures for which it has maintenance responsibility.  The timing of the work on individual projects is determined having regard to the need of regular maintenance and the prioritisation of urgent jobs.  Maintenance work is carried out in accordance with OPW environmental management protocols and standard operating procedures which have been developed to minimise the potential environmental impact of the operations.</p> <p>The original scheme for the Moy catchment was designed to cater for all arterial channels which could be included within reasonable cost limits and which would be practical from an engineering point of view.  The legal responsibilities of the OPW in respect of the maintenance of the Moy catchment are limited to the arterial drainage scheme as confirmed by the Minister for Finance under the 1945 Act and as certified to have been completed.  The OPW has no authority to carry out maintenance work in channels such as those upstream of Crossmolina that are not part of the scheme.</p> <p>The Senator will be aware that apart from the responsibilities of the Moy catchment drainage scheme, the OPW is currently engaging in the development of a flood relief scheme for the town of Crossmolina.  I am altogether aware of the extent of the damage there.  I have visited the site.  Since I come from Galway, where there has been extensive flooding, I understand well the suffering in Crossmolina as a result of recent and previous flood events.  Moreover, I understand that flooding continues to be an ongoing threat to people and businesses in the town.</p> <p>A public information day was held in the town in June 2014 to present an emerging preferred solution which involved flood defence walls in the town and raised parapets on the bridge.  Since then, consultants have been working to finalise the design scheme and the environmental impact statement with a view to being in a position to bring the outline scheme forward to formal exhibition at the earliest possible date.  However, new information relating to the bridge became available to the consultants which led them to conclude that the bridge was not sufficiently structurally sound for the purposes of the scheme and would need to be replaced.  This would involve significant additional cost.  While not affecting the overall economic feasibility of the scheme, it requires the options to be re-evaluated, including the option of diverting the channel.</p> <p>A review of the options will also take into account the most up-to-date hydrological data and other relevant information arising from the Storm Desmond flood event, which recorded the highest ever levels on the river.  To assist in the re-evaluation process, a hydrological assessment is under way to assess the local karst regime.  It is critical to understand the nature of the karst drainage system and its relationship with surface water drainage before the diversion option can be brought further.  It is likely that the assessment will take at least until the end of 2016.  The options report will be finalised on completion of these investigations.  While this has meant a delay to the scheme, the most important point is that the best possible solution is found for the town flooding problem.</p> <p>A further public information day was held on 8 April outlining this information to the public.  If the survey confirms that the diversion option is feasible and if design work on the option progresses satisfactorily, a public exhibition of this option is likely in the second quarter of 2017.  In the event that the diversion option does not prove to be feasible, then the original option of walls and bridge replacement could be progressed at an accelerated rate since considerable work on this has already been completed.  The public exhibition of this proposal could happen possibly in the first quarter.</p> <p>If the proposed scheme is acceptable locally, it will then move to the detailed design stage, which will be followed by the formal confirmation stage, as requested under the Arterial Drainage Acts.  As an interim measure to help mitigate any further flood damage and pending the completion of the flood defence scheme, the OPW and Mayo County Council are working together on a pilot project of individual property protection.  The council has carried out a survey of households and has received expressions of interest from 60 homeowners for the installation of flood gates.  The OPW hopes to appoint consultants shortly to undertake surveys of individual properties to determine their suitability for floodgates.  This work will be funded through the OPW minor flood mitigation works and coastal protection scheme.  In addition Mayo County Council is also preparing a flood emergency plan for Crossmolina.</p> <p>In addition to meeting the people there last Monday, a further meeting will take place today involving Inland Fisheries Ireland, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, Mayo County Council and the Office of Public Works to determine what works can be carried out upstream and to come up with a solution.  That is the best I can do, because changing Acts will not happen today.  I await the outcome of that deliberation today.  I assure the House that the OPW remains fully committed to delivering an effective flood defence scheme for Crossmolina and has included provisions for the costs of this scheme in its multiannual profiles for the period 2016 to 2019.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-07-21a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1425" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016072100002#B00300"><p>I welcome that a meeting is going to take place today.  Ideally, this conversation with the Minister of State would happen after the meeting but the reality is nothing new will be discussed.  The problem is that the upstream section is falling between two stools and no one is taking responsibility.  My suggestion is a simple one.  I am suggesting an extension pursuant to section 12 of the Arterial Drainage Act 1945 to include upstream as part of the existing drainage scheme.  That would make it the responsibility of the OPW.  It would assist in making it the responsibility of someone.</p> <p>In the second part of the matter I have raised I asked what maintenance has been carried out.  An official has provided the Minister of State with an answer but he has not described any work.  No work has been carried out.  The Minister of State will have seen the photographs of the vegetation and overgrowth downstream.  I appreciate the Minister of State could not see the silt because there was water in the channel.  Nothing has been done.  I guarantee the Minister of State that if he asked his officials or the people in the area, he will find out that there is no action plan or scoping document on how the OPW is going to do the maintenance.  It is not simply a case of us asking the OPW to do it, the OPW is obliged to do so.</p> <p>I accept the point about the cost.  We can all talk pie in the sky.  This is a simple matter.  We are not talking about dredging.  I have made inquiries on the matter.  The work involves putting a machine on the bank and taking away the vegetation encroaching into the river channel as well as the silt.  This work would clear the channel and allow the water to flow more freely from the town to Lough Conn.  This, in turn, would hopefully assist in mitigating the risk of flooding.  The first flood saw two inches of water going in.  One could not but argue that this work would at least assist in allowing water to move more freely.</p></speech>

It is very simple: we can go in.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michelle Mulherin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is already a derogation under the birds directive where public health requires works to be carried out.  Local authorities use this derogation all the time for hedge cutting and there is absolutely no reason work cannot be done by the OPW to get into the channel from the river downstream to the lake.  I cannot understand the resistance.  I believe the Minister of State is grasping the nettle.  In his previous capacity, he spoke about the problems of flooding in Galway.  No more than myself, I am sure he is endeavouring to the best of his ability to get this solved.  However, it is over to the Minister of State really.  This is being complicated.  There is a legal obligation on the OPW which it has not lived up to in Crossmolina in relation to the clearance of this channel.  I ask the Minister of State not to allow people who have been at this for years to give him the run-around.  This is an old chestnut within the OPW and it has not been responding.  Given that there is no problem with the National Parks and Wildlife Service or the IFA, why is it not being done?</p></speech>

Since I got involved in the project in Crossmolina, I have instigated the downstream cleaning of the river.  It is going to happen as we told representatives last Monday.  In fairness, the Senator must let that happen.  I am not here to go into the technical issues and the type of machinery that should be used, but that is going to happen.  I have made it happen.</p> <p>Upstream is something we could talk about forever.  Last Monday, however, I instigated that the four people involved would look at it and see what solution they can come up with.  That is the best possible progress from Monday to the meeting today with all the people involved.  That is as much as I am going to do until I see what emerges from that.  Perhaps this matter might not need to have been tabled if we had waited until we saw the result of that.</p></speech>

I am delighted we are getting the opportunity to discuss this very important issue on the last sitting day before we rise for the summer recess.  This is an issue that is very close to many people's hearts, particularly those of us who are Irish citizens but do not have a vote in presidential elections at this point in time.</p> <p>The Constitutional Convention made a call for and heard contributions from people across Irish life, including submissions on politics and civic life in the North.  The convention recommended extending the franchise to Irish citizens not just in the North, but also the diaspora.  Senator Lawless made an articulate and wonderful maiden speech in the House yesterday and outlined the significant connection we have to our diaspora.  I imagine that everything we can do to further harness that connection would be welcomed.</p> <p>The President is the President of the Irish people as opposed to the President of the Irish landmass.  As such, it makes practical sense to take this very progressive and, some might say, modest step.  It is modest because 20 years after the Good Friday Agreement was ratified, we still do not have the ability to vote for our President, notwithstanding the anomaly that someone from the North can run and, as has happened, become a very fine President of the Irish people.  I thank the Minister of State for being here and I look forward to the discussion and work ahead.</p></speech>

It is important that we discuss the implications around it.  In its fifth report, the Constitutional Convention recommended that voting rights be extended in presidential elections to Irish citizens resident outside the State.  The then-Government considered this recommendation last year and decided that it would be necessary to analyse the full range of legal, practical and policy issues arising before any decision could be made on the holding of a referendum on the matter.  The estimated costs arising also need to be fully analysed and considered.</p> <p>The Government requested the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to undertake this analysis in co-operation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister of State with responsibility for diaspora affairs.  A range of complex and interrelated issues are being examined as part of the analysis being undertaken.  I will briefly refer to some of the issues that arise.  They are ones which I would have mentioned during the debate last week on extending the Seanad franchise.</p> <p>The wider Irish diaspora is estimated by some at 70 million people.  The number of those in the 70 million who are entitled to Irish citizenship is not known and would be difficult to determine.  However, the potentially very high number of citizens outside the State relative to those within it must be an important consideration in examining the extension of the franchise at presidential elections.  Many questions arise in this regard.  Should voting rights be extended to all citizens resident outside the State or only to passport holders?  Should it be extended only to those born in Ireland or to citizens who have lived outside the State for a limited period?  What would be an appropriate time limit?  Would it be five, ten or 20 years, for example?  How would this be administered or verified?  This is not an exhaustive list of questions that arise when considering this particular issue, but they are ones we will have to talk through at some stage and make decisions on.  The Departments are analysing them and trying to come up with suggestions.</p> <p>Clearly, a robust system for the registration of voters resident outside the State is a prerequisite for any extension of the franchise.  The operational arrangements for the registration of electors in the State would likely not be suitable for an extended franchise.  Much work would be needed in this area and this has already been flagged in relation to the establishment of an electoral commission.  How would citizens outside the State vote?  Arrangements must be workable.  Embassy voting allows for in-person voting such as we have at polling stations.  While in-person voting is generally viewed as the most secure method of voting, many practical issues appear to mitigate against such an arrangement being workable for us.  Postal voting is an alternative for consideration but security of the ballot and verification of identity must be carefully considered if we are to use this method on a very large scale as could arise in an extended franchise.</p> <p>The Government recognises that an extension of voting rights at presidential elections to citizens resident outside the State would be welcomed by many.  An amendment to the Constitution would be required to give effect to the convention's recommendation.  There is a need, however, to ensure that we carry out a thorough analysis of the issues arising before putting a question to the people at a referendum.  My Department is undertaking that analysis in close co-operation with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for diaspora affairs.  I do not have a date as to when the analysis will be concluded.  It is a complicated issue and there is a lot in it.  That does not mean we are not going to do it.  It must all be looked at.  There is a desire there to do this but there is also a fair bit of work involved.  I said during last week's debate on the extension of the Seanad vote that the use of technology is important and that we must explore all options there.  At all times, we must ensure that the system is secure and usable.  We must try to learn from those countries which do this best.</p></speech>

The work is necessary and I appreciate that it is not a simple matter.  However, it needs to be done.  There is a huge onus on us.  I appreciate that the diaspora are in a unique set of circumstances and I do not mean to be dismissive of that, but it would be relatively easy for me to go to St. Matthew's primary school in Seaforde Street in east Belfast to cast my vote for the President.  Perhaps, in parallel with those broader issues, given the size of the diaspora internationally, we could run a dedicated consideration through the North-South Ministerial Council and our colleagues in the Executive and Electoral Commission in the North on how to utilise the existing facilities there.  They are ready to be utilised through co-operation and a good working relationship with the Minister of State's colleagues in the North.  We need to put a bit of fire under this, expedite it and ensure that we are not lost in bureaucracy, albeit I appreciate what the Minister of State points out.  Without putting a timeframe on it <i>per se</i>, it would be useful if the Minister of State would consider ensuring that this does not run perpetually so that we end up sitting here for another 20 years after the Good Friday Agreement and after the Constitutional Convention.  Who knows, we might even have another Northern President in that time.  What we should definitely have is our vote.</p></speech>

It is difficult to do.  It might be a case of coming back with recommendations to do this step by step.  There are easier paths to doing this.  Extending it to the full option of 70 million people when we do not even know how many of them could be citizens would be an awkward process to develop.  It is about coming back with different answers and to try to move it on.  We also have a lot of work to do to get our current register of electors up to date for both D&aacute;il and local authority elections.  It is not completely out of date, but we all come across a lot of problems with it on a daily basis.  The first phase of any work is to get that in order while looking then at all the options.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Department is working hard and we have meetings scheduled during August to try to get a handle on the timeframes involved.

I live in Dublin, but the issue has appeared consistently on my desk in recent weeks.  Community representatives from County Sligo and the county's mayor, Councillor Marie Casserly, have raised it with me.</p> <p>There are three principal libraries and a mobile library service in County Sligo.  We all know the benefits of a library service.  Anyone living in rural Ireland, in particular, knows what they are.  It is not just about books but also the associated services in terms of the arts, culture, heritage and the availability of after-school clubs.  Many things are happening in these three amazing libraries.  I salute the chief executive of Sligo County Council who has a very difficult job, as do the elected members, in difficult financial circumstances in dealing with management and governance issues that we need not detail but about which we all know.  Every local authority must manage its own finances which councillors of all parties and none accept.  One of the three libraries mentioned will close for three weeks during the summer because of resourcing issues.  The service is operating at half staff capacity.  Arriving at a library to find its doors locked because someone is out sick has been known to happen.  If it does not have the staff, it cannot open.  There are many good reasons for this.</p> <p>I will not use too much time, as I want to hear the Minister of State's response to this important issue.  His response is more important.  I might comment subsequently.</p></speech>

It is one I have debated several times, as there is some confusion about what lies in store for libraries.</p> <p>My Department has been in discussions with the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, and local authorities' chief executives on the introduction of a new library management model as outlined in the report, Managing the Delivery of Effective Library Services.  The areas being considered for the new approach include counties Sligo, Leitrim and Roscommon, among others.  The proposed model seeks to put in place planning and implementation arrangements that will deliver more effective and efficient public libraries, thus securing the delivery of an enhanced quality and range of services and the long-term sustainability of the library service.  Moreover, it has been identified as a means of achieving a greater and more equitable standard of library service across all library authorities, rather than the requirement to drive greater cost efficiency.  Accordingly, there will be no closure of libraries in County Sligo or any other local authority area as a result of the proposed model.  Nor will there be any reduction in the library services available in these areas consequent on the changes we are trying to introduce.  Instead of cutting funding and services, the model aims to secure the strategic capacity and scale of operations required to ensure the long-term sustainability of library services in smaller counties such as Sligo.  In this regard, the model focuses on enhancing the services available, while safeguarding the role of local representatives and local authorities which will still be responsible for the policies, priorities and budgets of their respective library services.</p> <p>Libraries are evolving and becoming a focal point for community engagement.  As the Senator mentioned, the library service plays a very important role in community life.  In addition to what many still perceive to be the traditional preserve of the library, namely, book lending, the local library now provides educational supports, community meeting facilities, study spaces, cultural supports and supports for businesses in terms of research and innovation.  It provides a space and a range of services that communities may not otherwise be able to access.  We want to build on this, enhance the services available and ensure library services across all local authorities are in the best position to respond to emerging local needs and priorities.  To this end, we will continue to engage with the respective local authorities to identify the optimum solution for the counties concerned.  An alternative approach that seeks to deliver the same strategic objectives has been submitted for my Department's consideration.  We made it clear that we would be willing to consider alternatives.  We will work with the local authorities concerned in the coming weeks to explore how this approach might be implemented to achieve the best possible outcome for all concerned.</p> <p>It is not a question of cutting front-line services; rather, it is about management and making strategic decisions.  We want to enhance front-line services.  The importance of a library to a community, particularly in smaller towns and villages, is clear to me.  Often, it can help communities that run many events.  We want to protect that aspect and I am fully behind it.  The closure of libraries in County Sligo is not the result of the changes we are introducing; rather, it is down to the local authority's budgetary decisions.  I can investigate the matter if the Senator wants me to do so, but the closure is not due to the changes we have requested to be made at this level.</p></speech>

I agree that there is a need to reform the library service.  We both acknowledge the importance of libraries and the services they provide for communities, in particular, rural communities.  What I am taking from the Minister of State's response is that there will be no library closures in County Sligo - I am glad that he has confirmed that fact - and no service reductions.  We can take these two positives from our deliberations.  Will the Minister of State or his Department seek clarification and reassurance from the chief executive of Sligo County Council to the effect that no libraries will be closed for three or four weeks this summer?  That is important.  What the Minister of State has told the House is good news and we will not be slow in telling the people of County Sligo.  Fair play to him for standing by them and making this commitment, for which I thank him.  Will he give an undertaking to make contact with the chief executive of the county council to determine whether there has been a misunderstanding or lack of resources or whether anything can be done to ensure no library service will be curtailed during the summer months?</p></speech>

These changes should not and will not affect front-line services.  If members of Sligo County Council decide to close a library for a week or two owing to their existing budget, that is not something we are asking them to do.  The changes we are introducing are not focused on cost reduction but on enhancing the service provided.  As they have not even been introduced, they are not the reason behind the closing of a library for a week or two during the summer.  These are two separate issues.  A local decision is just that, but our strategy will not affect library opening hours.  We are introducing new initiatives.  I have complimented front-line library services many times on the various initiatives they have tried.  One on which they are working involves longer opening hours, in respect of which libraries may be accessed using swipe cards and pin numbers without the need for any staff member to be present out of hours.  In some cases, libraries are open everyday, including Christmas Day, for example, in Tullamore and Tubbercurry and a third location.  The pilot scheme has worked well and is being extended.  Libraries can remain open for longer hours without the need for staff to be present.  That is an option.  The idea for this reform came from the library service.  We are constantly trying to change and examine new ideas to extend opening hours and the availability of library services, but the proposed changes do not call for a reduction in services.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State for what is his first debate on a matter in which I have been involved.  I also congratulate him on his appointment.</p> <p>I was contacted by a number of businesses about the public service obligation, PSO, levy, which it is proposed be increased by approximately 36% from October.  A Government levy on the electricity bills of commercial and domestic users, it is used to subsidise the use of renewable energy sources, which is laudable, and peat-burning power plants.  However, the levy has been increased by 226% since 2010.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John O'Mahony:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2202"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2202&amp;amp;pid=JohnOMahony&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I think there were small decreases at some stages - perhaps there was one last year - but this year's increase is one of the biggest.</p><p>I will put this in context.  I was contacted by representatives of a quarry in the Minister of State's constituency.  At the moment, the quarry is paying &euro;5,520 a month, or &euro;66,240 a year, as part of the levy.  If this increase goes ahead in October, the quarry's new payment will be approximately &euro;7,500 a month, or &euro;90,000 a year.  The annual increase will be &euro;23,000.  That is just an example of what will happen if this increase is sanctioned.  We are talking about small businesses that pay rates and various other charges, rather than the businesses that are availing of the 12.5% corporation tax rate.  It is impossible for them to budget or plan ahead.</p><p>As the Minister of State knows, Irish electricity prices are among the highest in Europe.  A large increase in the PSO levy would exacerbate that imbalance.  As the small businesses to which I refer are providing jobs, it is clear that issues like job creation, job security and the competitiveness of Irish companies in Ireland and abroad are at stake here.  Companies that export are currently having to deal with the outcome of the Brexit referendum in Britain.  The weaker sterling is causing its own problems.  If this additional issue arises, these companies will have more difficulties.</p><p>Is it proposed that this increase will go ahead?  I am aware that there was a consultation period and all of that.  I am calling for this to be looked at again in the context of all the issues I have mentioned.  I refer particularly to the effect it would have on small businesses.  I appreciate that both commercial and domestic users would be affected by this increase, but in raising this matter today I am thinking particularly of job creation.</p></speech>

I am taking this Commencement Debate matter on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Naughten.  I thank the Senator for giving me an opportunity to comment on this important issue.</p> <p>While the calculation of the PSO levy is technically and strictly a matter for the CER, which is independent in this function as it is in its other statutory functions, I welcome this chance to discuss the levy.  It has been proposed that the PSO levy for 2016-17 will be &euro;441 million, which would equate to less than &euro;7 per month for domestic consumers.  The levy, which is charged to all customers, is designed to compensate suppliers for the additional costs they incur by meeting their obligations to purchase electricity from renewable sources and indigenous sources and to ensure security of supply.</p> <p>The existence of the PSO is vital if we are to deliver on our renewable energy targets, ensure security of supply and support hundreds of jobs in the midlands that are associated with the peat industry.  The PSO has supported the connection of over 2,000 MW of renewable energy to the electricity grid.  It will continue to support the development of renewable energy so that we can meet our target of boosting renewable penetration by 40% by 2020.  Recent studies have shown that Ireland has one of the lowest per-unit supports for renewable energy in the EU.  The biggest driver for the proposed increase in the levy is the lower predicted wholesale market electricity price, which is currently estimated to be approximately 28% lower than it was last year.  This results in lower predicted market income for the PSO plants.  Therefore, a higher levy is required to cover the allowed costs.</p> <p>The lower wholesale electricity price is currently being driven by lower international gas prices.  This drives up the PSO levy.  These reduced gas prices help to reduce the wholesale cost of electricity that suppliers pay.  This should enable suppliers to reduce their retail prices and offset the PSO levy increase.  Electricity prices are deregulated.  The CER will continue to actively monitor suppliers and the retail market generally.  While the support of renewable electricity generation adds to the PSO levy and to customer bills, it should be noted that wind also tends to reduce the wholesale price of electricity because the operating cost of wind power is close to zero.  Renewable generation therefore displaces fossil fuel generation.</p> <p>Like the Senator, I am concerned about increases in the electricity costs of industry, households and the small businesses he has mentioned.  It should be noted in the context of the proposed increase that as the wholesale electricity price is falling, this should be passed on to electricity customers, thereby acting as a counterweight to the increase in the PSO levy.  In recent months, a number of electricity suppliers have announced price reductions on their standard tariffs.  Most suppliers offer significant discounts to new customers.  I urge all domestic and commercial consumers to seek the best-value offer available to them.</p> <p>The reductions in the market that are available to customers outweigh the PSO levy increase.  As the increased levy is partly driven by lower wholesale electricity prices, I expect all suppliers will reduce their prices.  It is worth noting that the current decision is a proposed decision by the regulator.  The CER may use a revised figure for the wholesale electricity price in the final decision paper if forecast fuel prices change for 2016-17.  A final decision on the PSO levy for 2016-17 will be published before 1 August next.  Changes in the forecast wholesale price will affect the amount of the PSO levy, increasing it if the forecast wholesale price decreases and reducing it if the wholesale price increases.</p></speech>

I suppose the reality of what he has said is that the PSO levy increases when prices decrease.  That drives people crazy.  In other words, the benefits of price decreases are wiped out by something else.  While I understand perfectly the point made by the Minister of State about the independence of the CER in setting the levy, I suggest that if an issue here is affecting jobs and competitiveness, it needs to be approached.  It is important for that point to be made to energy regulator when he is making his decision.</p> <p>When I served as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, the current Minister, Deputy Naughten, who was not a Minister at the time, raised this point with the energy regulator.  I expect him to take an interest in it now.  I would like the Minister of State to ask the Minister whether he intends to raise these concerns again so that they will be taken into account when the final decision is being made in October.</p></speech>

I will liaise with the Minister, Deputy Naughten, on this issue and I will ask him to liaise with the CER.  I accept that there is uncertainty about issues pertaining to the levy.  This is associated with factors outside our control that relate to the global market for energy.  A number of factors are applying upward pressure to the PSO levy, including the lower Single Energy Market and wholesale market prices.  As I have said, the wholesale market price is 20% lower than the price used to calculate the current 2015-16 PSO levy.  That creates a major complication.</p> <p>I reiterate that a lower wholesale price means that the payment to companies engaged in the PSO increases.  In addition, there are more renewables.  The REFIT scheme supported 2,080 MW of renewable generation in 2015.  It is estimated that 2,943 MW of renewable energy, mostly wind energy, will be supported by the PSO next year.  As this is 863 MW, or 41%, more than the level supported in the current PSO period, it is driving up the levy.  The CER estimates that all renewables account for approximately &euro;334 million of the total of &euro;444 million.  While there are a number of complicating factors, they are predominantly based on the lower gas prices in the present market.

Will the Acting Leader ask the Minister for Finance to clarify the position?</p> <p>The second issue is the challenges facing small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, in seeking Government public procurement contracts.  The Office of Government Procurement's drive to centralise the public procurement of goods and services is having a detrimental effect on small and medium-sized businesses.  Despite some superficial changes to the rules on turnover, essentially, most small businesses are unable to compete with larger companies when it comes to the Government's public procurement strategy.  Many small businesses have contacted me in the past few weeks about the matter.  They have modest staff numbers and turnover and are pleading with me because they are unable to compete with larger companies.  We hear daily that SMEs are the lifeblood of the economy, yet these measures are hitting home and crippling small and local businesses, ranging from legal service providers to stationery and sanitary suppliers.</p> <p>The problem is that many of the contracts put out to tender by the Government are too large.  The Government's advice to small businesses is that they should join together as a consortium to enable them to compete for these contracts.  To ask a small company to join with a competitor is grossly unfair.  Many small businesses might be family businesses that have been in business for a long time and have trade secrets and it is unfair to ask them to join others and share these trade secrets in an effort to compete for tenders.  </p> <p>Another major issue is that while many tenders are meant to be provided for SMEs, many subsidiaries of larger companies are claiming to be small businesses.  This means that predatory pricing is being introduced, whereby SMEs are just not able to compete with larger suppliers.  It is really affecting them.</p> <p>In the past small businesses traditionally dealt with local schools.  For example, a principal would have been able to ring and ask a business to deliver a few hundred rolls of toilet paper.  Now he or she cannot go to the local supplier but must go online and order from a centralised database.  It is to the massive detriment of the local school, as well as local business.  Many local and small businesses do not have the confidence or the resources to apply for the larger contracts.  It is generally unfair.  </p> <p>Given that SMEs are the lifeblood of the economy, if we do not protect them, we will have no economy.  Any of the larger companies could pull out of Ireland on any day and we would be left with no industry.  I ask the Acting Leader to raise this issue with the Minister and ask him to revise the public procurement guidelines.  If they cannot be revised, perhaps there might be more investment in providing resources for small businesses to enable them to enter and compete in the tender process, as it is a non-transparent and costly exercise to enter it.</p></speech>

I await a response from the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to the specific issues I have raised with him.  While we wait for policy makers to take the lead in ensuring more fairness and balance, particularly in publicly funded media, the problem continues.  Nowhere is this more visible than in the complete lack of fairness and balance in RTE's coverage of the abortion issue which, given the Government's initiation of a citizens' assembly to address the issue, among others, requires urgent attention in these Houses.  I will outline the most recent example.  In the past month, from 9 June to 8 July, RTE Radio 1 devoted an incredible 81 minutes to people who were pushing for repeal of the eighth amendment to the Constitution, while in the same period the pro-life side was given a paltry four minutes to make its case.  Members heard me correctly.  If public service broadcasting is to mean anything, regardless of our views on this issue, we must acknowledge that there has been an utter abuse of power and influence which shows contempt for the licence paying public.  It is no wonder that the public never hears hard questions being put on RTE to abortion advocates.  When a woman from Ireland died in the back of a London taxi after an abortion at a Marie Stopes clinic, there was no outcry on RTE, no headline coverage for days and no "Prime Time" debates.  When women hurt by their experience of abortion wish to tell their stories, RTE looks the other way.  When parents feel pressured by medical personnel to abort their child with a life limiting condition, as has happened, RTE has shown no interest or curiosity in pursuing their stories.  It only gives headline coverage to stories that push abortion.  That is what the record shows.  It consistently shields Government commentary in support of abortion from any one-on-one debate with those who seek to protect unborn children.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I am concluding and I am grateful for the opportunity afforded me by the Cathaoirleach.  RTE no longer deserves the public's trust on these issues.  There was only 81 minutes allocated for the so-called pro-choice side and four minutes for those who want to protect both mothers and unborn children.  Such allocation is insulting and inexcusable.  We should applaud members of the public who have drawn attention to the blatant nature of the bias for some time in a calm, reasoned and persistent way.  Fairness in the media goes to the heart of our democracy and how it functions.  The House ought to debate this issue as a matter of urgency.  It is time we posed hard questions to RTE.  It is time that RTE stopped treating members of the licence fee-paying public like fools.  RTE has some fine honourable reporters working for it and my remarks are not directed at them.  When it comes to the abortion issue, journalism is dead in RTE and propagandism has taken its place.  To claim otherwise is to insult people's intelligence.  I ask the Deputy Leader to please arrange a debate on RTE's bias on this issue, at the earliest possible opportunity, because the present problem, controversy and scandal has to be addressed quickly. </p></speech>

I acknowledge the help that I have received from the Leader in trying to secure a bed.  I appreciate what the Cathaoirleach said about a Commencement debate but I felt it was important that I raised this matter yesterday.   Not only to raise it on behalf of Mary but also on behalf of all of the other Marys and Johns who await vital treatment.  I will never apologise for doing so.</p> <p>I want to return to an issue I raised last week in regard to the Government's economic forecast.  The CSO, through the Department of the Taoiseach, is responsible for the collation and dissemination of economic data for the State.  This is meant to instil confidence in the economy and provide accurate data for Ireland's potential investors and traders.  The recent skewed figures for GDP growth were not just an embarrassment for Ireland, as we see now, but a figure has been placed on how much it will cost us, namely, and additional &euro;280 million.  That sum would provide a lot of hospital beds in the west.  Even the director general of the CSO has said, at the MacGill Summer School, that GDP and GNP, although required internationally, no longer provide a sufficient understanding of the domestic economy or growth.  While they may be used to measure income to an extent, they certainly do not measure equality.</p> <p>That to which I refer has not happened just with these figures.  I want to refer to the CSO figures on farming.  We were told that 30,000 jobs were created in farming in one quarter in 2013.  I was so amazed by the statistic that I rang the office of the CSO in Cork.  I told the person who answered my call that 100 new jobs were not being created on a daily basis in farming but I was informed that the statistic was true, according to the figures.  I replied that the person must be overrun with tractors in Cork because farming jobs were not being created in Mayo.  Obviously, the figures have been altered.  The CSO is looking for leadership for a means to provide more accurate economic data.  In the wake of these remarks, from a senior civil servant working in the Taoiseach's Department, I ask that somebody from the latter be invited to come in here to address my concerns about the validity of economic data released by the Government.</p></speech>

It would be useful to debate them more comprehensively in the House.</p> <p>Earlier this week, I raised my concern about the Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement, CETA, between the EU and Canada.  The Minister responding recognised that there is a need for further debate and suggested that the jobs, enterprise and innovation committee might be one place where such a debate might occur.  I ask the Leader to consider arranging to hold a debate on the matter in the Seanad because the scope of the agreement goes far beyond the question of jobs and innovation.  It would be useful to debate the agreement in this House prior to the proposed signing of a provisional application on 18 October.  The agreement is a pressing issue and, therefore, it is a matter for a pressing debate.  I would appreciate if we could have a debate during the first week of our return in the autumn.</p> <p>As a university Senator, I am extremely concerned - as is another of the university Senators, Senator Ruane - about the developments in Turkey in response to the recent coup.  These developments are giving rise to serious human rights concerns.  In Turkey, 21,000 teachers have had their licences revoked, 15,200 staff at the department of education have lost their employment and been suspended and 1,500 deans of universities have also had their resignations demanded.  The Turkish state has placed a huge scale of pressure on the education system at every level and on the individuals who work in the system.  There are now media reports that academic staff have been forbidden from international travel.  Moreover, those who are travelling internationally at present were given the deadline of 8.30 a.m. today to return to their posts and present themselves for work.  That means some of the academic staff only have a matter of several hours' notice.  We are not clear what the consequence will be for those who did not get back to Turkey at 8.30 a.m.  This is a very concerning issue.  I urge that over the summer that the Government makes sure that human rights concerns are placed at the centre of their engagement in the ongoing situation in Turkey.  I ask that the Minister for Education and Skills engage with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on this issue.  I also ask that the Government promotes a review of the EU-Turkey refugee deal in light of the highly unstable situation and worrying trends in that country.</p> <p>I will not address my final issue because Senator Craughwell will comprehensively address it.  I refer to the issue of the Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT, unfairly reneging on its funding agreement with the students' union there.  Senator Lynn Ruane and I call on DIT to address the issue and ensure that interim funding is found.</p></speech>

Two days ago, Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and I met members of the student's union.  The behaviour of the DIT executive is troubling and affects the independence and autonomy of the students' union.  I have received a response from DIT and look forward to meeting its representatives in an effort to resolve the impasse in everyone's interest.</p><p>I want to raise the issue of the conduct of section 38 organisations that are funded by the State and which provide services on its behalf to people with disabilities.  In an article by Martin Wall in this morning's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>it is stated that the St. John of God organisation ran two separate payroll systems from 2010 to 2013.  Some very well remunerated senior managers were paid a particular amount under one payroll system and the balance under the other.  To me, the organisation put this system in place to avoid responsibilities relating to the introduction of public sector pay cuts.  St. John of God is effectively a public sector organisation and is recognised as such in law.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerald Nash:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2281"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2281&amp;amp;pid=GeraldNash&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Its staff, and all those associated with it and other section 38 organisations are, <i>de facto</i>, public servants.  The Committee of Public Accounts is examining the issue as the result of an internal HSE audit or investigation but there is a fundamental principle at stake here.  In difficult times, St. John of God and other organisations had absolutely no compunction whatsoever introducing pay cuts, through public sector pay agreements, in respect of physiotherapists, nurses, administrators and those who deliver services to people who need them most.  Of course, its senior decision makers appear to be a much more protected species.  Moreover, the body was, and is, absolutely required to implement public sector pay agreements, end of story.  This is a matter of fact.  In recent weeks, the Ministers, Deputies Donohoe and Harris, have made some very welcome statements on the responsibilities of section 38 organisations regarding public sector pay agreements.  However, as a House and as public representatives, we need to send a very strong message to organisations such St. John of God that public sector pay agreements cannot be breached and the organisations cannot be selective in how they are implemented.</p></speech>

For a long time, I have stated that history should be a compulsory subject because everyone should know their background and the history of the country.  This is particularly the case in the year in which we are celebrating the centenary of the 1916 Rising.  History should be at the core of education in this country.  Gaelic games, particularly hurling and football, should also be at the centre of the curriculum.</p></speech>

There is an issue in Irish society whereby we have a land of no consequences for people in positions of influence.  When they do wrong nothing ever happens to them.</p><p>I am disappointed at the lack of legislation being dealt with this afternoon.  The Opposition tabled a number of Bills, including on corporate manslaughter and the recognition of Irish sign language.  The corporate manslaughter legislation is interesting because it was proposed by the Law Reform Commission ten years ago but has never been dealt with.  The reason for this is that the people who would be held accountable are in the public service.  They are those who failed in the Blood Transfusion Service Board and who have failed so many other times, including regarding Portlaoise Hospital where women died and people knew about it but no action was taken.  Individuals should be held to account but this does not happen as a result of the fact that the legislation is not in place.  The latter is due to the fact that those in positions of power are ensuring that it is not introduced because it is they who would be held to account.</p><p>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to the effect that the Irish sign language recognition Bill be published and I asked the Deputy Leader to allow for this.  The Bill would allow members of the deaf community to interact with the State, which at present they cannot do.  The more than 5,000 members of the deaf community and their families have no legal basis on which they can ask the Government to ensure there are services for them to interact.  The most serious case of this is regarding accident and emergency departments.  A member of the deaf community would not be able to communicate with a consultant emergency doctor and there is no provision whereby there must be an interpreter in place.  One may be put in place, but it is not necessary to do so.  This is covered in one of the many provisions in the Bill.  Will the Deputy Leader allow for it to be published?  In the autumn, instead of making statements <i>ad nauseam</i>because there is no legislation, Fianna F&aacute;il has legislation, which is long overdue, that is ready to be debated.</p></speech>

As a result of the row that has developed, the students' union is running out of cash.  This puts at risk the jobs of 20 people.  Three times the students' union has had an agreement with the institution, which, on each occasion, has rowed back on it.  This simply cannot be allowed to happen today.  Will the Deputy Leader - it is a pleasure to address her on her first time sitting in that seat - make contact on behalf of the House and ask DIT to at least put in place an interim arrangement to ensure funding until a final agreement can be reached?  Senator Nash and his colleagues have written to the institute and received a reply.  There will be a meeting at some stage but the situation is simply not acceptable.  This is an attempt by an institution to try to use the pressure of funding to manage a union.  When one tries to manage any union, as far I am concerned, it is repugnant to the entire system.  It must be independent and have in place its own auditing systems.  The students' union at DIT is quite happy to do so.  This is Big Brother trying to control things.</p> <p>Following a Commencement debate, we had an agreement with the former Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, on the registration of physical therapists and physiotherapists.  This is an extremely serious issue.  After completing a course over a couple of weekends, individuals can stick a sign outside their door and tell the world they are physical therapists, whereas chartered physiotherapists must undergo extensive training.  There was an agreement in place as to how registered physical therapists and physical therapy students could upgrade to full physiotherapy, and this was to be provided for in legislation.  I understand that this will be rowed back on, which will be to the detriment of the health system.  Will the Deputy Leader take this to the current Minister, Deputy Harris, and ask him to look into it as a matter of urgency?</p></speech>

I wish to be associated with Senator Conway's timely remarks about the staff of the House.</p> <p>I welcome the set of solutions proposed to deal with the housing crisis announced by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and his team.  We need to establish a mechanism to monitor this as was the case with the Action Plan for Jobs.  Each month we need to know what has been achieved, how many houses have been built, how many vacant properties have been acquired, etc.  I ask the Deputy Leader to ensure that.  The Seanad could play a role in that.  At least every couple of months, we should have a debate to take stock on the status of the housing crisis.</p> <p>I am particularly interested in the occupation of vacant houses, whether they are vacant houses owned by local authorities that have not yet been turned around, vacancies above shops, vacant houses owned by people anywhere or even relatively derelict properties that could be reconstructed and put into use.</p> <p>I am also interested in encouraging first-time buyers, which is obviously where the great problem is for the developer-builder sector.  More importantly, there is the human reality for the prospective first-time buyers, who cannot get into the market.  That needs to be addressed in the budget.  The signs here are good but it needs to happen.</p> <p>I am encouraged to hear from the Minister and others that there are positive moves afoot in the private sector to develop student accommodation.  I am aware of one such development.  I am anxious that we also monitor that because purpose-built student accommodation is key to providing the cheap accommodation third level students need to allow them get the full university experience rather than having to commute but also to relieve the housing crisis.</p> <p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to address these important issues.  It is the biggest crisis facing the country.  We should monitor it in the House.  We talk about the relevance of this House all the time.  Nothing would be more relevant than a two-monthly debate on the status of that.</p></speech>

I recommend that everybody take the time to read it.  It is incredibly well put together.  It contains startling figures.  For those who do not know, TASC stands for Think-tank for Action on Social Change.  It is an independent progressive think-tank whose core focus is economic equality and democratic accountability.  Mr. Fergus Finlay was in attendance to assist with yesterday's launch.</p> <p>The 2016 report reveals a deep inequality at the heart of this economic recovery that threatens its sustainability.  It demonstrates not only that there is a deep divide in Irish society in terms of wealth and income, but also that this divide is getting worse.  The report states that the top 10% of wealth earners now own 54% of Ireland's wealth while the bottom 50% hold less than 5% of the wealth.  Therefore, half of the population in the State has less than 5% of the wealth.  That is the Republic that has been delivered to us.</p> <p>There are shocking figures on gender inequality.  For example 29% of female workers are low paid as opposed to 19% of men.  The gender pay gap between women with no children and women with at least one child is 31% - the highest in the EU.  The proportion of children living in consistent poverty rose from 6.8% in 2008 to 11.7% in 2013.  That equates to 138,000 children, one in eight, living in consistent poverty.  One in ten people aged over 65 is at risk of poverty.  In 2014 lone parent households had a deprivation rate of 58.7% and a consistent poverty rate of 22%.</p> <p>The overall message here is that for all the spin of the Government and the media, inequality is growing, not decreasing.  Child poverty has nearly doubled.  In-work poverty is on the increase, as is deprivation.  At the same time the wealth share of the top 10% rose by 10% in a year.</p> <p>These figures are as a direct result of the unbroken conservative rule in this State.  It does not matter whether it was Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael conservative rule; the results have been the same.  I ask the Deputy Leader to invite the Minister for Justice and Equality to come to the House in September for a debate on inequality.  We need to talk about inequality in the State.</p></speech>

It is a cross-Government approach led by the Department of Justice and Equality and is based on five strategic priorities: building skills and independence; providing bridges and supports into work; promoting job retention; providing co-ordinated and seamless support; and engaging employers.  However, the problem is it has no funding or action plan.</p> <p>What the strategy proposes and what is actually happening are two different things.  Without implementation of this strategy and adequate resources, nothing will change.  Last week in the Leinster House AV Room, two young ladies told their stories of how the innovative WALK PEER programme has changed their lives and given them hope of leading contributing lives in mainstream careers, rather than lives in expensive services.  The WALK PEER programme works on bridging the gap and providing equal employment routes for people with disabilities.  The WALK PEER programme is funded until the end of 2016 but the uncertainty about its future only leads to additional stress and anxiety for the participants and their families.  The stress of stop-start projects needs to be addressed.</p> <p>I ask all Members of the House to support a call for dedicated funding in the budget for 2017 for the implementation of the CES through longer-term funding for innovative projects such as WALK PEER so that the learning can be captured as the strategy is developed.  I also ask the Deputy Leader to ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to commit to dedicating resources to the implementation of the comprehensive employment strategy for the employment of people with disabilities now and to funding some current innovative projects.  Alternatively, do we have to wait until after the ten years is up before we take some action to reverse the plight of people with disabilities being systematically transitioned from school into expensive Department of Health-funded programmes without the chance of testing their abilities in the mainstream to further education, training and employment?</p> <p>I wish the Cathaoirleach a happy birthday.</p></speech>

I am sure this matter will be resolved; I am not expecting any special privileges.  I appreciate the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s courtesy.</p> <p>I understand the Taoiseach went on walkabout yesterday in the north inner city.  I very much welcome this.  It is about time and it is a good thing.  The Taoiseach has been in the inner city five times since the recent emergency.  I am extremely glad Fitzgibbon Street Garda station is being reopened.  As Senators all know, I have campaigned in this House over a number of years to reopen the station, which is central to the policing of the inner city.  It is in the area most affected by drugs.  It is an area of considerable criminal activity, regrettably, and it is very necessary to have the police station open.  I very much welcome the move.</p> <p>Everything of value has been ripped out of the north inner city and it has been stuffed with drug clinics.  While they are necessary, why concentrate them in an already deprived area?  The local authorities have not implemented their own regulations on the development of derelict houses, rubbish, etc.  It is time for a really concerted effort to save this area of our city, in which I am proud to live.  The amounts of money invested so far are absolutely tiny.  I hope this is just seed money because it does not compare favourably with the amount we are apparently happy to give away to the European Union as a result of leprechaun economics.  Some &euro;280 million has been just whizzed away.  Small amounts of money are provided.  I hope the money is just seed money and that there will be further progress.</p> <p>I wish to raise a final matter about which I am sure a number of Senators feel the same way as I do.  I have been contacted by people who run a charity shop in Carlow and who are being charged commercial rates.  This is wrong.</p></speech>

In 1980, 20% of students proceeded to third level education.  Today that figure has increased to 60%.  We have the highest level of participation at third level in the European Union.  This is a statistic of which we can all be proud.  Unfortunately, finding accommodation for our children, particularly in this city, has become a serious problem.  In 2014, the Higher Education Authority said the number of student beds was approximately 31,000.  Today, it is reckoned there is a need for approximately 57,000.  This goes to show the extent of the problem.  If one couples this with the increase in rent, one can see how some students must commit to leases they simply cannot afford.  Some have to sleep on the floor in friends' accommodation, some must live in poor-quality accommodation and some must travel long distances to get to college.</p> <p>The USI recently commissioned a survey of students that found that 58% miss a meal each day to try to stay in college.  Some 38% go hungry in order to stay in college and 34% of go without heat.  Some 25%, or one in four, have contacted their students' union to contact the Society of St. Vincent de Paul or a food bank for food.  That is serious.  As one can imagine, this fosters a dropout culture at third level.  It is an issue we must address.  It is a crisis that will be facing more people in September, unfortunately.</p> <p>Addressing this requires some imaginative thinking.  One solution might be a State-backed fund to allow universities to build accommodation.  Another might be to decentralise some of the courses in our universities.  I am sure there is not a provincial town in Ireland that does not have facilities that could serve as an outreach facility to cater for students.  In Cavan and Monaghan, there are two institutes with accommodation of quality available to students.  If institutes of technology are providing an outreach facility, I see no reason the colleges could not address this issue also.  It is a serious problem that needs to be addressed.</p> <p>I beg the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s indulgence on a more joyful matter, on the day that is in it.  I congratulate Ireland&rsquo;s oldest councillor, a gentlemen called Mr. Ian McGarvey from Ramelton in County Donegal, on having celebrated his 86th birthday last week.  This is a fantastic achievement.  He is a credit not only to those of his age but also to the community he serves.  He is an example to us all, young and old.</p></speech>

The incidence of petrol stretching has increased again.  This is because a new dye has been put in diesel and the diesel launderers are finding it very hard to get it out of it.  In Meath and Mayo, there has been an epidemic of petrol stretching, resulting in cars being absolutely destroyed.  In certain cases, the retailer sorted out some of those affected.  In other areas, the insurance company did so.  With the retailer, one had to have a track record, including receipts.  With the insurance company, it was a question of one's policy.  What is happening now, however, is that insurance companies are including clauses stating they will not cover the policyholder if an engine is damaged by petrol stretching.  What I am saying to the public today is that if the price is too cheap, there is something wrong.  If a petrol station has no brand or does not have a sign up with the retailer excellence code, one should keep going.  In the long run, one will pay, and pay dearly.  Customs officials have said this is a very serious problem and that the launderers are going to extremes to water down the petrol.  In certain cases, they get away with it, with a 5% kerosene mix, but they are now increasing the proportion of kerosene 15% or 20%.</p> <p>Another practice the criminals have resorted to is the selling of non-winner scratch cards.  They are mixing non-winner scratch cards with legitimate scratch cards, resulting in a profit of 300% for the retailer.  When one system of making money illicitly falls through, the criminals move on to some other game.  Petrol laundering is a serious issue.</p></speech>

We, especially the newbies who probably wrecked the heads of the staff, really appreciate their support.  I hope we will come back energised and a bit more knowledgeable after the summer.</p> <p>I wish to raise two issues, the first of which concerns the action plan for housing.  We welcome the report.  It is an improvement over the previous offers but it could clearly go a bit further.  The cross-party committee had a target of building 10,000 social houses per year.  Based on early indications, the current plan estimates approximately 6,000 units will be built per annum, which is 40% below what we set as a benchmark.</p> <p>Yesterday I attended the launch of the Dolphin House regeneration project in Dublin South-Central.  This is absolutely welcome, as is the &euro;25 million for phase 1.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator M&aacute;ire Devine:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2468"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2468&amp;amp;pid=MaireDevine&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The community there has fought for over a decade and had to take it to Europe to get this on track.  It needs to be delivered throughout Dublin where there is a lot of social housing in poor and even dreadful condition.</p><p>I attended a briefing yesterday on Irish credit unions.  They have said they have &euro;4 billion that can be directed to social housing.  I understand, however, that Central Bank rules prevent the credit unions from investing in property related schemes.  I call on the Minister to lobby and do all in his power to relax the rules and amend the legislation to allow the release through voluntary funds of &euro;4 billion which would go a long way towards providing 20,000 to 25,000 housing units which would be welcome throughout the country for the people who are in need.  We need a commitment to establishing a dedicated court to deal with housing repossessions and an urgent amendment to the code of conduct on mortgage arrears for those struggling and threatened with repossession.</p><p>There is a dire shortage of rehabilitation services in the Irish health care system.  There are 25,000 people in Ireland every year who need rehabilitation for neurological conditions, stroke and acquired brain injury.  There has been a decade of promise-making.  I will bring this matter back to the House in September but too much time is being wasted and too many lives have been affected.  We need those rehabilitation services under the auspices of "We Need Our Heads Examined".</p></speech>

I am sure she will do an outstanding job.  I was concerned to read this morning in the paper a report on correspondence between a certain developer and the Governor of the Central Bank.  It is all detailed under a freedom of information request.  Where it raises a little concern is in regard to a deficiency in the Regulation of Lobbying Act.  Under the Act, anyone who engages with public representatives like ourselves, civil servants or local authority staff must register that.  It is going well so far.  However, there are wider public servants who are not included under the remit of the Act.  While this might be appropriate for small bodies such as the Marine Institute, it is important that correspondence from developers and others should be included under the Act where people are addressing the Governor of the Central Bank.  I ask the deputy Leader to raise this with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, under whose remit this is.  It is very concerning.  The Regulation of Lobbying Act should be amended to include the Central Bank.</p></speech>

I have been involved in it for a number of years.  The strategy should have been and was supposed to be launched in 2013.  It was launched in the run-up to the last election and it was interesting that the only Department not present at the launch was the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  It is very important.  I completely take the point the Senator made that there is no funding to go with it.  It cannot move unless there is funding and support.  It is a matter primarily for the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation who needs to come to the House and show how it going to be moved on.</p><p>Senator Joe O'Reilly referred to the action plan on housing.  We had a motion with great support last week on housing for people with disabilities.  I expressed my disappointment yesterday on what was in the action plan but I agree with Senator O'Reilly that the Minister should come here on a regular basis.  There needs to be a module in that regular discussion on housing for people with disabilities.</p><p>Senators Craughwell and James Reilly raised the issue of the titles &quot;physiotherapist&quot; and &quot;physical therapist&quot;.  Both are valid professions, but physiotherapists as we know them have a battery of integrated skills.  One cannot expect people to know the difference between one and the other.  It is vital that the title of &quot;physiotherapist&quot; be protected.</p><p>As a novice Member, my thanks, along with that of many others, are due to the support of the staff who took us, and certainly me, by the hand as if it was my first day in school, which it was in many ways.

Mr. McGarvey played football in Glasgow and for Sligo Rovers football club.  He is a renowned soccer player and if he was playing today he could assist the Irish team at centre-half.  He is 86 years young and we extend good wishes to him.</p> <p>I extend good wishes also to Ireland's Olympic athletes who will be flying out to Rio next week.  The manager and team fly out next Wednesday.  Patsy McGonagal, a Donegal man, is the Irish Olympic team manager.  We wish the squad, many of whom are in training abroad, well as they take to Rio to represent Ireland and hope they achieve some success.</p> <p>Senator Reilly referred to the health strategy committee.  It is imperative that Members of the Seanad be included on the committee.  It is a ten-year strategy to drive a plan and provide a footprint for the future of our health service.  There is a drastic need to drive efficiencies from an economic perspective.  The budget will take an additional &euro;6.5 billion in public spending between now and 2021.  It is where most of the public spending will be going because of our ageing population and it would be very wrong for the Government and D&aacute;il only to be represented on the committee.  Reflection over the summer should allow a number of Senators to serve on the committee on a cross-party basis.</p> <p>Senator Mullen raised the issue of bias in the media, in particular on social issues or issues of social policy.  There is a need to provide balance, scrutiny and objectivity on all debates and, in particular, fairness on social policy issues like the eighth amendment where we saw recently that about 20 times the coverage was given in a one week period to the pro-repeal side.  Fairness is not being provided to the other side.  There are questions to be answered about the public service broadcaster which is receiving assistance from the State.  To reflect on that, we should have a debate in the House at an early date when sitting resumes in the autumn on the issue of fairness in the media, in particular on social policy issues which are sensitive and in respect of which commentary should be balanced, especially from the national broadcaster.</p></speech>

It is a topic many people have raised before and is similar to motion No. 21(4).  It relates to Brexit and I wanted to put structure on it.  There is a huge opportunity for the Chamber to lead a wide-ranging debate on Brexit.  I propose that Seanad &Eacute;ireann holds a comprehensive debate over a number of days on the UK referendum on EU membership and its implications for the island of Ireland, North and South, and invites a range of persons including the Taoiseach and relevant Ministers, as Senator Richmond has said, MEPs from the North and the South, the First and Deputy First Ministers of Northern Ireland and any other persons we deem relevant to the debate.  I hope we get unanimous agreement to that and I ask the Cathaoirleach and Acting Leader to schedule the debate for priority when we come back in September and to set aside a number of days for it.  We speak about the relevancy of the Chamber here.  The Brexit debate is a huge issue.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Kieran O'Donnell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2207"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2207&amp;amp;pid=KieranODonnell&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It has dimensions for the entire island of Ireland.

I have to say he has levelled some very serious criticism at RTE.  It behoves RTE to take that criticism seriously and to come up with an answer to it.  If the Senator is right, and I suspect he is, RTE has a case to answer.  Senator Mullen has been involved in this issue previously and undoubtedly has a strong position on the repeal of the eighth amendment.  There are Members of this House who, like myself, do not cross bridges until we come to them.  Sooner or later, this issue is going to land into the Chamber.  I would like to see a more reasoned debate, with a better proliferation of information on both sides of it, in order to allow us to come to our own conclusions, as we undoubtedly will in due course.</p><p>I congratulate the Garda nationally and particularly in the Limerick area on its outstanding success in recent days in bringing about the incarceration of some very serious criminals arising from a drugs bust of very big proportions.  This is just another step in the long road that is the battle against organised crime in Limerick and nationally.  It is great to see the Garda, and law and order, coming out on top.  The turning of the corner in the fight against crime in one of our major cities is the greatest tribute that could be paid to the memory of the great late Jerry McCabe, who was cruelly and foully murdered by the IRA 20 years ago this year.</p><p>I commend Senator O'Donnell's motion on the Brexit issue.  I think it would be very timely if we were to tackle this in the Seanad.  It is great to see Mr. Hollande here with us today after what the people of France have gone through.  We sympathise with the British public in the dilemma it has landed itself in.  Obviously, Brexit is a huge issue for Ireland and the rest of Europe.  I agree with the Prime Minister.  We are in an especially delicate position with regard to the British.  As Bob Dylan famously said in one of his quirky love songs to his girlfriend:</p><blockquote>But if you got to go, go now,<br /><br />Or else you gotta stay all night.</blockquote></speech>

The provision of home care packages in counties Mayo, Roscommon and Galway has reached a critical point.  Not only has this year's budget for those packages been spent but in addition there has been an overspend of &euro;5 million.  I spoke last night to a woman whose husband is in Mayo General Hospital and who has been told there is a freeze on the provision of home care packages.  A man is being kept in hospital, possibly at a cost of &euro;1,000 a day, because he and his wife cannot get the help they need to bring him home.  I wonder whether this is acceptable to Pat Healy, who is the HSE national director for elderly people's services.  I do not think it is on.  It is not cost-effective to keep people in acute hospitals or step-down beds when they could be at home.  The best place for somebody in these circumstances is at home, if that is possible at all.  Families need support.  It is really a contradiction.  If this issue cannot be sorted, perhaps the Minister for Health can assist by taking it up with the HSE so that it can be sorted as a matter of urgency.  This is a widespread problem in the three counties in question.  If it is not solved, we will not be providing people with a proper health service.  Additional funds are required as a matter of urgency.  We cannot simply tell people they have to wait for a few months because the budget has been spent.  That is not how one's health works and it is not how a health care system should work.  The most cost-effective place to provide health care is at home.</p></speech>

Other member states must listen to Ireland's sensitivities regarding Northern Ireland, the free travel area and the common ties with the UK.  I agree with Senator Ned O'Sullivan that the UK has made this decision and we have to look out for ourselves now.  I suggest we should get much closer to countries like France because they will be our allies in the EU.</p> <p>I think we should highlight another issue because it is good news.  The Taoiseach's visit to the north inner city yesterday was heralded by one and all.  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, for whom I have great time, said it was "very obvious" that the Taoiseach was listening to the views of these communities.  Politics is about breaking down barriers.  I very much welcome the efforts of the Taoiseach and the various Departments to resolve the serious issues in these communities.  We should deal with such issues by going into the communities, listening and doing the work.  We do not hear this enough.  I was very heartened to hear that an independently minded Deputy was brave enough and good enough to highlight these efforts.  I welcome that.</p></speech>

It is great that Fitzgibbon Street Garda station is going to reopen.  I welcome all the other fine improvements in that area.  Many of us who are used to going to Croke Park, including Senator Ned O'Sullivan - I was going to call him "Lord Edward" - and Senator Daly, are hoping to get there again.  Fitzgibbon Street Garda station is an important landmark on the way to the stadium.  It is very well situated to deal with everything in that part of the city.</p> <p>Senator Mullen raised a very important matter regarding the national broadcaster.  Others have spoken about it too.  The national broadcaster is charged with a very serious responsibility never to show any bias or favouritism on any issue, let alone the important matter referred to by Senator Mullen.  It would be extremely appropriate for representatives of the national broadcaster to be invited to appear before the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Change and Natural Resources in early course to explain their attitude and approach.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Coghlan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1881"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1881&amp;amp;pid=PaulCoghlan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I would ask the Deputy Leader to use her good offices, through the Leader's office, to ensure they are called to account in early course on this matter.</p><p>I offer good wishes to the Cathaoirleach and the staff, in particular Deirdre Lane, Martin Groves, Ronan Curran and Niamh O'Grady.

We can do things here they cannot do in committees, or in the other House for that matter.  The proposal was made by Senator O'Donnell to set aside a number of days to bring in various people who can outline their thoughts and views in regard to Brexit.  This may require changes to Standing Orders or other initiatives to be taken.  However, it is a very good idea that a number of days would be set aside so people from various quarters could come in to be the questioned and that the rules of the House would provide that they would outline their views.  This could be of great benefit in allowing us to see where we are going or what might happen in the coming years.  There is no doubt the UK will not be out of the EU for quite a number of years and we have seen recently that the trade deal between Canada and the EU took seven years to put together.  Brexit has a long way to go, in my view, and what has been proposed by Senator O'Donnell could be very beneficial.</p></speech>

I did not realise quite how many issues are actually raised when raising them myself, given some individuals have actually raised four or five issues each.  I will do by best.  Members will bear with me and if I omit to refer to any issue, I will be happy to come back to it.</p> <p>Senator Ardagh referred to the inflated CSO figures.  To the best of my knowledge, the Minister has clarified the position this morning.  It is an issue that could usefully be addressed in this House on pre-budget statements.  I hope we will be able to facilitate clarification of that matter in the House in September.</p> <p>I agree with the Senator's point on public procurement.  We need to encourage small businesses, which are the backbone of our economy, because many jobs are obviously dependent on them.  It is an issue that has been raised previously in the House, including by Senator Kieran O'Donnell.  I believe a debate with a special emphasis on small business might be worthwhile.  I will certainly convey Senator Ardagh's concerns to the Minister.</p> <p>Senator Mullen referred to media fairness, in particular in regard to RTE and the pro-life and abortion issue.  Other Senators also referred to this and I will deal with their comments when I come to their contributions.  There is a media ombudsman and anyone who feels that RTE has been biased in any broadcast can make a complaint, which perhaps has already been made, to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  I agree with Senator Mullen and other speakers that a debate on the issue would be worthwhile.  Certainly, the suggestion of Senator Paul Coghlan that they be brought before the communications committee is a good one and could be constructive.  It is an issue I will follow up.</p> <p>Senator Conway-Walsh raised the issue she raised yesterday.  I understand the Leader has been in communication with her on that and, hopefully, matters will progress.  She also raised the issue of the economic forecast.  I would have a similar answer for her as I did for Senator Ardagh, in that the Department and the Minister will be more than happy to clarify their position on that issue.  Hopefully, we will be able to have a debate in early course in September on that and other budgetary issues.  The Senator raised a particular issue on farming and referred to the Department of the Taoiseach.  I am sure the Department will be quite happy to clarify the position in regard to the anomalies or, at least, the inconsistencies that exist.</p> <p>Senator Higgins raised several issues in regard to the Canada-EU trade agreement.  I believe a debate would be worthwhile and I would be happy to convey that to the Leader.  I hope a debate can be arranged in the new term.</p> <p>We could spend an hour or two hours right now discussing the situation in Turkey, which is very serious and evolving.  The issue raised by Senator Higgins includes 21,000 teachers having their licences revoked and the demands that universities are making.  The issues are so wide-ranging that it is a matter that will be discussed at length at the foreign affairs committee but it is something we could debate in this House also.  It is an issue that will continue to arise in the context of the relationship of the EU with Turkey, which had come so far but which is regressing hugely.  I believe it is a matter of huge regret to all of Europe.  We could have done with Turkey coming more towards our way of thinking but it is moving further away.  I agree with Senator Higgins on this matter.</p> <p>Senator Nash and others raised the issue of the DIT, which I will bring to the attention of the Minister.  Senator Craughwell in particular asked that I would write to the people involved and I would be happy to do so.  Senator Nash also raised the issue of section 38 bodies.  It is an issue we are discussing and it is being covered in the media every single day of the week.  It clearly is not satisfactory.  I am confident the Committee of Public Accounts will cover this issue well and there have been a good number of debates there to date.  There are all sorts of anomalies.  I would be happy for the Minister for Health to come to the House as there are always matters to discuss with him but this is something that would be worth focusing on in early course.</p> <p>Senator Conway raised the question of history and the GAA.  I was going to make the same comment as the Cathaoirleach, namely, I think it is already on the curriculum in Kilkenny.  Perhaps that is where we are going wrong in Mayo.  Perhaps we should have Gaelic football on the curriculum and that might bring us the trophy we have been so long looking for in Mayo.  The GAA is always worthy of attention.  The Senator asked that I bring this to the Minister's attention and I would be happy to do so.  I believe it is hard for the GAA not to be in the Minister's focus on a regular basis as it promotes itself very well and we are all acutely aware of the benefits it brings to society at large.</p> <p>I would be happy to agree to Senator Mark Daly's request with regard to Irish Sign Language.  I cannot imagine how it could be in any way controversial.  In the vein of the new politics, if there is a method in legislation whereby we can make it easier for people who could benefit from interacting with the State, that can only be a positive thing.  In regard to Senator Daly's comments on legislation, I agree with him and do not see any point in having statements in the House, day in, day out.  The Leader has been working very hard to get legislation before the House.  If there is anything the Leader's office can do to introduce the legislation to which the Senator referred, that will happen in early course in the new term.</p> <p>As I said, Senator Craughwell raised the very serious issue of the DIT.  I take on board his comments and I have said I am happy to contact those responsible and bring this to the attention of the Minister for Education and Skills.  I agree with the Senator's point on the registration of physical therapists and physiotherapists.  Until I heard Senator Craughwell speak about it this morning, my understanding was that the then Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, was very happy to clarify this and to recognise the title.  I will certainly bring this to the attention of the Minister as my understanding was that this was happening.  The Senator said there was some row-back but I am not aware of what that is.  I am interested in this issue myself.</p> <p>Senator Joe O'Reilly raised the issue of the housing crisis and the comprehensive housing strategy that was announced.  I agree, and believe most of us would agree, with his proposal that we touch base on this issue on a two-monthly basis, or whatever other period we deem appropriate, to review the situation and see what progress is being made.  As with the Brexit issue, which I will come to shortly, this House could play a very useful role in this crisis, which, to be fair to the Government, is the top priority, as we have demonstrated to date.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Catherine Noone:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2354"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2354&amp;amp;pid=CatherineNoone&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Senator Gavan quite rightly raised the TASC report and highlighted the deep inequality and divide, which is getting worse.  Of great interest to me is the gender pay gap and general difficulties in that area.  A debate on that issue would be very useful.  The main thing I would say is that a job is the best chance of getting out of inequality.  Creating jobs has been a major focus of this Government.  While I appreciate the Senator raising the issues and the statistics that are very stark, some progress is being made.  A debate could certainly be facilitated in due course.</p><p>Senator Black spoke about the employment of people with disabilities.  I am happy to pass on her concerns to the Minister.  Regarding the funding needs that are in the budget, no doubt we will have pre-budget discussions with the Minister in this House.  That is one of many issues that could be raised.  It is worth mentioning that this Government was the first Government to have a Minister of State for disability issues sitting at the Cabinet table.  That is very much to be welcomed.</p><p>Senator James Reilly raised the issue of physiotherapists and student accommodation, which a few other Senators mentioned.  It is a major challenge in the context of the overall housing problem we have.  My understanding is that there is a specific group under the housing strategy to deal with this issue and to come back with a strategy on it.  In the context of Senator Reilly's suggestion, this is something we can come back to again.  He also mentioned the committee on the future of health care.  It is an insult to this House that Senators are not included on that committee.  He highlighted the expertise present in this House.  It is great.  The argument from the Chair of the committee is that there are already enough members on it.  In my view, the more people on those committees and the more rounded their experience, the better.  It was intended to be an Oireachtas committee, so I cannot understand why that has not already been agreed.  There is some resistance, which I find frustrating.</p><p>Senator Norris mentioned the Taoiseach's visit to the inner city and the reopening of Fitzgibbon Street Garda station.  I commend him for his work on that.  He also mentioned a local charity shop in Carlow.  I agree with him.  Local authorities need to be more nuanced and think outside the box when it comes to leaving units empty rather than having enterprises such as the one Senator Norris mentioned actively contributing to the community and to business in a small way.  It is better than having units empty.  There should be some exception made for this type of organisation.</p><p>Senator Gallagher also commented on accommodation for students.  It is very positive that we have such high participation, but it presents major problems, especially in the context of the overall housing problem we have.  It is especially in focus at this time of year because over the coming months students will in many cases be very worried about getting some sort of accommodation that they will be able to afford.  I also join him in wishing the councillor in Donegal a happy birthday.  I hope I am not in politics at the age of 86, but it is a case of horses for courses and I wish him very well.  Hopefully he still plays a bit of football.</p><p>Senator Butler raised the issue of petrol-stretching.  From what I understand, the criminals involved in this are moving a little ahead of the lawmakers all the time.  They are probably the same people who are involved in green diesel.  The Minister for Finance did come up with some measures to combat the green diesel issue and there is now a new issue in this context to be dealt with.  I will bring it to the Minister's attention.  It is a major issue of concern to the public.  I would like to join in his request for the public to be vigilant when it comes to the price of diesel.</p><p>Senator Devine spoke about Dolphin House.  It is an exemplary development and, as she said, it needs to be introduced in many other areas.  She mentioned the issue of credit unions and the Central Bank, which I will bring to the attention of the Minister for Finance.  The Senator also discussed rehabilitation services and people with neurological conditions, which is also a very serious issue.</p><p>Senator Richmond raised the matter of lobbying, particularly when it comes to developers and correspondence with developers.  It is definitely worth getting an official comment from the Minister for Finance on this issue the next time he is in the House.  In the meantime, I will make sure we communicate with him.</p><p>Senator Dolan also raised the issue of a strategy for people with disabilities.  I have covered a response to that.  He also raised the housing issue and agreed with Senator Joe O'Reilly on that.  In addition, he mentioned the physiotherapist-physical therapist issue, which I have already addressed.</p><p>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill also wished the famous Mr. McGarvey a happy birthday, which, again, I reiterate.  He is obviously a very popular man in Donegal.  He also wished the Olympic team well.  It is a very important time for athletes and their families and we all wish our Olympians well.  The Senator also mentioned the ten year strategy and bias in the media, which I hope I have covered.</p><p>Senator O'Donnell's amendment has been broadly welcomed by the House.  This represents a significant opportunity for the House and for the Oireachtas as a whole to cover these issues.  The suggestion of having key individuals come to the House is a very good one.  It could be very constructive and, depending on how it works out logistically, we could put together a report on the outcomes and the comments made during that exercise.</p><p>Senator O'Sullivan raised the issue of RTE and the debate on fairness, which I would be happy to arrange, or to ask the Leader to arrange, in the new session.  He congratulated the garda&iacute; in Limerick.  They have made major progress there and it is good to highlight that.  He also commented on Brexit, which I have covered.</p><p>Senator Mulherin raised the matter of provision of home care packages in Mayo, Roscommon and Galway.  The situation she describes is very illogical, on the face of it and is very frustrating for people who want to be at home.  It is nonsensical that it is costing us more when there is a willingness to have them at home and overall it could cost less to do so.  I will bring the issue to the attention of the Minister for Health.  This type of money-wasting is frustrating when money is so difficult to find in the health budget.</p><p>Senator Feighan also raised the issue of Brexit.  I join the House in welcoming President Hollande to Ireland.  France is going through a very tough time at the moment and our thoughts and prayers are with those who have been very seriously affected by recent horrible developments.  Senator Feighan also raised the very positive visit of the Taoiseach to the north inner city and the fact it breaks down barriers, which is well worth mentioning.</p><p>Senator Coghlan also mentioned that visit and the role of the national broadcaster, which I have covered.  As I said, that would be a worthwhile debate.</p><p>Senator Paddy Burke raised the Brexit issue and concurred with Senator O'Donnell.  We are all in agreement that a few days of debates in this House in the new session, whether consecutively or over a number of weeks, would make sense and could be very constructive.</p><p>I wish all my colleagues well for the break and hope they get some downtime and some time with their families.  I thank the staff and concur with those who said the staff are always extremely cordial, friendly and helpful and have always been in my time in the House.  As Senator Dolan said, we have all been in the situation where everything is completely new, and it is great to have their support.  I wish everybody well.</p></speech>

On the Thursday we basically have to adjourn for an hour and a half because the Ministers are all tied up as that is when they vote.  There is block voting going on.  It is not very satisfactory for us because, whether it is the scheduling of committees, which I have been involved in for many years in this House, or this issue, there seems to be scant regard by the other House for our work here.  That is unfair and not tenable.  We should remember and the other House should remember the acid test when two years ago we had to stand in a referendum and the people decided to keep this Chamber.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">An Cathaoirleach:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1988"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1988&amp;amp;pid=DenisODonovan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I think we should be shown a little more respect.

On the question "That the Bill be received for final consideration", the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.  This is looked upon as the report of the D&aacute;il amendments to the Seanad.  For the convenience of Senators, I have arranged for the printing of, and the circulation of, these amendments to them.   The Minister will deal separately with the subject matter of such related groups of amendments.  I have also circulated the proposed groupings to the House.  A Senator may contribute once on each grouping.  I remind Senators the only matters that maybe discussed are the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

This was a Seanad Bill in which the Minister was not initially involved.  I respect the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.  To be totally realistic, the D&aacute;il will go into recess and will not return until the end of September.  As a realist, I recommend to the House that the amendments be dealt with without great debate because, quite frankly, they have been debated in great detail.  It is very important that the officials get on with enacting the Bill during the summer recess.  I have no objection to any of the amendments.  I support them and I ask the House to support the Bill because if any change is made here, it will take until the end of September or early October to return to the House, and this is just not acceptable in the present climate when we need action on all fronts.  The Bill should be passed and approved by the House.</p></speech>
