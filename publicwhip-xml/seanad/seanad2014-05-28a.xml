    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-05-28a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1139" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014052800003#B00400"><p>A few short weeks ago the Taoiseach came to this House to bring forward legislation on an inquiry, led by Mr. Justice Nial Fennelly, into Garda whistleblowers, the alleged bugging of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and the resignation, retirement or forced resignation of former Garda Commissioner, Mr. Martin Callinan.  During that debate I suggested to the Taoiseach that he could simply have outlined to the House what he asked Mr. Brian Purcell, Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, to say to the former Garda Commissioner.  He knows what happened and he could have put the matter on the public record in this House.  He refused to do so, and he refused again earlier this week on our national broadcaster.  We are now left in a situation whereby the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality will meet this afternoon to discuss the Guerin report and the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality will appear before that committee to answer questions on the report.  We are led to understand that Mr. Purcell will not be answering any questions relating to the conversation he had with the Taoiseach in advance of his visit to the former Garda Commissioner to ask him to resign, if that is what happened.  In effect, the waters have been completely muddied.</p><p>I put it to the Leader that Mr. Purcell is being put in an invidious position by this Government because he is being asked to go into a committee where every member, which I assume includes members on the Government side, will be asking him what occurred during his conversation with the Taoiseach in advance of his meeting with the former Commissioner.  He will not be in a position to answer those questions.  His position will probably then be untenable and he may have to tender his resignation at that stage, all because the Taoiseach will not tell us what he asked Mr. Purcell to say to the former Garda Commissioner.</p><p>This is an incredible situation.  When the Taoiseach was in this House he promised us he would ensure we got to the bottom of the matter and that we would find out all the facts.  In respect of the Fennelly report, the Taoiseach could have told the Seanad what he said but he has refused to do so.  If what I suggest transpires, it will further undermine the authority of the Department of Justice and Equality, or certainly its Secretary General, and will have ramifications across the Department and those who administer justice in this country.  This situation is being created by the Taoiseach and the Government.  I put on record my absolute displeasure at this and my hope it is not the case.  Has the Taoiseach, the Department of the Taoiseach or the new Minister for Justice and Equality instructed Mr. Purcell not to answer questions relating to the resignation of the former Garda Commissioner?  Has he been told not to answer those questions later today?  If the Leader has the answers to my questions, I ask him to tell us and, if he does not, to inquire into the matter.</p><p>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to assist those on the Government side.  The Leader has been trying for the past 14 months to get the Minister for Health to come to the House to answer questions on medical cards and the removal of discretionary medical cards.  I welcome the Leader's comments in regard to his displeasure at what is happening.  The Minister is blatantly refusing to come into this House and the only way we can get him to do so is by passing an amendment to the Order of Business on the matter.  I am therefore proposing an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister, Deputy Reilly, would come to the House to discuss exactly what is happening and what form the review of the removal of discretionary medical cards is going to take.</p></speech>

That is absolutely proper and appropriate for an Oireachtas committee.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-05-28a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1148" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014052800003#B00700"><p>Unfortunately, I cannot predict how the answers will go.  Clearly it is within the right of any witness not to answer questions.  We have seen it happen previously in Oireachtas committees that witness did not answer questions or did not answer them adequately.  One cannot predict what answers will be given, but certainly the committee has expressly reserved that right.</p><p>I support the calls made yesterday by Senators Zappone, Hayden and others for a debate on homelessness.  I am conscious that we will have a debate this afternoon with the Minister for Social Protection on the issue of rent supplement and the youth guarantee.</p> <p>That is very welcome.  The issues to do with rent supplement feed directly into policies on homelessness.  I know the Leader has made every attempt to ensure we will have a debate on homelessness with the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.  I will do anything I can to assist in ensuring that debate will be held because it is a very important issue.</p><p>I ask for a debate on the issue of the implementation of the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act which provides for a 30% quota or target of candidates of each gender for all political parties in the next general election.  I ask this in the context of a very changed gender breakdown of councillors following the local elections.  Yesterday I spoke about the defeats suffered by the Labour Party but many Labour councillors and candidates were returned.  In particular, women candidates and councillors appeared to fare better than men.  The overall picture for the gender breakdown of councillors across all the local authorities shows a significantly improved situation for women.  A total of 21% of councillors are women compared to only 16% after the 2009 election.  There has been a significant increase in the number of women councillors.  It has been estimated by Women for Election that this represents a 33% increase in the number of women councillors, given the reduction in the number of seats.</p><p>The by-election results show that we have the highest representation ever of women in the D&aacute;il, with 27 women, 16.3%.  This is very welcome.  I ask the Leader for a debate on what this means for the implementation of the political funding legislation which was initiated in this House and which was passed with general support and which it is hoped will result in a great increase in the numbers of women candidates in the next general election.  What we have learned from the local authority elections is that where there is an increase in women candidates this follows through to an increase in women who are elected.  People will vote for women and every political party has an obligation to ensure it has a significant proportion of women candidates at the next election.</p></speech>

I have been asking for more than 12 months for a debate on the fishing sector.  The summer is coming and the weather is calm.  During the storms of the winter many fishermen were without an income for prolonged periods and were unable to get fish assist payment.  They were living on crumbs.  I ask for a debate on the fishing industry and on the situation of the inshore fishermen.  I ask that the debate be held as soon as is practicable.</p><p>We should have a debate on job creation in rural Ireland.  The Government, with some merit, crows loudly when jobs are created in places like Dublin, Galway or Cork city, but in huge areas in the Leader's county of Waterford, in west Cork, parts of Kerry and the west, no sustainable jobs have been created in the past four or five years.  That issue is worthy of debate.  It is a significant loss that there is no senior Minister dedicated to rural affairs.  The jobs situation in many parts of rural Ireland is acute and the only answer in those areas is widespread emigration, which is a sad substitute for jobs.  I hope for a positive answer from the Leader with regard to a full debate on those issues.</p></speech>

The review of medical cards is unnecessary and I have made my view clear on this matter.  Such a review gives a very false and misleading impression.  As recently as yesterday evening at the Joint Committee on Health, representatives from one organisation alleged that the number of medical cards was reduced by 10%.  Such a reduction in the number of medical cards would see 190,000 cards withdrawn.  That is not the position.  In fact, the number of medical cards has increased by 12.5% since 2011.  However, the review of medical cards is causing unnecessary alarm.  My argument is that if four out of 100 medical cards are withdrawn because of the change in the criteria, the unfortunate problem created is that the 96 people who retain their cards are convinced that someone tried to take their cards from them.  I do not believe the current review is doing anything for anyone and it is not doing anything for the provision of health services.</p><p>If I may say to the leader of the Opposition I was surprised to find that when we visited the PCRS in Finglas last week, there was no representative from Fianna F&aacute;il. </p></speech>

While I appreciate that the Minister, Deputy Reilly, is coming to the House today to deal with another issue, we want to discuss this issue with him.  We commend the Minister because unlike some of his colleagues he always makes himself available for debates in this House.  That is not an issue but we want him to come to the House to deal specifically with the review of medical cards.</p><p>The PCRS is not doing its job correctly.  Its ability to impress with regard, for example, to the five or six members of the joint committee who visited its premises to survey its work and who were shown around to prove how well the system works is a back-slapping exercise and it does not interest us.</p></speech>

The good reason I was not there is that we passed an all-party motion in this House that the Order of Business takes precedence over any committee work.  That is the rule I followed.  I ask the Leader to remind his junior colleague that the Order of Business takes precedence and on that day we were raising very important issues, one of which will be dealt with by a Private Members' motion on maternity services after the Order of Business this morning.</p><p>If Senator Burke inquired from any of his defeated colleagues in Sligo, Leitrim, south Donegal or Roscommon, they could tell him that the medical card issue was the single most important issue on the doorsteps in those constituencies.  That is why I and some of my colleagues did not engage in a futile back-slapping exercise.  The people I listen to in the context of the review of medical cards are the elderly, the sick, the handicapped people and those who are terminally ill, who have informed me, first-hand, of the failure of the system, so I have no interest in wasting resources and taking these people from their work to facilitate a media exercise to try to make a failing Minister and Department of Health look better.  I look forward to that debate and I hope it can be held as early as possible.  The Minister is coming to the House today but we need a debate on this issue which, along with maternity services in the north west, is probably the reason Fine Gael and the Labour Party collectively lost 160 seats nationally.</p></speech>

Senator Colm Burke has proposed on several occasions that this House have a dedicated role in the scrutiny of EU legislation and directives which affect people&rsquo;s lives.</p><p>Deputy Luke &quot;Ming&quot; Flanagan was elected as a new Member of the European Parliament as a result of that agenda.  I do not blame people for being upset when we have not acted to ensure adequate scrutiny of directives and legislation before it affects their lives.</p><p>The second lesson we need to learn and to discuss here, is that it is time to move from being pro-economy to pro-people.  The narrative needs to change.  A former colleague of mine, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Donohoe, spoke all about the economy on &quot;Prime Time&quot; two nights ago.  The people have taken it in the neck for the economy for the past six years.  The economy must serve the people.  It is a very important distinction.  We all mean well but we must tweak it in the right direction.  The Labour Party is paying the price this week.  Fine Gael is too although it is muted.</p><p>We all want stable government.  The Taoiseach needs to come into this Chamber to discuss and hear about the lessons learned from the local and European elections.  I ask everybody in this House to grow up and forget about taking sides.  I want stable government for this country, even though I may be physically on this side of the House.  Let us be there for all of the people.  We all have to learn.</p></speech>

I congratulate everybody who stood for election, particularly those who were elected.  It was a busy period and it was not easy for anybody but it was important.  Some people fared better than others but many Members of this House took part and I congratulate them all on doing so well.<br />Health services and medical cards were a massive issue during the election campaign.  It was one of the major issues brought up on the doorsteps when we were canvassing.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, accepted late in the day that there was a major issue around discretionary medical cards.  I support the call for an immediate debate on the restoration of the discretionary medical cards.  It is vital that they be restored immediately.  My party colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, is preparing a Bill to make that change.  It is the right thing to do.  I remind the Government Members present today that they voted for cuts to the health budget which are part of the reason for these cuts in the medical card provision.<br />I am also concerned by a call this morning from the Irish College of General Practitioners about universal health cover.  According to an article by Paul Cullen in <i>The Irish Times</i>today it has criticised the Government&rsquo;s plan for universal health insurance:<blockquote>. . . saying it will reduce patient choice and &quot;do more harm than good&quot;.  The Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP) says the plan will result in fragmentation in the health service and greater inequality affecting poor and rural patients.</blockquote>Rural Ireland cannot take any more cutbacks.  There are serious problems in providing dental, medical, nursing and other health-related services.  There is no social worker dealing with the rural part of County Galway for those aged between 18 and 65.  Rural health services have been stretched.  We need a full debate on this Government&rsquo;s universal health cover plans.  It does not look as if it will be possible to implement them.  The ICGP has serious concerns about it.  The health service is in chaos.  I am not confident that the Minister has a grasp of the issues.  We need to debate them as a matter of urgency.  As an immediate step discretionary medical cards need to be restored and another approach taken.</p></speech>

It caters for clients with mental health issues who are collected every day and brought to the centre, which is nice and homely.  It is suggested that the service be located at a primary care centre, which does not have the facilities for the people who need the service.</p><p>I congratulate all those who ran for election to the European Parliament.  I will be very sorry if circumstances do not turn out well for Pat &ldquo;the Cope&rdquo; Gallagher.  Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan has delivered a great reward for Roscommon in being elected.

I congratulate those who were elected and commiserate with those who were not.  Some very fine people have lost local and European seats.</p><p>I pay tribute to one person, a cousin of mine who died suddenly on Friday, Councillor Owen Bannigan of Lough Egish in County Monaghan.  He served the people very well.  He was an outstanding member of his community, party and family.  He died doing what he loved best, serving the people on the canvass on Friday.  I also pay a personal tribute to his family as well.</p><p>I have raised the issue of discretionary medical cards countless times.  It is one of the main issues on which the people have spoken.  I note the Minister of Health&rsquo;s comments of yesterday that he would sort them out for people with motor neurone disease and Down's syndrome. </p> <p>I would also like a debate on the issue, as certain conditions cannot be categorised.  I have stated from the day I entered this Chamber that all people with a disability should be entitled to a medical card, regardless of income.  It should be an automatic entitlement.  People come to me every day who may be slightly over the threshold but they may have children and if the assessors saw what parents are coping with on a daily basis, there would be a change.  This is our opportunity to examine the issue of discretionary medical cards, and I join the call for a debate on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-05-28a.48" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1145" speakername="Feargal Quinn" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014052800006#E00200"><p>Figures last month indicated that consumer sentiment is higher than it has been for seven years, and there is a great confidence that what is happening in the economy will lead to success.  I am very worried nonetheless about what I have heard on radio, particularly yesterday and at other times, about us having to change direction now.  That is mainly coming from the Labour Party, and I can understand that.  If at this stage we change direction too suddenly in order to make ourselves more citizen-friendly, there is a serious danger that we could throw away all the good work of recent times.  I urge that in the next two years we take care to ensure we do not throw away all the good work that has been done.</p><p>For example, this House has taken an interest through legislation in upward-only rent reviews.  The Government could look at this in a customer-friendly manner that would also help citizens while helping to get our shops open again.  The issue of upward-only rents was mentioned by the two parties in Government and it was included in their programme for Government but they seem to have changed their mind.  We have put the legislation through the Seanad but can we ensure it gets through the D&aacute;il?  If the President decides there is a question over whether it should become law, he can send it to the Supreme Court for a decision.  At that stage we would know if the legislation would be inside the limits of the Constitution.  Tackling the issue will get shops open, and 12 business associations - which to my knowledge had never come together before - are urging the Government to do something about this issue.  We have demonstrated what can be done in this House so we should encourage the Government to take it to the next stage and make it law.</p><p>When I came in this morning I noted significant amounts of graffiti in different places around Dublin.  We are not nearly as bad as other countries but if we are to encourage tourists to come to the country because it looks so well, we should see what can be done to avoid this graffiti.  A while back a local garda saw two young fellows putting graffiti on a wall; a neighbour took the two 14-year-olds by the scruff of the neck home to their parents.  One parent said that boys would be boys but the other parents got their boy to clean the graffiti with a toothbrush, and it took him a week to clean what he had put on the wall.  There are steps we can take to help encourage tourism in the country, and we should make graffiti unacceptable.</p></speech>

Going around to the doors for the elections, many people told me that in the small and medium enterprise sector, as well as retail, there was a bit of a pick-up, although it was nothing extraordinary.  This was in the last quarter of last year and following through to this year.</p><p>Yesterday I launched an e-learning network in Dundalk Institute of Technology for further education colleges in the north east region.  The message from career guidance personnel in those colleges and the institute in Dundalk was that they were finding it easier to place students in employment.  It is necessary to follow our course and stability is very important.  People who have worked hard and have been put to the pin of their collar - these people may be in their 40s and have family members in third level education - need a bit of a break from paying the universal social charge or similar measures.</p><p>I acknowledge the great achievement of Sinn F&eacute;in in different areas.  Louth has not been rolled over by a Sinn F&eacute;in tsunami; we had eight Fine Gael councillors and we now have seven, with the councillor who lost being replaced by a fellow from the Fine Gael family.  We are still there.</p></speech>

I congratulate all those who were successful and commiserate with the many who were not.  Very many fine councillors have been lost throughout the country, mainly from the Government parties of Fine Gael and Labour.  It is time for their colleagues in this House to stand up and be listened to at parliamentary party meetings.  I have no doubt that issues like the discretionary medical cards and household, water and septic tank charges have not come as news to the councillors who lost their seats or colleagues in this House or the Lower House.  I have no doubt people stood up at parliamentary party meetings and explained the reality on the ground.  I have experience as a Fianna Fail Senator of being part of a parliamentary party which brought issues on the ground to the party hierarchy but I was not listened to.  In that case 160 decent people lost their council seats over two elections.  Those opposite should take a little advice.  They should stand up and be heard at parliamentary party meetings or the same fate may face some of them in the next general or Seanad election.</p><p>I pay tribute to the late councillor, Mr. Owen Bannigan from County Monaghan, who died suddenly on the day of the election.  He was a very fine representative for the people of his electoral area and he was very vocal about many social issues throughout the length and breadth of the country.  I join with Senator Moran in paying tribute to him.</p></speech>

I commiserate with those who lost seats and particularly those who in participating put their life blood into local and national politics.  It is a difficult day for those people.  I congratulate my colleague, Senator Clune, for her achievement as it is not easy to get elected to the European Parliament.</p><p>The drug Fampyra was mentioned by Senator O'Brien yesterday and this is a serious issue for sufferers of multiple sclerosis.</p> <p>It is a really serious issue for sufferers of multiple sclerosis, MS.  A friend has unfortunately contracted the disease and it appears to me that the only reason he is still mobile is because of the drug.  It is the human side of Government that sometimes gets lost when one enters politics.  One is in difficulty when one loses humanity.  The provision of the drug is something that must be funded.  We cannot allow people to lose their independence because of the cost of the drug.  The drug that my friend has been using for some time on a trial basis is a new one but it is coming onto the market as the trial has been concluded.  In this Chamber we are good at some things; we are quite good at some of the small, human stories.  This Chamber should be able to raise a flag for people who suffer from MS and do something about it.  I call on the Leader in a constructive manner and not in any confrontational way, in the same way as the issue was raised yesterday, to ask the Minister for Health to come to the Chamber.  The issue is very specific to a small number of people who suffer from MS.  If the Leader were to ask the Minister to come to the House, he would have the full support of every Member to do something about the situation.</p></speech>

This is a very serious issue.  I heard a detailed discussion on the drug in question on the radio recently and I heard stories of patients who had benefited significantly from it.  We must tease out the issue with the Minister.</p><p>I join colleagues in congratulating everybody who was successful in the recent local and European elections.  It is a particularly proud moment for us that one of our colleagues, Senator Deirdre Clune, is now a Member of the European Parliament.  We wish her well and every success in her career at European Parliament level.</p><p>I ask the Leader to arrange a discussion on serious and violent crime at the earliest opportunity with the Minister for Justice and Equality when she settles into her new role.  I say that in light of the discovery of two badly decomposed bodies on a remote island in County Meath yesterday.  Our hearts go out to the families of those two young people whose lives were so violently taken.  The situation shows the depths to which the criminal underworld in this country will go to deal with people who have crossed them in one way or another.  It is important that the new Minister would hear the views of the Members of this House on how badly we need to tackle this very serious cancer in society.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-05-28a.67" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1130" speakername="Maurice Cummins" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014052800007#F01100"><p>Let us wait and see what the man has to say.<br />A number of Members raised medical cards, which is a matter that was raised yesterday.  We will ask the Minister for Health to come to the House to speak on that specific matter.  He will be in the House for two hours today to discuss another matter on which he was requested to attend.  It is important to note that 96.4% of the reviews on medical cards that have been carried out confirm continuing eligibility but that is no consolation to the people who have been put in the position of having to provide documentation on more than one occasion in some instances.  The matter will have to be addressed.  The Minister has said he will deal with it.  I will ask him to come to the House to speak to us on discretionary medical cards.  The Taoiseach has said the Government will examine the issue and deal with it as a matter of urgency.<br />Senator Bacik called for a debate on homelessness.  On numerous occasions I have asked the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, to come to the House and I will continue to ask her to have such a debate.  We will have a debate today on rent supplement, which was sought by a number of Members.  The debate will be with the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton.  The Senator also commented on the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act and the implication for women in politics.  It is good to see that we now have more than 21% of women elected to local authorities.  That is a significant improvement on the previous local election results.<br />Senator O'Donovan raised the fisheries (amendment) Bill.  I understand that the heads of the Bill have not yet been cleared by the Cabinet.  Fianna F&aacute;il tabled a Private Members' motion last November on fisheries and maritime jurisdictions but I will ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, to come to the House for a further debate on fisheries.  The Senator also inquired about job creation in the regions.  I will ask the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, to come to the House for a debate on the issue.<br />Senator Healy Eames raised EU legislation and EU scrutiny.  It is part of the Government's proposals being considered by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, CPP, for the House, which I am sure will be accepted.  An improved economy means improved benefits for people also.  That is what the economy is about.<br />Senator Leyden spoke about Roscommon hospital.  He should ask the consultants there whether the hospital has improved in recent years.  The consultants have said the hospital is a lot better off now than during the period to which Senator Leyden referred.<br />Senators Moran and Wilson referred to the death of former councillor, Owen Bannigan.  I echo their sentiments and express our sympathy to the Bannigan family on the death of Owen in his early 50s.  He was an outstanding councillor.  I knew him well.  <font color="#222222">Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam</font><font color="#222222"> d&iacute;lis.</font><br /><font color="#222222">  Senator Quinn warned that we should not throw away the gains made in the economy and that we should not change tack at this stage.  I will find out the exact position on upward-only rents and whether legislation in that regard will be tested by the Attorney General.  We will have to wait and see what the Government decides but I will inquire on the status of the Bill.  I agree with what the Senator said about graffiti.  It is not something tourists like to see and it should be tackled as a matter of urgency.  I am sure local authorities are doing that but they need the help of parents in particular where children are concerned.  I note the point he made in that regard.</font><br /><font color="#222222">  Senator Jim D'Arcy emphasised the importance of economic stability but also the need for people to benefit from the recovery.</font></p> <p>Senator Wilson spoke from experience regarding seat losses and what should and should not be done.</p><p>Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy raised the issue of the provision of the multiple sclerosis drug, fampyra, which was also raised yesterday by Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien.  As I said yesterday, this matter should be addressed by the Minister in a compassionate way.  If people&rsquo;s conditions are improving because of a drug, then funding for it should be made available.</p><p>Senator Mullins called for the Minister for Justice and Equality to attend the House for a debate on crime.  I will request she attends.  She was here yesterday for the DNA database Bill which will be of assistance to the Garda in fighting crime.  It is one of several provisions the Minister will be bringing before the House in this term.</p></speech>

While we understand the objective of the amendment and appreciate the importance of it and the role it could play, we will not accept it.  A debate on the amendment took place in the D&aacute;il between Deputy Pearse Doherty and the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, and I would like to emphasise a number of points in regard to that discussion.</p><p>I will look first at the objective of the legislation and of the amendment the Senator put forward.  The Government is committed to addressing this issue by bringing forward separate legislation which will focus on the issue of the sale of loan books to unregulated third parties.   That legislation will ensure that the protections in the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA, will continue to apply to mortgages sold to unregulated financial services providers.  Since this is such an important issue and, as the Senator is aware, a complicated one which will affect many people, the Government believes the best way to address this is through separate legislation, looking at the issue in its entirely and bringing forward a robust response to it.  That legislation is being actively progressed and it will be brought before the Oireachtas as soon as possible.  </p><p>The current listing of that legislation is down as 2015 but given the seriousness of this matter, which I know is the reason the Senator raised it, the Minister for Finance indicated that he will look to bring this Bill forward in the legislative programme to address this issue.  It is his intention that it will be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas in the next session.  While I appreciate and understand the objective of this amendment and given the importance of this issue and the number of people for whom it will have consequences, the Government believes it would be best handled through separate legislation.</p></speech>

As he is aware, following last week's elections, particularly in counties Leitrim, Sligo, South Donegal and others, this is a serious issue that exercises many people and there is much concern about it.  The Minister and I have had the benefit of debating this as a matter on the Adjournment when I questioned his word on the issue on the basis that he had broken his word on other issues.  I now have the report whereas at the time of the previous debate I had only rumours of what it would contain.  When the Health Service Executive was first asked about it, Setanta Communications Limited, which it employs, denied the existence of a report but quickly acknowledged that it did exist and said that it came to no decisions.  It is marked &quot;strictly confidential&quot; and the title is High Level Review of Maternity Services in the West Northwest Hospital Group.  The Health Partnership is the consultancy firm that undertook the study.</p> <p>It is dated February 2014.  It exists and there are a number of options set out in it.  Four of them include the closure or downgrading of Portiuncula Hospital, and others include the downgrade or closure of Sligo Regional Hospital and Mayo General Hospital at Castlebar.  It seems to question the Higgins report from last year on the hospital groups, which stated that Letterkenny hospital, as a result of its geographic location and similar to Kerry and Wexford general hospitals, should retain its full range of emergency department, surgical, maternity and paediatric services.</p><p>The Government in its amendment argues that this report has no status.  What did the report cost and is the HSE in the business of spending people's money on reports which have no status?  When I first raised this matter I wanted to know the terms of reference given to the Health Partnership but nobody is prepared to tell me what are those terms.  We also want to know what other reports exist.  Do all the hospital groupings have similar reports that are seeking to downgrade or shut maternity services?  What is the position?</p><p>I was accused of scaremongering and being highly political about this before.</p></speech>

That is correct, although people are not upset that a report labelled as private and confidential was exposed by me.  They are concerned that in secret the Government is considering plans to downgrade maternity services.  They have expressed anger in this regard at the ballot box last week in some of these counties.</p><p>Are the reports for all these hospital group areas seeking to downgrade the services?  We are specifically calling for the retention of obstetrician-led services at centres in Letterkenny, Sligo Regional Hospital, Castlebar and Portiuncula, as it is important.  With tragedies, including the case of Ms Savita Halappanavar, among others, and inquests that will come to light over the next number of months, it is vital that people can have obstetrician-led services within easy access and not an hour's drive away.  That is suggested in some of the recommendations of this report.</p><p>Worryingly, although the Government notes many of the issues we do and supports many of the goals we seek, the amendment falls short of seeking the retention of services.  It mainly states that no decision has been made about maternity services at this stage and the Government has indicated there are no proposals at this point to downgrade services.  If there are no such plans, what is the function of the 56-page report?  I would love to work for the Health Partnership, as it seems to get money for nothing.  It gets money for reports that have no status and which people do not read.  If it is the case, it is great news.</p><p>When preparing my contribution, I noted how the Minister and others argued I was scaremongering.  What would the Minister, Deputy Reilly, have done with this report if he was in Opposition?  Would he have not worried as the report has no status?  The practice in the Department of Health and with Ministers in general is to waste money on reports, seek proposals and then ignore them.  The Government has been caught with this one as we got hold of a report we were not meant to see.  It is now in the public domain, as it should be.  The Department officials are smiling and I am glad my contribution is humorous for them.  It is certainly not humorous for the people in the north west of the country or those working in the smaller hospitals in the other hospital groups, such as those in Tralee, Wexford, Drogheda, Tipperary and elsewhere.  There is likely to be a report about them which, I presume, again has no status.  All I can go on is what is in black and white, and agencies for which this Government is responsible are considering options that include midwife-led services only at some of these centres.  That is a fact in the report and there is nothing the Minister can say to deny its existence.  The Health Partnership, with a virtual office on Trinity Street, produced it.  I do not know who works for it.  I tried to make contact but I spoke to a lady who could only put me on to the HSE, with the usual laundered answers coming from it about people's services and money.</p><p>We have the lowest number of obstetricians in the OECD group of nations.</p></speech>

With that in mind, we can consider how services function within the obligations under the working time directive and, arguably, the new consultant contract, as well as competition from abroad and elsewhere.  More lucrative medical disciplines can be chosen, meaning further pressure may come to bear.  Our concern is that the Government, as it has with other issues, will take the easy option.  It will look to rationalise the number of maternity centres as it does not need all of them, and it will be able to use the case of Ms Halappanavar and other issues as good cover for downgrading certain hospitals.  That is instead of seeing that, from a geographical perspective, there must be services in the north west at Letterkenny, with obstetric-led services in Sligo and other centres.  The women of Ireland are entitled to that.</p><p>We must not replicate what is happening with cardiac care and the National Cancer Control Programme.  They are a great success from a statistical perspective and when speaking of outcomes for 80% of the population but what about the 20% in the north west, where no cardiac catheterisation laboratory facilities exist?  There are no plans for them and, as usual, it is kicked to touch with the statement that the Department is discussing the issue with colleagues from the North.  Frankly, the people in the north west do not want the Queen looking after their health services.  The Minister is in charge and these people are entitled to services in this area.  His track record of commitments to people in the north west, including Roscommon, Sligo or elsewhere, is poor in the extreme.  It gives me no pleasure to say this but people simply do not believe the Minister.</p><p>Worryingly, the amendment indicates that decisions on maternity service provision will be taken in the context of a proposed national maternity strategy; it will be a national rather than local basis.  This is similar to what happened with the National Cancer Control Programme and the cardiac programme and whether this boils down to medical politics, officialdom or the political will of the Minster and his colleagues, the north west of the country is a gaping wound in the context of adequate service provision.  I would like the person who wants to have a baby in Glencolmcille to have the same chance of that baby being safely delivered as the person living in Salthill.</p></speech>

They are entitled to that.  As it stands under the policy driven by the Minister, if a person has a heart attack in those locations, his or her chance of surviving is less than that of people elsewhere.  The Minister may laugh all he likes.  He can cast his mind to the debates in which he participated as an Opposition Member and ask himself if he is being fair to the people of the north west.  We found him out and this is his report, on which he spent money on behalf of the people.</p></speech>

I also welcome the debate on maternity services, as it is important that we have a constructive debate on the matter.  The amendment particularly states &quot;that the draft report on reconfiguration of maternity services in the West/North-West Hospital Group has no status other than that it may help inform the development of the national maternity strategy;&quot;.</p> <p>It is in that context that the report was drafted.  The amendment outlines that there are no proposals to downgrade maternity services in Sligo Regional Hospital, Mayo General Hospital, Portiuncula Hospital and Letterkenny General Hospital, all of those hospitals which are providing an excellent service in their respective areas.</p><p>I wish to respond to issues raised by my colleague across the floor.  He seems to be overly concerned about the publication of reports.  I remind him that his party leader, when in the Department of Health and Children published 125 reports, all of which remained on the shelf.  The Senator should not raise concerns about reports currently when his party leader had no difficulty spending money on the production of reports only to allow them to lie idle.</p><p>One report I wish to raise is the Hanly report, which related to the development of services in the hospital structure and the employment of doctors.  It clearly set out that there was a need to examine maternity services.  At the time the report was produced in 2003, it set out that the working time directive as it related to junior doctors would be implemented by 2004.  It took a lot longer than that.  By the time the previous Government left office we were nowhere near the implementation of the working time directive for junior doctors.</p><p>Another issue referred to on page 145 of the report is obstetrics and gynaecology.  In 2003 there were 93 consultants in obstetrics and gynaecology and there were 50,000 deliveries annually.  The Hanly report proposed that by 2009 there would be 179 consultants.  Between 2003 and 2009 the country was flush with tax collected and Government budget surpluses.  By the time the previous Government left office there were 125 consultants, one third short of what was set out in the plan.  At the same time, the number of deliveries had increased from 50,000 a year to 75,000 &ndash; almost a 50% increase.</p><p>There has been talk of comparisons.  We recently had a debate on Portlaoise hospital where the number of deliveries reduced from 8,000 a year to 2,000 a year but the number of consultants remained the same.  If one compares it to the education sector, if one had a school that increased from 1,000 students to 2,000 students over a period and there was the same number of teachers we would all have been up in arms but for some reason we do not seem to have reacted in the same way in the area of maternity services in the period 2004 to 2010.</p><p>That is the reason we now need to review the structure of maternity services, especially in smaller units.  There are 19 maternity units in the country and 11 of them have three consultants that are on one-in-three call, where one is on-call every day from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m., every third night and every third weekend.  There is a problem getting locum consultants to cover when someone is on sick leave or holiday leave.  The problem has not been addressed.  Let us have a debate on maternity services, especially on the 11 units that have three consultants.  Some of the units might have four consultants but I understand they have three whole-time equivalents.  It is important that we have a structured debate on how to proceed with the reform that is required, in particular in terms of increasing the rota to one in four.  It is very important that we examine the matter.</p><p>It is also important to consider the requirement for sub-specialisation in some maternity cases.  Reference is made in the report to University Hospital Galway sub-specialising in particular cases.  That is happening around the world where the smaller units focus on straightforward management of gynaecological and obstetric cases but where there are particular difficulties patients are referred to a specialist unit.  We need to have a debate on how we go forward but we also need to have a debate on improving existing services.  In the period from 2003 and 2004 to 2010, the required reform did not occur.  Now we have an opportunity to do that and we should do it.  There is a need for improved staffing levels and improved services in certain areas.  We need a debate such as today&rsquo;s not to focus on negatives but on positives and how we can plan into the future.  That is what we need to do with maternity services in this country.</p></speech>

I compliment him on bringing the issue to the fore and highlighting the critical situation that might arise.  I welcome the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and thank him for coming to the House.  I appreciate that he has always been available to this House.</p><p>I will not refer to any hospital other than Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe of which I have personal knowledge.  My children were born there to my wife Mary.  It was a wonderful service.  At the time the nuns there provided, and still provide, first class maternity services to the region, including towns such as Athlone and Roscommon.  I urge the Minister to state clearly that there is no danger to the hospital and that he is not going to close the maternity service in a quality hospital such as Portiuncula Hospital.</p><p>I was chairman of the Western Health Board in 2002 when the Department bought the hospital from the nuns.  I signed the contract.  It was necessary at the time.  The Minister for Health at the time was Brian Cowen.  He provided the funding and the Department bought the hospital and it became a fully State-run hospital.  We bought it on the basis of providing a service to the people of Roscommon, east Galway and elsewhere in general medicine and in particular maternity services.</p><p>I cannot speak too highly of the hospital.  I urge the Minister not to allow uncertainty to develop.  A report has been published.  The Minister is aware of the situation in Ballinasloe.  He was briefed very well by a consultant who ran for election, prior to the previous general election.  The Minister knows the place very well.  That is my request to him.</p><p>Nothing concentrates the minds of politicians or those in Government like a by-election.  It is like facing the gallows.  The Minister was in Roscommon recently.  I did not attend because I could not participate in an event given the closure of the accident and emergency service by the Minister.  I urge the Minister to carry out a full review of the decision.  I was chairman of the Western Health Board when I signed the contract and funds of approximately &euro;10 million were provided by the then Minister for Health, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, for a state-of-the-art accident and emergency department.  The department&rsquo;s closure is a subject of current concern in Roscommon.  Fine councillors lost their seats following the election because of the decision taken by the Minister and his colleague, the Taoiseach.  During the campaign I came across an accident at Lisnamult in Roscommon.  A lady fell on the footpath and was badly injured.  The ambulance was called straightaway and arrived within five minutes.  It is an excellent service.</p> <p>The technicians gave immediate care on the spot and made her comfortable.  I inquired of the ambulance driver if she would be brought to the urgent care centre at Roscommon County Hospital.  He said no, that he would be bringing the patient to Portiuncula Hospital Ballinasloe.  If I had given her a lift - although I would not interfere in a case like this because the patient was injured - she would have been admitted to the urgent care centre in Roscommon County Hospital.  As a general practitioner himself, does the Minister consider it ludicrous that an accident occurs in Roscommon town, an ambulance arrives but does not take the injured person to the acute centre in the town?  This, by the way, was not at 8.30 at night but 2.30 in the afternoon.</p><p>I was amazed that the woman in question had a minor, below-knee injury to her leg which was not treated at the urgent care centre in the town but taken off to Portiuncula.  When that patient presents at that hospital, then the rest of her treatment will continue there.  That is how one degrades a hospital.  Accident and emergency is the most crucial service any hospital can provide.  The Minister will be in Roscommon for the forthcoming by-election in September or October.  In the meantime, I appeal to him to examine the decision to downgrade Roscommon County Hospital.  Will he also explain why an injured person would be taken from the streets of Roscommon town to Portiuncula hospital 40 miles away in Ballinasloe?</p></speech>

It is not the first time I have addressed this matter.  Senator MacSharry wants to get the idea across that, through some tremendous detective work, he has managed to unveil how a report has been commissioned by the Health Service Executive to examine maternity services in the west-northwest hospitals group.  This was dealt with on 18 February as a Topical Issues matter in the D&aacute;il when Deputy Calleary and my party colleague, Deputy John O&rsquo;Mahony, raised it then.  Senator MacSharry asked me what I would have done if I were in opposition.  I would have listened to what the Minister had said three months ago.</p><p>Let me put the record straight.  There are no plans to close any maternity units, or indeed reconfigure maternity services in the west-northwest hospitals group.  Any reports of such proposals are speculative, disingenuous and unhelpful to staff and patients of these hospitals.  I fully recognise such unsubstantiated and politically motivated reports are designed to be a cause for concern for patients and staff.  I very much regret any upset which may have been caused.</p><p>The reality is that in the context of the implementation of the recommendations of the HIQA report into the death of Savita Halappanavar at University Hospital Galway and the report on the establishment of hospital groups, the west-north west hospitals group undertook a review of its maternity services.  The establishment of hospital groups is the most radical and fundamental modernisation of our health system infrastructure since the State's foundation.  It is a key building block in delivering on our programme for Government commitments to health reform.  Hospital groups will provide the optimum configuration for hospital services to deliver high-quality, safe patient care in a cost-effective manner.  It is logical, therefore, that as hospitals move to working as part of a group, services will be reviewed and evaluated to ensure the delivery of high-quality, safe patient care which is cost-effective and guarantees better outcomes for patients.</p><p>The review of maternity services undertaken by the west-north west hospitals group included the maternity units at Portiuncula Hospital Ballinasloe, Mayo General Hospital, University Hospital Galway, Sligo Regional Hospital and Letterkenny General Hospital.  While the draft report presents various options for service reconfiguration, I understand the report does not recommend any option in particular.  I am aware that an issue has arisen, however, concerning the commissioning of the review of maternity services on behalf of west-northwest hospitals group.  At the request of the director general, the HSE internal audit unit has undertaken a review and established that the procurement of services was not in accordance with HSE national financial regulations.  I further understand that the director general has written to both the hospitals group chairperson and the chief executive officer outlining his concerns, seeking to ensure the recommendations of the audit unit are implemented and that there will be no further breaches of procurement rules.  I am satisfied this operational matter is being dealt with appropriately by the HSE working with the chief executive officer and the group board and that any issues will be resolved in that context.</p><p>Maternity services in all parts of the country will be subject to review and evaluation this year as part of the development by my Department of a new national maternity strategy.  The development of this strategy is under way and will determine the optimal configuration of maternity services to ensure women have access to safe, high-quality maternity care in a setting most appropriate to their needs.  It is the intention to publish the new strategy later this year.  Developing the strategy will provide us with the opportunity to take stock of current services and identify how we can improve the quality and safety of care provided to women and their babies.  The strategy will ensure our maternity services will be developed and improved in accordance with best available national and international evidence.</p><p>While the review on maternity services undertaken by the west-northwest hospitals group may stimulate debate and may help inform the strategy, any decision on maternity service reconfiguration will be taken on a national rather than on a local basis.  No decisions on service reconfiguration will be implemented without my agreement.  The commitment to develop a maternity strategy arises from my acceptance of the recommendations of the HIQA report into the death of Savita Halappanavar.  I regret the manner in which Senator MacSharry referred to the late Ms Halappanavar and I will apologise to her family if any offence was taken.  The report recommended a strategy be developed to implement standard consistent models for the delivery of a national maternity service that reflects best available evidence to ensure all pregnant women have appropriate and informed choice and access to the right level of care and support 24 hours a day.</p><p>The Health at a Glance 2013 - OECD Indicators publication provides evidence that Ireland does not have the lowest ratio of obstetricians to patients in the OECD.  However, Senator MacSharry is only too willing to misinform the House on this.  Nonetheless, I recognise that across some specialties, the ratio of consultants per head of population is lower than in some other jurisdictions.  However, it is the Government&rsquo;s policy to move to a consultant-delivered service.  There has been a significant increase in the number of consultants, whole-time equivalents, over the past decade.  Since the establishment of the HSE, the number of approved posts increased by 723, from 1,947 in January 2005 to 2,670 in December 2013.  The most recent census returns, to end of March 2014 reported 2,581 consultants. If Senator MacSharry checked the figures, he would find both Canada and Holland have fewer consultant obstetricians per head of population but can deliver safe maternity services.  We may require more consultant obstetricians but we must also examine the model of maternity service delivery.  We also need more involvement of midwifery in this area.  We are working to address recruitment problems in this regard.</p><p>I also acknowledge there are difficulties in recruiting in certain specialties.</p> <p>There are some hospitals to which it has historically been difficult to attract applicants for consultant posts, in particular smaller or more remote hospitals or those with onerous rosters due to the limited number of consultants available.  It is particularly difficult to retain academic consultants, given the competitive international market.  Such shortages are typically met through the use of locums in order to ensure service delivery is maintained.  I am confident the establishment of the hospital groups will help address this issue, as it will support the appointment and deployment of consultants as group resources.</p><p>We are planning for the future recruitment and retention of consultants including those who specialise in obstetrics and gynaecology.  The number of doctors in training generally reflects the current projected future staffing needs of the Irish health service.  Of the basic specialist training posts filled by the training bodies in 2013 and 2014, some 75 are in the obstetrics and gynaecology specialty, while of the higher specialist training posts, 50 places are in the specialty.</p><p>I am more broadly concerned about the retention of our young hospital doctors and I am progressing measures to ensure we will have an adequate supply of highly skilled consultants and non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs.  Last July, I set up a group under the chairmanship of Professor Brian MacCraith to carry out a strategic review of medical training and career structures.  The group will make recommendations aimed at improving the retention of medical graduates in the public health system and planning for future service needs.  In December 2013, it provided an interim report focused on training.  In April 2014, the group submitted its second report to me, which dealt with medical career structures and pathways following completion of specialist training.  The final report of the group will deal with workforce planning and is due to be submitted by the end of June 2014.  The work of the group is fundamental to ensuring positions within the public health service are attractive to consultants and doctors in training, particularly NCHDs, in the years ahead.</p><p>I am very concerned that so many are leaving our shores and I know it is not all to do with money but with the lack of a clear career path and lack of respect in how they are treated.  While one can temporarily bully people into working without being paid, they will not stomach it any longer than they have to.  We need a new code of conduct, which will be part of the recommendations.  We need to respect those who work in our health service and treat them with dignity.</p><p>It is important to recognise that appropriate midwifery staffing is essential to ensure the delivery of safe maternity services and reducing error.  In this context, a review of workforce requirements regarding clinical activity is necessary to future-proof our services over the next three to five years, thereby ensuring and assuring patient safety, quality of care and cost effectiveness.  Such a review is currently under way and the aim of the project is to examine the current levels of midwifery staffing and health care assistants in the HSE and recommend appropriate staffing levels and-or initiatives to improve our skill mix.  We must encourage innovation around how we care for patients and the models of care we develop.  I commend those who work in our health service, especially midwives, on the great work they do.</p><p>One of the objectives of the project is to identify the key changes in maternity services and their likely impact on the requirement for midwives and maternity care assistants, taking into account recent and upcoming developments as a result of service reconfiguration, Government policy, industrial relations agreements, clinical research findings, clinical care programme outputs and changing demography.  The project also aims to establish baseline midwifery and maternity care assistant staffing in all maternity units by undertaking a benchmarking exercise to validate the staffing figures received by the HR information unit nationally.  It will examine the midwifery workforce planning needs in a defined number of maternity hospitals nationally, namely, two large units or hospitals, two medium-sized maternity units and two smaller units.  Another objective of the project is to recommend appropriate midwifery staffing and skill mix levels and-or initiatives to meet emerging models of maternity care ensuring standards of safety and quality care for women and their families are met.  This workforce planning exercise will provide data to support the determination of midwifery staffing, and I look forward to receiving it.</p><p>The House will be aware that I have a very clear focus on patient safety and I have ensured patient safety has been made a priority within the HSE's annual service plan.  My officials meet with the HSE each month on the service plan and patient safety is a standing item on that agenda.  There are many facets to the patient safety agenda and several initiatives under way have the potential to drive significant change throughout health service provision over the coming years.  The leadership of this change from a governance and management perspective will be a key dimension to progressing towards this goal.</p><p>Guaranteeing better outcomes for patients is a fundamental principle of our health reform programme.  We all continue to strive to ensure patients receive the best care possible when they need to access health and social care services.  Improving the safety and quality of that care is our highest priority.  The findings of recent reports demonstrate that we still face many challenges to ensure our health and social care services are truly safe and of the highest quality.  I am confident that implementation of the recommendations of the HIQA report into the death of Savita Halappanavar and the report of the chief medical officer into perinatal deaths at the Midland Regional Hospital Portlaoise will ensure patient safety is everyone's priority, and reassure patients that the services they access are of the highest quality and safety.  I am updated regularly by the HSE on progress made in implementing the recommendations of each of these reports.</p><p>Regarding the HIQA report into the death of Savita Halappanavar, the most recent progress report was forwarded to my Department on 2 May by the HSE's national director of acute hospitals, who has been assigned responsibility for this body of work.  I have been assured that progress in implementing both the local and the national recommendations is well under way and will continue throughout the year.  An additional &euro;1.48 million and 6.5 whole time equivalent staff have been provided in the HSE's national service plan 2014 to target necessary patient-centred improvements in maternity care.  Regarding the implementation of the chief medical officer's Portlaoise report, the HSE has established an implementation group, chaired by the national director of acute hospitals, to oversee and ensure the recommendations of the report are progressed in a timely and effective manner.  Progress on implementation of the recommendations is reviewed by the HSE leadership team and a monthly report provided to the chief medical officer.  The second progress report has now been received and the continued progress in implementing the recommendations is noted.</p><p>I regret any upset that reports regarding the alleged downgrading of maternity services in the west may have caused.  As I said in the D&aacute;il on 18 February when the issue was raised as a Topical Issues matter, such reports are speculative and unhelpful.  It is not my intention to downgrade any maternity services in the west.  Two consultant posts in obstetrics and gynaecology, one with a specialist interest in maternal fetal services, to be shared between Portiuncula Hospital and University Hospital Galway, have recently been approved and will, I am informed, be advertised shortly.</p><p>Far from downgrading services, my intention is to improve and develop maternity services throughout the country.  For this reason, work is ongoing within my Department and the HSE to develop a new national maternity strategy.  As part of the development of the strategy, we will review and evaluate maternity services provided in each of the 19 maternity hospitals around the country.  We will also look at national and international evidence of best practice.  This will allow us to determine how to move forward and provide better and safer patient-centred maternity services.</p><p>I still adhere to the underlying principle of the patient being looked after at the lowest level of complexity that is safe, timely and efficient, and as near to home as possible.  On that basis, why would I want to oversee the closure of maternity services in the west where there is such geographical spread?  With the new hospital groups we can have a centre to support these units and ensure the highest standards of care, compassion and outcomes for our citizens.  I am sorry the people of the west and north west may have been distressed by mischievous pronouncements around a report that has little or no status.  While the report might be of some value in informing the national review of maternity services, that is all it can do.  The national review will determine the outcomes, which will have to be approved by me, and I have made my position crystal clear.</p></speech>

I listened in my office to the response of the Minister.  I have not received any reassuring comments on the provision of services, whether in Letterkenny General Hospital, Sligo, Mayo or Ballinasloe.  I commend my colleague, Senator MacSharry, on raising these important issues.  A report was commissioned, and in light of what the Minister stated here today, further issues now arise with regard to it.  The Government is clearly stating the report has no status.

Procurement issues arise, to which the Minister referred in the final lines of the first page of his address with regard to the commissioning of the report.</p><p>We would like to know who sanctioned the report.  What were the terms of reference of the report?  Who signed off on commissioning the report?  Was the Secretary General in the Department aware of what was happening?  Was the head of the HSE, the Minister's office or the Minister aware the report was proceeding?</p><p>The taxpayer deserves to know how much the report cost.  If there are procurement issues, one would expect the HSE has not paid for the report at this stage.  Will the Minister confirm whether the report has been paid for, and if there are procurement issues whether the money is being recouped by the HSE on behalf of the taxpayer?  My colleague, Senator MacSharry, will raise some of these issues, but clarity is needed because the Minister cannot come in, provide a few lines, rubbish a report and state it is not convenient so we will not allow it to go ahead and that there are procurement issues.  It appears the Government is distancing itself from the report simply because its councillors throughout the country got it on the chin at the doors during the local elections.</p><p>Maternity services have been reviewed and they are under-resourced.  Not only are maternity services under-resourced but other services are too, including accident and emergency services about which concerns were raised by my colleague, Senator Leyden.  This question was not answered.  The accident and emergency facilities at Letterkenny General Hospital are in crisis.  Staff are precluded from speaking to public representatives about the issues affecting them on a weekly basis.  Why must elderly people aged 90 years wait 24 hours on trolleys beside coffee machines?  This is what is happening.</p><p>One of the findings of the report highlighted by Senator MacSharry is a lack of resources, particularly staffing resources, whether obstetricians or midwives.  The embargo on recruitment is having a detrimental impact on services throughout the country.  Of course the Minister can say this is not the case but why does he not visit some of the hospitals where the staff and patients who have been lying on trolleys for 24 hours will tell him otherwise?  We need answers today on what is happening in the north west.  We are told in a statement issued on 12 May by the hospital group management in the north west that there was a report, all of the maternity services units in the five hospitals are being looked at, reconfiguration is an option, everything is on the table and the closure of any hospital or maternity unit cannot be ruled out, but the Minister stated here that the report has no status.  How does this add up?  The HSE appears to be saying one thing, the hospital group in the west is saying another and the Minister and his colleagues are saying something different.  Clearly it does not add up and the public are not buying it.  I commend Senator MacSharry on taking the initiative on this issue.  He must be commended.  It is not convenient for the Government or the Minister to hear what he and we have to say and so they try to rubbish it.</p></speech>

We are all agreed that improving maternity services for women in this country and for the birth of children is a key issue and there should be no disagreement about this. I welcome the fact there is a review of national maternity services.  It would be a nonsense to review one part and not the other.  We live on a small island and are all interconnected.  It would be a folly, and the Opposition would be right to jump up and down, as it were, if a review was being done of one part of the country but not of the others.</p><p>I am surprised by Senator MacSharry's confusion over the report with regard to some of the matters raised in it.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill stated it is all on the table.  I would have thought any review should rightly put everything on the table.  Any proper review should state every single thing that goes on should be reviewed.  This is my understanding of the word &quot;review&quot;.  If the Opposition were jumping up and down stating only one or two suggestions had been made and asking where the rest were, I would agree, but everything has been put on the table.  The report states these things are possible, that they could all be closed down and moved to Timbuktu.  It is not a folly at this point to review everything, because in the interests of proper research and providing information, one looks at everything and, one by one, those suggestions which are not at all appropriate are excluded.  One cannot possibly carry out the review required at this point without reviewing all the options.</p><p>The report makes very clear on several pages, none of them mentioned by either Senators &Oacute; Domhnaill or MacSharry, the grave risks that would occur if various options were pursued.  The report mentions in particular the distance people would have to drive.  Anybody who has ever taken an interest in the research done in other countries and the experiences of other countries knows two key things are at play, namely, economies of scale and distance, and they are probably equal in value.  Big risks are written against the options, such as that the travel distance will deprive certain people of certain things or that the travel distance is too great.</p> <p>Did Senator MacSharry not see that when he read the report?  That is what it meant and the people making the decisions are experts, unlike me.  Unlike him, I do not claim to be an expert and would not wish to be charged with making the final decisions.</p><p>I understand from talking to the HSE in recent weeks about this matter that it proposed and is engaged now in a full and frank discussion about this issue with the staff concerned in this group of hospitals.  I say to Senators MacSharry, &Oacute; Domhnaill and anybody else that those staff are the experts.  They are the people who deliver thousands of babies and they are the people who employ midwives.  I see that Senator MacSharry finds reading his iPad far more interesting than engaging in a debate that he called for.</p></speech>

I hope that when the completed reports come to the Minister and to the senior managers in the HSE, the serious viewpoints of the experienced and qualified staff will be taken into account.  I am quite sure that will happen.  I would place greater trust in what they have to say than in what the Senators have to say.  It is as simple as that.</p><p>There have been tragic deaths in hospitals in Ireland.  We all remember Savita Halappanavar with great sadness.  It must be very difficult for her family to keep remembering that she died in the way she did and that her death has caused these kind of debates.  We should not just mention her in passing but pause and think about what happened to her.  We should also reflect on what happened to Sally Rowlette and Dhara Kivlehan who died at Sligo General Hospital.</p><p>I think we are all of the view that trying to avoid maternal deaths is always the best outcome.  As the Minister has always said, patient safety should be and will remain our primary concern.  I would be distraught if I thought for a moment that any review of national maternity services would do other than put patient safety first.  I take his assurance that it is the primary thing.  In the 21st century, the ways and means of providing maternity care have changed from the way it was provided in the past.  I shall give one small mention to one of the complexities that has arisen.  I refer to the numbers of older mothers who give birth and the numbers of women who are obese when giving birth, which has changed the way maternity services must be configured.  I mention them solely to show that expertise is required to try to provide the sort of services that are appropriate for a changing environment and changing type of mother.  These matters cannot be ignored.  They have not been ignored by the research in this document.  They have not been ignored by the research carried out in other areas of the world, particularly in the UK which probably has the closest profile to Ireland.  The idea that we can hang on to the services that we have in the way that they are configured is a nonsense.  We must do something that is different to make sure we continue to provide patient safety in the 21st century when so many things are changing.</p><p>I trust and I am assured that through having this conversation, patient safety will remain the primary concern for patients of the west, north-west, south, midlands and east regions.  It is much more difficult in the north west because of geographical constraints, which I trust will be put into the mix to ensure patient safety benefits and is taken into account because we live with roads that are less good or in an area where we are, potentially, further away.  I trust that patient safety will become the number one consideration in the north west.  That has already been outlined in this report but the Senators, as ever, have opted to ignore it.</p></speech>

The truth is somewhere in the middle and I will outline what I mean.  I speak from a certain amount of personal experience of the maternity services in the west because I have five children who were all born with the help of the services.  It is important for me to say that my experience of the services, certainly at Galway University Hospital, were always very good.  My first child was born under the Domino scheme.  It was a fantastic midwifery-led scheme that was axed by a previous Administration, which led to a huge outcry.  I favour a midwifery-led type of service but it must be backed up by a full hospital service in case anything goes wrong.</p><p>I have issues with the way the hospitals groups have been configured, an issue that I have raised on previous occasions.  The initiative has moved us down the route to privatisation and I am very concerned about the type of model proposed.  Some of the oversight issues flag my issues with the initiative.</p><p>As someone who comes from Galway, the case of Savita Halappanavar focused attention on maternity issues.  Many issues have arisen in maternity units around the country.  Therefore, it is only right that there is a national review of maternity services and, where issues arise, they must be addressed.  I am afraid that I do not agree with some of the things that have happened here.  I have attended briefings held by the hospital group on the issue.</p><p>It is interesting to note that the Minister mentioned in his statement the procurement issues around the report but he did not say that he fundamentally disagreed with its approach.  There are other issues, as mentioned by Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill.  One is left wondering why the report was sanctioned if there was an issue with it, what the cost of it was and who was paid for it, etc.  However, I prefer to focus on other issues.  Also, I noted the statement made by the hospital's chief operating officer who said that they have not recommended or approved reconfiguration of the group.  They have not said that they will not do so in the future.</p><p>Some of the major issues people have in the west is with the framing of this debate.  I do not completely agree with Senator O'Keeffe's comment that all the options were put on the table.  That is not the impression of the workers' representatives to whom I have spoken in this debate.  They are particularly concerned about the status of Portiuncula Hospital because the report contains six options that relate to the hospital.  The first option was to let everything stay as it is, but that has been ruled out by Bill Maher, the chief executive of the hospital group, so the workers' representatives feel that option is no longer available.  In their opinion, all the remaining five options recommend a downgrading or closure of the unit in Portiuncula Hospital.  They are greatly concerned that all the options have not been put on the table.</p></speech>

It is a concern when one looks at the fact that the Portiuncula centre has won national and international awards for the type of service it provides.  Quite a number of well-known politicians from these Houses have availed of the services at Portiuncula.  The fact is 47% of the people who opt to attend Portiuncula come from outside the catchment area because its system is so good.</p><p>I have read the review report on maternity services.  If one looks at the unit costs for Portiuncula, one finds that it is the second most cost effective maternity unit.  The cost per birth for Portiuncula Hospital is &euro;3,673 per unit, which is second only to Letterkenny hospital.  Also, there has not been a drop in birth rates in Portiuncula in comparison with other hospitals.</p><p>The options and recommendations put forward are as follows: leave the number of maternity units as is; to have a main maternity hub at University Hospital Galway and three satellite maternity units; to have a main hub and two satellite maternity units; to have a main hub and one satellite maternity unit; and have a main hub and four satellite maternity units.</p> <p>The people of Ballinasloe, with all due respects, do not put great stock in the responses from the Department and from the hospital groups because in their experience to date, the promises from the Department or from the HSE relating to services, particularly in Ballinasloe, have not borne fruit.  In mental health services, for example, where they were given promises and told not to worry about the 22 acute mental health beds in Ballinasloe which would be okay, that did not come to fruition and those beds were closed down.  Alcohol treatment services in St. Brigid's were also lost to the area.  The people of Ballinasloe and that area are certainly very concerned when they hear of high level reports such as this going to the hospital trust that would even discount the possibility of maintaining a full maternity service in Portiuncula Hospital, and I would agree with them.  I would certainly share many of their concerns.</p><p>They are also concerned that there has not really been any proper community or staff consultation around this issue.  I am not saying this; this is being said by the workers' representatives.  That is not acceptable.  Their thinking is that, when one looks at the way the report has been framed, those who wrote this report had it in their minds already that Portiuncula would be closed down and the only options left on the table are ones which bear that in mind.  That is totally unacceptable.</p><p>It went so far prior to the elections that a priest, from a pulpit, spoke out on this issue in the Ballinasloe area.  He got a standing ovation from the people in the area only to be castigated, I understand, by a member of the Minister's party, from the balcony on the issue.  The amount of unrest and disquiet on this issue is alarming.</p><p>We certainly do not accept any downgrading of those services, in particular, in Portiuncula.  As has been stated previously, what we need is an enhancing of services.  Certainly, we need an enhancing of the midwifery services available.  I would welcome more of the Domino-type schemes that were available which were midwife led, but there would be no acceptance whatsoever of this report.  The Minister should discount the report completely and ask the hospital trust to scrap it.</p></speech>

The Minister has done a pretty good job in that regard here today.</p><p>They have, by their behaviour, caused worry, fear, anxiety and concern to expectant mothers in my constituency and in surrounding areas, and particularly to the employees of Portiuncula Hospital.  These employees were told by Fianna F&aacute;il - this is not hearsay as they put it in an election document that was circulated around the town of Ballinasloe - that the decision to close the maternity unit in Portiuncula Hospital would be taken two weeks after the local elections.  A new young candidate put that out in his election literature.  The young man, for whom I have tremendous admiration, did not design it, but it was designed by an Oireachtas Member who mischievously attempted to misrepresent and cause fear and worry for so many around the Ballinasloe area.</p></speech>

Everybody in this House wants to provide an accessible, safe and high-quality maternity service for all the people and it is only right that there would be a national review of maternity services in light of the many serious issues and problems that have surfaced in recent years.</p><p>I welcome the fact that no decisions on maternity service provision will be made in advance of the publication of the national maternity strategy.  I also welcome the fact that there are no proposals to downgrade maternity services at Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe or at the other units in the west and north-west region.  This confirms the information given to me by Mr. Bill Maher, CEO of the West/North-West Hospitals Group, who stated that, far from downgrading the Portiuncula Hospital service, they were looking at a midwife-led service model alongside the obstetrician-led service in Ballinasloe.  The confirmation that two additional obstetricians will be appointed shortly to provide a service in Portiuncula and in UCHG confirms my confidence in the information given to me by Mr. Maher.</p><p>Portiuncula Hospital maternity unit is one of the best in the country and should be used as the model for best practice in maternity care.  It has received, as has been said, many awards.  The Minister will be aware that over 2,000 births take place there annually and I am sure that he will be pleased to hear that the cost of a birth in Portiuncula is considerably lower than the cost of a birth in UCHG - &euro;3,600 in Portiuncula versus &euro;5,000 in Galway.  As we look at the money follows the patient model, Portiuncula Hospital should be considered to be the centre of excellence for maternity care.  In addition, the bed occupancy level at Portiuncula is higher than anywhere else in the country and mothers are making the decision that Portiuncula is their centre of excellence.</p><p>I want to see the Minister fix the many problems in the health service that he inherited from the previous Government, and he is making very significant progress.  The women of Ireland must have the best quality maternity services that are properly resourced.  The national review is a necessary element of improving patient safety.  I look forward to the development of the maternity services in the west and north-west region and seeing my local Portiuncula Hospital continuing to be the jewel in the crown of that service.  That is how people feel about Ballinasloe and that is based on the level of service and care that has being given to mothers down through the years in Ballinasloe.</p><p>I thank Fianna F&aacute;il for the opportunity to speak on this issue.  I want to nail, and see put to bed here today, the untruths and misinformation that have been peddled so widely over the past number of weeks.</p></speech>

We have a fantastic maternity unit in Sligo General Hospital, and also in Letterkenny, Mayo, Galway and Portiuncula.</p><p>What has happened in the past few weeks is regrettable.  It is disgraceful how Senator MacSharry scaremongered the women, particularly in Sligo.  I have been on the doorsteps with a candidate who was seven months' pregnant.  We met many women on the doorsteps, including pregnant women and women who will be pregnant in the future, who were frightened by what he was saying.  He was saying it, if he does not mind me saying so, in an aggressive and arrogant manner, and that is regrettable.</p><p>I am delighted to hear the Minister state here today his commitment to maternity services in our region.  I would also be very supportive of midwifery-led services, obviously, backed up by obstetricians and gynaecologists.  Certainly, that is the future of maternity services in this country.</p><p>I compliment all the wonderful midwives who we have in those hospitals and the work that they do and their commitment to their job.  However, I want to put on the record of this House that what went on during the local elections in Sligo was unfortunate.  I know it was led by Senator MacSharry.  It is good that we can debate maternity services in the country in this Chamber and discuss changes that we may like to see happen, but the bottom line for everybody is the safety of women in this country.</p> <p>Ireland has very good maternity services thus far and I thank the Minister.</p></speech>

I see I have time and had thought there would have been a few more speakers on both sides.  First, Senator O'Keeffe's research differs from mine and that is why the iPad is out.  Ireland has the lowest number of obstetricians in the OECD and Greece has nine times as many obstetricians as do we.  Perhaps that is wrong but in any event, Members will agree that Ireland is down the field.  I have the report to hand, with no lies or no anything.

Of course it scares us all and we are distraught to think that in secret, had it not been brought out by Fianna F&aacute;il, somebody under the Minister's control commissioned a report that has no status, wasted the public's money and scared the people of the north west.</p><p>If it is the case that there is nothing to worry about, why does the Government's amendment not state that obstetrician-led services will be maintained in Letterkenny, Sligo, Castlebar and Portiuncula?  It does not state this.  Most worryingly, it states this matter will be examined in a national context and that the Government will not be driven by any local considerations.  Senator Henry should note this is what frightens women, namely, the potential for downgrade.  I find it to be humorous in the extreme that the Minister, Deputy Reilly, who in opposition was the champion of the patient, takes such issue with me bringing into the public domain a report that the buck stops with him.  When he abolished the HSE board, he stated that he was taking control.  Therefore, he should take responsibility and should provide the name of the person who commissioned the report and outline what were its terms of reference.  Did the Secretary General of the Department of Health, the Minister, his special adviser or Mr. Bill Maher know about it?

The people of the north west of the country are entitled to better and as I stated in response to another Minister lately on a different issue, members of the Government need to get it into their heads that there is a culture in Ireland whereby people live outside Dublin and are as entitled to services as people anywhere else.  Many of the Minister's colleagues, through no fault of their own, lost their seats last week.  I hope the Minister is listening this time.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-05-28a.175" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014052800021#W00300"><p>I thank the Cathaoirleach and Seanad for inviting me before it today.  I will start by giving a brief overview of the Government's strategy to tackle the pressing issue of youth unemployment.</p><p>Research evidence shows that early and prolonged periods of unemployment during a person's lifetime can have a permanent scarring effect on his or her capacity to improve his or her standard of living.  This is a particular problem during an economic downturn, as young people tend to be hit by the impact of job losses more than others because they tend to be the most junior employees in an organisation and they also tend to work in sectors, such as retail and services, which feel the brunt of any reduction in demand.  Hence, it is crucial that an effective strategy is in place to tackle youth unemployment before it becomes prolonged and systemic.</p><p>In the first instance, the Government's primary medium-term strategy to tackle youth unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity.  Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth.  Past experience suggests that youth unemployment, which tends to rise relatively rapidly in a downturn, can be expected to fall relatively rapidly during the recovery.  There is evidence to indicate this is already occurring.  The official labour market figures published by the CSO earlier this week show that the youth unemployment rate has fallen from 30% in quarter 1 of 2012 to 25% in quarter 1 of 2014, while the number of young unemployed has fallen by 16,500 from 64,000 to 47,500 over the same period.  My firm belief is that this improvement in youth unemployment trends will continue.  However, the Government recognises that even as the economy enters a recovery phase, the number of young jobseekers will exceed the supply of job opportunities available to them.  Hence, in addition to promoting medium-term economic recovery, the Government recognises the need to ensure these job gains for young people continue, and for interim measures to support the young unemployed and keep young jobseekers close to the labour market.</p><p>Key to this will be the implementation in Ireland of the European Council recommendation for a youth guarantee.  The objective of this guarantee is to ensure that young people receive a quality offer of employment, training, work experience or further education within four months of becoming unemployed.  This is a very ambitious target and, accordingly, in agreeing the recommendation, the European Council noted that the guarantee should be implemented on a phased basis in those countries, such as Ireland, facing very significant fiscal constraints.  None the less, while financial constraints remain a reality in terms of roll-out, Ireland will be implementing the guarantee from a very advantageous position, as recognised by both the EU and OECD.  Many of the elements that will make up the guarantee at EU level are already in place in Ireland, thanks in large part to the Pathways to Work strategy that has been rolled out by this Government and which is being led by my Department.  We do not intend to reinvent the wheel where it is not necessary to do so.</p><p>The features of the youth guarantee which are already in place include: Intreo, the transformative new employment service helping people back to work; JobBridge, the national internship scheme; JobsPlus, the wage subsidy scheme for employers; community-based employment options such as TUS and Gateway; and further education and training programmes such as Momentum and VTOS.  In implementing the guarantee, we will build on these important initiatives and expand them as necessary.  A key part of our challenge will be to increase the impact of these schemes in supporting young unemployed people.  Accordingly, the guarantee approved by the Government and commended by the European Commission, involves the following: modifying the Intreo process to ensure more intensive engagement with young people; increasing the number of places on schemes available to young people; and earmarking a quota of opportunities on existing schemes for young people, including, in addition to Department of Social Protection schemes, opportunities for accessing entrepreneurship funds via Micro Finance Ireland and training and further education opportunities through the Department of Education and Skills and its agencies.  We will also introduce a developmental internship programme for the most disadvantaged young people who have been identified as having significant barriers to gaining employment.  Under this programme employers will be asked to make work experience places available for young people with low levels of educational attainment, long periods of unemployment and other social barriers to employment.  It is proposed that, at any one time, 1,500 young people will participate in this programme.</p> <p>The youth guarantee includes improving the JobsPlus subsidy arrangements for employing young people by reducing the qualifying period for those aged under 25 from 12 months to four months in respect of young people who are assessed as having a low to medium probability of leaving the live register.  This is line with recommendations from the OECD.  These are young people who have never worked or are early school leavers with relatively few qualifications to offer an employer.  The aim is to introduce, in line with recommendations from the EU on the promotion of intra-EU labour mobility, an international mobility and language skills development programme for young people to expand the number of opportunities currently availed of by young people in the form of further education and training, internships, subsidised private sector recruitment and supports for self-employment.</p><p>I will describe the timing of the roll-out of the youth guarantee.  By the end of 2014, we will have progressively rolled out processes and programmes to ensure that all those young unemployed people who most need support will receive a youth guarantee offer within four months.  In this way, we will ensure our resources are prioritised to help those who are most in need.  In 2012, some 56,000 young people joined the live register as wholly unemployed, and some 35,000 or 63% of these remained unemployed for four months or more.  The target of the guarantee approach is to reduce over time this level of persistent unemployment among young people.  As part of the implementation of the youth guarantee it is proposed, subject to labour market and economic developments, to review the targeted nature of the youth guarantee offer before the end of 2015.</p><p>Significant progress has been made since the youth guarantee implementation plan was published in January.  The plan provides for more than 28,000 programme opportunities for unemployed young people in 2014, as set out in the table being circulated with this statement.  This figure excludes some 24,000 places provided for young people through post-leaving certificate courses and apprenticeships.  These latter places, together with the wide range of vocational third level courses provided for the young, although not reserved for the unemployed, nevertheless contribute to the spirit of the guarantee.</p><p>Of the approximately 28,000 places for unemployed young people, approximately 5,000 of these were taken up in the first four months of the year.  This is broadly in line with expectations, as some programmes such as the vocational training and opportunities scheme and the back to education allowance have intakes in September as per the academic calendar.  A new intake of young people to the MOMENTUM programme for the long-term unemployed is also scheduled for later in the year.  The MOMENTUM programme has been very popular with unemployed people.  In addition, some of the initiatives planned under the guarantee require primary legislation to allow positive discrimination on age grounds in the provision of employment services and supports.  This legislation will enable us to take steps to discriminate positively in favour of disadvantaged young people in accordance with the provisions of the EU equality directive.  It will be enacted as part of the spring social welfare Bill due before the Oireachtas in June.  Two employment schemes in particular, the developmental internship and JobsPlus, are dependent on this legislation being passed.  The JobsPlus variant will be available as soon as possible after the relevant legislation has been cleared.  The developmental internship, which will include a pre-internship training period, will be in place not later than the autumn.  Passage of this legislation will also permit the introduction of earlier and more intensive engagement by Intreo with young unemployed people.</p><p>The cost of the programmes contributing to the youth guarantee will be significant.  It is being funded, in the first instance, by the Irish Exchequer.  However, it is expected that a number of these youth programmes will meet European Social Fund eligibility criteria and will be included in the youth employment initiative application for Ireland.  This will permit EU funding to be drawn down in respect of expenditure in 2014 and 2015 to a level that should enable the full youth employment initiative allocation for Ireland of &euro;68.1 million in current prices to be taken up over those two years, with a further similar amount in ESF funding.  Given the way the funding is structured, to recoup these amounts from the EU in due course it will be necessary that we spend, in the first instance, close to &euro;100 million on relevant programmes each year, or close to &euro;200 million in 2014 to 2015 overall.  It is anticipated that actual expenditure will be significantly in excess of that amount over the period concerned.  Taking existing and planned provision together, the current estimate of programme uptake by young people in 2014 of approximately 28,000 will involve associated programme costs of &euro;336 million.  If all post-leaving certificate course and apprenticeship provision is included, the total programme uptake of approximately 52,000 has associated annual programme costs of &euro;528 million.  The expenditure by the Exchequer from taxpayers' funding is very significant.</p><p>The Department of Social Protection, in conjunction with local groups, has also secured EU funding of &euro;250,000, the maximum amount available, to pilot a youth guarantee scheme in Ballymun.  The Ballymun pilot project is developing an activation approach tailored to the needs of young people, guaranteeing access to career guidance and assistance leading to identification of an individual career plan for the young unemployed person with follow-through to training, education, work experience, or full-time employment.  A particular focus of the pilot is to involve and build links with employers in the locality and the immediate hinterland to ensure the guidance and training elements of the youth guarantee are tailored to the needs of the local labour market and also to generate work placement experience opportunities for the participants.  Only last week, the Ballymun pilot was visited by Commissioner Laszlo Andor, the European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion, who has overall responsibility for the youth guarantee at EU level.  Commissioner Andor was extremely impressed with the progress to date in the Ballymun pilot.  Feedback from the Ballymun pilot will be taken into account in finalising the ongoing implementation plan of the guarantee in other areas of the country.  I spoke to a room full of young people involved in the Ballymun pilot project.  One young man said there was so much positivity in the room because they were getting an opportunity to get work experience and to develop skills.  Many of the young people spoke about what they were doing as opposed to simply being unemployed.  The adrenaline and the positivity in that room last week was really striking.</p><p>I wish to assure the House that the issue of youth unemployment will continue to be a major priority for the Government.  While youth unemployment has been falling recently, I recognise that an insufficient supply of job opportunities is the reality that continues to face many young people leaving our education system.  Aside from the obvious negative financial, social and emotional impact, youth unemployment also results in a waste of the skills acquired in schools and colleges and an under-utilisation of the obvious talent and creativity of the youth population.  As Minister I am determined to ensure the implementation of the youth guarantee scheme in Ireland makes a real difference to the many young people who, as a consequence of the recession triggered by the collapse of the banking system and the bust in construction, are exasperated by the lack of opportunities to match their ambition and their talents.  I am confident the youth guarantee, which I championed and navigated through the EU decision-making process during the Irish Presidency of the EU Council, will play a key role in ensuring that this need not be the case over the next few years.  It is a guarantee of which I am proud and one which I commend to the House.</p><p>I will now speak about the rent supplement scheme.</p> <p>In any discussion of rent supplement, it is very important to be clear that the purpose of the scheme is to provide short-term income support to people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  The overall aim is to provide short-term assistance and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.<br />The Government has provided more than &euro;344 million for the rent supplement scheme in 2014.  There are currently approximately 77,000 rent supplement recipients, of which more than 50,000 have now been in payment for more than 18 months, representing more than 65% of the total.  At the end of April 2014, approximately 33,150 rent recipients were on the live register - representing 8.5% of the total live register.<br /><b></b>Rent supplement is subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant may incur.  Limits are set at levels that enable eligible households to secure basic suitable rented accommodation, having regard to the different rental market conditions that prevail in various parts of the State.  Maximum rent limits are generally reviewed every 18 months.  The most recent review was completed in June 2013 with revised rent limits introduced on 17 June 2013.  Despite pressures on the social protection budget, the last review saw rent limits increase in line with market rents in some areas, including Dublin and Galway, with Dublin limits increasing by a weighted average of 9%.  As people will appreciate, relative to inflation a 9% increase in the rent supplement in the Dublin area last year was a very significant increase.<br />A new rent limit review has commenced and will feed into the budgetary process.  This review will involve a comprehensive analysis of information from a range of sources, including rental tenancies registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board, the Central Statistics Office rental indices and websites advertising rental properties to ascertain both the costs and market trends for private rented accommodation.  The Department will also seek the views of a number of stakeholders in this area, including the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Health Service Executive and other non-government organisations.<br /><b></b>I am fully aware that in some areas, in particular Dublin, prospective tenants, including those seeking access to rent supplement, are finding it increasingly difficult to secure accommodation due to reduced availability of supply.  I assure Senators that Department officials have considerable experience in dealing with customers of the scheme and continue to make every effort to ensure their accommodation needs are met.  <br />Staff in the Department's community welfare service have discretionary powers to award a supplement for rental purposes in exceptional cases where it appears that the circumstances of the case so warrant, for example, when dealing with applicants who are homeless or who are at risk of losing their tenancy.  Such cases are examined on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the situation presented.  <br />It should be noted that approximately 77,000 people and families are currently in receipt of rent supplement.  That proves that a significant number of landlords are accommodating applicants of the scheme and that rent supplement recipients are accessing accommodation.  The Department also provides support to persons towards rent deposits under the exceptional needs payments.  This form of assistance is very important to people on low incomes who rely on the private rented market to meet their housing needs.  In 2013, some 4,300 people were assisted with rent deposits at a cost of &euro;2.1 million.<br />The community welfare service, including through its work in the homeless persons unit and the asylum seekers and new communities unit, works closely with local authorities and other stakeholders to facilitate homeless people to access private rented accommodation.  This ensures that, where possible, people are diverted away from homeless services and towards community-based supports.<br />In addition, and in view of the current supply difficulties, the Dublin local authorities, in conjunction with voluntary organisations, are finalising a protocol so that families at risk of losing existing private rented accommodation can have more timely and appropriate interventions made on their behalf.  The necessary operational arrangements are currently being put in place and it is expected the initiative will be launched shortly.  These cases will be assessed on an individual basis, having regard to the individual circumstances and families requiring additional support will receive the necessary assistance.<br /><b></b>The Government effectively has two initiatives to deal with long-term reliance on rent supplement - the rental accommodation scheme, which is in operation since 2004, and the more recent housing assistance payment.  Both initiatives give the local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the long-term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement.  At the end of March 2014, local authorities had transferred almost 48,900 households from rent supplement.  Of these, 28,900 were housed directly under RAS and a further 20,000 were accommodated under other social housing options.<br />The Department's strategic policy direction is to transfer responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need to local authorities under HAP.  Officials in the Department of Social Protection are working closely with those in the lead Department, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, in piloting HAP on an administrative basis in Limerick City and County Council, with more than 50 cases having being transferred from rent supplement to date.<br />There will be further roll out of HAP to selected local authorities during the remainder of the year.  Officials in the Department of Social Protection are working closely with those in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to progress this transfer.  One of the key benefits HAP will bring is the removal of barriers for people currently in receipt of rent supplement in returning to employment which is consistent with the Government's commitments under the Pathways to Work programme.  Senators have mentioned previously that catch-22 where if one is on rent supplement and gets an offer of an entry level job, one may risk losing one's rent supplement as a result of going back to work.  That is basically the wrong way round.  <br />Rent supplement will continue to be paid to clients who are already in the private rented sector but who, generally because of a loss of income through unemployment, require short-term income support in order to pay their rent.  Rent supplement will, therefore, over time, return to its original intention of being a short-term payment.  I thank the Cathaoirleach and Members of the Seanad for inviting me today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-05-28a.178" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1128" speakername="Paschal Mooney" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014052800023#Y00200"><p>I welcome the Minister and wish her well.  The Department of Social Protection has admitted that it will be unable to provide training or employment for more than half of those under 25 on the live register.  This has been the focus of some criticism from the OECD and the European Commission which claim Ireland now risks the emergence of a lost generation.  While I welcome the figures mentioned by the Minister showing a reduction in youth unemployment, it is still staggeringly high.  In budget 2014, the Government stated that &euro;14 million would be provided to roll-out a youth guarantee scheme over the coming months.  The provision of &euro;14 million for youth unemployment equates to approximately &euro;232 per person under the age of 25 currently on the live register.  The National Youth Council of Ireland estimates that &euro;273 million would be necessary to implement the youth guarantee model in Ireland along the lines of the successful Swedish model.</p><p>What is critically important is that the Department of Social Protection has stated that there will be a total of 20,000 training or education places set aside this year for young people who are out of work as part of the youth guarantee while CSO figures estimate that approximately 39,000 plus under 25s have been out of work for three months or more.  This leaves a shortfall of almost 20,000 places which means 20,000 people will not be given a youth guarantee and will have to rely on a vastly reduced jobseeker's payment instead.</p> <p>A total of 20,000 people will not be given a youth guarantee and will have to rely on a greatly reduced jobseeker's allowance instead.  A total of 6,993 young people under 25 years of age have been unemployed for over three years.  At present, there is only one social welfare employment service officer for every 800 people unemployed.  Ireland has one of the highest rates of youth unemployment in the EU.  No new jobs have yet been created through the NewERA project - which the Minister did not mention - the project which Fine Gael promised would create over 105,000 jobs.  The Government's policy of reducing income support to young people with the cut in jobseeker's allowance along with the lack of labour activation measures means that there is often no option for young people other than to emigrate, which is a sad comment on this Government.</p><p>Jobseeker's allowance has been slashed to &euro;100 from &euro;144 per week for existing recipients up to and inclusive of people who are 22 years of age from 1 January 2014, a huge and disproportionate reduction.  For all new entrants up to and including the age of 24 the allowance has also been reduced from &euro;144 to &euro;100 from 1 January 2014 and for 25 year olds it has been reduced from &euro;188 to &euro;144 from January 2014.  These changes will also result in a cut in payment to those engaged in the JobBridge internship programme as interns receive an allowance of only &euro;50 per week on top of their existing social welfare entitlement.  There are many gaps in the much-vaunted Government plan to deal with youth unemployment, which the Minister has not addressed. </p><p>The use of the rent supplement as a quick fix solution to a long-term problem has resulted in increasing rents for those on low incomes, increased homelessness and ever increasing profits for private landlords.  The Government over the past three years has failed to develop a proper social housing plan and is now scrambling to address one of the worst housing crises in the history of the State.  Fianna F&aacute;il has published its own national housing strategy which aims to help address the serious shortage of available housing units and the record numbers waiting on social housing lists.</p><p>Are staff being redeployed from the Department of Social Protection as part of the move to the housing assistance payment, HAP?  There are at least 66 separate computer systems in different local authorities dealing with housing.  What resources are being provided to smooth the transition?  Can we be assured this will not become another student universal support Ireland, SUSI, Irish Water or medical card fiasco?</p><p>The Minister stated that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has been anxious to see the Department of Social Protection help people to pay their rent by direct deduction at source through the Department.  Is that still the intention?  Will the Minister ensure that if landlords are in receipt of rent supplement they are fully tax compliant and also that inspections are carried out to ensure properties meet minimum expected standards of accommodation?</p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il's national housing strategy, published some weeks ago, aims to increase the housing stock, boost employment in the construction sector, dramatically speed up the transfer of vacant National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, units for social housing and make it easier for local authority tenants to buy their own homes.</p><p>Among Fianna F&aacute;il's many proposals are a new home building programme drawn up by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in conjunction with each local authority; Part V teams to ensure that 20% of all new developments is used for social housing; the vacant home refurbishment scheme to open up the large number of vacant homes to families on social housing waiting lists; the establishment of NAMA transfer units at each local authority; the establishment of a national database of rogue developers to inform planning decisions; the establishment of a national planning portal so that citizens can access planning information in each local authority; and the reintroduction of housing adaption grants to allow older people and people with disabilities to live independently at home.  The reduction in that local authority grant was shocking and caused enormous distress to older citizens and to people with disabilities.</p><p>NAMA has identified 4,319 units as being potentially suitable for social housing but only 1,900 have been confirmed as being suitable and 443 have been completed or contracted.  This represents a significant failure to deliver the promised social dividend from NAMA.</p><p>In July 2013 the Government approved the introduction of the HAP concept.  Under HAP, responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need will transfer from the Department of Social Protection to local authorities.  The implementation of this process has been painfully slow.  Officials in the Department have been working with the various agencies in piloting HAP in Limerick City and County Council.  Since July 2013 progress has been abysmally slow, despite promises that HAP will be further rolled out to six selected local authorities during the year.  HAP will allow one to work and receive some form of rent supplement.  It is being introduced to combat the perception that the rent supplement scheme in its current format is a poverty trap.  Questions remain, however, as to whether HAP will address the needs of people in receipt of rent supplement. </p></speech>

This discussion with the Minister is a welcome occasion to discuss the progress to date.  It comes on the back of the Minister's being able to secure agreement on &euro;6 billion of funding during the course of Ireland's Presidency of the EU.</p><p>I see some nonsense published recently by the Socialist Party that paints the youth guarantee as some form of forced cheap labour.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The scheme is a genuine attempt to assist young people most at risk of long-term unemployment.  It provides opportunities for up-skilling and development.  The social welfare system we inherited was utterly passive.  People became trapped in the system with no encouragement or reward for working.</p><p>I emphasise that everything we do as a Government is aimed at helping the less well-off and those out of work.  We do it through encouraging people into work and rewarding them for it, not reinforcing an old system that simply has not worked.  The State, through a variety of initiatives, is now actively assisting and rewarding people for engaging in training and further education.  It is actively assisting people in their search for suitable employment.  Anyone who, like the Socialist Party, considers it appropriate that someone be let languish on the dole without being actively encouraged to do anything about it, should take a good hard look at what this means for our future generations and stop the polemics.</p><p>What further feedback has the Minister received on the Ballymun pilot project and what further roll-out does she envisage over the course of this year?  Have further projects been identified?  Does she expect that the envisaged 30,000 young people at high risk of long-term employment will receive the guarantee in 2014?</p><p>The amount of funding available is a major concern for all sides.  Is the Minister satisfied that she has sufficient resources in place for the current year, given that we are still borrowing, although much less, to keep our welfare and employment support services funded?</p><p>This year, the Government has provided &euro;344 million for 77,000 rent supplement recipients.  For a scheme that is not intended to provide long-term assistance or as an alternative to other social housing schemes, it seems remarkable to spend a third of a billion euro.  While I understand that people are in great need of assistance to pay their housing costs, this is an enormous sum, which could be used more productively.</p><p>There remain a vast number of empty estates and apartments in our towns and cities.  NAMA retains a sizeable housing stock that presumably, for book-keeping purposes, could be bought by the State.  The money spent on rent supplement would go a long way to renovating such property and also towards building new social housing thus alleviating our housing shortage, and thereby reducing demand and rents.  I also note that much of the economic commentary on the difficulty in accommodation costs is very insistent that rent controls are not the solution but an increase in building, and supply are.</p><p>While house prices in Dublin outstrip the national figures, &euro;344 million would build a minimum of 1,700 houses annually in the capital on today's figures and far more nationwide.  If some of the moneys were used to update unused stock, it would go a long way also.  There will always be people who will require short-term assistance with their rent.  A study could perhaps be undertaken on how so much money would produce a more tangible and lasting result, rather than just help meet increasing rents, as it does at present, which seems possibly counterproductive.</p><p>I am not for a moment suggesting that, in the short term, people who are struggling should have their housing benefit cut.  When the present difficulties subside, rather than just cut the allocation for rent supplement, the Minister should retain a large portion for investment against future difficulties.</p></speech>

I will not repeat previous interventions I have made on the Youth Guarantee but will instead ask a series of questions because I want to further the issue and there are issues on which I have not received answers.</p><p>On the last occasion the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, was with us, on 5 February, she stated that the implementation of the Youth Guarantee could not be achieved with the flick of a switch.  All of us agreed with that at the time but I spoke about the importance of the national partner organisations named in the Youth Guarantee plan published in January.  On 5 February I indicated they had not heard anything from the Department; having contacted them on foot of this debate they have told me they still have not really heard anything from the Department.  Partnership is crucial in delivering this plan and partners must be kept in the loop.  The Department of Social Protection held a stakeholder forum last October when devising the plan and perhaps it would be useful to have another stakeholder forum to update and involve partners, and I ask the Minister of State if there are any plans to have this type of forum.</p><p>There is also a concern that this is initially a two-year programme, and we all hope it will continue beyond 2015.  It is very important that we spend the financial envelope allocated for 2014 and 2015, so will the Minister of State provide an update and assure the House that the moneys allocated to Ireland will be spent?  I know that seems to be an obvious question but I am not convinced at this time.</p><p>One of the more disappointing aspects was raised by me before the plan's publication and again in February.  It is the failure to acknowledge the role and value of engaging the youth work sector in supporting the participation of young people in the Youth Guarantee programme.  Will that be reviewed in light of the experience to date in Ballymun?  I know the Minister for Social Protection met Commissioner Andor at Ballymun Regional Youth Resources last week to find out its experience of supporting the implementation of the Ballymun Youth Guarantee project.  I am sure the Minister of State is aware that there has been work with the Department of Social Protection and the Ballymun Job Centre in reducing the number of what are referred to as &quot;DNA&quot; or &quot;do not attends&quot;.  This is the scenario where a young person receives a letter inviting attendance at an interview or a group engagement with the Department of Social Protection but does not attend.  I welcome the fact that in Ballymun, the Department worked with the Ballymun Regional Youth Resources to find out why this happens and support young people in participation.  The feedback from young people is that letters did not arrive on time or were sent to the wrong addresses.  Some young people did not understand their content or had literacy problems and could not read the letters.  I know the Department of Social Protection has changed its process in response to the feedback from young people, altering the nature of communications.  This is a perfect example of why youth work organisations need to be involved, so they can reach out and meet young people who can be hard to contact.</p><p>Ballymun Regional Youth Resources has also been working with young people to support and encourage them to engage in the process and understand why it is important while providing some moral support to young people who are not used to engaging with State agencies or who have had a bad experience in the past.  This is very welcome but the reality is there is no provision or funding in the national plan to facilitate this type of work in the rest of the country.  Will the national plan be revised to reflect the experience of youth engagement in Ballymun?</p><p>Like the Minister I welcome increased employment in our country but at a recent conference the Central Bank reported that 90% of new jobs created in 2013 were for people with third level qualifications.  This is good news for the many well-educated and qualified graduates in our country but I am concerned about the uneven recovery, with young people with limited qualifications left behind.  The Youth Guarantee plan proposes, correctly, to begin with the 22,000 long-term unemployed young people but what will the Government do to ensure we have job opportunities for these young people when they complete their Youth Guarantee programme?  The Government recently published Construction 2020 and although that will make a contribution, we should never go back to where we were in the early 2000s, relying on the construction industry to provide jobs for these young people.  What else is being done, as this sector should not be seen as the only solution?</p><p>At a meeting of the education committee earlier this afternoon, the Minister for Social Protection confirmed that the JobBridge scheme for disadvantaged youths, which will be called Developmental JobBridge and was proposed in the national Youth Guarantee plan, will be mandatory for those identified as eligible.  I welcome greater targeting of the disadvantaged but I am very concerned at hearing that JobBridge will be compulsory for some groups.  Rather than forcing people to participate in JobBridge internship, which may at best be unhelpful and at worst could be damaging and exploitative, I recommend the Department to engage in consultation to ascertain why some groups of young people are more attracted to other training and education programmes.  I have heard anecdotally that the extra &euro;50 in some cases has an impact on other entitlements such as rent allowances, meaning that JobBridge participants could end up worse off.  I do not know for sure if that is true but those questions must be answered.  The Department of Social Protection must consider how to remove barriers to encourage participation rather than forcing people to participate in a programme.</p><p>Will the Minister of State outline the number of case workers now in place to engage with young people about the Youth Guarantee?  It is vital to have sufficient numbers of case workers in place to deliver on personal progression plans.  When will the Youth Guarantee formally commence?</p></speech>

For the past two hours the social protection committee has discussed the Youth Guarantee.  We have asked many questions and received many answers so I do not intend to thrash out the issue again.  Matters were raised and perhaps those who were not attending may wish to know about them.  Young people need hope and they must know that the Government is working for them and their future so as to keep them in Ireland and avoid emigration.  All they want is help to stay in their own country, and parents and grandparents are asking for the same thing.  The Youth Guarantee is a step in the right direction, although it is only functioning in Ballymun now, and we need to see it rolled out to the rest of the country.</p><p>We put many questions at the meeting to the officials from the Department of Social Protection, including how the Ballymun scheme was working and its success rate.  They told me over 400 young people were on the live register there and a big event took place that involved the young people, employers and education providers.  Only 32 people did not turn up, which means that young people are willing to participate and engage; these people want to work and do not want to be at home all day, playing video games or being depressed because they have no job or money.  It is incumbent on us to provide a process for these people.  There are 99 people now in full-time and sustainable employment, with 193 taking courses in development training and the remainder being engaged with.  It is a good response in Ballymun and, as everybody has said, we must roll it out to the rest of Ireland.  We should not write off young people as lazy because they are not.  Some are involved in local activities on a voluntary basis because they have nothing better to do.  These people want to use their energy and channel it into the community so as to bring about improvement.  There is much good in young people and we must bring it out in them.</p><p>We have debated this issue many times and I have brought up a number of examples.  I raised another example at the committee meeting today and an official assured me it would be considered.  The case involves a young man who left school, possibly without the junior certificate and certainly without a leaving certificate.  He decided to return to education, taking a Springboard course on culinary arts at the Institute of Technology, Tralee.</p> <p>He was delighted with it and he did very well.  He was on work placement for two days a week.  When the course came to an end recently his work experience placement employer offered him summer work to keep him going until he starts his next course, which is an intensive course.  The fees were funded by Bord F&aacute;ilte and the course was provided by the IT in Tralee.  He was in an awful state when he came to see me because if he took up the offer of summer work he would not qualify for the back to education payment as he would have to give up his jobseeker's allowance for the summer.  There was a deterrent to stop him taking up work.  The Youth Guarantee must ensure that young people will not be penalised for doing work during the summer to help to finance them through the winter when they are back in college or finishing their education.  The social welfare officers assured me they would examine the matter but I do not wish it to be solely examined in my area, I wish to ensure that it does not happen anywhere in the country.</p><p>Very few new industrial jobs are being created in Killarney and we survive on tourism and the hospitality sector.  The CERT training course that was in place was great for the hospitality sector but it no longer exists.  We have adequate hotel accommodation and bars in Killarney to provide work placements.  I am probably straying from social protection into education but we should examine the reintroduction of such courses.  Hotels used to look to CERT for employees because they knew they received a good education and experience.</p><p>The delivery of training places in a large urban area is totally different to the delivery of training places in rural areas.  If one is living in the Iveragh Peninsula or the Dingle Peninsula and has to travel to Cork for third level education there is a huge barrier for young people due to the lack of affordability of accommodation and travel.  The back to education allowance or whatever other payment exists would not cover their costs.  If one is on the back to education allowance, one does not qualify for a maintenance grant from the Department of Education and Skills.  We must examine the barriers that exist.</p><p>It has been said that youth unemployment is falling but it is difficult to get the exact figures.  One of the reasons for the decline is due to emigration and another reason is continuing education.  I do not believe my time is up, Acting Chairman.</p></speech>

The Minister can respond to the point on her return.  In Killarney town, which is where I live, it is next to impossible to find accommodation for a family with three children for less than &euro;540 a month.  The cost is &euro;520 for a family with two children and &euro;500 for a family with one child.  It is not possible to find rental accommodation for the amount of money provided by the rent supplement in Killarney.  I invite the Minister or anyone else to find accommodation on Daft or anywhere else for less than the amounts I outlined.  It cannot be found.  We are driving people out into the countryside.  Some people cannot go there and they are desperate.  They do not have a car and they have young children and cannot get into town to schools and for other reasons.  Homelessness is not a big problem in the area but it will become one if we do not revise the cap on rent supplement or incorporate it with the housing assistance payment, HAP, in order that people can take up employment.  At the moment people are deterred from taking up employment because they will lose their rent supplement.  We need to transfer the rent supplement to HAP so that people can pay a differential rent and take up employment.  Thank you, Acting Chairman, for allowing to make the point.  I could speak for another ten minutes on rent supplement.</p></speech>

I wish to follow on from Senator Moloney and speak about housing first.  Part of the problem with NAMA is that its job is to keep up the price of property because it is an asset on the balance sheets of financial institutions.  It would have been far better for the country if the price of property had been allowed to fall.  That would have been a boost to the competitiveness of the country and would certainly have been a boost to those seeking housing.</p><p>There is a contradiction at play.  I am flabbergasted to hear that some local authorities refused properties offered to them by NAMA.  The information was in the newspapers in recent days.  That is an incredible situation.  We know that many of the 80,000 empty houses are in the wrong place but the ghost estates, as the former Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, used to describe them, are assets.  It was the case that some houses in Tuam were sold for &euro;20,000.  The jobs are in Galway, which boomed even during the recession.  People can make the decision to live in Tuam and have a low housing cost and commute to Galway to work.  That is what housing markets do.  I want to see that happen.  I wish the empty houses and the stock in NAMA had been sold because we need to do something to take the pressure off prices in the housing market.  It is contradictory to have pressure on house prices and empty houses within the same commuting distance.  It is not a long commute in any OECD country to travel for 30 minutes.  The fact that the house one would really like is somewhere else should not detract from that.</p><p>We will have to examine social housing provision.  A most interesting report was commissioned by Gay Mitchell when he was Lord Mayor of Dublin as part of the Lord Mayor&rsquo;s commission on social housing.  The late Taoiseach, Garrett FitzGerald, was a member, as was the current city manager, Owen Keegan, and Professor Yvonne Scannell of TCD.  We all support the Minister in confronting the problem of homelessness and the shortage of housing.  The problems identified at the time were that local authority housing cost more than housing on the open market, there was a very high maintenance cost compared to similar open market costs and rents were very low.  This led to a policy of selling local authority housing stock.  Another problem is that too many local authority houses were built together and that created ghetto problems such as educational deprivation.  Let us examine the Garrett FitzGerald proposals to reform social housing so that it does not run into the same problems again.</p><p>Everybody complains about the number of closed shops around the country.  Many of the shops were recently houses and perhaps they could be converted back to housing use.  What is the obstacle?  The buildings no longer have a use as shops because shopping has moved to suburban shopping centres where space is provided for car parking.  There was a scheme to encourage the provision of rental accommodation over shops.  Why not have rental accommodation in buildings that were shops if they have no further commercial function at ground level?  We see dozens of closed-up shops in towns.  Let us see if we can use the property market to deal with the problem being confronted by the Minister.</p><p>The Leader, Senator Cummins, referred to empty local authority houses.  One could ask how on earth the situation developed.  Let us have local authorities that are proactive when a tenant leaves or dies so that houses do not become derelict and have to be repaired at huge cost.  Let us have people moving in much faster than is currently the case and deal with the turnover much quicker than is the case at present.</p><p>I am concerned with the view of housing as an asset rather than as a place to live.  Assets should go back to being stocks and shares.  Gambling on property cost this country dearly.  It was indicated to the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, that we need protection for tenants in buy-to-let accommodation.  They are not the ones who are going bankrupt or defaulting.  When someone buys a buy-to-let property, he or she buys a rent book; he or she does not buy an entitlement to force a tenant out.  If the tenant has kept up the rent payments he or she should not come under pressure.</p> <p>There needs to be some kind of leasing arrangement so they have the fixity of tenure that Charles Stewart Parnell argued for back in the 1880s.  It is incredible that we are having to go back to that idea these days.</p><p>We have over 200,000 fewer people at work now than at the peak.  Most of that burden has been borne by young people.  That is why the schemes the Minister referred to are necessary to tide us over.  Otherwise, we will have in Europe what is known as a lost generation.  I support whatever the Minister can do in keeping people on in school and education.  The economy is reviving but at the high-skills level.  In an ideal world one could ask for a better match between the firms IDA Ireland brings into the country and the skill-sets of the unemployed.  It is very strange that a country with serious financial problems has a development agency that creates jobs which then require people to migrate from other countries to fill those jobs.</p><p>I support the Government&rsquo;s attempts to create flexible labour markets and help us recover from the tsunami that hit the economy in 2008.</p></speech>

I have a routine.  I have something to look forward to, it is different every day, it keeps me on my toes and I am not repeating uselessness every day.  When I was out of a job, one day meant three days.  The courses I did were brilliant and fun and I am working towards buying something.  I have been in full-time work for four months.  I have possibilities and I am happy.  I would not get out of bed when I was on the social because there was nothing to do.  It did not matter if I was getting paid twice as much money on the social, I had nothing to do.  Now I have something to do.</blockquote>To be fair to the Government, it has put in place an extraordinary array of schemes and programmes to get those unemployed for a while back into work, possibilities and hope.  Senator van Turnhout alluded to the urgency to have legislation in place to commence the youth guarantee.  There is also an urgency in how it is communicated.  As I said at the Oireachtas education committee, there is something terribly dull about the method of engagement about the youth guarantee.  I accept it is face-to-face but the message should be got across through television, radio, youth media and, as the Finnish did, through a roadshow.<br />The Council of Europe document on education, youth culture and sport is pretty good.  I hate the word &ldquo;synergy&rdquo; but there is a massive synergy, work well done and cross-purposefulness in this document which outlines multilingualism, quality assurance of education and training, cross-border education, media literacy, entrepreneurship and the whole area of arts and language, culture and heritage.  These should all be major elements in the youth guarantee.  Jobs are not only in business but in culture and the arts.  We tend to leave that area out or not connect it too well or readily to employment opportunities.  The term &ldquo;entrepreneurship&rdquo; rolls off our tongues but terms such &ldquo;arts&rdquo;, &ldquo;music&rdquo;, &ldquo;theatre&rdquo;, &ldquo;vocality&rdquo; or &ldquo;auracy&rdquo; do not.  One cannot be an entrepreneur unless one can discuss what one wants and how one wants it.  There is interesting cross-purposefulness in this document and the youth guarantee.<br />There is an urgency to introduce legislation for the youth guarantee.  Much money has been spent on these job activation courses.  We need to examine them from every single angle.  The communication of the schemes available is dull and uninteresting.  I congratulate the Minister, however, on the work done and the effort put in by her Department to create some kind of possibility, hope, education and training for young people, be they coming out of university or long-time unemployment.  Without our young people, we are not a society.  They are our future and are most important.  I cannot understand why the Chamber is not full for this debate.  It is most important for Ireland that our young people have hope, possibilities, connection, education and feel they can get up in the morning, doing what Mr. Brophy said in a small way by going to work so they feel they are making some contribution.  Even when there is work, young people will take work.  It is a myth that nobody wanted to work when we were in the throes of having money thrown at us.  People still wanted to work then because they want to be connected.  I was in Ballymun for 25 years and never met a young person who did not want to work.</p></speech>

As Senator O&rsquo;Donnell said, youth employment is an important debate and, as they will lead the country in the future, it is imperative we ensure they are not led into the rut of long-term unemployment.  Surveys have shown that it is more difficult to get the long-term unemployed back into the jobs market.  I also congratulate the Minister on spearheading the youth guarantee initiative through the European Parliament when we held the EU Presidency.  Ireland made it a priority because we recognised that our youth are our most valuable asset and that we must ensure we work for and with them.</p><p>Youth unemployment is not just an Irish problem but an EU-wide one.  The youth guarantee is a key proposal to turn the tide on youth unemployment and bring young people back into employment through continuing education, apprenticeship or traineeship.  Earlier, a Senator asked when the guarantee will formally commence.  EU Ministers agreed a &euro;6 billion youth fund initiative to target the most affected regions to get young people back to work.  This funding is most welcome as part of the 2014-2020 multi-annual financial framework.</p> <p>Prolonged unemployment is devastating.  Young people lose their self-confidence, self-esteem and self-worth in all aspects of life and it sometimes leads to suicide.  The Department of Social Protection is tackling the social problems arising from unemployment in other areas.</p><p>The youth guarantee scheme has been in place in Sweden, Finland and Austria for a few years and evaluations of it in Finland indicated that it has reduced youth unemployment and inactivity.  Many Senators have spoken about how soul-destroying inactivity is for youth.  It is estimated in Sweden that 46% of participants in the youth guarantee scheme have benefited from the scheme.  The Swedish and Finnish schemes were found to be more effective for young people who are new to the labour market than for those who are long-term unemployed.  As the old saying goes &quot;get them early . . .&quot;  .  The same applies to the youth guarantee scheme, as surveys in Finland have shown.  If the participants had been unemployed for four months the chances of success went down for each month of unemployment after that.  This will have to be addressed and the Minister will have to keep an eye on it when the scheme is fully implemented.</p><p>When the scheme is implemented it is intended that it will contribute to three out of the five Europe 2020 targets: reducing the extent of early school-leaving, lifting people out of poverty and social inclusion, as well as increasing the employment rate.  Lifting people out of poverty and social exclusion is a major factor.  We need to ensure that we get this on the road as quickly as possible.  Part of it is on the road but the youth guarantee scheme when implemented fully will add to the initiatives the Minister has outlined, with the additional money for the programmes to help young unemployed persons and to keep jobseekers close to the labour market.</p><p>On the rent supplement scheme, Senator Moloney spoke about Killarney but it is trotting after Dublin where rents are increasing so much that people cannot afford them.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government with responsibility for housing, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, is reconsidering the scheme.  Will the Minister explain how this will be rectified?  I know about the housing plan to be produced next month, the housing construction programme and the &euro;68 million announced last month for local authorities to upgrade houses that are not in use and bring them back into use soon. </p></speech>

The volume of contributions on the youth guarantee shows that it almost merits another day of discussion.  Unfortunately, rent supplement is not getting the attention it deserves.</p><p>I will raise some issues that young people have mentioned to me and some that arose at a European Commission conference in Brussels last April.  The European Youth Forum asked if there will be additional opportunities for young people to get back into the system if their first chance fails.  There are not enough case workers in the system.  How realistic is it to say there will be 100% meaningful engagement with long-term unemployed youths when the extra supports they need, such as career guidance, may not be available?</p><p>Other issues beyond the availability of places on courses and placements need to be addressed.  I and others working in the youth sector are worried about the compulsion and penalties attached to the JobBridge scheme for disadvantaged youths.  The Senators who attended the meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection this morning have referred to the discussion there.  We were told there that the scheme is mandatory when the case worker decides the person would benefit.  Will that intensive effort be put into the personal plan to ensure it benefits the person?  I am concerned about the process and how to make sure those positions are completely suited to the young people involved.  The Pathways to Work plan mentions work preparation courses prior to commencement.  The committee was told that this scheme operates on a four day week and the fifth day is for training.  What kind of training will be provided?  What shape will these courses take?</p><p>Having young people with skills but no jobs is a big problem.  The youth guarantee should not focus on what happens at the end of compulsory education.  It then falls under the remit of the Minister for Education and Skills.  What work will be done in schools to pre-empt early school-leavers from falling into the category of not being in employment or education?</p><p>At the conference in Brussels we heard that this is the most certified, not necessarily the most educated, generation.  What monitoring is there of the education and training aspects of the guarantee to ensure that the personal and professional development path participants pursue allows them reach their potential?  What role or weight is being given to the informal learning aspect of the youth guarantee plan?  The youth organisations I have met stressed the importance of informal learning and the skills one may acquire prior to entering a course or getting certification from the Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC, or the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, HETAC.  I was advised there was a bilateral meeting in February on the plan.  If that is true could the Minister give us an update on it?  How will the youth guarantee feed into the country specific recommendations on the semester process and what indicators will have to be reported on?</p><p>We heard at the committee meeting today, and the Disability Federation of Ireland has also raised the point, that the youth guarantee does not cover young people on disability allowance or in receipt of the one-parent family payment.  The committee was advised that the funding is specifically aimed at the unemployed group.  I think there is an International Labour Organization, ILO, classification for that.  Can the Minister give us some more information on that and say whether those people are definitively excluded from education, training or a placement on the youth guarantee?  The recommendation of the Council of the European Union on the youth guarantee refers to &quot;all young people&quot;.  I have spoken before about the treatment of young people who are not on the live register and do not have a relationship with public employment services.  Stefano Scarpetta, the director of employment, labour and social affairs at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, raised that issue at the Commission conference last April.</p><p>It would be remiss of me not to mention the role of youth organisations.</p> <p>They showed positive discrimination.  Today was the first I heard of that so I have many questions about it.  Positive discrimination may be dealt with but I will also touch on the issue of negative discrimination and cutting the jobseeker's allowance for young people just because of their age.  Perhaps it could be dealt with or the measure could be reversed in the next budget.  There may be legislation to positively discriminate against young people but should we remove negative barriers first?</p></speech>

I hope when she becomes leader of the Labour Party, she might address all of these with her Cabinet colleagues.</p><p>There are some counties where the rent caps are far too low and as a result, many people cannot acquire proper accommodation, ending up either in substandard accommodation to meet the rent cap or subsidising rent to a greater degree by paying a landlord extra money under the counter so they can get the accommodation.  We must consider that issue.  When people find themselves in substandard accommodation - God knows we have plenty of it - they may not qualify at any stage for the rental accommodation scheme because a council would deem the property unsuitable.</p><p>We have been on the campaign trail for the past number of months and I found it strange that there was an amount of vacated local authority houses in my area.  I asked why this happens and the answer is that local authority rents are too high.  If a person earns &euro;500 per week, &euro;100 would be paid to the county council but at the same time a person can go to the private rented sector and get a house for &euro;80 per week; the rent cap appropriate to the person may be less than &euro;70.  The issue needs to be dealt with on a cross-departmental basis.</p><p>I welcome the youth guarantee.  There are many unemployed people who do not get the dole because they live with parents, so will they be part of the youth guarantee scheme?  I met a man I know this morning on the way to work.  He is in his 60s and he cannot get into a community employment scheme because he is not in receipt of the dole as his wife has a job.  I feel sorry for such people because they are all willing to work, and there are many more unemployed people than is reflected in the register.</p><p>I have always had an issue with the prerequisite of going on the housing list in order to get rent allowance.  That list is inflated and thousands of people on it are not seeking local authority housing.  We get hammered by the Opposition when it points out the number of people on the housing list but thousands of those people do not want local authority housing and are only on the list to qualify for rent allowance.</p><p>Another issue was brought to my attention, although it is not really the responsibility of the Minister.  It must be considered nonetheless.  A lady is on the rental accommodation scheme and has worked in a service industry in Ballaghaderreen for years, although she is currently unemployed.  There is no work for her in the town and she is a single mother with a 17-year-old child who she hopes will next year go to college in Galway.  She tried to get a transfer from the Roscommon local authority district to Galway so she could get work and put her child into college there.  She was told the only way she can be considered by Galway County Council for the rental accommodation scheme is if she presents to the authority as homeless.  Such issues must be dealt with and there must be a policy between local authorities to accommodate transfers of people who are genuinely seeking work.  This girl will never work again unless she can go to a town where work is available.  I thank the Minister for listening.</p></speech>

There is a decreasing rate of youth unemployment, which is fantastic.  One of the difficulties is that areas like retail and entry-level jobs dry up in a recession, so as the economy recovers, some of those sectors again have openings and young people can get such entry-level jobs.  Employers have an enormous role to play and unless employers in Ireland see themselves as part of the system responsible for including young people in getting back to work, we will not get many people back in employment.</p><p>Unlike the countries referenced by many people, such as Finland, Austria and Germany, our society tends to have the understandable singular focus on celebrating people who achieve a third level education place.</p></speech>

In other words we lack a "dual" system.  It is really important to understand that this is a cultural shift to include young people and to have very limited social acceptance of young people being unemployed during what are potentially their most creative developmental years.  It is in this time they transition from being teenagers to becoming young adults, and it is important we understand that.</p><p>Last year I set up a labour market council consisting of representatives of a series of very prominent employers, chaired by Mr. Martin Murphy from HP and including big companies in Ireland, ranging from Tesco to Glanbia.  The council includes many labour market economists, including the former deputy secretary general of the OECD, Mr. John Martin, who people like Senator Barrett would know well.  Companies now put up posters in supermarkets, for example, outlining where food is sourced, and I want to see posters in supermarkets indicating they employ young local people and give them a chance.  In fairness to many big supermarkets, particularly those based heavily in Ireland, that has begun to happen, partly through the labour market forum and also through Feeding Ireland's Future, an initiative we started last autumn.  To quote a clich&eacute;, one can go from the farm to the fork in employment terms for Ireland and find a significant number of people working in the area.</p><p>Some of the larger supermarkets employ as many as 15,000 people, and in the course of a year there can be vacancies.  Employers must select suitable employees and in the course of a year, we can ensure those vacancies or a proportion thereof go to young unemployed people or other unemployed people.  This approach starts with young people but it facilitates teaching and learning in the Department about all unemployed people.  We need a cultural shift so that when employers have ten vacancies, they will call the local Intreo office to outline how they want to recruit ten people with a particular profile.  With the new Intreo offices we have improved information technology and we can source the kind of people these employers want and send them to interview.  It is really important for people to understand that.</p> <p>This is across all of society.  It includes all of us, including people who are public representatives, but in particular employers.  People sometimes refer to the turnover or churn on the live register.  The important point, as Senator Mooney indicated, is that 50% of young people leave the live register after six months.  They do not necessarily need that much help.  The people who are hard to reach are those who perhaps had a poor experience in school, and in some cases quit school entirely at 16.  They could be longing for a traineeship or apprenticeship where they will work and learn at the same time.  Many of my family work in the building trade.  Young men in particular who want to work in the building trade do not want to be corralled inside a schoolroom, as they would see it.  After they reach 17 or 18 they want to be out working.  Everyone present knows such young people.  We just have to change our attitude.  Apprenticeships related to the motor trade are much sought after by young people, particularly young men.  We must encourage that and see it as being as valuable a contribution to employment, work and services in Ireland as a career in IT.  Not everyone wants to be a software engineer.</p><p>I accept the point made by Senators on the arts, heritage and the environment.</p></speech>

As this country had high youth unemployment &ndash; it has since fallen &ndash; when the agreement was brokered at the Heads of State meeting, it was decided that the first two years would be front-loaded because in order to improve economic activity in the country we do not want to wait until the recovery has taken more hold, we want to do it now.</p><p>I have been to see the Ballymun pilot project four or five times.  A meeting was held last week with Commissioner Andor.  People in Senator Reilly&rsquo;s party are very critical of JobBridge, notwithstanding that party members keep sending me questions on how to expand the scheme, including her party leader.  At local level when young people or their parents or relatives say they would like a JobBridge internship, representatives are anxious to facilitate them.  I recall one young man at the meeting said he thought doing a CV was, to paraphrase him, rubbish.  He was more forthcoming than that.  He did not realise that the CV counted if one went to an interview.  He had received a very good education but he thought a job would just come.  As time passed and the job did not come when he got involved with the Ballymun pilot scheme he realised that CVs and presentation do matter.  He now has an internship with a law firm.  He commented on the positivity in the room.</p><p>Another young man wants to work and develop his own business as a barber and hairdresser.  He got an opportunity to find work experience through the internship and he was very hopeful of getting proper training and an apprenticeship and going on to set up his own business.  Another young man was interested in sport.  Interestingly, he wanted to set up his own gym and to work with young people.  There was an air of positivity in the room.  I went to Tesco, for instance, which is now running a scheme around the country, thanks to the labour market council.  To date, it is rolled out in six different areas.  Tesco is going to local Intreo offices to recruit young people, by and large under the age of 22, in conjunction with the local education and training board, to do a FETAC level 4 retail and warehouse qualification.  The trainees then have certification for the retail industry and can get employment.  It is a very good combination.</p><p>I attended initial interviews in Cabra some time ago.  As someone who worked in third level for a long time &ndash; I really like students and young people &ndash; it was a familiar scene with people wearing hoodies sitting with their eyes downcast, looking at their feet wondering who I was, what was going on and when they would get out of there.  Many of them took up the places and the course was run by Col&aacute;iste Dh&uacute;laig.  Senator Barrett, as a fellow educator-----</p></speech>

I went to a graduation ceremony some months later and one would not believe the difference.  The young people were wearing very nice shirts and chinos.  Their heads were up and they were making contact and talking with friends on the course which was run in conjunction with Col&aacute;iste Dh&uacute;laig.  Many of them were beginning to set out on the road to work.</p><p>The scheme is about giving people confidence and restoring their self esteem.  The critical element is to have a strong working relationship between the education and training boards and the Intreo offices.  We have begun to roll out the first of the employer forums around the country.  In addition to Ballymun I launched one recently with a number of employers in Carlow and Blanchardstown.  The aim is essentially to include unemployed people, not just those below a specific age, in the process.</p><p>I spoke recently to someone who has a garden centre and who is employing people from some of the colleges.  They said to me that when someone comes for an interview, regardless of the qualifications they have, they put out a box of plants and ask them to name 20 common plants.  Even if they have a degree in horticulture, if they cannot relate to business they will not be high on the list of those who are recruited.  What employers require is practical people.  Customer service is important in retail as well as enthusiasm for the customer and the product being sold.</p><p>A question was asked about the mandatory nature of the scheme.  I wish to outline what is envisaged.  This is a first for Ireland and for many countries in the EU.  It is intended that the youth guarantee will include a large amount of challenging, nudging, talking to and cajoling young people to identify where they would like to work, what they would like to do and whether they would like to get involved in training and education.  I am aware that some Members are very familiar with the system.  It often takes a while for people to open up because it is a different forum to being unemployed or in a structured situation at school.  The aim is to try to get people to develop their own life plan.  That is especially true for young people who are not in education, training or employment, the so-called NEETs.</p> <p>This is an exciting and positive development but it will take time.  Professor Blanchflower, the world-renowned economist with regard to youth unemployment, and John Martin, the deputy secretary of the OECD who is Irish, both state if one is unemployed for a long spell early in one's life, almost certainly throughout the rest of one's life one risks having lower earnings than those who did not have this experience and one risks having more frequent spells of unemployment.  They state this is particularly the case for men.  We want to avoid this in Ireland.</p><p>With regard to the scheme being mandatory, there is no way to force an employer to take somebody he or she feels is not good for the business or organisation.  We try to encourage and make the people job ready, mentor them about what may be expected from them with regard to employment, and perhaps mentor the employer so there are realistic expectations about the young person.</p><p>We are also pioneering the disability activation scheme in the BMW region for young people with either an intellectual or physical disability.  We see exactly the same thing as we see in the Ballymun project; knowledge and information is required on what the person would like to be involved in and can be involved in, and on the employment opportunities.  It involves working to prepare the young person for these opportunities and to prepare the employer for their specific responses and the responsibilities they may have towards the young employee.  It also seeks to include a fairly significant developmental element.  Everybody here had to start in a first job and most of us would not have been brilliant.  We probably got in, kept quiet and gradually picked up experience of how to deal with various tasks.  It will be mandatory only where we have complete refusal to engage.  When there is complete refusal to engage, it may be because people are too busy doing other things.  If they are good luck to them, but society should not countenance a situation where somebody will stay unemployed indefinitely.</p><p>Without a doubt the biggest difficulty with rent supplement is supply.  There are issues about rental costs but it is very simple to take the Dublin area, where it is a fact that several years ago there was three to five times as much supply as there is now.  We had a housing market which was in a bubble and there were many vacant units and buy to lets, many of them owned by fairly amateur landlords.  Much of this supply has simply dried up.  Some time in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the local authorities increasingly got out of social housing.  The only significant type of social housing among most local authorities was via housing associations in conjunction with the local authority and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Since there was no availability of rental properties, increasingly people saw rent supplement as a solution and, to be honest, it is not.  In many cases in Ireland we have very short-term leases of one year.  If one is bringing up a family or living in a particular area over a long period of time, one needs to develop security of tenure and social housing does this.  We also need an affordable housing approach, particularly for young couples where both are working but they do not have enough money to fund a housing mortgage themselves.  They could work in co-operation with local or central government through schemes with partial renting and purchase.  Many Senators know this has been very successful in the past and it should be examined.</p><p>Senator Kelly mentioned the problem of empty houses and people being reluctant to take local authority houses for a variety of reasons.  In Dublin, one can see significant numbers of boarded up apartments, flats and houses in local authority areas.  One can see local authority areas which have been refurbished but when a vacancy arises, it is boarded up.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, has set out to identify the numbers.  Senator Maloney spoke with concern about the situation in Killarney.  I do not know about Killarney but certainly in Dublin, and to a lesser extent in Cork, a significant numbers of properties are boarded up.  When a local authority tenant leaves a house or flat, it is often boarded up and it can remain boarded up and vacant for anything up to a year, 18 months or two years.  If three or four flats in the one block are boarded up, it very quickly leads to an enhanced risk of anti-social behaviour and a general decline in the standards of the entire block, and flats for which people would give their eye teeth are left lying idle.  Local authorities state this is how the system works with regard to refurbishing their housing stock.  I genuinely think the system has to change.  When a vacancy arises a family should be earmarked for it and should be ready to be moved into the vacancy as soon as the existing tenant has left.  This is very important.</p><p>My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, has secured quite a significant amount of funding from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, to begin this process.  If we can end this practice of local authority houses and flats being boarded up, we can bring significant numbers of accommodation units back into circulation.  The number runs to well over 1,000.  Some of them have been boarded up for so long that they require significant refurbishment; for others, this is not so much the case.  If the leaving tenant can leave the property in a good state, all that is required in many cases is an intensive clean and a paint job.  However, this is not what has come to be the practice.  What has come to be the practice, particularly in some parts of Dublin including my constituency, is a tendency to board it up.  Then it goes into a cycle of waiting a number of months until a small contractor is available to do refurbishment work.  In this period there is often a severe deterioration of the quality of the neighbours' environment due to the boarded-up accommodation attracting anti-social behaviour.</p><p>To return to Senator Moloney's comments on Killarney, one of the problems there is a lack of development of social housing in recent years and the seasonal element to rented accommodation due to the large tourism market.  I will bring the Senator's comments to the attention of the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.</p></speech>

Social protection accounts, through rent supplement, for about 30% of the housing rental market nationally.  Last year we raised rents, particularly in the Dublin area but in other areas of tight supply, by about 9% which was a very significant increase compared, for instance, with the rate of inflation.  As a consequence the increase was absorbed within a month or two.</p><p>We have to be concerned about whether such increases cause and put upward rent pressure on people in low-paid employment who are renting and, therefore, we act to increase rents.  For people at work who pay their own rent or retired people in rented accommodation, social protection just adds to the pressure of rent increases.  That is a very delicate balancing act.  </p><p>With regard to Killarney and other areas, it is critical to increase supply.  If we can do so then we will relieve the pressure, which there really is, to find scarce accommodation of a suitable kind.</p><p>With regard to RAS, as people will know local authority standards are understandably high.  Often a property that may be rented privately will not be accepted by the local authority.  I refer to the standards of  suitability necessary to qualify for the RAS scheme and that is a fact.</p></speech>

The company is a seaweed processing factory based in Kilkieran, Connemara.  We have been told by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta that it was sold to a Canadian company.  We wish the new company well and have no issue with the purchase whatsoever.</p><p>We have an issue with the licensing regime.  My understanding is that the licence regime that covers the process is based on the 1933 Foreshore Act.  The legislation states that the State owns the seaweed on our shores and, technically, the people who want to cut seaweed require a licence.  It appears to us that the law has not been implemented to the letter until recently.  However, there is a tradition, certainly in places like Connemara where I am from, for people to have a stripe or space on the shore to cut seaweed and sell it to the factory.  Recently we have become aware that the National Parks and Wildlife Service, I think, wrote to at least one seaweed cutter informing him that he needed a licence if he wanted to continue cutting seaweed.  On foot of that we noticed that a number of private companies had applied for a licence to gain the right to harvest seaweed along the foreshore from Kerry to Donegal.</p><p>We also know of a licence application that covers the area from Belmullet to Clare.  Local seaweed cutters are quite concerned about the issue and are worried that it may affect their rights to cut and sell seaweed to the companies that operate in the industry.  Before Arramara Teoranta was sold to Acadian Seaplants it applied for a licence for the area.  A number of very large public meetings have been held to discuss the matter where the seaweed cutters, along with many public representative, expressed their concerns.  The local seaweed cutters stated that they would like an input into the resource and its management.  They are very concerned about sustainably managing the resource.  They are also concerned that the seaweed is cut well, that the best is made of it and that they can make a living.  There is a concern that if one company receives a licence it would have a monopoly and thus dictate the terms such as the times for cutting and the price.  In addition, if it was not happy with a certain cutter it could put somebody else on his or her stripe of seaweed and get him or her to do the work.  A number of smaller companies that work in the industry are very concerned that they will be squeezed out of the business.  </p><p>My understanding is that these licence applications must go before a sub-committee in the Department, the sub-committee then makes a recommendation to the Minister and then the Minister has the responsibility of signing off or granting a licence to the cutters, company or the people who applied.  I ask that none of the licences be granted until there is full public consultation with the seaweed cutters and people involved in the local communities.  This is necessary to see if this is the best model and the most sustainable way of maintaining the industry.  Locally, the seaweed cutters have suggested that they would prefer a fair trade scenario where a co-op or organisation, comprising the seaweed cutters, was set up and would apply for a licence.  If a licence was granted they would be able to negotiate with a number of different players in the industry to get the best possible terms and conditions for them and their workers.  That is my question for the Minister of State and I hope she will look favourably on the request. </p></speech>

At the outset I want to stress that foreshore licence applications are subject to a public consultation process, during which comments can be submitted to my Department.  A number of licence applications for seaweed harvesting have been received by the Department and are currently under assessment.  These applications vary considerably.  They are made by both individual and commercial harvesters.  Some have applied for a licence to harvest specific types of seaweed in a single or a couple of adjoining bays while other applications extend over a large area of coastline.  The species and amounts of seaweed proposed to be harvested are also varied, ranging from very small quantities of Carrageen Moss to significant volumes of ascophyllum nodosum.  End use applications range from artisan food products to animal health products to high grade fertiliser.<br />I urge people with a particular interest in, or a tradition of involvement with, seaweed harvesting to use the opportunity afforded by the public consultation process to make their views on the applications known to my Department on the applications in question.  These consultations are expected to begin very shortly.  They will be advertised in the local and national press and published on my Department's website.  I am aware of the interest that some applications have attracted and of the one referred to by the Senator.  My Department is in the process of making all applications that are deemed complete available on my Department's website and is issuing instructions to applicants on the public consultation procedures.  Given the level of interest in these applications, I have decided to extend the consultation period from 21 working days to 30 working days.<br />All applications will be assessed in the context of the relevant regulatory framework, including any obligations that may arise under the EU Birds and Habitats Directives.  Following the conclusion of that assessment and the recommendations of the marine licence vetting committee - which I think is the committee that the Senator referred to - and my Department, I will be in a position to make determinations on the applications.<br />It is important to remember that living seaweed acts as an important habitat for marine and coastal species as well as having economic potential.  In this context, the need to ensure sustainable exploitation of this valuable resource through the regulation of seaweed harvesting under the Foreshore Act 1933 is vital.  This is the focus of my Department's efforts.<br />I am sure that Senators will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment directly on any specific application that will ultimately come before me for determination.  However, any established rights in law will not be interfered with.  My Department is seeking legal advice on the interaction of folio rights with the Foreshore Act and the European Communities (Birds and Habitats) Regulations 2011.</p> <p>My Department is seeking legal advice on the interaction of folio rights with the Foreshore Act and the European Communities (Birds and Habitats) Regulations 2011.  In addition, I will seek to definitively clarify the position on traditional and appurtenant rights.  It must be remembered, however, that the majority of foreshore is in State ownership and that the associated seaweed is also, therefore, owned by the State.</p><p>As I previously advised the House, the specific issue of seaweed harvesting licensing is currently under review in the context of the forthcoming maritime area and foreshore (amendment) Bill.</p></speech>
