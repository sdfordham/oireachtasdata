It seems that a new Labour Party driven policy within the Government is dictating that provisions required for the assistance of communities throughout the country be ignored.</p> <p>One would have assumed the Cabinet meeting yesterday dealt with the crisis in Irish Water, but instead, what has emerged from the meeting is the frustration of the Minister.  It seems that a local authority which has already cut its staff by one third, had its central funding cut by 50% and has had to cut its services substantially now has a gun to its head and has been told it will be abolished and will get no assistance from central government if it cannot overcome its debt situation over the next two weeks.  This is totally unacceptable.</p><p>At a time when debate on Irish Water is taking place throughout the country but Labour Party Members of Government are not available to participate in that debate, one wonders why they should be so quick to take to the airwaves and put the gun to the heads of the people on smaller local authorities such as Sligo.</p></speech>

It seems that following the Cabinet meeting yesterday, at which it is alleged the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, had quite a rant in frustration about Irish Water, he has taken that frustration out - through his fellow party member, our colleague Senator Susan O'Keeffe - on the regional airwaves today, and following a meeting held in secret last night for Government Members of the Oireachtas, this gun has been placed at the head of a local authority.</p><p>We will vote today for the Minister to explain this, and again tomorrow if he is not available today.  The local authorities of small counties of Ireland, unlike the larger local authorities with &euro;100 million or more on deposit, as opposed to debt, following the centralising policies of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, will not stand by and let the Labour Party do to them what the Government has allowed Brussels do to the Irish people.</p></speech>

We are in a serious position.  The Minister has said he wants a solution to the finance issue in Sligo County Council.  I have made clear that I believe we need a collaborative and coherent response to the debts of Sligo County Council.  I do not believe we need a deadline, although I know why the deadline is in place.  It is because that is when the council is due to meet to discuss the budgets.  However, I do not believe that discussion will provide a coherent, collaborative and cogent response to the difficulties facing Sligo County Council.  I made my position clear in public this morning and I do so again now.</p><p>It is a difficult position when a council faces the kind of debt faced by Sligo County Council.  Nobody in this Chamber, not even Senator MacSharry, would approve of any council carrying that kind of debt.  However, there should be no rushing into a quick fix for a council that has had such tough times, is central to the activity of the county and puts in time and effort to try to build the county for a sustainable future.  If, as we now find, there is a more positive approach in Sligo and people are working as hard as possible to try to build a future for the county, pulling the house down, particularly in short order, is not the correct approach.</p><p>I know the Minister is not intent on abolishing Sligo County Council, and Senator MacSharry knows that well.</p></speech>

This Bill refers to the Royal College of Surgeons and its being awarded university status outside of but not inside Ireland.  However, the name of the Royal College of Surgeons is not mentioned anywhere in the Bill, and it was not mentioned in our previous debate.  I realise that when we move to that business, those who are not particularly interested in it will move off to attend committees or be elsewhere.  In this era of openness, transparency and accountability, not to refer in legislation to an organisation that is the beneficiary of that legislation strikes me as rather strange.

Either he wants to abolish it or he does not.  It is as simple as that.  I understand that the Minister is, ironically, in Swords, County Dublin, this morning.  Some 30 garda&iacute; have closed off North Street in Swords to allow him to speak at a conference on housing.  This is an example of the waste of Garda resources that is occurring at present in areas like Swords, where Garda numbers have decreased by more than 25% in the last three years.  I do not necessarily lay the blame for this at anybody's feet.  The Taoiseach said yesterday that he does not need a corridor of garda&iacute; to protect him.  I wonder why the Minister, Deputy Kelly, needs such protection.  Is this the correct use of Garda resources?</p><p>A debate is taking place in the D&aacute;il over yesterday and today on the fair deal nursing home scheme and the pressure it is experiencing.  I ask the Leader to arrange a specific debate in the Seanad on this issue.  The numbers waiting in the Dublin region have increased by 300% in less than one year.  This Government removed &euro;23 million of funding from the scheme and waiting times have increased to an average of 15 weeks.  These are senior citizens who are assessed as requiring nursing home care.  The Government has taken &euro;23 million out of the scheme and waiting lists have gone through the roof.  As of yesterday, more than 2,541 people were waiting 15 weeks or more for funding under the fair deal scheme.  This is something we could address in the Seanad.  The debate in the D&aacute;il is worthwhile but we should also address this issue.  If we are concerned about our senior citizens, surely they should be a priority and the &euro;23 million taken out of the scheme should be reinstated immediately.</p></speech>

I thank the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate for its ground breaking and comprehensive report.  Most rank and file garda&iacute; will welcome the report because they are doing their best in systems that have let them down.  There is now a realisation, based on the recommendations of the inspectorate's report, that the systems have to be fixed.  Much that is positive in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has happened in the last six months.  The Acting Garda Commissioner is doing a very good job, and the new Minister for Justice and Equality is extremely committed to reforming the Garda.  Her brief is specific, and the transfer of the defence portfolio to a different Minister has facilitated her in focusing on implementing the necessary reforms.</p><p>Now that we have the report, it is time we moved to put the new systems in place.  I ask the Leader to recommend to the Minister that every single recommendation in the report be implemented.  It is welcome that a Cabinet sub-committee and other structures have been put in place to start the process of implementing the recommendations.  To that effect, it would be useful if the Leader could arrange a debate with the Minister on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate's report.  That would give her an opportunity to update the House on the timeline for implementation of these recommendations.  It would also give us an opportunity for a full debate on the issue of Garda reform.</p><p>The Garda is an important pillar of society.  The rank and file do a phenomenal job and it is our responsibility as parliamentarians to ensure reform of the systems is kept at the top of the political agenda.  A number of Members of this House were nominated by the Garda Representative Association.  I am sure they will be delighted to participate in such a debate and I ask the Leader to facilitate one at an early opportunity.</p></speech>

The leader of the industry stated recently that confidence has never been so low in the sector.  Senator Darragh O'Brien recently raised the huge crisis for the pension schemes in Dublin Airport Authority and Aer Lingus but I do not think we have debated the wider issue of pensions recently.  I suggest it is time to have a debate on what is clearly a crisis.</p><p>The industry feels threatened and believes it will need to start earning trust very quickly if it is to regain that trust.  In the region of &euro;2 billion has been taken out of pension schemes.  People who saved all their lives for their pensions are suddenly finding they cannot retire on the expected basis.  In regard to ensuring people have saved enough, usually self-employed people have to do this themselves.  Concerns have been expressed that the Government is not valuing the self-employed, who are building industry and jobs in Ireland.  The budget is almost telling people to stay in their safe and secure 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. jobs rather than go out to start their own businesses.  This Government does not appear to recognise the benefits brought by self-employed people.  We have to do something about that.</p><p>Many people are looking for jobs in Ireland but many employers are looking for people with the skills they want.  France recently introduced the teaching of computer coding at primary level.  Students younger than ten years of age are being taught computer coding.  A young man in Ireland, James Whelan, has set up an organisation to facilitate such activities worldwide and it has been very successful.  It is a reminder that we have to do something about the stresses and strains on primary schools.  I do not understand why teachers are so opposed to continuous assessment, even though the Minister for Education and Skills is proposing that only 40% of assessments will be based on continuous assessment.  In other countries teachers are crying out to be allowed to assess their pupils.</p></speech>

This is a supplementary sum on top of the money that has already been allocated for homelessness in Dublin.  Approximately 300 families are currently in emergency accommodation in Dublin, of whom 160 are living in hotels.  The tenancies sustainment protocol, which was developed by the four Dublin local authorities and is operated by Threshold, has had 942 families at immediate risk of homelessness coming to its service.  There is no doubt that homelessness in the Dublin region is at critical proportions.</p><p>It is rather sad that much of this difficulty has been brought about because the level of rent supplement paid in the Dublin region is inadequate to cover the cost of accommodation.  It is ironic that we have saved &euro;170 million on the rent supplement budget in the Department of Social Protection since 2010 but are now paying over and above the odds to accommodate families in hotels instead of proper housing.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Social Protection into the House at an early opportunity to allow her to outline to the House her plans for reviewing the rent supplement system.  It is not acceptable that people are losing their homes because the level of rent supplement paid in this city is inadequate.</p></speech>

It is a one-sided report.  I note the comments by the Acting Garda Commissioner, Noir&iacute;n O'Sullivan, that the men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are focused on providing a police service of which the people of Ireland can be proud.  I am certainly proud of the Garda.  It is an unarmed force and its members have laid down their lives to protect Irish citizens against subversive elements since the foundation of the State.  We remember Jerry McCabe who in 1996 gave up his life in Adare for this country.  We remember Garda Morley and Garda Byrne in County Roscommon, and Garda Dick Fallon.</p> <p>I could go through a list of heroes whose contributions should be recognised.  The Garda Inspectorate was not allowed to advise the Government on the optimum strength of the Garda force or study what would be the required numbers in a country with a population of 4.5 million.  It was told not to make recommendations on this issue as to do so could embarrass the Government.  Having reduced the size of the force from 14,500 to 12,000 and mothballed the Garda training college in Templemore for three years, the Government expects a force of 12,000 to carry out the same work as a force of 14,500.  Could one expect the Garda Inspectorate to make findings other than those made in its report?  The Garda traffic corps has been reduced in strength from 1,200 members to 800.  Senior garda&iacute;, the most experienced members of the force, have been given early retirement and bought out by a Government which expects garda&iacute; to be experienced.  The Government has closed down Garda stations all over the country and garda&iacute; do not even have official e-mail addresses.  The Garda fleet has deteriorated to such an extent that garda&iacute; are forced to use what can only be described as bangers.  It is no surprise, therefore, that the Garda Inspectorate has produced a report of this nature on a force that has been neglected and ignored by the Government.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has performed excellent work on behalf of the State.  The Government may gloat over this report, but I am very proud of garda&iacute; and want to give their side of the story.</p></speech>

Mr. Ryan has done the State some service.  It is wrong to assume, as may have been the case in the past week, that nothing much came of his reports or that they were downplayed.  We know that everything he did was referred to the appropriate authorities at the relevant time.  The Revenue Commissioners have admitted that Mr. Ryan's work and the reports and material he provided led them to several cases which they successfully pursued against former Ansbacher account holders.  These investigations generated in excess of &euro;112 million for the Exchequer and six cases remain outstanding.  I assume this income is separate from moneys that flowed to Revenue from the amnesty of 1993 which some of the individuals in question appear to have legitimately pursued prior to the Ansbacher investigation.  We should welcome the new whistleblower legislation and accord to Mr. Ryan the acknowledgement he is due for his work.  I have no doubt that we will hear more about the matter.</p></speech>

I hope this problem will be rectified in the near future.  Both sides have moved a considerable distance and I hope they will move the rest of the way.</p><p>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on a scandal in the banking system.  It appears a small number of mortgage holders, primarily those aged in their 40s and over who bought houses 15 years ago or thereabouts, are carrying the burden of returning the banks to profitability by paying interest rates that are as much as 4.2% higher than the rates paid by those with tracker mortgages.  The overall cost of this discrepancy to the mortgage holder can be as much as &euro;650 per month in repayments, which is a scandal.  We must remember that all those who are paying mortgages, irrespective of when they took them out, are subject to pay cuts, tax increases, property taxes and water charges.  One section of society is, if one likes, carrying the banking system on its shoulders, while another pays tracker rates.  I am not arguing that the latter group is doing anything wrong.  Tracker mortgages were a marketing ploy that worked well.  However, we must act now to correct this problem, given that, as I stated, the difference in the interest rate paid by the holder of a tracker mortgage and the holder of a variable rate mortgage can be as high as 4.2%.  I would appreciate it if the Leader were to arrange an urgent debate on this matter to highlight it in the public domain and encourage further discussion.</p></speech>

The court ruled that a non-economically active European citizen had no right to any non-contributory benefit in whichever European state he or she decided to reside.  To put the ruling in more understandable terms, the court decided that a citizen of another member state, for example, France, would not be entitled to claim family allowance in Ireland if he or she had not been economically active here for an appreciable period.  It also decided that it was a matter for each member state to decide what non-contributory cash benefit it would grant to citizens of the European Union who were non-nationals.  The decision will clearly have implications for Ireland.  I ask the Leader to request that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection come to the House to discuss what will be the consequences of the ruling for taxpayers.</p></speech>

Mr. Walsh was a gentleman at all times under pressure and a personal friend.  I look forward to the House being afforded an opportunity to pay proper tributes to him.</p><p>On my way to Clonakilty yesterday, I received an emergency call from a lady in Dundrum, where I live, informing me that a woman living in a rented property in the area had been ordered to leave her home because she could no longer afford to pay the rent.  The lady in question has four small children, the eldest of whom, a young teenager, suffers from depression.  She was distraught at the prospect of spending the night on the streets.  Friends in the area telephoned D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to seek support for her.  I compliment council staff on the empathy and sympathy they showed to the lady in question.  They organised and secured a place for her and her family on Gardiner Street, which is not especially close to her former home.  She had to leave her home because she could not afford to pay her rent which her landlord had increased by &euro;300 per month.  My duty is to help those in society who are less well off.  That is the motivation that drives me and about which I am passionate.  I support Senator Aideen Hayden in her mission to help people who are homeless.  While everybody knows that the shortage of housing is a problem, we also have landlords increasing rents without compassion, which has had the effect of forcing a person with four small children onto the streets.  I call for a debate on developments in the property market.  While we all understand the law of supply and demand, justice must be done for the weaker in society. </p></speech>

We were told repeatedly at monthly meetings that crime in the county had declined.  It appeared to us that the Garda at senior levels was downplaying the incidence of crime because everyone, including people in my home town, knew it had increased.  For this reason, I would welcome a debate on the report.</p><p>I hope the Garda Inspectorate's report also deals with the issue of Garda transfers and promotions because it appears to me and many others that unless one is a member of a particular party, one does not have a hope of being transferred or promoted.</p></speech>

However, I ask her to meet with the teachers' unions as a matter of urgency to avert the threat of a strike.  I agree with Senator Craughwell in that regard.</p><p>I also join Senator Craughwell in seeking a debate on banking.  I am aware the banking inquiry is currently under way, but it is important that this House has an urgent debate on banking.  A number of areas must be discussed, including the rate of interest mortgage holders must pay.  At a time when the European Central Bank, ECB, rate is at an all-time low of almost 0%, the banks in this country are charging mortgage holders well in excess of 4%.  That must be addressed.  We must also examine how the banks are dealing with mortgage arrears, receiverships and the sale of properties which they have put into receivership.  There are serious questions in this regard and I ask the Leader to arrange that urgent debate.</p><p>Finally, it is very serious if the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has made a threat to abolish a democratically elected council without good reason.</p></speech>

When one considers that 11,000 cases were reported last year and that there were 248 arrests, it means only approximately 2% of the cases led to an arrest.  That is really shocking.  I raise this issue as a male because it is almost always the male who is the perpetrator of the violence against the female.</p><p>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on this issue sooner rather than later.  The 11,000 cases reported last year is a shocking figure, but even more shocking was the inaction of the Garda.  I speak as somebody who strongly supports the Garda, but the inaction and the lack of understanding of the impact it has on the victim and the other members of the family should not go unchecked.</p></speech>

The Garda Inspectorate report is a major milestone in Irish policing.  It calls on the Minister immediately to establish the criminal justice service group to implement the recommendations of the report.  It is a comprehensive and devastating critique of the systems within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We all acknowledge that many men and women in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na do very good work in very difficult circumstances, but we can also see from the report that there has been a systemic failure.</p><p>It also points to issues of particular embarrassment for the Government due to the way the new Garda rosters were implemented, the lack of Garda vehicles and the loss of trained garda&iacute; to administration duties.  The spin that has been put forward by the Government over the last number of years does not have substance, so we must have a full debate on this report before the Christmas break.  I hope it is not kicked to touch; it must take place sooner rather than later.  We must also discuss the previous report on the fixed charge processing system, which is also important.</p><p>We have called for a debate on domestic violence on many occasions.  I believe I have raised the matter at every joint policing committee, JPC, meeting I have attended in Galway.  It appears to be the only figure that is increasing each time there is a meeting, but one can see from the report that the figures are probably underestimated, along with the capacity of the garda&iacute; to deal with the situations they face.  The Leader said previously that he would be open to arranging such a debate so I hope we can have it soon mar is c&uacute;is an-mh&oacute;r imn&iacute; &eacute;.  It is a particular concern when one sees organisations such as Domestic Violence Response, DVR, in Connemara having their budgets cut again.  That organisation's helpline will be curtailed as a result of the cutbacks to its funding, so it is an important issue.</p></speech>

The last thing pupils, teachers and parents want is a strike.  It is obvious that significant progress has been made by the Minister in recent weeks and I hope a satisfactory conclusion can be reached to resolve this unnecessary and unwanted dispute.</p><p>I join colleagues in calling for a debate on the Garda Inspectorate report.  I strongly support and applaud the wonderful work done each day by the garda&iacute; at the coal face.  They are operating in difficult and dangerous times and they are doing an amazing job.  However, the Garda is typical of an organisation that has not been modernised in recent decades, and successive Governments must take the blame for failing to invest in and modernise the Garda systems.  This Government is committed to doing that and I have no doubt that it will.  The report shows the need for a sea change in policing in Ireland.  Very serious systemic weaknesses have shown up in the Garda structure.  There is a need for huge investment in new technology, modernisation of crime investigation and operational and support infrastructure.</p><p>Senator Michael D'Arcy highlighted a major issue that is central to this report, the poor handling of domestic violence.  However, I welcome the Government's commitment to putting a new victim liaison office in every Garda division.  The victims of crime are very much forgotten in the general debate and I hope the Government's commitment is honoured and implemented quickly.</p></speech>

Last Monday, I attended a COPE event in Galway.  There are 800 reported cases of domestic violence in Galway this year in which the victims required shelter from their partners or spouses, the abusers.  That is the situation at local level.  The report from the Garda Inspectorate is excellent and necessary.  It is clear the Garda has been working with Dark Ages technology.  It is unbelievable that it has been able to do its job at all.</p><p>My main reason for contributing this morning is to comment on the dispute with teachers.  It must be appreciated that the Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, has gone some distance in offering a very good deal to teachers.</p> <p>She is now offering 60% external assessment, plus the State exam, with 40% internal assessment by teachers on the basis of continuous assessment.  Much of this is going on already.  At a committee meeting a number of months ago, I sought a deal of this nature from Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, who was then Minister, and he was nowhere near there.  The current Minister has been extremely positive in listening to teachers' needs when we consider what she is offering today.  In light of this, I ask the teachers' unions to think again and re-ballot members, because the deal that was refused is very different from the deal that is now on the table.  We must appreciate the importance of assessment for learning and, for that reason, teachers should do some assessment.  This improves their professionalism.  If the children were just a few years older, they would be marking all of their tests in colleges and in further education.  Many teachers are impressed with the deal, and I appeal to the unions to put it back on the table.</p></speech>

Given the number of people in hospital who have been assigned nursing homes, the cost to the State is approximately &euro;40 million.  This is a huge amount of money and the question is whether we provide those beds by making cuts in other areas or by increasing taxation.  These are the choices we must make.  It is also a major problem for long-term planning.  Estimates suggest that we will need an extra 7,000 beds between now and 2021.  If that is the correct estimate, the question is how it will be funded.  The Fair Deal question must be debated and we must decide how to plan.</p><p>Another area concerns the number of people coming home for Christmas and the pathway home for young people who have had to leave because they were unable to find jobs in this country over the past five to eight years.  Many of them have difficulties getting access to social welfare when they come home.  We must review this.  Returning to the nursing home issue, given that 990,000 people will be over 65 years of age in the next 17 years, we need 2.7 million people to be working to maintain the current level of support.  At the moment, 1.9 million people are working.  We must ensure that we encourage young people with qualifications who left the country and have a contribution to make to come home.  We must put in place mechanisms to support them in staying here at the earliest possible opportunity.  We should consider the issue leading up to Christmas.</p></speech>

The criticism that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is receiving is no different from the criticism in the report on the Department of Justice and Equality, the HSE or any Department.  It relates to a total lack of management in the structures of our public service.  Locally, a good superintendent in charge means that people notice a significant improvement in the quality of Garda operations.  I am sure other Members notice the same.  The common denominator in all successful companies is good management.  Those who follow sport know that successful teams have good management.  Unfortunately, we do not have any emphasis on it in the public service.</p><p>One of the major criticisms of the current Administration is the failure to use the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity during the economic crisis over the past six years to get things right in the public service.  Most people are followers and there is a dearth of leadership worldwide.  Where there are good leaders, they get the best out of the people following.  We do not have an emphasis on that or a system to try to encourage it within the public service.  Consequently, much of the criticism politicians come in for and the debacles we have seen are not the creatures of the politicians but are due to the failure of anonymous administrators.  Unions protecting people who are not performing must also be tackled.  That is not good enough when taxpayers, as Senator Diarmuid Wilson pointed out, are struggling to pay their mortgages, working hard to rear their families and paying high taxes, particularly the universal social charge.  To the shame of the Government, it failed to address the USC and has increased it.  Hard-earned money should be put to good use and any waste should be penalised by the structures in the system and the political structures in these Houses.  The Committee of Public Accounts does a good job, but we need something stronger to root out waste across the public service, which is endemic.</p></speech>

In view of recent decisions on whether there should be a requirement for house buyers to provide a deposit of 20% of the purchase price, the topic of mortgages could be usefully debated in the House in the near future.  A general debate on banking is also overdue.</p><p>I support the comments of Senator Michael D'Arcy on domestic abuse.  What shocked me most of what I heard about the report was the attitude towards domestic violence and the feeling that there is not much point in investigating it.  It was seen as a waste of resources, which is a frightening attitude.  We have had requests to debate this and we should do so.</p><p>I want to highlight a report by the Irish Cancer Society published in recent days which reveals that cancer death rates in the capital are up to three times higher in less affluent communities.  Lifestyle, smoking and obesity play a substantial role in this glaring disparity and I have consistently highlighted the surge in childhood obesity, especially in socially disadvantaged areas.  However, health care access is also a factor.  In deprived parts of north Dublin, for example, there is one GP for every 2,500 people, compared to a national average of one per 1,600.  I welcome the debate and call on the Minister for Health to tackle the high rate of cancer incidence and death in poorer communities as a priority.</p></speech>

I call for that debate.  I caution against two extremes in the response to the Olson report.  One is the extreme tended towards by the mainstream political parties, which involves a blind rush to the defence of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as though any criticism were inappropriate.  Just as wrong, however, is the attitude of Sinn F&eacute;in in describing the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as not fit for purpose.  The view is understandable in the context of the post-conflict situation in Northern Ireland and the work of the police force there, but there is no suggestion of bias on the part of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na against any group.  Taking the Sinn F&eacute;in position is inconsistent with the role it is trying to play in Irish politics.</p><p>I would go further-----</p></speech>

The criticisms must be understood in the context of major cuts in Garda numbers and resources over the past number of years.</p> <p>Systematic failures and poor management practices have been identified.  One of the deficiencies involved a lack of oversight of decisions and an inconsistent approach to updating victims of crimes and a lack of IT and equipment to support the investigation of crime.

Major investment in water and property and many other projects was made several years ago; some of these are losing substantial amounts of money.  The downturn in the economy had a major effect on the finances of the council.  Many businesses in Sligo are struggling and finding it difficult to pay their rates.  It is not necessary to bring the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, to the House today.  He is meeting the CEO and the management of Sligo County Council and they will have a frank discussion as to how to move forward and what options are available.  Also, the local councillors have a job to do in supporting the CEO and the management on whatever proposals are put forward.  I look forward at a later stage to finding out the proposals.  It is disappointing that we find ourselves in this situation, but it is no secret.  As a former member of Sligo County Council, I know the council has had many difficulties down through the years.  It has come to a stage at which we have to sort out the problem once and for all and move forward so that the people of Sligo do not suffer in respect of services.</p></speech>

As Senator Fidelma Healy Eames has said, the members of the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection asked the previous Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, to increase the level of standardisation of the junior certificate.  I was very pleased to note that the Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, arrived at an offer of 60% standardised assessment.  To be quite honest, I never thought the unions were seeking total standardisation, as the president of the TUI, Mr. Gerry Quinn, said this morning on RTE radio.  He said that the system had to be standardised and not open to opinion.  A mother knows her baby, a shepherd knows his flock and teachers know their pupils.  A certain level of assessment by teachers of their pupils is reasonable.  I hope they can get together again and sort out the issue for the benefit of the pupils.</p></speech>

That one can appeal penalty points to a Garda superintendent, who can then cancel the points, seems odd in light of the fact that garda&iacute; should not make judgments on appeals pertaining to their own decisions.  Quite simply, it is nonsensical to allow the prosecuting authorities to decide on issues relating to penalties imposed by themselves.  I suggest we need a debate on the issue to work in tandem with yesterday's report.  These appeals should be heard by a District Court judge who may be assigned by the Minister solely to that function.  I do not think it is necessary for oral evidence to be given but simply a submission on paper.  This would restore the public's confidence not only in penalty point appeals but also in the members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, who have undergone much trauma in recent months and years as a result of this issue.  Judges would offer standardisation in decision making and a transparent system which is publicly credible.  It would also mean that the statistics on refusals and appeals would be readily available to the public and there would be nothing to undermine the process, given that it would operate at arm's length from the prosecuting authorities.  The reality is that the Garda has effectively been asked to exercise a quasi-judicial function, which is unfair to them.  That is the reason I call on the Minister for Justice and Equality to come to the House to address the specific issue of how to deal with the penalty points process.</p></speech>

This has obviously resulted in a rowing back by the Minister.  I think she did it on a common-sense basis.  I got calls from my own local teachers in the school in Drumshanbo, which is a TUI school, who are very pleased with the developments.  I hope that a mutually acceptable conclusion will be reached in the best interests of all the pupils of Ireland because, ultimately, this is about them and their future.  I wish the Minister well in that regard.</p><p>I wish to raise an issue that, rather surprisingly, has not come before the Chamber - that is, the remarks in New York last week by the president of Sinn F&eacute;in, a Member of the other House, Deputy Gerry Adams.  I preface my remarks by saying that this is not an anti-Sinn-F&eacute;in comment or reference.  This is about a comment he made, which he said was a joke, in front of corporate America.  The people who have attended that dinner down through the years are the CEOs of some of the largest corporate entities in America.

In that context, I think that what Deputy Gerry Adams said in New York is totally unacceptable.  I say this as a working journalist, as well as for those from across the journalistic field.  Every international journalists' organisation has criticised Deputy Adams's comments.  They have done it because they said he seems to be unaware that journalists, men and women, have been killed across the world in areas of conflict doing work which we then find out about.  Without them we would not know what is going on in conflicts in various parts of the world.</p></speech>

Fintan O'Toole opined yesterday that the political reform project has run into the sand.  It does not have to be this way.  This evening we can do something immensely significant if we focus on the good.  I know from having spoken with members that everyone wants to achieve Seanad reform and that every member wants to demonstrate before the next general election that we could not be counted among those who are part of a system that is unwilling and unable to reform itself.

We are all aware that it has a massive debt at this point in time.  Of course, it is the elected members themselves who have direct responsibility in law for all reserved functions of the authority, which include adopting an annual budget and authorising borrowing.  They are democratically accountable for all expenditure by the local authority.  That said, I am sure the problems will be surmounted and that wise counsel among all parties will prevail.  I understand the CEO is meeting with the Minister today and I hope that wise counsel will be seen among all parties and a resolution occurs.  However, it must be pointed out that it is a reserved function of the members themselves to deal with the budgetary process.  That is something forgotten at times by members.</p><p>Senators O'Keeffe, Leyden, Conway, Kelly, Michael D'Arcy, &Oacute; Clochartaigh, Walsh, Mullins and others referred to the report of the Garda Inspectorate.  The report was very comprehensive and all Members need time to digest its contents.  I will certainly endeavour to have a debate on the report within a matter of weeks as it deserves the counsel of the House.  I will try to have the Minister attend to discuss the matter at that point.</p><p>Senator Barrett referred to the Education (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill and I am sure he will raise the point he raises on the Order of Business with the Minister during the debate.  It was a very valid point.</p><p>Senator Comiskey and others referred to the beef forum and wished it success today.  The matter was also raised yesterday by a number of Members.  Senator Darragh O'Brien and Senator Colm Burke also raised a matter which was raised yesterday by Senator Thomas Byrne and others in relation to the fair deal scheme, on which we will try to arrange a debate.</p><p>Senator Darragh O'Brien also mentioned approximately 30 garda&iacute; in Swords getting access for the Minister to attend an event.  The protection of the institutions of the State and the elected representatives of the people is of paramount importance and guarded properly by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is a matter for the Garda to allocate resources for such an event, but the protection of a Government Minister or any Member of the Houses elected by the people is always a matter for the Garda and something it addresses well.  Peaceful protest is a right but we have seen - and I do not allude to the situation in Swords - peaceful protests infiltrated by small groups of dissident republicans and others who have attacked garda&iacute; in many instances.  This cannot be tolerated by anyone.  We should be seen to protect and defend our garda&iacute; in instances like this and I will do so at all times.</p><p>Senator Quinn referred to pensions in the private sector.  We will have the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill in here and the Minister will attend on 2, 4 and 9 December to deal with it.  There have been other requests for the Minister to attend on other matters also this morning and we will try to get her to attend on additional dates to discuss some of the things that have been mentioned.  Members will realise that the Minister will be here for three days and we will try to get her to fit matters into her very busy diary as both T&aacute;naiste and Minister.  I must disagree with Senator Quinn in that the Government recognises fully the benefit of the self-employed and has adopted many measures in the current and previous budgets to help and assist them.</p></speech>

Senators Craughwell, Wilson, Mooney, Michael D'Arcy, Mullins, Healy Eames and others referred to the dispute with teachers on the junior cycle.  It has been recognised that the Minister has gone some way, though obviously not as far as the unions would like, and I hope both parties work for a solution.  That is what everybody wants, especially parents and pupils who will be affected by any dispute.</p><p>Senator John Kelly supported Senator Hayden on an additional &euro;4 million for homelessness services in the Dublin region.  He also raised a point, as he has done consistently, on rent supplement.  The Minister will attend on the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill, in respect of which the points could be raised.</p><p>Senator Leyden referred to the Garda Inspectorate and I named the other Senators who spoke on the matter.  Senator Paul Coghlan referred to the work of Mr. Ryan, a former civil servant, on the Ansbacher accounts and welcomed the whisteblower legislation and its operation in this regard.</p><p>Senator Naughten referred to the European Court of Justice ruling and the consequences for taxpayers.  It is a matter on which I am sure the Senator can address the T&aacute;naiste in respect of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill.  Senator White praised D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council for its efforts on behalf of a constituent on rent and an eviction.  We have many unscrupulous landlords who are raising their prices to exorbitant levels in Dublin in particular.  Many people have come to me who cannot find a place to rent due to the prices being charged.  It is a matter that will certainly have to be addressed.</p><p>Senators Michael D'Arcy, &Oacute; Clochartaigh, Healy Eames and Noone referred to domestic violence.  It is a debate we should have outside the Garda Inspectorate report in any event and we will ask the Minister to come to the House on the matter.</p><p>Senator Colm Burke referred to access by people returning home to social welfare and the difficulties they experience.  Again, it is a matter which can be raised during the debate on the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill.</p><p>Senator Jim Walsh referred to the Garda Inspectorate report and the need for greater leadership.  He also mentioned the universal social charge, which is a Fianna F&aacute;il-introduced tax the Government has taken-----</p></speech>

Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-11-12a.135" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="11:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014111200011#K00600"><p>I move amendment No. 1:<blockquote><br />In page 3, line 6, after &ldquo;1997;&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;to amend The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (Charters Amendment) Act 2003;&rdquo;.</blockquote>I welcome the Minister and wish to be associated with the sympathy expressed by the Leas-Chathaoirleach on the death of the former Minister for Agriculture and Food, Mr. Joe Walsh.<br/>After Committee Stage I had expected more amendments in the Minister's name, but other than amendment No. 20, the Bill is back before the House in virtually the same form and this is the Seanad's last chance to discuss it.<br/>This is a strange Bill which it is widely believed has been drafted to assist the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, although the name of that institution is not and was not mentioned on the last occasion.  The danger in not mentioning in the Bill the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland is that it makes possible for the Bill to be used by a different body without the former's standards and reputation.  Such a body could find loopholes - that is what lawyers do - to achieve accreditation and a future Minister might try to correct the situation.  I have in mind the procedures on which the Department is working in the case of the technological universities Bill which will ensure an institution will have to go through steps thoroughly and methodically in order to become a university.  In the worst case scenario under this Bill an institution could receive a licence to operate and give the Irish higher education sector a bad name by not going through the thorough procedures in place and embodied in the technological universities Bill with the Higher Education Authority, HEA.  A Minister would then have to withdraw the licence and we would then enter the area of compensation and the payment of money that is badly needed in the primary education sector and elsewhere in the system.</p> <p>So that is the context.  By not being specific to institutions and by not having a licensing system, we create danger.  That is why amendments Nos. 1, 18 and 25, which the Leas-Chathaoirleach has asked us to take together, refer to explicitly saying that this applies to the Royal College of Surgeons.  The issues that then arise would be, as Senator Power previously noted, the issue of why it should not be called a medical university because that is what it does.  The issue then arises as to why we have an institution that is a university when it is outside Ireland but not inside Ireland.  They are substantive issues and we would be delighted to debate those with the Minister.</p><p>The other issue arising is the question of whether it would be better to educate the medical profession in a wider university context or on its own.  I am sure we will have views on that one way or the other.  If, as people are convinced, the purpose of the legislation is to facilitate the Royal College of Surgeons in its development plan, let us discuss that.  I think it would probably have wide support.  However, by not mentioning it, do we create a loophole and possibility of claims arising against the State in the future and probably unworthy people by Irish university standards ruining, I do not like the word &quot;brand name&quot;, the reputation and good name of Ireland?  That is why it is in amendment Nos. 1 and 18.    </p><p>In amendment No. 18, we seek to make explicit that we are talking about the Royal College of Surgeons.  Amendment No. 25 is the third amendment on this list.  It aims to draw attention to the fact that the best and I would say the only candidate at the moment that meets this criterion is the Royal College of Surgeons.  We will go through the other criteria in the other amendments.  If in any case, they fall short of the standard of the international reputation of the Royal College of Surgeons, are we creating problems for future Seanaid and future Ministers by not being explicitly tight in our definitions and the procedures?  It takes a long time to build up a university reputation and that is what we must defend here for the sake of students - the status of Irish degrees.  If I may summarise, the first three amendments aim to make explicit that the intention in this legislation is to facilitate the Royal College of Surgeons.  Why not say so?  </p></speech>

We understood that we were being listened to and heard and that attention would be given to the cases made.  To come back on Report Stage with absolutely nothing seems strange.  It is not the aim of this House to just be a talking shop and not achieve something.  Senator Barrett touched upon instances which I am aware have occurred in the past, usually in the US, but I am sure it happens in many other places, where degrees or doctorates have been awarded to people in return for a sum of money, which may be only $100 or $200.  These are institutions we would not know, some of which have very unusual names and some of which have very prestigious names.  People are able to claim that they have a doctorate from those colleges.</p><p>We brought this up before and I would like the Minister to put my mind at rest.  My concern is that by not mentioning the Royal College of Surgeons, there is a danger that we are opening the door to allow institutions in other parts of the world to establish themselves as Irish universities and to be able to offer these so-called qualifications without coming near Ireland.  Senator Barrett has explained that very well so I will not repeat what he said.  In particular, I will not repeat the cases made on Second and Committee Stages.  The case is well made.  I would like to hear the Minister say that she has thought this one through and that the reason for coming to Report Stage is to make sure that we have an opportunity to have another look at something like this.  I believe it is worthy of consideration.  </p></speech>

I have grave concerns about this Bill not specifying the educational institution I believe it has been designed to facilitate, namely, the Royal College of Surgeons.  We already have one third-level institution in this country which is marketing its services on a for-profit basis and my fear is that some of the very high-powered international universities that market their services all over the world would come to Ireland and use it as a base or hub to market their services.  I am also concerned that the bar has not been set as high as it has been set for a technological university to establish itself.  I ask the Minister to consider restricting this Bill to the Royal College of Surgeons and ensuring that we do not allow Ireland to become a hub for sharp practice among those institutions internationally which would not aspire to the same standards we find in our fine national universities and Trinity College Dublin.  I ask the Minister to reconsider that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-11-12a.141" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1154" speakername="Averil Power" time="11:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014111200012#L00600"><p>I also support the remarks made by Senators Quinn, Barrett and Craughwell about their concerns about this Bill.  Indeed I made such remarks myself on Committee Stage.  It is clear to everybody here in this House that this is a Bill for the Royal College of Surgeons and it should say that.  We should be up-front about what this Bill is actually designed to achieve.  It is called the Education (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill and 90% of the provisions relate to the Royal College of Surgeons so it is a bit of a farce to call it a miscellaneous Bill and not spell out what it is actually directed at.</p><p>I reiterate that I accept that the Royal College of Surgeons has a difficulty marketing itself abroad when it is competing against institutions from other countries that can call themselves universities when it cannot do so.  However, our other institutions face exactly the same problem.  The quality of the education provided by Dublin Institute of Technology, Waterford Institute of Technology and other institutes of technology is far superior to that offered by some institutions that can call themselves universities in the UK and other countries.  This is not the right way to approach it.  We have a strategy on the internationalisation of third-level education, much of which has not been implemented.  There are other things we can do to make sure we are marketing our third-level institutions coherently and the quality of education but it must be done on a message of quality.  </p><p>There is something deeply duplicitous about saying that an institution is not good enough or does not meet the criteria to be called a university in Ireland but that it is okay to sell it as a university to students in the US and Asia.  Those students would be well within their rights to say &quot;Hang on a second, why are you selling me one thing if you're not selling it to your Irish students on exactly the same basis?&quot;  It looks dodgy.</p><p>I accept that there is an issue that the Minister is trying to address but it is the wrong way of going about it.  As has been pointed out, if a difficulty does arise, it reflects on the entire Irish education system and people will say that the way this came about is a bit weird and ask whether there is something odd about the fact that the institutes have been going through a long and painful process to get university status while another institution was able to get a Bill drafted just to deal with its specific concerns.  This is a significant and deeply concerning departure in Irish education.</p><p>I would love to work with the Minister.  I know the university Senators, Senator Craughwell and others would love to do so as well to find the right way to address this issue because I accept that the quality of the educational provision in the Royal College of Surgeons is top class.  I have raised issues and concerns about human rights in the countries in which it operates but I do accept that the educational aspect of its degrees is probably far superior to that offered by medical schools elsewhere.</p> <p>As I proposed last time, the way to deal with that is to develop a criteria specifically for a medical university for which it could qualify at home and abroad, without creating a special situation of having a university abroad but not at home.  It is unfair and I object to that in the strongest possible terms.  </p><p>Like Senator Quinn, I thought the matter would be addressed, given the dialogue we had across the House about some of our genuine concerns.  We tabled amendments opposing the sections which refer to the RCSI and I have been told the House will not have an opportunity to vote on them because they have all been ruled out of order.  Amendments Nos. 5, 13 to 15, inclusive, and 17 tabled by Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in have all been ruled out of order and we will not be able to vote on the individual section amendments we tabled.  That is unfortunate, in terms of the democratic process in the House, and making sure everybody has an opportunity to brief themselves and vote accordingly during the debate.</p></speech>

Having listened to the debate very carefully on Second and Committee Stages, we remain unconvinced of the merits of allowing an institution such as the RCSI which, it appears, has no trouble in attracting international students to apply for places, to qualify.  If it looks, walks and quacks like a duck, it is a duck.  This should be called the RCSI Bill.  </p><p>As I mentioned, the only institution which will qualify under this Bill is the RCSI and it is disingenuous, to say the least, that the Government will attempt to present the Bill in a way which would make the average reader think that any institution could avail of it.  If the RCSI wishes to identify as a university the correct thing for it to do would be to, as was mentioned, go through the appropriate channels and procedures in order for that to happen, as other educational institutions in Ireland have to do and are in the process of doing.  Otherwise, there is a sense of duplicity to the whole affair.  It is not fair.  We share the concerns expressed by other Senators, in particular those of Senator Power, about what would happen if students arrived in Ireland and realised they were not attending a university in the traditional sense of the word.</p><p>Senator Craughwell mentioned the issue of TTIP to me and what would happen if we awarded a licence which was then revoked.  Could a body go to a court of arbitration and be awarded compensation for profits lost?  It is an important concern.  Had our amendments been allowed, I am sure Senator Craughwell would have raised these issues.  They are important considerations which need to be addressed.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-11-12a.145" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1061" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014111200013#M00400"><p>I thank all Senators for their contributions.  I acknowledge and thank them for the constructive debate we had on Committee Stage.  I will give some explanation as to why I did not table amendments on Report Stage.  I had not at any stage indicated that I would table an amendment on this issue.  I will table amendments on protecting the names of Irish universities, and perhaps others, but we have not been able to draft them sufficiently well to bring them before the Seanad.  Amendments made in the D&aacute;il will have to come before the Seanad because the Bill was initiated here.  I will address those issues when we deal with amendments at a later stage.  I regret that I did not have time to properly draft amendments on Report Stage in the Seanad.</p><p>I do not think we can introduce a piece of legislation that is confined to one institution which, as Senators correctly pointed out, will be able to benefit, namely, the RCSI.  I do not think it is right that we would pre-empt any other institution from reaching the standards that would be required to use the term &quot;university&quot; and it would only apply outside the State, as we discussed.  It would be open to other institutions, if they fulfil the strict criteria involved.  </p><p>Section 2(1) of the Bill refers to doctorate level under the Irish qualifications framework.  There is no question that another country could decide that an institution qualifies to be a university.  It has to qualify under the Irish qualifications framework, through the HEA, and be at doctorate level.  The criteria only relate to bodies outside the State, therefore the title can only be used outside the State.  </p><p>The RCSI is likely to benefit in the immediate future, but it would not be correct to have a piece of law which excluded any other institution in the future which might reach the strict qualifications and make the case to call itself a university outside the State for the purposes, as Senator Power said, of international students and internationalisation which, I am sure Senators will agree, are positive for the country.  I am glad Senator Power clarified her point.  I do not think anybody is questioning the standards of the RCSI, rather, the question is whether other institutions might not meet the required standards.  The Bill is very specific; they have to reach the qualifications within the Irish framework of qualifications.</p><p>On calling it the Royal College of Surgeons Bill, the Bill is not just about calling an institution a university outside the State.  It contains an important element regarding PLC students being eligible for student grants.  Everybody would want to make sure that we do not exclude further education students from obtaining grants.  </p><p>Another element, about which I know there are differing views, is the use of information for league tables, something we want to exclude.  We will debate the issue later.  As the Bill contains three elements we would not want to change its name.  </p></speech>

Perhaps Report Stage of the Bill should have been delayed in order to incorporate the amendments we suggested during the previous debate.  The loopholes remain.</p><p>I wish to press the amendment.  The RCSI is further down the route.  The Minister wants to do other things.

As I should have said before, I note that if amendments are made to the Bill when it comes before the D&aacute;il, the legislation will come back to this House.  That gives us a new context in which to examine the amendments before us.<br/>Amendment No. 2 replaces the definition of an  &ldquo;education provider&rdquo;, which means a person in the State who provides a programme of education and training, with the wording proposed in the amendment.<br/>The Minister knows the concerns of the House that &quot;person&quot; is too loose a definition.  Could it bring in the wrong kinds of people?  I accept what the Minister said about the existing section 3.  Amendment No. 2 is there as a suggestion, if it is of any value to the Minister as she brings the Bill to the D&aacute;il and possibly back here.  That is the spirit in which the amendment is offered.  It is a tighter definition of an education provider than the current one.<br/>Amendment No. 3 gives a definition of &ldquo;higher education&rdquo; as defined under the National Qualifications Framework.  If those safeguards, to which many Members of the House have referred, are required, do we need the kind of drafting in those amendments to put forth what they are worth?  They may be helpful to the Minister.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-11-12a.151" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1145" speakername="Feargal Quinn" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014111200014#O00300"><p>I support what Senator Barrett has said.  These amendments have been tabled in order to help the Minister.  The Minister has experience of the Seanad herself and knows that we are not all that uppity - although we are a little bit uppity - as to believe that if we initiate a Bill in this House it is a pity to take it away and have it changed in the other House.  That is the way things go on, however.  I would prefer to see changes made here to a Bill that is initiated here.  I did not think there was a need for a huge rush to get this particular Bill through, but there probably is.  The Royal College of Surgeons certainly requires that.</p><p>The two amendments before us are certainly worthy of consideration.  I hope the Minister will consider them, if not in this House, then when the Bill reaches the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-11-12a.152" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1154" speakername="Averil Power" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014111200014#O00400"><p>I support Senator Quinn's comment about not amending the Bill here.  I understand the Minister has explained that it was not ready in time in the Department, but I genuinely do not understand why we have the Bill back if the amendments are not ready.  Perhaps the Minister could elaborate on why there is a rush to get this legislation through.<br/>To be fair, there is a lot of education expertise in this House that does not exist in the D&aacute;il.  People frequently tell me that, on education issues in particular, because we have the expertise of university Senators and others who take a particular interest in education, people pick up on things here that are not picked up on in the D&aacute;il.  Language is better understood and we have more deliberative and intelligent debates around language and wording.  It is unfortunate that we will not get to do that concerning the issues that have been raised by the university Senators previously.  We thought we might be discussing those amendments today.  <br/>The Minister said that if the D&aacute;il amends the Bill it will come back here for us to discuss amendments made by the D&aacute;il, but what if the D&aacute;il misses those points?  The Minister will be tabling amendments and will discuss them with Deputies, but she will not have Senators Barrett, Quinn, Crown, Craughwell and others who have a particular interest in education.<br/>The Minister's predecessors have said during education debates here that there is a standard of interest and expertise in this House that is useful in formulating legislation.  I will be talking to our party's D&aacute;il spokesperson on education about the language that is put forward in the D&aacute;il, and I am sure others will also.  It is unfortunate, however, that the university Senators will not be part of that debate, unless the Bill reverts to the Seanad if the D&aacute;il amends it.  In that case we can discuss the changes, but otherwise we will not have an opportunity to raise those points when the Bill finally comes back to us at the very end.  It is a missed opportunity.<br/>I know the Minister did not commence this Bill, but it was published on a Thursday and discussed here the following Wednesday.  I happened to be away for work at the time.  I had left when the schedule came in, and our Whip's office phoned me to say there was an education Bill on Wednesday.  I had no idea what it was, so we had to scramble around.  The best I could get was an article in <i>The Irish Times</i>that reported that it was a Bill for the Royal College of Surgeons.  That was the first time I heard that it mainly concerned that college.  The Bill was published and debated in this House within a matter of days, but that is not the best way to make policy.  Best practice is for the Minister to consult with people, flag that the Bill is coming, publish it and give us some time to consider it before it arrives in the House.  I hope that is how we will deal with education legislation in future.</p></speech>

I therefore hope I have benefitted from the expertise of Members of this House.  I have the greatest of respect for the Seanad and, as Senator Quinn said, I served here for five years.  The expertise here will certainly feed into the amendments I will bring to the D&aacute;il.  The Bill will come back here because it has been initiated here.</p><p>My concern with specifying the levels on the National Qualifications Framework, as proposed in these amendments, is that one would be putting the specific levels into primary legislation, whereas in the legislation on the framework itself that is not done.  If we put in the specific levels, therefore, and if somehow or other they change in any way - if, for example, further levels are established, which could well happen in future - we will have stitched in specific numbers concerning levels 7, 8, 9 and 10 in this legislation.  If the QQI levels change for any reason, which they could do in future in terms of classification, we would then have to amend this legislation.</p><p>The Bill identifies that a body has to have reached a certain level in the Irish qualifications framework in order to qualify to call itself a university abroad.  While this relates to the previous amendment, the awarding bodies of institutions that would be entitled to call themselves universities abroad have to have the power to award degrees at doctoral level in Ireland.  We are therefore talking about a narrow range of institutions.  They must currently, or at a particular time, have the power to award at doctoral level under our qualifications framework - not anybody else's qualifications framework.  I wish to be clear on that.</p><p>I cannot accept these amendments because we would be stitching in the actual current levels at which doctorates, for example, are awarded.  That could change, however, in terms of the qualifications framework in future.</p></speech>

I will not be moving the amendments.  I gathered the Minister will be moving some in the D&aacute;il and they will come back here.

Amendments Nos. 4 and 6 to 12, inclusive, are related.  Amendment Nos. 7, 8 and 9 are physical alternatives to amendment No. 6.  Amendments Nos. 4 and 6 to 12, inclusive, may be discussed together by agreement.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I call Senator Barrett.  Ar aghaidh leat on amendment No. 4</p></speech>

That is self-explanatory.  <br/>Amendment No. 6 is to delete a section of page 4 of the Bill.  This amendment was somewhat controversial on the last occasion.  Marketing programmes of education is a specified purpose of the Bill, rather than education itself.  I think it was the marketing aspect that annoyed people.  We specify in our amendment No. 6 the provision of a programme of education and training and research services.  The concern was that there would be international marketing programmes.  They appear very high up in the Government's Bill.  We put the education aspect first.  <br/>Amendment No. 4 is on universities.  Amendment No. 6 is to put the educational purposes up front rather than its marketing.  <br/>Amendment No. 12 is the third one I was looking for.  I think it is a matter that the Minister has referred to.  Amendment No. 12 states, &quot;that the Minister is satisfied that the name of the proposed university is distinct from any existing university in the State&quot;, in case somebody sets up &quot;Trinity University&quot; or one that could be confused with an already established one.  The Minister has already dealt with that in her introductory remarks.  <br/>The background to what we have in these amendments is to give a licensing regime which will ensure - as the Minister, Senator Power and others have said - that these newly-validated institutions will meet the criteria that are being applied to technological universities and will meet the standards set by Irish universities over many hundreds of years, to build up the international reputation that they have.  As Senator Quinn has stated, it is hoped that these amendments are of help to the Minister bringing the Bill before the D&aacute;il.  That is the spirit in which they are intended.  They are not intended in a spirit of confrontation.  If they are of help, they are on offer for that purpose. </p></speech>

I do not wish to repeat what Senator Barrett has stated but the aim of this is to avoid confusion and help the Minister.  I hope it is taken into consideration by her, if not in this House certainly in the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-11-12a.160" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1061" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="12:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014111200015#P00800"><p>I thank the Senators again for their very helpful contributions in these amendments.  I will come to the latter ones in a couple of minutes.  In terms of the term "marketing", the central purpose is education rather than marketing.  The reason the universities want to use the title is so they can identify to students outside of Ireland the high standard that they reach in terms of the degrees and doctorates that they award.  If one likes, to market is the reason they want to use the title or why they would like to use the title outside the State.</p><p>I want to explain a little about the word &quot;persons&quot; . This comes into amendments Nos. 7 and 8.  My officials have consulted again with the parliamentary draftsman in relation to this word &quot;persons&quot; to confirm that &quot;person&quot; is the appropriate legal term, although we might see person as maybe not appropriate.  However, it is the appropriate legal term for an institution or other body in this context as provided for under the Interpretation Act 2005.  Part 4 of the Act provides for the general rules of construction in an enactment and section 18(c) states that &quot;'Person' shall be read as importing a body corporate (whether a corporation aggregate or a corporation sole) and an unincorporated body of persons, as well as an individual, and the subsequent use of any pronoun in place of a further use of 'person' shall be read accordingly&quot;.  Therefore, the Interpretation Act 2005 defines the general use of certain terminology in legislation.  That is why we use the term &quot;person&quot;.  It has an understanding within law, as defined in that particular Act.  That is to explain why &quot;person&quot; is deemed to be the most appropriate language to use.  </p><p>I want to give a definite commitment that I will bring forward an amendment with regard to the Senators' proposed amendment No. 12.  I fully understand the Senators' concern to protect the names of the Irish universities.  I propose to bring forward a Government amendment on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il to ensure that where the description &quot;university&quot; is being used as part of a title of an institution, the Minister will have to approve that usage.  My officials are engaging with the draftman as to the most appropriate wording to use in that regard.  I thank Senators Barrett and Quinn for that. </p><p>The Senators were also concerned that we would publish the observations of An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s.  That is dealt with in their amendment No. 11.  They suggested that the observations of An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s should be published.  My understanding is that An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s will simply be saying, &quot;you qualify&quot; or &quot;you do not qualify&quot;.  Its observations will be fairly straightforward.  It is a yes or a no.  Detail will not be given in the observations.  Nevertheless, I will look to see if we can incorporate that request as well. </p></speech>

As I said, Sinn F&eacute;in is opposed to the Bill for a number of reasons.  First, it is a little disingenuous to say the Bill is not about the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland being able to operate as a university outside the State and that this provision is open to all education providers, as I do not think that is the case.  It is about the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.</p><p>I wish to make the following point, about which I have spoken to the Minister.  The Government side tabled an Adjournment motion on the matter.  We have a number of applications for categorisation as technological universities.  Such institutions are going through a painstaking process of having to meet criteria, which is as it should be.  The criteria need to be set and the bar and benchmarks need to be set very high.  One wants an institute to meet these targets to take its place among the top universities in the State, which is as it should be.  The difficulty is that different rules are being applied to the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.  Why is it not subject to the same level of scrutiny to which the institutes of technology and other institutions are subject in their quest to secure university status?  That is a genuine concern. </p></speech>

The provision states the Minister can make the choice &quot;from among persons who have a special interest in...&quot;.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure it is of a higher standard.  Rather like what Senator David Cullinane said, we want to have a person with an international reputation to chair and be a member of the appeals board.  As the Senator said, the institutes of technology are going through a very demanding process.  Therefore, it is not right to have an appeals board comprising persons with qualifications who are defined as having &quot;a special interest in...&quot;.  I might have a special interest in medicine, but I have no qualifications to say whether a place should qualify as such a university.  The amendment seeks further safeguards.

That is the spirit in which we propose this amendment.  I am worried about placing any restriction on access to information.  The spirit of the time is to open up access to information.  For example, whistleblower material will be presented to the Committee of Public Accounts today, while the secret agreements made on minimal corporate tax rates are being opened up for discussion by the OECD.  That proves that this is a time to allow access to more information.  In fact, it was part of the reforming agenda of the Government to provide more information.  <br/>I will outline my concerns about this section of the Bill.  Section 7(4)(ii) includes the words &quot;education or training facilities&quot;.  Can we not find out where the laboratories, computers, libraries and sports fields are located?  Is this not information to which parents should have access when deciding where to send their children to school?  <br/>There is an aversion to league tables.  It seems that because of this aversion we threw out a lot of other useful things.  Also, some of the information is needed by the Minister to operate DEIS schools.  Information on schools should only be restricted in very limited circumstances such as in asking how did candidate Blogs did in the leaving certificate examinations.  It is good to release the rest of the information on schools, including on qualifications and facilities.  On the one hand, there is the protection of people's genuine right to privacy, while, on the other, we have wrongly restricted access to information on facilities such as those I have mentioned.</p> <p>Is that section in the spirit of the times?  Do we need to let out more information?  Does this help the community to become more involved in schools and help parents in the choices they make?  Do we need to be tighter in protecting an individual's privacy while putting out information which would make schools perform better, which is what we all want?  That is the purpose of the section.</p></speech>

At a time when almost everything is moving towards more and more information being made freely available, on this occasion it seems to be a step backwards.  I can understand one or two of the points that have been made by Senator Sean D. Barrett, but it seems to be far too broad, far too wide, and I urge the Minister to seriously reconsider restricting the amount from the point of view of the information people require.</p></speech>

It is only the information specified in that legislation, that is, academic information on results.  It refers to the information specified that would allow for league tables to be produced.  In other words, as successive Governments have agreed, we do not want to facilitate league tables which we believe would not be good for the education system and would not serve the needs of students or schools.  It only refers to that level of information; it is not about other general information on schools.  For example, the information we have on DEIS schools would not be included.  Prescribed public bodies are provided for, whereby one can release or share assessment and examination data with other public bodies for the purposes of research.  For the purposes of research and information, certain prescribed public bodies can be given information, subject to ministerial approval or direction.  This is not about facilitating the drawing up of league tables which we consider would be damaging.  It is not about withholding information from parents and school communities but rather about preventing the use of data in a way that would not serve parents, students or the education system.  That is my view and I think it has been the view of successive Governments.</p></speech>

I take it from the reference to "education or training facilities" in section 7 that the numbers of computers and laboratories and items of equipment used, sports fields, libraries and books will not be covered by a refusal of access to certain information.  Perhaps it might be considered that if we need facilities, it would be better for us to have the information available.  It might even help the Minister in her dealings with the Minister for Finance.  The subsection seems to be at odds with what the Minister was saying, since it conceals the lack of facilities under the heading of refusal of access to certain information.</p></speech>

I am reassured by the fact that the language used on the next page in section 7(4), paragraphs I and II, is more specific, stating the specified information includes:<blockquote>without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing&mdash;<br />(I) the overall results or outcomes in any period of time of students in a recognised school or learners in an education or training facility in an examination or assessment, or<br />(II) the comparative overall results or outcomes in any period of time of students in different recognised schools or learners in different education or training facilities in an examination or assessment,</blockquote>It is clear from the later language used that it is aimed at academic results and information that would allow the media, in particular, to compare academic results.  In the earlier language used, &quot;including but not limited to&quot;, it is more specific that the intention is that it be only about academic results, but because it only includes academic results, it gives the Minister power under the regulations to have it broader than this.  I think the Minister has made it clear that her intention is only to prevent league table results.<br/>It is welcome that more information is now available from schools and that inspection reports - whole school evaluations, etc. - are published online, but we still have a very under-developed system when it comes to information.  I do not agree with comparisons of crude examination results because it is amazing for a child from a disadvantaged area who is the first in a family to sit the leaving certificate examinations to get a C.  Perhaps he or she has had fantastic teachers to help him or her to get up to that grade, which is a huge achievement for him or her.  It would be wrong to compare that result crudely with results from another school where all of the children come from well-off backgrounds.  It would not capture the fact that some students might not be academic but may excel in sports, the creative arts, or other such areas.<br/>It would be crude and unfair to compare students on a purely academic basis, but there is still a huge gap in time between one whole school evaluation report and the next.  I am not even sure if every school has been covered at this stage under that process which has been ongoing for some years.  Some of the language used in the inspection reports verges on the conservative.  It can be very subtle because the inspectors are trying to congratulate a school on the good things it is doing and sometimes it takes a trained eye to actually spot the criticism in what is being said about other areas - &quot;There is room for improvement in maths&quot; and so on.  We have some way to go in that regard.  Parents need more information and we need more transparency about schools.  I do not agree with league tables, but I ask the Minister to take on this issue as a priority in her brief in terms of the information we can provide for parents that would be helpful and make them better informed in the choices they are making for their students, not just the crude academic results.</p></speech>

To clarify again, at the bottom of page 8 of the Bill it is stated the specified data are those "which would enable the compilation of information" - it is specific information that would enable the compilation of league tables - "in relation to the comparative performance of [...] recognised schools [...] or [...] education or training facilities".  The reason the term "education or training facilities" is used is that, for example, education and training boards, ETBs, have places where examinations are held that are not actually schools - they could be Youthreach centres or other institutions run by ETBs which are not specifically schools but in which examinations would be held.  That is why they are described as "education or training facilities".  This does not, therefore, refer to the education or training facilities within individual schools but the actual institution that runs courses and carries out the examinations.  I hope that is clear and think Senator Averil Power was helpful in further clarifying other elements of the legislation.</p><p>I failed in my original intervention to say the proposed amendment No. 20 was a technical amendment brought forward by the Government to update the reference to the Freedom of Information Bill 2014 which has now been enacted.</p></speech>

Their purpose was to amend the current legislation in order that schools would be required to make available information to parents on voluntary contributions in the same way that information was available for State funding allocations.  The second amendment, No. 22, was to further compel the Minister to report to the D&aacute;il on the practice of seeking voluntary contributions.</p> <p>The reason these amendments were resubmitted is the Minister mentioned on Committee Stage that she would introduce an education (admission to schools) Bill to deal with admissions and fees.  A parent and student charter is forthcoming but there are concerns about the issue of voluntary contribution and the huge costs faced by parents and families.  Many schools use voluntary contributions extensively to plug gaps in school funding and in some cases children are excluded from activities or have lockers withheld when such charges are not paid.  I seek more information on when the legislation on this will be introduced and more details on the parent and student charter.  There is a fear that schools will be let off the hook on this for a while and many hard-pressed families will suffer in the interim.  The educations of young people should not suffer because parents cannot pay voluntary contributions.</p></speech>

Parents face great difficulties on this and many are not in favour of them - they are classed as voluntary but many parents feel they have no choice.  This was highlighted previously in the education committee when we discussed the issue.  Some schools have a system where a pupil will not be given a locker key, or the like, until a voluntary contribution is paid.  I understand that schools are in a difficult situation due to capitation cuts and so on - they are massively underfunded on a day-to-day basis.  What are school principals supposed to do when, due to insufficient capitation, they do not have sufficient money to pay for light, heat and basic necessities?  Principals and teachers are caught between a rock and a hard place as they would prefer schools not to seek voluntary contributions.  Voluntary contributions contradict constitutional commitments to free education.  This is a big issue and greater transparency is required.</p><p>Another problem in recent years is that schools that do not receive a minor works grant end up seeking more funding from parents.  In such circumstances, parents dip into their pockets to pay for minor building issues in schools that should be covered by a minor works grant.  Will the Minister confirm whether there will be a minor works grant in the current school year?  Parents face real pressure when they are asked to pay for broken radiators and minor problems that arise.</p></speech>

I generally support this principle but I do not think this amendment is appropriate.  As Senator Reilly noted, we are working on the education (admission to schools) Bill and are close to publication.  We are engaging with parliamentary draftsmen and the Office of the Attorney General to finalise proposals on the Bill and, among other things, it will prohibit the charging of any fees or contributions as part of a school's admissions process.  Schools will not be allowed to charge a fee for applications, in other words.  I agree that greater transparency is required and it was noted that we will publish a parent and student charter.</p><p>I agree with the principle of what the Senators seek but I do not think this Bill is the appropriate place to address it as we are close to publishing a final draft of an education (admission to schools) Bill.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 23 relates to the good part of the Bill and the success of student universal support Ireland, SUSI.  One of the last interactions in this house with the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Quinn, was to compliment him on the fact that SUSI's first-year teething problems had been overcome dramatically.  He sent a list of officers in each county to deal with queries.  The lady in charge of the Wexford section instantly solved an issue I raised.  Given that there were brickbats in the first year of SUSI, there should be plaudits for what has happened subsequently.  The fact that the issue of SUSI is not raised in the House much anymore means it must work well.<br/>I wish to make a technical addition to the praise I have given.  Is it administered by the Minister, now that it is in a separate body, or is it authorised by the Minister?  I will leave this for the Minister's consideration.  Could a person say it is no longer administered by the Minister because it has been delegated to a new body called SUSI?  I hope this amendment is of use in framing the Bill.</p></speech>

It was discussed on Committee Stage and the Minister addressed it but I will refresh the memories of Members of the House.  The purpose of the amendment was to address anomalies in the grant system that see students assessed on their parents' incomes unless they are over 23 years of age.  A student under 23 years of age will be assessed on his or her own income only if he or she can prove he or she is estranged from his or her parents.  The purpose of amendment No. 24 is to expand the range of information acceptable to verify a claim of estrangement for the purposes of a student grant.  At the time the Minister mentioned different pieces of legislation that made provision for ministerial discretion.  She said the legislation allows for latitude and for other criteria to be applied.  She went on to say that this amendment will replicate existing legislation but that if she reviews the scheme she will consider this.</p><p>This is an important issue that has been raised with me since.  Significant problems exist despite discretion and latitude and, as legislators, we must ensure these obstacles are removed from people's way - this applies particularly to access to education.  If young people under 23 years of age are blocked from access to grants they are blocked from access to education.  The Youth Guarantee scheme makes sure all young people under 25 years of age have access to education and training and obstacles blocking access to income from a SUSI grant or the like should be removed.</p><p>The Minister spoke on this matter on Committee Stage and said she will be willing to examine this if she revises the scheme.  This amendment has been resubmitted on the basis that it has been raised with us as a constant background issue.</p></speech>

I appreciate that there must be generalised rules that are fair to everyone and set criteria but there are always problems relating to people who, for good reason, cannot live at home.  Some people leave home because of serious issues there.  When I was student union president in Trinity College I worked with students under 23 years of age who could not stay at home due to violence and a lack of safety.  They did not qualify for grants in their own right.  At the time this was dealt with through the student assistance fund, discretionary funding by the college to look after people ineligible for grants.  The college had discretion but that fund has been cut dramatically in recent years.</p> <p>Some of the colleges ran out early last year and were not able to assist anybody after a particular date.  That is a serious problem because we are talking about the most vulnerable students.  Those who qualify for the fund are in the most dire financial straits.  I echo that there is a need for a more flexible system and that it is welcome that the Minister has indicated that she will look at it.  If she is not in a position to respond to the amendment, she might indicate whether it is something she will take forward, as discussed on Committee Stage.  The cut to the student assistance fund is a big problem and I ask her to do something about it if she has any discretion within her funding approaching the end of the year.  It is a big problem for the most vulnerable students who are in very difficult situations and whom the colleges would have been able to help in years past.</p></speech>

That is the purpose in using the same language, to ensure these students qualify for grants and that there is no doubt about it.  As that is the purpose, I am not proposing to accept the amendment because it would involve the  use of different language.</p><p>The reason I do not propose to accept amendment No. 24 is that we already have a provision in section 16(3) of the Student Support Act, 2011, whereby the Minister may specify a class of applicant or criteria that may be considered in determining whether an applicant is a student of a particular class.   Under that Act there is a statutory instrument in which we should make any change to be made.  I am sympathetic to the case made by the three Senators who spoke on that issue.  We all know of cases in which people are living away from their parents and proving estrangement from them can be difficult.  In some cases people have formed new families, as Senator Marie Moloney described.  However, I do not believe this legislation is the appropriate place in which to address this issue.</p></speech>

I take this opportunity to reiterate, on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il group, why we are opposing this Bill.  As I pointed out in the course of the debate, 90% of the Bill relates to the putting in place of an extraordinary new procedure for the benefit of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, whereby that institution, which is not entitled to call itself a university within this State because it does not satisfy the relevant criteria, may market itself abroad as a university.  That leaves us with a bizarre situation in which foreign students will be enticed to study there thinking it is a university when it is, under the Irish system of classification, a college.</p><p>As I emphasised, I have no difficulties with the educational standard of the medical qualifications provided by the RCSI.  However, what is proposed here represents a huge departure in our system of third level education.  The institutes of technology that have been jumping through hoops for a long time to secure university status are being told they must continue on that uncertain path while another institution is allowed to move ahead.  The IoTs face exactly the same difficulties as the RCSI in marketing their qualifications abroad.  To give just two examples, Dublin Institute of Technology and Waterford Institute of Technology provide qualifications on a par with, if not better than, those offered by many of those institutions in the United Kingdom, for instance, which can call themselves universities.  It is unacceptable to facilitate one institution in this State at the expense of others and without addressing the broader issues of internationalisation and ensuring all our third level institutions can compete abroad and attract their fair share of foreign students.</p><p>We would like to work with the Minister on this issue, but the Bill before us today is absolutely the wrong way of approaching it.  It is for this reason, notwithstanding our support for the provisions in the Bill regarding grants for post leaving certificate students and transparency in the provision of educational data, that we are opposing the legislation.  The welcome provisions it contains are a very minor part of the Bill when stood beside the strange and dubious departure therein of allowing the RCSI to use the term &quot;university&quot; abroad when it does not qualify to do so here.  I have put forward a better solution whereby the RCSI would be permitted to call itself a medical university both at home and abroad.  That fine institution will never reach university status under the definition applied in this State because it includes only one discipline and does not have the scale required.  The solution I am proposing would allow it to use the same title at home as it does abroad, thereby addressing the issue the Minister is seeking to address in a sensible way and without throwing our entire classification system in the air.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-11-12a.256" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1196" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014111200021#V00500"><p>I voted against this Bill at an earlier Stage and find it regrettable that it has proceeded this far through the House.  We should be very careful in our dealings with the academic institutions of this country.  With negotiations on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ongoing, we are opening the door to foreign institutions coming here.  In addition, while I accept the Minister's bona fides with respect to the quality assurance of those institutions that will market their services outside this country, I am concerned that institutions which are registered in Europe and already meet the European criteria will not have to meet separate criteria in Ireland.</p><p>I welcome the Minister's indication that the Bill will come back to the House.  I hope we get a chance to have another bite at this particular cherry.  This is the wrong legislation at this time.</p></speech>

There is no way that an institution which operates abroad and is not awarding at that level under the Irish system would be given the designation of university.  The Bill contains a range of important measures, including provisions regarding support grants for students in PLC colleges.  There is more to these proposals than what is provided in respect of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.  The Bill is very restricted in terms of which institutions will be able to call themselves a university outside this country.  That will only be possible where they offer qualifications at doctorate level in Ireland.</p></speech>

This is a very important Bill supporting the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, dealing with student grants and preventing the development of a system of league tables at further education level.  I congratulate the Minister on bringing the Bill through the House.</p></speech>

She has raised issues of fundamental concern.  I am glad there is no guillotine on this Bill, because we have seen the ill effects of guillotines on legislation in the other House.  However, the Bill should not be completed today.  The Minister needs to give further thought to it.  Senator Power has raised the most serious issues in respect of the Bill.  These are serious issues of equity and fairness in terms of the south-eastern part of the country and other areas looking for university status when certain colleges are entitled to get that through Government action.  I think there is an inherent unfairness there.  The Minister should pause for thought, listen to what Senator Power has been saying about this legislation and let the people of Waterford and other regions know why one institution is being treated in a different way compared to the institution that, as Senator Power said-----</p></speech>

The Minister quite clearly addressed their concerns, has agreed to bring a number of amendments to the D&aacute;il based on proposals made by the aforementioned Senators and has said she will return to this House when the amendments have been passed by the D&aacute;il.  She explained the reason she could not bring the amendments forward today due to time constraints caused by her talks on other issues.  However, she will address a number of the amendments.</p></speech>

Quite frankly, it is just about money.  It is about the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland marketing itself abroad as a university because if it did not do so, the people it is hoping will come might not understand what its status was.  It reminds me of how, when one goes to the US as a Senator or Deputy, one has a much more enhanced status as a Senator than as a mere Deputy.  I suggest to those Senators who have not gone to the US that they do so, because-----</p></speech>

For example, Massachusetts Institute of Technology is a world-famous university that does not have the word "university" in its title.  Its reputation sells.  Why can RCSI, which is well known here, not market itself as RCSI abroad without being called a university?  It is a bit deceptive.  My concern is for international students and their families.  Down through the years and generations, the word "university" has conjured up the image of a higher qualification.  We know international students are being fooled here every day at the moment.  Colleges are closing without any regard for the concerns of students and their families and the amount of investment in them.  I share the concern that we are keeping this going by allowing RCSI to exist here under its current name while calling itself a university abroad.  Let us have a bit of standardisation on this.  Has it been considered that RCSI might apply for university status here, or is that just another big problem?  I ask the Minister to look at this because I know the Bill is going to the D&aacute;il.  It would be nice to be able to support this Bill, but the concerns articulated are worthy of consideration.</p></speech>

I know the Minister will consider them again.  There is a possibility that loopholes could leave the State open to challenge.  It is drafted too broadly and I hope this can be remedied when it comes before the D&aacute;il.  It treats RCSI much more leniently than Waterford Institute of Technology or Dublin Institute of Technology, which is a pity.  I wish the Minister well with it in the D&aacute;il.  I hope it comes back in an amended state, because that is why we put down the amendments.  There are flaws that Senators Power and Byrne and others have drawn attention to.</p></speech>

Senator Cummins will know that this region suffers the most because it is the only region in Ireland without a university.  The Minister has given an undertaking that she will look at the issue of a technological university for the south east, which is a very good thing.  However, it is very important to realise that a change is not occurring with RCSI.  It will still provide the same quality of education as before.  There is a change in terms of status in that we are allowing it to style itself as a university internationally.</p><p>I am speaking about Waterford Institute of Technology and Carlow Institute of Technology and the possible merger of those institutions at some stage in the future.  We cannot just merge them and call it a university without a significant upgrade in the standards that must be applied for those institutions.  I do not just want a name change for the south-eastern technological university.  I want a university that is able to stand up to scrutiny and provide courses of standing.  That is the difference here.  What is happening here will not have a major impact on RCSI, but there is a major job of work to be done, as we saw in the past couple of weeks when Waterford Institute of Technology withdrew from the conversation about the merger.  The south-eastern technological university must be a university of standing.  We cannot just merge them and change the name.</p></speech>

It has been a constructive debate.  I will return and have given an undertaking to Senator Barrett in particular that I intend to bring forward amendments in the D&aacute;il to in respect of some of the issues he raised.</p><p>In respect of the specifics around the naming of any institution outside the State as a university under this legislation, the qualifications are very rigorous in terms of qualification under the Irish system.  Senator Michael D'Arcy is right about technological universities.  It is important that the bar be high for any institution that can call itself a university inside or outside the State in terms of Irish qualifications and how we recognise them.  Waterford, Carlow and the other institutes of technology that are proposing to merge and become technological universities are very different.</p> <p>They have a large number of undergraduates and a wide range of courses and know it is important they reach certain standards.  This element of the legislation is tightly controlled in terms of how it can be used.  The Senator is right to name the Royal College of Surgeons, although it is not named in the Bill.  As far as we know, it is the institution that is likely to reach the required standard.  Nobody has questioned the standard of education or qualifications provided for within the Royal College of Surgeons.  I believe we are <i>ad idem</i>on much of this.  I will come back to the Seanad on the Bill.</p></speech>

We are seeing a new era in the seafood sector, and it is not without its challenges.</p><p>The introduction of a new Common Fisheries Policy took place on 1 January last.  I had the good fortune to be the Presidency of the Fisheries Council during the negotiations and I secured the agreement of both the European Parliament and the Council on an ambitious and forward looking new policy for the period to the end of 2022.</p><p>The economic value of fishing to Ireland continues to grow.  Landings into Ireland increased from 246,000 tonnes in 2010 to 280,000 tonnes in 2013, an increase of 14%.  However, over the same period the value of landings increased by 48%, from &euro;208 million to &euro;308 million.  The increasing trend of greater foreign landings into Ireland is a positive development for processing and support activities in our coastal communities.  In total, 78,000 tonnes of fish were landed from foreign vessels into our ports in 2013.  This development allows Ireland to benefit from the economic dividend that flows from such landings by way of increased economic activity in some of our most isolated coastal communities.</p><p>Irish seafood exports amounted to &euro;496 million in 2013.  This is a 7% decline on the 2012 export level.  However, this followed very strong growth of almost 65% in the value of exports in the 2009 to 2012 period.  Seafood exports to non-EU international markets such as Korea, China and Hong Kong continued to grow strongly in 2013, reaching &euro;175 million, which represents a value increase of approximately 7%.  Last week, I opened the largest ever Irish pavilion at the China Seafood &amp;amp; Fisheries Expo which is a showcase for the &euro;20 billion Chinese market.  Our seafood exports to China have risen by more than 300% since 2011, to reach &euro;18 million last year, and sales are up 56% in the first six months of this year.  We are well on our way to establishing a foothold in this huge market.  This strong future potential of the seafood industry is identified and acknowledged in the Government&rsquo;s Food Harvest 2020 national food production plan and in the marine strategy, Harvesting our Ocean Wealth 2020, and is being delivered through Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, and Bord Bia&rsquo;s strategies.</p><p>The over-arching goal of the new Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, is to end over-fishing and to make fishing sustainable &ndash; environmentally, economically and socially - thus resulting in a competitive and viable seafood sector for all.  I will outline some of the key features of the new CFP.</p><p>In respect of regionalisation, the new CFP will, over time, see an end to micro-management from Brussels and will bring the decision-making process closer to the fishing grounds, in particular to national administrations, fishermen and other interest groups.</p><p>The big new policy initiative relates to discards and the landing obligation.  A key element of the new CFP is the introduction of a phased ban on discards from boats.  The ban on discards in pelagic fisheries will come into effect on 1 January 2015 and is already set down in a regional discards plan for our fisheries.  At national level, a discards implementation working group, involving the fishing industry and chaired by Dr. Noel Cawley, has been established to facilitate the phasing in of the landing obligation, which will have its challenges.  A landing obligation for mixed whitefish will be phased in from 1 January 2016.  Current discard rates run at between 40% and 80%, depending on species and fishery.  We must face up to the challenge over the next 12 months but I am confident that, with all stakeholders working together, we can deliver the necessary change in fishing practices.  It is in everybody's interest in terms of building stocks for the future.</p><p>As regards sustainable fisheries and maximum sustainable yield, MSY, the other key element of the new CFP is the setting of fishing levels on the basis of the MSY principle.  Its application will be phased in, applying by 2015 where possible and by 2020, at the latest, for all stocks.  This will result in more fish being left in the sea to mature and reproduce, leading to increased abundance of fish and, over time, to higher quotas for everybody.</p><p>The EU Commission published its proposal for fishing opportunities for 2015 on 28 October.  In line with the new CFP, setting total allowable catches, TACs, in accordance with MSY is a challenge in the short term and will have to be implemented in a manner that takes into account the economic impacts on fishermen.  Some of the Commission proposals for 2015 are very severe for certain stocks.</p> <p>Some of the Commission proposals for 2015 are very severe for certain stocks.  It has proposed a 64% quota cut for Celtic Sea cod for 2015 and a 41% cut for haddock.  It has yet to make its proposal for the Celtic Sea whiting and prawn quotas for 2015.  I met the French fisheries Minister on Monday in Brussels and we agreed that we will work closely in the coming weeks in advance of the council meeting on issues of mutual interest, particularly Celtic Sea stocks.  On 2 December I intend to lay before the Oireachtas a sustainability impact assessment on the quota proposals and present it to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  At council, I will vigorously oppose any cuts which are not fully justified and supported by science and I look forward to a productive discussion to inform our negotiations at the December fisheries council.</p><p>I know there are concerns in the House with regard to aquaculture licensing.  Irish aquaculture is at a crossroads, with many challenges to overcome to realise its full potential.  The global projections for the expansion of aquaculture are very strong.  Realising the industry&rsquo;s full potential is difficult and has proved elusive over many years.  The need to eliminate the licensing backlog is one of the key challenges currently facing the industry.  The licensing backlog arises primarily from a 2007 European Court of Justice judgment against Ireland for breaches of EU birds and habitats directives.  As most aquaculture activity takes place in areas designated as special areas of conservation or special protection areas for birds, it is necessary to gather scientific data over a number of years and then set conservation objectives for the bays.  After that, an &quot;appropriate assessment&quot; of the effects of aquaculture activity on these areas is required before any new licences can be issued or any existing licences can be renewed.  This process is very resource-intensive and represents a major investment by the State to ensure the continued sustainable development of the aquaculture industry.</p><p>My Department, together with the Marine Institute and the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, has been engaged in a major programme to gather the necessary baseline data appropriate to the conservation objectives of aquaculture sites located within designated &quot;Natura&quot; areas.  In 2012, 115 licence determinations were achieved in &quot;non-Natura&quot; areas and in 2013, 137 licence determinations were made primarily in &quot;Natura&quot; sites.  Progress is being made as, until 2012, there had been no licensing decisions relating to aquaculture for a number of years.  It is likely that licence determinations in 2014 will be significantly less than the previous year, due primarily to the delay in the provision of final appropriate assessments in respect of which there is broad consensus between the Marine Institute and the NPWS on the scientific inputs.  This delay reflects the ongoing complexity inherent in the overall process.  However, 2015 will see a significant and sustained increase in licence determinations, and in the order of 120 determinations are projected for the first quarter of 2015 alone.  It is expected to achieve licence determinations in respect of Donegal Bay, Dungarvan Harbour, Clew Bay, Valentia and Portmagee Channel, Lough Swilly and Galway Bay in the first half of 2015.</p><p>An application by Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, for an aquaculture licence for the cultivation of fin fish near Inis O&iacute;rr in Galway Bay was received by my Department in 2012.  The application and its accompanying environmental impact statement are being considered under the relevant legislation.  BIM is also examining the feasibility of sites off the coast of Mayo but no licence application has been received by my Department in this regard.  As the Galway Bay application is under active consideration as part of the statutory process, it would not be appropriate to comment further on that application.</p><p>My Department owns, maintains and directly manages six fishery harbour centres.  This network of harbours is strategically located around our coast to provide state-of-the art facilities and infrastructure for the increasingly mobile and large-scale Irish and EU fishing industry.  A total of 237,000 tonnes of fish was landed into the six fishery harbour centres in 2013, representing 85% of all fish landings into Ireland.  The value of fish landed into the fishery harbour centres increased from &euro;137 million in 2010 to &euro;227 million in 2013.  The fishery harbour centres underpin the Government strategy to further develop a modern offshore fishing fleet and a modern onshore processing industry.  From 2011 to 2013, &euro;17.2 million has been invested in developing and maintaining the fishery harbour centres.  In March this year, I allocated &euro;11.63 million towards safety, maintenance and new development works in 2014 at the six fishery harbour centres in addition to infrastructural improvement works at north harbour at Cape Clear in west Cork.</p><p>Ireland needs to attract a greater proportion of the 1.2 billion tonnes of fish caught in waters around Ireland to be landed and processed here.  The development of our fishery harbour centres is a critical part of achieving that objective.  The 65% increase in the value of landings into the fishery harbour centres between 2010 and 2013 is a strong indication that the historic and ongoing investment in the six fishery harbour centres is producing dividends.  Foreign landings into the six fishery harbour centres in 2013 were up by 25% from 1,040 tonnes in 2010 to 1,305 tonnes in 2013.  Continued development and investment in harbour facilities around our coast remains a high priority for me, subject to the availability of Exchequer funds.</p><p>There is a wide consensus regarding the enormous potential of the seafood sector to grow sustainably in the years ahead.  There are also many challenges that need to be addressed.  Much investment will need to happen in the years ahead to equip our processing industry to increasingly add value to commodity products.  Investment will be needed in our aquaculture sector to grow output after recent years of stalled production and in our fishing fleet and landing sites to adjust to the discards ban under the new Common Fisheries Policy, CFP.  We will need to invest in the science that underpins our industry and meet increasing demands to ensure environmental sustainability.  We need to invest in improving our oversight and monitoring of the industry, as we will see the consequences for any failure in these areas.</p><p>Earlier this year, I announced that I had secured for our industry &euro;148 million from the new European Maritime and Fisheries Fund.  In budget 2015, I announced national co-funding that will bring the total fund available for the new seafood development programme for the period 2014 to 2020 to &euro;241 million.  This is a doubling of the investment funds available compared with the previous CFP period.  My Department has been working since 2013 on developing the new programme and I would expect to see new support measures being launched from 2015 onwards.</p><p>In May I announced a &euro;1 million package of measures for the inshore fishing sector, which has been neglected for far too long.  Uptake in the lobster v-notch scheme is improving after I increased in May  the grant rate from 55% to 75%.  I now expect to see a doubling in the numbers of lobsters v-notched in 2013.  I also announced the establishment of the National Inshore Fisheries Forum, based on a network of regional forums to foster industry-led regional and national development of proposals for the sector.  The first regional forums have been held and the first National Inshore Fisheries Forum will be held in early December.  I hope I have managed to convey a broad perspective on the challenges and opportunities facing our fisheries industries and the progress made to date.   I look forward to hearing your views and questions.</p></speech>

It is important that at least once or twice per year we have a debate on this valuable industry in the House.  It is high time that at senior political and government level we examine the appallingly bad deal we got with the fish quotas from 1973.</p> <p>Successive governments seem to have given up on the notion of ever revisiting or trying to renegotiate or get a better deal on quotas for Irish fishermen.  It is a millstone around our necks historically, and we are a very compliant nation.  Our fishermen are probably the most policed and compliant fishermen in the whole of the EU.  A Cabinet committee led by the Taoiseach should at least embark on an investigation of the possibility of getting a better deal for our quotas.  To give one simple example, in our Irish waters our fishermen have 8% of the monkfish quota, whereas the French have 50%.  I could give several other examples.  This is the message I am getting from fishermen in the west of Ireland, in west Cork, Donegal and other areas.</p><p>This nation took a hit when we saved Europe in the banking crisis, yet we seem to be giving up the fight for our fishermen and for rights to the fish in Irish waters, not internationally.  Irish fishermen, particularly in the polyvalent and  whitefish fleets, want to fish ecologically.  They are very anxious to work with the Marine Institute, which they are doing, and to manage their fishing methods and fishing effort, as opposed to the set-up that is currently in place.  A vessel can catch all kinds of whitefish in the same trawl and the same area, so sometimes when they pull up their trawl they might have 40% megrim, 35% cod, 15% whiting, etc.  If they are over quota, that is where the difficulty comes up.  </p><p>I had the good fortune to meet a Spanish fisherman who was landing fish in Castletownbere this summer while on a seven-day trip.  As an example of how this works the wrong way, in my view, he had to dump 27 tonnes of whitefish, approximately &euro;70,000 worth.  There were no quotas for certain species.  The message I am getting from the Irish fishing industry is that there should be fewer fishing days and less effort, which might consequently overcome the difficulty we are having.  I do not know how the new discard proposals will deal with that trawlerman who landed the fish in Ireland, and vessels landing and processing fish here are very welcome.  It is an awful waste when &euro;70,000 worth of fish is dumped.  </p><p>Would the Minister consider adopting an approach whereby there would be fewer days at sea and less fishing effort as a compromise?  The Marine Institute is listening closely to the fishermen, but at Government level and possibly at the Minister's end, there seems to be no wish to go down that route.  </p><p>In the pelagic section, the mackerel quota system seems currently to be in a mess.  Brussels and Europe capitulated to the problem that the Faroe Islands put forward.  Not alone did the Faroese get a huge mackerel quota, they are now entitled to come and fish in European waters.  That was an overreaction by Europe, and Irish fishermen in the pelagic section fear that it will have a knock-on effect on the quotas we can expect to get.  </p><p>Normally, 80% or 85% of the mackerel quota is allocated in the springtime and there is a 15% or 20% reserve to be given out in the autumn.  I am hearing that the Irish fishing boats, which are not the biggest in Europe, would prefer to have the option of fishing the mackerel in the spring when the weather is benign, rather than chasing the mackerel shoals up off the coast of Scotland late in the year, when the weather is not the best and our fishing vessels put themselves at risk.</p><p>There seems to be an emerging trend whereby a lot of Celtic Sea herring is now being landed in Northern Ireland.  Is there a better price available, or why is that trend emerging?  Irish fish caught in the Celtic Sea are being landed outside this jurisdiction.  I am of the view that any fish caught in Irish waters, whether it is landed in Scotland, Norway or wherever, will give us better value if it can be landed here, and if some of it is processed here.  As I said, we are a very compliant nation.  Is it the case that some of these vessels are being very strictly policed in the Republic of Ireland and so are landing where conditions are more benign?</p><p>Perhaps the Minister could outline whether the proposed sea fisheries Bill, which I believe has been introduced, will be dealt with during the life of this Government?  There was a commitment given on that during the 2007 election.  It was recognised that the 2006 Bill was very draconian and severe, and it was promised that some amendments to ameliorate the severity of that Bill would be tabled during the life of this Government. </p><p>Regarding problems in the inshore fishing sector, I have recently met a number of people in the west Cork area who are involved in fishing scallop.  They feel that the goalposts keep being moved regarding the scientific checking and testing of the scallop industry.  Inshore fisherman are unfortunately not very well organised.  Their catch varies depending on the time of year; they are sometimes fishing for lobster and in the winter they fish for scallop and shrimp.  I have never yet heard of any of these fishermen - some of them with young families trying to survive - availing of the fish assist scheme.  I know that is under the Department of Social Protection, but I asked a senior official in that Department, and I have never yet come across a fisherman who has availed of this backup if the weather is bad or he is tied up for some time.</p><p>The Minister referred to the amount of money spent on the fishery harbours, and that is welcome.  There are a lot of positives in his statement and I am not here to be totally critical, although I have certain questions to raise.  It would be remiss of me not to remember my west Cork colleague, the former Minister for Agriculture and Food, Joe Walsh, who was buried yesterday in his native Ahiohill.  In his time as a Deputy, a Minister and a Senator of this House, he did so much to promote the fishing industry in West Cork.  He was a political catalyst for the &euro;40 million spent in the development of Castletownbere Harbour, which took a few years to come to pass and is now done.  He was also influential in bringing about the &euro;65 million transformation of the whitefish fleet back in the late 1990s.  Sometimes in politics we all hear the negative side, but Joe Walsh never forgot the fishing communities.</p><p>There are many challenges facing the fishing industry.  It is frightening to hear from the Minister that he recently had a meeting with the French Minister dealing with huge cuts in the quotas - coming up on 40% or 50% - that are being proposed for certain fish.  I am sure that when the Minister is going out before Christmas to do the annual negotiation of stocks and quotas, we will all support him in wearing the green jersey and getting the best deal possible for the fishermen.  That is extremely important.  It is also important that the four remaining fish processing factories in the country - two of which, the Castletownbere fishermen's co-op and the one in Baltimore, are in west Cork - be sustained to create onshore jobs.  There is no doubt that the extra fish landings that are coming in, sometimes by foreign vessels, are creating jobs in these factories.  Castletownbere and the Beara Peninsula are nearly 90% dependent on the fishing industry.  Take fishing away from Castletownbere and the whole community is dead.</p><p>I wish the Minister well in his dealings with Europe.  It seems to be a constant battle and I hope that when the negotiations are taking place, just as Christmas dawns, the results will be positive for him and for the country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-11-12a.289" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1124" speakername="Michael Comiskey" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014111200026#AA00200"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for giving his time to discuss this most important matter of fisheries. Ireland's fisheries are a vital part of our economy.  As an island nation, Ireland has always recognised the importance of fishing, both economically and socially.  In the past and still today, fisheries have provided necessary employment for those living along the coastline.  The natural, clean water around Ireland's coastline has proved particularly bountiful for seafood for thousands of years.</p> <p>It is important to protect this in the future.</p><p>The seafood industry contributes approximately &euro;700 million annually to our national income and employs 11,000 people, mainly in coastal counties from Donegal around the country to Louth.  There are four main activities under the auspices of the Irish seafood industry - fishing, fish farming, processing and marketing.  The top fishing ports in Ireland are Killybegs, Castletownbere, Dingle, Dunmore East and Kilmore Quay, but fishing vessels also land at various small ports around the coast.  Aquaculture activity includes growing finfish, such as salmon and trout, and shellfish farming, including the cultivation of mussels, oysters and scallops.  With regard to processing, seafood companies produce high value products from salmon, whitefish, shellfish and pelagic fish species, such as herring, mackerel and horse mackerel, all of which yield substantial export earnings for the sector.  As regards marketing, Irish seafood is sold at home, to the value of &euro;340 million, and in international markets in Europe, Africa and the Far East, where exports are valued at &euro;375 million.</p><p>In light of this, it is important that we strive to do all we can to protect the coastal environment, fish stocks and jobs in the industry for the sake of future generations.  Modern fishing vessels and fishing methods can pose risks to the fisheries sector.  Commercial trawlers can now travel long distances across the ocean and some are fitted with hydraulically powered winches with the ability to scoop up several tonnes of fish in a single net.  During much of the 20th century, continuous fishing and marine pollution pushed some fish stocks to the brink of extinction, making it necessary to regulate the fishing industry.</p><p>Today, the interests of Irish fishermen, fishing communities and consumers of fish products are supported through the EU's Common Fisheries Policy.  The Common Fisheries Policy is negotiated and agreed between all 28 member states, and initiatives that promote sustainable fishing are encouraged and part funded by the European fisheries fund.  Following three years of considerable review and consultation with industry representatives, and negotiations between the European Commission, member states and MEPs, the Common Fisheries Policy was substantially reformed in 2014 and is now financially supported through a new European maritime and fisheries fund.</p><p>The main aim of the Common Fisheries Policy is to protect the seafood industry and the marine environment for future generations.  The Common Fisheries Policy sets out the rules for managing European fishing fleets and for conserving fish stocks.  It is designed to manage a common resource, the sea, and it gives all European fishing fleets equal access to EU waters and fishing grounds and allows fishermen to compete fairly.  While fish stocks may be renewable, they are limited.  Some fish stocks are being over-fished.  As a result, EU countries have taken action to ensure the European fishing industry is sustainable and does not threaten the fish population size and productivity in the long term.</p><p>The CFP was first introduced in the 1970s and went through successive updates, the most recent of which took effect on 1 January 2014.  The CFP aims to ensure that fishing and aquaculture are environmentally, economically and socially sustainable and that they provide a source of healthy food for EU citizens.  Its aim is to foster a dynamic fishing industry and to ensure a fair standard of living for fishing communities.  The current policy stipulates that between 2015 and 2020 catch limits should be set that are sustainable and maintain fish stocks in the long term.  It is submitted that the impact of fishing on the fragile marine environment is not fully understood.  As a result, the CFP has taken a cautious approach which recognises the impact of human activity on all elements of the ecosystem.  It endeavours to make fishing fleets more selective in what they catch and to eliminate the practice of discarding unwanted fish.  The reform also changes the way in which the CFP is managed, thereby giving EU countries greater control at national and regional level.</p><p>This new policy puts fishermen at the core of developing conservation measures for fisheries in which they are involved and also makes specific references to taking account of the needs of our fishermen.  Under the new regional approach, Ireland works with fellow member states, the UK, France, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands, on developing appropriate measures for fisheries in the north-western waters.  This group works closely with the North Western Waters Regional Advisory Council and the Pelagic Advisory Council.  A discards plan for pelagic stocks in north-western waters is being finalised, as the landing obligation applies to these stocks from 1 January 2015.  Work on a plan for whitefish stocks has commenced to provide for the landing obligation which commences on 1 January 2016.  This work is being carried out in consultation with the advisory council.</p><p>The European Commission published its annual consultation paper in June 2014 on fishing opportunities for 2015 under the Common Fisheries Policy, setting out its views on the state of the stocks and the principles to be used when setting the fishing opportunities for 2015.  The terms, conditions and quotas for 2015 will be determined at the December Fisheries Council.  There are key issues for Ireland as we approach this Council.  One is how the Commission will take account of the new data indicating significant recruitment of cod and haddock in the Celtic Sea.  We wish to have clear commitments from the Commission that this data will be taken into account in the December negotiations, to avoid a situation where vessels will have to discard in the spring in the absence of sensible quotas reflecting the reality of the stocks.  The second is use of the precautionary approach when no scientific advice is available for the stock.  If strictly implemented, this could result in unnecessary cuts in TACs and quotas.  Third is the phasing in of the maximum rate of the fishing mortality objective.  Our view is that this must be achieved on a progressive and incremental basis as laid down in the CFP.  There are concerns that the Commission might seek to accelerate this process unnecessarily.</p><p>I welcome the meeting that was held earlier this month between the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the French Fisheries Minister, Alain Vidalies, in Brussels.  The meeting was organised to prepare for negotiations on the 2015 fish quotas ahead of the Fisheries Council.  This was the first meeting between the Minister and Mr. Vidalies.  France and Ireland have important shared fisheries in the Celtic Sea.  The Irish and French fishing industries have a strong working relationship and it is important that we ensure this relationship is fully reflected at political level.</p><p>In conclusion, Irish fisheries are a very important element of the Irish economy and society.  It is important that we do our best to ensure their continued growth and prosperity.  I congratulate the Minister on his work in China over the last couple of weeks.  Finally, I agree with Senator O'Donovan that we must also look after the small-scale fishermen who go out fishing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-11-12a.291" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1122" speakername="Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014111200027#BB00200"><p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  There are many issues I wish to raise, but on the point Senator Comiskey made about looking after the smaller fishermen I agree with Senator O'Donovan that we should consider trying to renegotiate the quotas at EU level.  However, the Minister has control over an element of the domestic quota, but 87% of the quota is controlled by 23 boats in the north west of the country.  That could and should be addressed.  Some people in the industry say that even a small re-balancing of that quota could create a couple of hundred jobs in the processing sector in the west and south west.  It could rejuvenate the fishing and processing industry throughout the country, and it would support smaller fishermen and the coastal communities in a better way.  It is time that the Minister tackled the golden circle in the fishing industry and secured the future for a new generation of fishermen and women.  Perhaps the Minister would explain the rationale in his Department for the distribution of domestic quota and why he has not addressed this historical imbalance.</p><p>Will the Minister comment on the implications of the deal that has been done with Iceland and the Faroe Islands in respect of the mackerel quotas?  The quota has increased here as well, but the market has been flooded by cheap product which is having an impact on the profitability of the Irish fleet.</p><p>There was a very good Oireachtas joint committee report on fisheries and sustainable rural coastal and island communities.  It made 29 recommendations with regard to rural coastal and island communities and their socio-economic profile, existing policy and licensing regimes, and developing strategies for rural and island communities.  What steps has the Minister taken to date to implement these recommendations?</p><p>What is the Minister doing to tackle the scourge of the factory ships that are hoovering up fish off our west coast?</p> <p>I was talking to somebody involved in the industry who yesterday was looking at the AIS and monitoring boats off the coast of counties Clare, Mayo and Galway.  There were a number of boats there, predominantly Dutch.  Holland has a smaller quota than ours, but its boats seem to be fishing in the area all year round.  Will the Minister tell us what policing is being engaged in of these boats?  Irish boat owners believe they are being hammered by regulations, while it appears a blind eye is being turned to these factory ships.  How does the Minister intend to address this issue?  I am also told anecdotally that a Spanish vendor who buys fish in Spain has bought fish from some of these operators, including, for example, hake, for which they do not have a quota.  There appear to be huge issues around the way some of these ships are operating.</p><p>People involved in the industry, including smaller and pelagic fishermen, are very concerned about the upcoming negotiations in Brussels on the distribution of quotas.  They are particularly worried about the potential closing of the prawns fishery in the Aran grounds and calling on the Minister not to sacrifice this quota in the upcoming negotiations.  They are also calling on him to keep these areas open and carry out more detailed research in the next 12 months into abundance densities.  This could be done in conjunction with local fishermen and would, they believe, give a more accurate picture of stock levels.  </p><p>Will the Minister clarify the position on the development of a deep water pier at Rosaveel?  I understand there is also work to be done there on a slip which has been promised but not begun yet.</p><p>Iascaire Int&iacute;re &Eacute;ireann is a group that represents small-scale inshore fishermen who have asked to meet the Minister on a number of occasions but have not yet been successful in doing so.  I understand a number of meetings were cancelled.  Will the Minister tell the House why the meetings were cancelled and also why they have not been rescheduled?  It is because he has an issue with the organisation?  Is there a reason he does not want to meet its representatives?</p><p>The issue of social protection supports has been raised.  The joint sub-committee's report makes specific recommendations in this regard as existing social welfare law considers fishermen to be self-employed.  Owing to the low take-up of the voluntary class &quot;P&quot; PRSI contribution, the sub-committee has recommended that a re-examination of access to jobseeker's benefit, illness benefit and other social welfare benefits for such fishermen be undertaken.  Fishermen whose boats are tied up for periods of time due to bad weather or other issues do not receive sufficient support from the Department of Social Protection to help them through these difficult patches.  What is the Minister doing to address these issues?  Why have we not seen measures in successive budgets to address them?</p></speech>

It particularly affects smaller fishermen.  Will the Minister outline what his Department is doing in this regard?  lascaire Int&iacute;re &Eacute;ireann is also very critical of the fishery management plans that have been put in place.</p><p>On compensation for storm damage, the lobster pot replacement scheme did not really deliver for fishermen who had lost gear, their vessels damaged and suffered a loss of income due to storms.  A scheme introduced in the North seemed to be more comprehensive and practical.  Perhaps the Minister might look at it.  Eibhl&iacute;n O'Sullivan of the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation, ISWFPO, has reiterated a request for a compensation scheme for demersal fishermen using EMFF as other member states such as the United Kingdom have done.   Is it envisaged that such an application will be made?  </p><p>The Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation is also concerned that the seafood sector is once again facing significant job losses as a result of the proposed quota cuts.  Ahead of the annual Council of Ministers meeting in Brussels in December, the European Commission has issued its proposals for quotas for 2015.  They include significant reductions for a number of key species, both whitefish and pelagic.  It is estimated that in the region of &euro;70 million could be lost to the seafood sector, with a further sum of &euro;147 million.  It is submitted that the majority of those not directly involved in the fishing industry do not realise that in the past few years a significant number of Irish fishermen have been forced to leave the industry and are now unemployed.  The ISWFPO has serious concerns in that regard and has I understand written to the Minister.  It also notes that recent international events in Nigeria and Russia have had a cataclysmic impact on the prices Irish fishermen are receiving for their pelagic products.</p><p>Another issue revolves around the landing obligations being brought in at the beginning of 2015.  This will mean that all fish caught must be landed, which will cause particular problems for smaller vessels as they will have to return to shore more frequently and may find themselves exceeding quotas and being penalised as a result.  It is also unclear what is to be done with excess fish landed and fish not part of quota.  There is great uncertainty and we hope the Minister can clarify matters.</p><p>Will the Minister outline the status of the Galway Bay fish farm project in the light of very serious concerns highlighted by the local community about the size, environmental impact and safety of the proposed fish farm, the serious questions raised internationally about the scientific evidence brought forward by BIM and the concerns aired by Inland Fisheries Ireland?  Will the Minister now rule out this particular development in one of our greatest tourist assets?  Surely, the ferocity of the winter storms should be reason enough to pull back from a project which has raised so many concerns.</p><p>I apologise to the Cathaoirleach for continuing, but we have been waiting to have this debate for a long time.  The development of aquaculture in Ireland is a shambles because of the major backlog that has been highlighted.  We have also seen very questionable practices engaged in by some operators in relation to planning regulations.</p></speech>

Safety at sea is important, particularly in small communities such as the one in the south of Wexford with which I am familiar where a number of serious accidents have occurred at sea, resulting in significant loss of life.  The quality of the fleet, particularly smaller vessels, is important.</p><p>On the Minister's contribution, he started by hailing the dawn of a new era for the seafood industry.  I come to this debate more from the perspective of a consumer than as someone who is an expert on fisheries.  Listening to what the Minister had to say, I was somewhat disturbed by a number of things.  He referred to the fact that the economic value of fishing to Ireland was continuing to grow, increasing from 246,000 tonnes in 2010 to 280,000 tonnes in 2013.  I was prepared to be impressed until I discovered that the total tonnage caught in Irish waters amounted to 1.2 billion tonnes.  We are not at the races in terms of the volume of fish actually caught in Irish waters according to the Minister's own statement.  He has said Ireland must attract a greater proportion of the 1.2 billion tonnes of fish caught in Irish waters and have them landed and processed here.  He said landings in Ireland had increased from 246,000 tonnes to 280,000 tonnes while noting that the six harbours managed by his Department handled 85% of all stocks landed in Ireland.</p></speech>

We are trying to ensure non-Irish fishing boats fishing in Irish waters land more fish in Ireland and have had some success in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-11-12a.305" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1172" speakername="Aideen Hayden" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014111200028#CC01400"><p>My understanding from what the Minister said is that he is trying to attract a greater proportion of the 1.2 billion tonnes of fish caught in Irish waters.  I take it, therefore, that 1.2 billion tonnes of fish are, in fact, caught in Irish waters.  The Minister says that of the stocks caught by the Irish fleet, 85% are landed at the six fishery harbours controlled by his Department.  That amounts to a total of 237,000 tonnes of fish.</p><p>I am coming at this matter from the following perspective.  The accusation has been made during the years that aquaculture and fisheries have been neglected in favour of agriculture.</p> <p>There is no doubt when one looks at some of the household names, such as Kerry Group, Glanbia, Greencore and so forth, we are talking about a different style and extent of the two industries.</p><p>I find it amazing that fish is expensive for the consumer to buy.  Yesterday evening I went into my local SuperValu to get something for the dinner.  I was able to buy a chicken for &euro;5, a piece of bacon for &euro;4 and a small tray of mince for &euro;4 but I could not have bought enough fish to feed myself for &euro;4 let alone enough fish to feed my family.  I cannot understand that situation.  The fishermen that I know do not benefit from that kind of pricing policy.  Therefore, I am at a loss to understand why fish is so expensive in comparison with other products that I can buy in my local supermarket and yet we talk about the amount of support we give the fishing industry.  </p><p>Do we need a symbol like the Bord Bia symbol of quality?  Fish products could carry a symbol, particularly frozen products, informing consumers whether products have been sustainably sourced, fished, come from Irish waters and caught by Irish fishermen.  </p><p>I wish to mention the amount of money we spend on fishing.  Earlier the Minister said that in budget 2015 he announced a new seafood development programme for the period 2014 to 2020 that would cost &euro;241 million.  That is six years.  I hate to say this but more money is spent on the yachting industry in this country than on the seafood development programme.  Consumers want a better offering of fish.  The quality of fish is excellent but the price being charged is high when compared with other foods.  I hope the Minister's negotiations with the beef industry went well today.</p></speech>

Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.</p><p>I shall start where Senator Hayden has left off and mention a theme which has emerged in agriculture and fisheries which I hope the Minister defends stridently.  He is beginning to favour the big guy completely over the small guy.  In agriculture that means the meat processor is being favoured over the beef farmer and, in fisheries, the big companies are being favoured over the inshore fishermen or the angler.  I shall not draw generalisations but I have my concerns about the matter.</p><p>Today, I shall focus on the Galway Bay fishfarm project.  As he will know, we had an Adjournment debate on the matter in this House.  I put my cards on the table by saying that I am quite happy for the Galway Bay fishfarm project to proceed if it has a sound scientific basis, the project is sound environmentally and it does not displace other equally valuable industry be it the inshore fisherman or the angler.  Does the Minister have a difficulty with any of my comments?  I would like to hear his answer.</p><p>I have two specific questions on the Galway Bay fishfarm project.  I shall not ask him to comment on the licence because I heard him say he will make a decision on it in early 2015.  The environmental impact statement for the proposed Galway Bay salmon farm does not mention an amoebic gill disease or where fresh water would be sourced from to treat 15,000 tonnes of farm salmon should they become infected with this disease.  That is the scale of the project being considered for Galway Bay.  Can the Minister tell me where a salmon farm operator would legally acquire the huge amount of fresh water required to treat this huge amount of fish?</p><p>In light of the fact that amoebic gill disease has been endemic in most of the salmon farms along the west coast over the past number of years, and has caused high mortality rates in farmed salmon, what effect might the disease have on other marine species in the bays and estuaries where salmon farms are located?  I refer to the fish that inshore fishermen rely on for their livelihood such as cod, whiting, mackerel, herring, turbot, salmon, wild salmon and seatrout among others.  What research studies has the Marine Institute carried out to determine the effect this disease may be having on these wild marine species?  I am a huge advocate of the Marine Institute.  It is located beside me in Oranmore.  I know that it carries out extremely positive and good research.  Has it researched the effects of this disease?  If so, then I ask the Minister to respond on that issue. </p><p>Earlier I said that I want the fishfarm to proceed if it has a sound scientific basis, is environmentally sound and does not displace other industry in this area.  Has the Department assessed the impact the project will have on angling and tourism?  Does the impact matter to the Department?  I look forward to hearing answers from the Minister.</p></speech>

He stated that the economic value of fishing to Ireland continues to grow and instanced that fish landings have increased from 246,000 tonnes in 2010 to 280,000 tonnes in 2013, an increase of 14% for which I am thankful.  I also noticed he specifically stated &quot;that the value of landings increased by 48%, from &euro;208 million to &euro;308 million&quot; which is more good news.  He also said, &quot;In total, 78,000 tonnes of fish were landed from foreign vessels into our ports in 2013.&quot;  Is there a possibility that a portion of that 78,000 tonnes could be taken in by our own fishermen?  Is a quota stipulated for them?  Could other fishermen with more vessels capture part of the 78,000 tonnes?<br/>The Minister continued, &quot;Seafood exports to non-EU international markets such as Korea, China and Hong Kong continued to grow strongly in 2013, reaching &euro;175 million, which represents a value increase of approximately 7%.&quot;  That leaves us in no doubt that the world is a small place, is getting smaller and there is greater access to the Far East.  I believe there is a major market for our fish in the Far East and that we can increase our exports to the region.  He further stated, &quot;We are well on our way to establishing a foothold in this huge market.&quot;  I agree wholeheartedly with him that the region can provide us with great opportunities to supply fish and seafood and that we should avail of those opportunities. <br/>I come from Carlingford and Carlingford Lough is renowned for its oysters all over the world.  As the Minister stated: <blockquote>Irish aquaculture is at a crosswords at present, with many challenges to overcome in order to realise its full potential.  The need to eliminate the licensing backlog is one of the key challenges currently facing the industry.</blockquote>Are there other challenges that hold back the seafood industry from reaching its full potential?  <br/>The Minister continued, &quot;The licensing backlog arises primarily from a 2007 European Court of Justice judgment against Ireland for breaches of EU birds and habitats directives.&quot;  Perhaps the Minister will comment on that issue.</p> <p>I acknowledge and welcome the progress that is being made in this regard, with a significant and sustained increase in licensing determinations expected next year.  This is good news for fishermen, with in the order of 120 determinations projected in the first quarter alone.</p><p>Is there an opportunity for apprentices to be employed in the shellfishing sector?  There are many seafaring families living along our coast whose young people would be interested in getting that type of start.  There is great potential for jobs in this sector, including in the area where I live.  An uncle of mine, the Lord be good to him, was a famous fisherman at a time when Carlingford Lough was renowned for its herring and mackerel fishing.  In the days when it was a distribution centre, I remember one could often not see the harbour for all the fishing boats.  They were 20 abreast and full of fish.  That business has gone to Clogherhead, Skerries and elsewhere, but opportunities are there in lots of places and we should capitalise on them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-11-12a.312" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014111200030#EE00200"><p>I thank Senators for their contributions.  I will try to answer as many questions as I can, but Members should submit any I do not get to in writing and I will try to get to them in due course.</p><p>In terms of foreign landings, as I explained, Irish waters have significant fish stocks and the Irish fleet catches a certain percentage and volume - in the region of 17% to 20% - of those stocks.  The remainder is caught by foreign fleets, including Dutch, Spanish, French, British, Portuguese and so on.  That happens because Irish waters are seen in a European context and from a fishing perspective as European waters.  As a member state of the EU, we have a responsibility in terms of sovereign territory, enforcement and so on.  International fleets move between various different waters at European level and there have always been large Spanish, French and Dutch fishing fleets working in what are now Irish waters.  In fact, Irish marine territory has expanded significantly since we joined the EU.  There might be a debate to be had on another day about the historical context but people need to be realistic about what is possible.  My job is to represent the industry on the basis of the facts and what is possible to do rather than pretending we can suddenly and fundamentally change the way in which quotas are allocated at an EU level.  That is not going to happen any time soon.</p><p>Reference was made to the 78,000 tonnes of foreign landings.  This is the portion of the 1.2 billion tonnes that we are encouraging to be landed into Irish ports for processing, grading and adding value in packaging and marketing in Irish processing facilities in places like Castletownbere, Rossaveal, Killybegs, Greencastle and so on.  While we will continue to welcome foreign trawlers into Irish ports to increase economic activity there, my preference, of course, is to ensure Irish boats catch as much fish as they can sustainably and within the rules.  After that, however, it makes sense for Ireland to position itself as a major fish processor internationally because we are surrounded by very fertile fishing grounds.  It makes sense to encourage Spanish,  Dutch and French boats to land close to where the fish are being caught, thereby generating income for Irish people.</p><p>I take the point that was made regarding Carlingford Lough.  There are challenges in terms of making sure we have a credible and legally sound licensing system that includes the benefit of a full environmental assessment of the area concerned and of the impact of increased aquaculture activity in that area.  We are trying, where possible, to move through all of the different harbours and bays that need to be assessed so that we can have that type of sound aquaculture licensing system.  This applies to Carlingford Lough as to lots of other areas.</p><p>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames had several questions.  First, I am not sure where the idea comes from that I am favouring the big guy.  My style is to tell people the story as I see it rather than what they want to hear.  When I wear my agriculture hat I am primarily about supporting farming and agriculture in this country, while as Minister with responsibility for the marine I have a primary focus on the fishing industry.  We have worked very hard through both a Common Agricultural Policy process and a Common Fisheries Policy process to ensure those primary production sectors are well supported.  I work night and day to that end.  I am about to attend a meeting of the beef forum which will seek to resolve a range of issues for farmers and ensure we move away from protest and towards a focus on selling high-quality and fairly-priced produce into the marketplace.  The bottom line is that we export almost 90% of everything we produce in food and drink and, as such, we must find a market outside of Ireland.  Reputation, standards and cost competitiveness are important if we are to have a sound and growing industry.  Within that, we must ensure there is fairness for primary producers.</p></speech>

In each Budget Statement he has delivered, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, has referred directly to agriculture and farming at the very outset.  The evidence of our commitment is there to see in the growth of the sector.  Problems remain and we will continue to deal with them as they arise.  Arising from our discussions in the beef forum later this afternoon, I am hopeful we will be able to deal with the problems farmers are facing in the beef sector.</p><p>I will not comment on any single application for which I have a statutory responsibility in terms of licensing determination.  All I will say is that I will not grant any license that is not legally and environmentally sound and does not have all of the necessary science and data attached to it.  The Galway Bay project is no different from any other in that regard.  Anybody who claims I have somehow allowed projects through without significant scrutiny understands neither the process nor my record.  In fact, I have not granted a single salmon-farming project licence in the three and a half years I am in office.  I want to see a sustainable aquaculture industry in Ireland which encompasses both finfish farming and shellfish farming.  We have a phenomenal resource around our coastline but it needs to be looked after from an environmental perspective, which requires a strict licensing and monitoring regime.  That is being done and will continue to be done under my stewardship.</p><p>Senator Aideen Hayden spoke about marine safety, an issue that is close to my heart.  We have done a great deal of work in this area in recent years, including on the personal location device initiative to which she referred.  This was a joint initiative launched between my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport at Union Hall under my stewardship and that of the then  Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar.  A major part of it involves the promotion of the use of life-jackets, with a significant grant aid package for personal locational devices linked into that.  Ultimately, there must be self-regulation for fishermen.  We are not going to have inspectors on board fishing boats every day.  Fishermen, like farmers, live lives where they must self-regulate to a significant extent.</p> <p>They are out at sea day and night and most of the time nobody is watching them.  The attitude to safety must change in the fisheries industry and life jackets must be worn.  We are pushing hard on that and we are approaching the conclusion of a new set of fishing safety recommendations that is being led by Mr. John Leech.  Mr. Leech chaired the effort and will report to me in the next fortnight.</p><p>I hope I have answered the questions on tonnage and landing issues as we would like to see increases in these areas.  On fish labelling, BIM and Bord Bia have been pushing a new &quot;responsible Irish fish&quot; label.  On supermarket shelves the &quot;responsible Irish fish&quot; assurance label can be seen, as one sees such labels on beef.  We would like to see this labelling spread through the industry as it says that the fish in question was caught responsibly, processed appropriately and is not an endangered species.</p><p>I was asked questions about rebalancing the pelagic sector around quota allocation and there has been much of this in the past five to ten years.  The pelagic sector has received an increased share that is now at 13% and last year more than 13,000 tonnes of pelagic mackerel were caught by the polyvalent sector.  Significant investment has been made in bigger boats as the cost of entering the sector is sizable and this cannot be changed overnight.  People have invested heavily on the back of business plans and have expectations in terms of access to fish so this cannot be reversed overnight.  This issue will be reconsidered but I can address only one matter at a time.  When quota allocations are reassessed all stakeholders are involved in the process and there will be an active debate if this happens in the future as everyone wants a higher quota.</p><p>The European Commission and most countries pushed for the effective privatisation of quota during negotiations on the Common Fisheries Policy to allow the big players buy up quota from everyone else over time but we successfully resisted this.  We were on our own in this resistance because the Irish quota is a national asset that is allocated to the industry as we see fit, in the best interests of the industry and coastal communities.  That is how things will stay under this Government.</p><p>Regarding the deal involving Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Norway and the EU, mackerel stocks have been growing and moving north into Icelandic and Faroese waters.  My views on the deal done by the European Commission are well known and I think I was the only Minister to vote against it.  I did not do so because the mackerel quota available to the Irish industry this year has fallen because it has not, it has increased significantly.  However, the overall share of mackerel stock in north-western waters to which Ireland has access has decreased in percentage terms and this is not a good precedent.  Do not forget, this deal will last only a couple of years and will have to be redone.  In effect, the industry in Ireland will have access to more mackerel than last year and I do not see this collapsing next year.  After that we will have to renegotiate a new deal between Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Norway and the EU.  My record on these negotiations speaks for itself.</p><p>On large Dutch factory freezer vessels, a public example of this arose in Killybegs some month ago.  It was part of an enforcement inspection procedure but if such boats have a quota to catch, which they do, they cannot be expelled from Irish or European waters.  There are many different types of fishing vessels in European fleets.  Very large freezer vessels have access to very large quotas and such vessels would buy most of the Irish quota, if it were privatised, as was the Commission's original plan.  We will not allow such privatisation and will enforce the rules with such vessels as best we can, as we do with all vessels in Irish waters.  Those vessels will have to comply with new regulations under the Common Fisheries Policy, like all vessels, on discarding, ending the practice of grading fish, which has been a huge issue for large factory vessels, and so on.</p><p>On meeting community groups and so on, I am a fairly open Minister and I meet most groups that want to see me.  However, I am also a busy Minister so we set up regional fisheries forums so groups could have a say collectively on deciding what different regions in Ireland prioritise within the inshore fishing fleet.  Via the National Inshore Fisheries Forum, those groups engage directly with me and my Department to get the outcomes they seek.  I cannot meet everyone but I will try to meet as many people as possible to get different perspectives.</p><p>Senator Michael Comiskey pointed to the big challenge this December.  We need to start the implementation of the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, which is challenging in itself, and we need to bring the industry with us.  That is why this winter I will emphasise strongly that we take account of economic concerns in fishing communities, in addition to pure science.  The new Common Fisheries Policy allows for this and it will be necessary to create the goodwill necessary for the other fundamental changes.</p><p>I know Senator O'Donovan's territory in west Cork very well and appreciate the fishing interests there.  I also pay tribute to Mr. Joe Walsh, who I knew personally.  I worked with him on a series of projects, particularly in the area of horse racing and the sports horse sector.  I paid a short tribute to him earlier in the D&aacute;il as I felt it was appropriate to do so while answering questions on agriculture.  I think he was the longest serving Minister with that portfolio that Ireland ever had and his family can be proud of his contribution to public life.</p><p>On the implementation of the ban on discards, we are starting with the pelagic sector in January 2015.  We will then examine the whitefish sector in 12 months and continue species by species.  This is a graded process of introducing an obligation to land species by species and the aim is to complete it by 2020.  This is a manageable timetable but it is challenging.  We have money to spend to help the industry adapt to new realities and it is in the interests of the industry to do this because it will build stocks.  The idea of catching and dumping dead juvenile fish, small fish and fish we do not have a quota to catch is not in anyone's interests.  Such fish could be caught next year as a commercial catch to be landed and sold.  This is the goal of the discards ban - we are switching from a quota for the amount of fish fishermen can land to a quota for the amount they can catch.  There is a big difference because at the moment one can land a certain tonnage and if one catches more one dumps the surplus over the side.  In future one will receive a quota for what one can actually catch and we must help the fishing industry to adapt by using new technology, fishing methods, mesh sizes, net designs and so on to target fish.  This will apply even to mixed fisheries, in terms of how we catch fish, to ensure the fish we catch can be landed, marketed and sold.  If we catch excess fish there is flexibility in the new Common Fisheries Policy to facilitate this - fishermen can carry a portion of a quota from one year into the next and can also have inter-species quota management.  This is necessary because in some mixed fisheries it will be impossible, even with all of the technology available, to improve the targeting of fish.  Fishermen will catch some fish for which they have no quota.  The cod, haddock and whiting fishery in the Celtic Sea is a good example of this but it does not mean we should not try.</p> <p>I want to ensure that we still have an industry in ten, 15 or 20 years time that is bigger than it is now, so that the small guys have something to catch.  I hope that will be my record.  The challenge of introducing a more sustainable and more science-based fishery is about the future of Irish fishing, to make sure that we do not overfish to the extent that we destroy stocks that will not come back in the future.  In my view, that is the best way I can look after every stakeholder and interest in the seafood and fisheries industry.  While we make those changes, we need to keep people in business, and that is what the European maritime and fisheries fund will primarily be used for while I am making decisions in this Department.</p><p>On the sea-fisheries Bill, which I have promised in this House before, I hope we will introduce and pass that between Christmas and next Easter, so in the first quarter of next year.</p></speech>

For the first time ever we have introduced regional inshore fisheries forums, at which people will sit down, make decisions on their own region, have an input into a national framework, and directly impact on policy regarding issues that affect them, whether that is V-notching for mackerel, supports for pots that have been lost in storms, gillnet fishing, line-fishing for mackerel, artisan fisheries, etc.  There is a whole series of opportunities for them to make proposals, which I have said that I would be more than supportive of, if they make sense both from a policy and a finance perspective.</p></speech>

It seems to be the advocated position of the Society of Chartered Physiotherapists that this should be the case.  They are interchangeable and one and the same in Northern Ireland and Britain, as well as in approximately 100 countries around the world where they are affiliated to the World Confederation of Physical Therapists.<br/>We should bring ourselves into line with them, particularly given the proximity of Northern Ireland, so that people can have absolute confidence in the situation.  The lack of ownership of this title gives confusion to society as regards what results can be expected from treatment by physical therapists, on the one hand, or physiotherapists, on the other.  People are entitled to certainty in that regard, so we must ensure the appropriate standards are adhered to.  <br/>The Minister of State and her officials no doubt have been in contact with the Society of Chartered Physiotherapists in preparing this legislation.  We think this is an ideal opportunity to bring back that into the kind of arrangement I have outlined, which is being followed in many other countries.  It seems that under certain EU regulations and obligations we ought to define these terminologies as one and the same, as is the case in other member states.<br/>I can appreciate that other people who are now beginning to use that title - heretofore there was a lack of ownership or definition - may have an issue with this proposal.  Therefore,  transitional arrangements may need to be put in place for these people to bring themselves up to the appropriate standards.  They should have an opportunity to do that so they can continue their livelihoods.  We should come up with an appropriate term for those who do not have the same qualifications, earned after three or four-year third level programmes, for what in all other countries are known as physiotherapists and physical therapists.  Such qualifications would give people the confidence to which they are entitled.<br/>This is the industry standard in many other countries, so there is no reason we should not move to that standard as well.Grandfathering arrangements with appropriate training may be required to cater for people who are currently using that title but who wish to be under the internationally required standard to be consistent with using it elsewhere.  I am sure we can cross that bridge when we come to it, if the Minister of State were to agree to the amendments.</p></speech>

It was only in recent months I learned that one does not need a qualification to use that title.  There is a public safety issue involved.  In my innocence, I assumed that if a person said he or she was a physical therapist or a physiotherapist, he or she was qualified and had completed the necessary qualification process.  Friends of mine have completed many years of study at college in order to be thus qualified.</p><p>We need to safeguard the title because there is a public safety issue involved.  It is welcome that Ireland will soon hold the presidency of the World Confederation for Physical Therapy.  Dr. Emma Stokes, a lecturer and researcher in Trinity College, is the sole candidate for the position.  It is remiss, however, to come from a country that does not have protection of title.  I hope therefore that the Government will accept this amendment or find a way to bring it forward.</p></speech>

The amendments would not achieve this.  The matter can be dealt with by regulation under the existing legislation.  Each registration board will be charged with making three by-laws, one of which will be in relation to qualifications, which is the protection that both Senators seek.  The issue of the title is anything but straightforward, given that Ireland is unique in having for over 20 years more than 350 physical therapists practicing here.  These practitioners have always used the title &ldquo;physical therapists&rdquo; and many have pursued programmes to degree standard on the basis that they would qualify to practice as physical therapists.  Any decision reached on the matter should be reasonable and proportionate when ensuring protection of the public.  Last month, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, in accordance with the Act, consulted with the newly established Physiotherapists Registration Board about options to address the issue.  That board is due to report to the Minister in early 2015 and once the Minister has had the opportunity to consider the advice and, if necessary, consult wider he will make a definitive decision.  I hope this gives some degree of comfort to both Ministers.</p></speech>

We are blessed to have a phenomenal cohort of professionals in this country.  I speak of the fabulous nurses, doctors, dentists, physiotherapists, opticians, medical specialists, ophthalmologists and social workers who keep the show on the road.  The show is not well organised and was not rationally constructed, and the thing that saves our bacon is the quality of the people who work in it.<br/>I have occasion to see many people whose lives have been saved by opticians.  Approximately 50 to 100 people get a primary cancer in the eye.  They may present to their doctor or eye specialist, but may typically present to an optician with vision change merely for a check-up.  In this case, an eagle-eyed optician doing an appropriate examination may find evidence of an eye tumour which could be fatal but which is usually cured if treated early.  My hat is off to our colleagues who have this critical role.  They are sometimes the first persons to diagnose a person with diabetes, tuberculosis or circulatory disease.  In some parts of the world, they are the first to diagnose a person with HIV.  These conditions can all present with abnormalities of the eye, and very often the first person the patient presents to is not a doctor, ophthalmologist or GP but an optician.  We must acknowledge the critical role they have had and I would not wish to demean this.<br/>In this amendment I seek to ensure that a classic medical situation of falling through the cracks is less likely to occur.  With this amendment, an optician examining a patient who finds something that might indicate an underlying medical condition, would not have, as has been widely circulated to Members of the House, an obligation to refer the patient &ndash; we never said that &ndash; but an obligation to inform the patient and suggest the patient seek medical attention.  I cannot see why it should be controversial.  Some would say it is gilding the lily because this obviously happens anyway.  In the overwhelming majority of cases it happens, and all I am saying is that it should be enshrined as part of the code of professional practice of opticians, optometrists, formerly known as dispensing opticians, and the various associated specialties.<br/>I understand the Minister of State needs to consult.  I have said before that she is an extremely courteous contributor to the business of the House and I would never seek to stop her from doing necessary consultation.  All we are asking is that it be codified in law and regulation that this is expected of people.  It should be uncontroversial.<br/>There is a certain amount of understandable confusion about the issue.  Ophthalmologists are the medical doctors who pursue senior postgraduate training in eye diseases.  They are usually, but not always, eye surgeons.  Opticians and optometrists are part of that other very esteemed profession who do not have a medical qualification but who go directly into training to look after optical and ocular issues.<br/>This is not something I thought up on the back of a bus.  The ophthalmologists approached me expressing their concern that the new regulations under which CORU and the regulatory boards could act would, perhaps, be strengthened in the case of the opticians if this requirement were inserted.  People may ask why we are not suggesting it for everybody else.  It is because the amendment relating to the opticians has come up now.  A similar amendment may be relevant to some of the other fine specialties.  The opticians are different in that they tend to act entirely appropriately but more independently than some of the other specialties to which people are often referred by doctors, dentists or nurses.  I ask the Minister of State to consider this uncontroversial amendment.  It would strengthen what is a very good Bill and would help our very fine cohort of opticians to continue to play their critical but unsung role.</p> <p>We often hear about how great it is to get one's eyes tested or to get one's contact lenses but we should remember that opticians save a bunch of lives as well.  </p></speech>

I hate to disagree with him, the man is a medical genius.  However, I have some concerns about this amendment and I cannot support it. However, I think the Minister of State should certainly take on board the point made.  We may be talking about the question of training opticians in a different way.  We may have to introduce a different code of practice, but to put an onus like this on opticians at this point would create the potential for negligence where people possibly do not have the qualifications or know-how to be able to identify everything the Senator suggested.  At the age of 18, my late mother benefitted from the quick thinking of an optician.  She lost an eye because of cancer and, thankfully, did not succumb to that disease until 54 years.  Senator Crown has shown such leadership with regard to cancer research and treatment and I bow to his prowess.  An issue could arise if, as the Senator rightly pointed out, the ophthalmologists are the people who ultimately need to see these patients if they are at risk.  If opticians have the potential to let something slip between the system, this is an issue of training and codes of conduct.  It needs to be training first, followed by a code of conduct, followed by statutory responsibility rather than just statutory responsibility if it is the case that people do not have the required training beyond checking a patient's sight for Specsavers or whoever.  I hope Senator Crown does not think I am not supportive because I am, but I cannot support the amendment in its current form.</p></speech>

The amendment is extremely restrictive.  It refers to any person registered by the Optical Registration Board, in the course of an examination, discovering a medical condition that would require medical treatment.  The people about whom we are talking would have the competence to deal with certain aspects, such as an infection or some aspects of a problem that might be identified.  Under this provision, even if they had the competence and the experience of dealing with a medical condition, they would now be obliged to refer them on.  The CEO and the secretary of the association are in the public gallery.  They are not in favour of this amendment.  In respect of the drafting of this legislation, the Department and Minister of State have held widespread consultation.  The association was fully briefed, is very familiar with and in favour of the draft legislation and is not in favour of the amendment.  The amendment is overly restrictive.</p><p>Practitioners in this area must operate within their skills, knowledge, competence and experience.  This will be dealt with anyway.  First, they must be registered and there also will be a code of practice with which they must comply.  If they are in breach of that, there is a disciplinary structure to follow.  In fairness to Senator Crown, the way the matter is drafted is well meaning but it involves a huge obligation.  Regardless of how small the medical condition identified, under this amendment, the patient would automatically have to be referred to somebody else even where the person has the competence to deal with it.  I will oppose the amendment on that basis.  </p></speech>

Senator Crown has spoken very persuasively based on his renowned expertise in his field.  If there are symptoms of cancer, diabetes about which one hears a lot, and circulatory diseases or abnormalities such as HIV which were mentioned by Senator Crown, I would hope the professional in this case would not just tell the patient he or she needs a new pair of glasses but that he or she needs further attention because some of these conditions are serious.  Otherwise, a diagnosis that should have taken place will be delayed and the condition will get worse.  We are talking about overcrowding in accident and emergency departments and crowds of people in GPs' offices waiting to see a health service professional.  We are actually engaged in the transaction.  It would be most valuable if a professional could just tell a patient that he or she needed to attend to this as well.  It would keep a person in the system because I do not know if these conditions can cure themselves.  Senator Crown is the expert on that but if the conditions are pre-existing and we can get persons on to the next stage and get them back to full health, why would we turn down this amendment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-11-12a.361" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1131" speakername="Fidelma Healy Eames" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014111200035#KK00700"><p>This is a well-intended amendment, however, I also see reason to reject it.  It is very important that if a condition of concern is detected that a correct referral takes place, but referring people back to the GP who may not even have the right equipment to determine that and creating another waiting list is not sensible.  We are trying to have a good public primary health care system.  I know the HSE is doing its best to achieve that.  There are 781 optometrists in Ireland.  They are the primary health care providers as regards people's eyes.  WHO research has shown that 80% of blindness is preventable.  It is prevented by regular eye examinations and it is the duty of the optometrist to detect eye diseases and to refer for appropriate treatment.  The waiting lists for most eye diseases are horrendous and the probability of a patient losing vision by the time he or she is seen is very high so we do not need to make those lists any longer.  This is where optometrists can help.</p><p>While I accept that Senator Crown's amendment is well meaning, if it were carried, it would add to the already very long waiting lists.  He is proposing that if persons present with a condition, professionals must refer them to their GPs straightaway and tell them to get medical attention.  This defies logic.  GPs are not equipped with the machinery to measure pressures.  They do not have machines such slit lamps, which is a microscope for examining the front and back of the eye.  There are another six vital pieces of equipment that GPs do not have.  In England, Wales and Scotland, there is a direct referral system from the optometrist to the appropriate department within a hospital.  This eliminates unnecessary referrals.  Optometrists are not claiming to be doctors but they have all completed a four-year Bachelor of Science degree in optometry and complete professional qualifying examinations before they can practise.  </p><p>We also know that we are living with an aging population and it is predicted that visual impairment will increase by 50% in the next 20 years.  As we all know, as we get older, we can see the power of our sight deteriorating.  It is in the public interest that unnecessary referrals are avoided because they will just further clog up the system.  In the interests of correct care, which is the intention of the amendment, why not do as they do in England, Wales and Scotland and have that direct referral system to the appropriate expertise or consultant as opposed to going back through the GPs which is an unnecessary loop?  I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to address the amendment.    </p></speech>

I presume the intention is to refer to the appropriate speciality as opposed to the general practitioner.  However, I am not in a position to support it.  It is well-meaning but is a narrow amendment.  Codes of conduct, codes of practice and professional competencies are already in place which probably cover the intention of the amendment.  I see one or two unintended consequences if we were to accept it, one of which is that it would restrict practice immediately.  To use my own profession as an example - I am a psychiatric nurse - nobody would have thought 15 years ago that the profession of psychiatric nursing or nursing in general would have expanded to fill the role it has now.  We would not have imagined the roles of nurse prescriber, registered clinical nurse manager or psychiatric nurse specialist.  The profession has expanded in a way we could not have imagined.  If there were provisions in the Nursing Act that precluded that kind of expansion, it would lead to all kinds of trouble.  We will see emerging competencies in all professions as we move forward.  It would be wrong of us to seek to restrict that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-11-12a.363" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014111200036#LL00200"><p>My experience of opticians is that they are very careful people and they refer patients on.  Clearly, as the first point of contact for people in terms of eye care, they are experts.  My experience - not personal experience - is that when a difficulty is encountered people are advised to go further, wherever that is.  I take the amendment in that vein.  For all the reasons expressed by various speakers, I cannot accept the amendment.  I hope I can explain the reason, but I take it in the spirit in which it was offered.  I believe it would introduce unnecessary and inappropriate provisions into primary legislation and would apply to the optical profession when the Bill is enacted.  The amendment proposes to effectively resurrect certain provisions of the Opticians Act 1956 which the Bill will repeal and to insert them into the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.  It would impose in primary legislation requirements on members of the optical profession to inform patients of suspected diseases or medical conditions, and to recommend that patients so informed consult with a medical practitioner.  I do not take it that the Senator is saying that necessarily as a GP.  I understand that perfectly.</p><p>I believe the existing robust regulatory provisions would adequately address these issues.  There are three by-laws that the optical registration board will have to make when it is up and running, one of which is about conduct and ethics.  That can be fleshed out at that point.  The provisions in the Bill relating to the future regulation of the optical profession were subject to extensive consultation.  A departmental working group on subsuming the Opticians Board into CORU, which informed the drafting of the legislation, comprised representatives of the board, including ophthalmologists, as well as members of CORU, the Irish Association of Dispensing Opticians, the Association of Optometrists of Ireland and the Department's professional regulation and primary care units.  Separately, the Department met and corresponded with representatives of the Irish College of Ophthalmologists on the proposed legislative provisions.  I am pleased to see evidence of increasing co-operation among all the eye professionals.  For example, the HSE national clinical programme for eye care is aspiring to increase interdisciplinary activity among professions in order to deliver a cost-effective, safe, high-quality eye care model for patients in the community.  That is what Senator Fidelma Healy Eames was talking about when she mentioned the clinical care pathway.  </p><p>I understand that care pathways are currently being agreed by all stakeholders.  The model envisages an ophthalmic referral process in the community for sight-threatening eye diseases such as glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration and cataracts.  This would ensure that management is provided for as long as possible by optometrists within the community setting and that only those with referable eye disease are directed into the secondary and tertiary setting.  This would free up clinic time to treat those patients most at risk of sight loss sooner in order to achieve better outcomes for patients in terms of preventing vision loss, improved quality of life and independent living.</p><p>The Bill proposes to transfer the regulation of the optical profession from the 1956 Act to the more modern regulatory model set out in the 2005 Act.  The model is reflective of the current realities experienced by today's eye care professionals.  By the end of next year, the 2005 Act's regulatory model will apply to 16 health and social care professional areas.  The Act comprises title protection provisions linked to a registration scheme.  It also provides for codes of professional conduct and ethics to be adopted by by-law and a fitness-to-practice regime similar to that applying to medical practitioners, nurses and midwives.  Under the 2005 Act, any health professional, including an ophthalmologist, optometrist or dispensing optician, who did not recommend that a patient consult with an appropriate health professional about a suspected disease or health condition would be guilty of professional misconduct and would be liable to disciplinary sanction, including cancellation of his or her registration.  That is a fairly robust and severe penalty in terms of what Senator John Crown wishes to achieve.  I agree with him that it is hugely important, but the Act already provides for that.  Such omissions would be in breach of the code of professional conduct and ethics that is adopted by each registration board.  Each code is framed in accordance with statutory guidelines set by the Department and CORU, and its objective is public consultation prior to its adoption by by-law.  The codes require registrants to act within the limit of their knowledge, skills, competence and experience and to refer on patients or service users when necessary.  I believe they do this already.</p><p>The code of professional conduct and ethics for the optical profession is currently being drafted by the inter-optical registration board, which includes on its board two eye doctors.  Members of the interim board will be appointed to the statutory board when this is enacted.  For these reasons, I believe the amendment is unnecessary and would not fit with modern legislation or professional regulation.  I am also concerned that it would result in optometrists and dispensing opticians being treated differently from other professions registered under the 2005 Act.</p></speech>

I had not realised that so many people in this Chamber were such extraordinary experts in the arcane details of the optical specialties.  I say well done all round.  Much research has gone into this.</p><p>I remind the Minister of State of two facts.  First, it was the Irish College of Ophthalmologists that approached me.  It was medical doctors - the people who deal with diseases of the eye - who were unhappy with this.  It was because neither they nor I wanted to make it look as though there was any question of our trying to protect a closed shop for them that we never said &quot;should consult an ophthalmologist&quot;; it was &quot;consult a medical practitioner&quot;.  I agree with other speakers that there is a craziness in the way referral patterns work in Ireland.  We are mandated to go through general practice at times when it is highly inappropriate to do specialist-to-specialist referrals, but that is the way it is.  Therefore, we kept it broad and said patients should see a medical practitioner.  That is the reason we did it.</p><p>The second fact refers to people acting responsibly within the scope of their practice.  It was the power that the registration boards have to define the scope of the practice which led to the concerns of the ophthalmologists that a group of people who are not medical doctors could make a decision as to what was and was not appropriate within the realm of medical diseases for a patient to be referred to a doctor.</p> <p>That is why we said it happens 99.99% of the time.  Nobody is perfect, whether a doctor or an optician.  There are things we have to do legally and this is a reasonable provision to put in regulation.  In no way does it limit the scope of anyone's practice.</p></speech>

I do not get this argument.  There is more than a little whiff of turf to this.  It is a simple, minimal amendment that enhances patient safety and hurts nobody.  I cannot understand why it is being treated so controversially.  I will press the amendment.</p></speech>

That means a practitioner would be required to make a recommendation that the patient take a second opinion for every medical condition discovered.  Even where the practitioner has competence to deal with the matter, he or she is obliged to refer the patient to someone else.  This is why I have a problem with the amendment.  It imposes an unnecessary obligation even if the practitioner is competent.  I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

There were no patients.  As a patient, I would be very pleased were this amendment implemented.  It is like our other difficulty with the junior certificate.  The 14 and 15 year olds I know were not asked whether they hate the idea that their work should be independently assessed.  The matter is focused on the teachers.  This issue is also about insiders.  The patients would like this to happen but they do not appear to have been consulted.</p></speech>

They are professional in their approach and if they spot something they believe requires further investigation, they usually advise the patient accordingly.  However, I think the legislation is robust enough to provide that if an optician spots something but does not inform the patient, it can be considered a dereliction of duty.  Significant penalties can be imposed in such circumstances, including removal of registration, which has the effect of taking away a practitioner's livelihood.</p><p>The amendment would also impose greater obligations on this group than we have imposed on others.  We should not do that.  Senator Barrett is correct but when one goes for a eye-sight test or to purchase new contact lenses, I am not certain that &quot;patient&quot; is the correct word.  This is probably the only profession that allows for that sort of equality of status in respect of how we interact with practitioners.  Any person who has an opinion on this, whether patient or client, can respond to the public consultation.  It will be interesting to hear their responses and I am sure most people who go to an optician hope they will leave with nothing more than a new pair of glasses.  In the event that something else occurs, I know from the experience of friends that they were informed when something required further investigation.  As it happens, this advice saved them a great deal of grief.  The current provisions are sufficiently robust and we should not impose on opticians, ophthalmologists or any other group of similar professionals an obligation that we have not imposed on others.</p></speech>

I was not in the Oireachtas when the original legislation was introduced.  The ophthalmologists brought this to my attention because, as the Minister of State pointed out, there is a unique professional-client among opticians.  Interactions with other specialties follow a professional referral.  Somebody can self-refer to an optician and by-pass all the medical expertise.  This is why we believe this relationship requires the provision.</p><p>I could be wrong but I believe we have provided in other legislation for legal mandates on certain people to report certain things even though common human decency and professional standards dictate that a reasonable person with the relevant professional qualification would act appropriately in the absence of a mandate.  We have provided for mandates in areas such as domestic spousal and child abuse.  I love it that I have so much attention from the Civil Service.  My mother would be very proud today.  I will not be raising any more issues but will press the amendment.  For the record, the Irish College of Ophthalmologists felt that its members had not been adequately consulted or given sufficient opportunity for interaction.  That is why it asked me to raise these issues.</p></speech>

There is a tendency to think that the headquarters of the organisation could, perhaps, be upgraded a little.  Very often in these organisations the money for that comes exclusively from the practitioners: the opticians, the optometrists, physiotherapists, radiographers, radiotherapists who have to pay it.  Every time their retention fee goes up, there is a high chance that, in turn, will represent an increased revenue burden on either the Exchequer, if they are paying the fees of the person in question, or the individual, patient, citizen who goes to see them.<br/>I would have thought the Minister of State would have approved of this.  Basically, it gives the Minister a little more power, just to make sure that the group of people who are deciding on the needs of their bureaucracy and also the people who are deciding what the revenue stream for it should be, that there is an extra level of checks and balances on the fees set.  Across the many registration boards and CORU, the council, there would be people with many diverse roles and there may well be some who would see merit in hiring additional persons about the necessity for whose employment there may be some controversy.  All I am saying is that there should be an extra level of scrutiny and that it should come from the Minister.  </p></speech>

Despite the fact that I know this amendment is so well intentioned as to give politicians more powers, I am not certain it is the type of power we should have.  I am opposing the amendment.  It runs counter to the trend in modern Irish legislation to give health regulators responsibility for financing their statutory public protection functions through the annual fees by registrants, as the Senator has pointed out.</p><p>The key principle underpinning such legislation is that regulators should be independent, self-funding and free from political interference.  For that reason the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005, the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 and the Nurses and Midwives Act 2011 all provide that fees for registration and retention of registration are set by the regulators themselves.  Each regulator is required to ensure that it has sufficient funds to perform its functions under the relevant legislation.  While the bulk of the annual running costs of the health and social care professionals and its registration boards, known collectively as CORU, are currently being funded by the Exchequer, the intention is that the CORU regulatory system will in time be self-funding when all registers are up and running.  This is the case with the other health regulators responsible for regulating doctors and nurses.</p><p>The Health and Social Care Professionals Council is obliged to manage its financial affairs in a prudent manner and there are a number of supervisory mechanisms in place.  The Department of Health is responsible for the oversight of the corporate governance of the council and the registration boards established under the Act.  It also holds the council to account in its performance of its functions and ensures adherence to Government policies relating to staffing numbers and their pay and conditions.  Each year when its accounts have been audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General they are presented to the Minister for Health, laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and published.</p><p>The current legislation strikes the right balance between independent regulation and political oversight.  To take away the council's power to charge registration fees would, I believe, be a retrograde step and would undermine CORU's ability to perform its legislative functions and to achieve its objectives to protect the public.  I greatly admire the Senator's confidence in the political system.</p></speech>

Such a charge has frequently been laid at the door of the medical professions, but in truth, the biggest impediment to jobs in medicine in Ireland is not the professional bodies but the agencies that create the jobs.  It struck me that the discussion of this amendment provides a good opportunity to make sure this issue is dealt with authoritatively.  The regulatory bodies have a unique role in that they straddle a number of different areas of responsibility in terms of recognising who can practice a profession and determining how they should practice it.  As such, this is something that is deserving of some degree of oversight to make sure that there is no self-serving behaviour across the range of specialties and in medicine too, which is not part of this particular Bill.  We should ensure that measures are not introduced that are restrictive in terms of the recognition of training qualifications, experience, grandfathering clauses and so forth, which would have the effect of creating closed shops.  This, in turn, would have the effect of driving up prices, decreasing services and restricting access for bright young people who want to join the professions, and would ultimately work to the detriment of patients and clients.</p></speech>

Comprehensive legislation relating to the Competition Authority is already in place.  This Bill deals with health care, and I do not believe we should now impose an additional condition here when the issue is already dealt with adequately in other legislation.  Any person, whether a member of the council or of the general public, can report a matter to the Competition Authority, and it is up to that organisation to deal with such a report.  This amendment, however, requires the Competition Authority to give an opinion on a matter, which is unnecessary and will only create more bureaucracy as well as delays in the process of putting rules and regulations in place.  Therefore, I am not in favour of this amendment.</p></speech>

We always say how much we appreciate young people and so forth.  Unfortunately, however, the incumbents invariably find new ways to keep new entrants out.  Regarding Senator Burke's point, the Competition Authority is a fairly barkless watchdog in these matters.  There are so many examples in Ireland where the incumbents rig the market.  We have a labour market of insiders and outsiders, with lots of unemployed young people, which never worries the insiders, who invariably block access.  When we set up a body to draw up regulations it should focus on professional standards, quality and so forth, not on keeping out new entrants.  However, regulatory bodies tend to gravitate towards the latter type of regulation.  The Competition Authority has issued mild warnings in this regard, as demonstrated with regard to buses and taxis in the past.  Nobody stays awake at night wondering what the Competition Authority will do.  The authority will not do anything in this area unless we provide for it in legislation.  One of the best ways to keep incumbents in any profession on their toes is to provide a constant stream of new entrants, who improve the professions by raising standards and bringing new ideas, but invariably we tend to go for the opposite approach.  That is why Senator Crown's amendment is very appropriate.  Indeed, we should see it applied to many other areas of professional activity, because competition is not the norm and the Competition Authority is slow to intervene unless it is invoked, which is what this amendment does.</p></speech>

I am loath to disagree with my friend and colleague Senator Barrett, who has argued that the Competition Authority is a barkless organisation, but we saw the teeth of that organisation in the recent negotiations on a new GP contract.  The ruling from the Competition Authority in that regard was far from barkless.</p><p>Senator Burke made reference to creating unnecessary bureaucracy, and there is also the potential for an unintended legal consequence in that when we prescribe in law that somebody must do something, that generally excludes great numbers of other people from doing it, by inference.  Senator Burke has already pointed out that it is open to any member of the public to draw an issue to the attention of the Competition Authority.  If we were to prescribe in law that it was up to a member of the council or the board to do so, the danger is that this would be interpreted as meaning that members of the public should not.  This is an issue worth considering.</p></speech>

It would delay the approval of that by-law until such an opinion is received.  All by-laws made by the registration boards are subject to public consultation and approval by the council.  Interested bodies are also consulted.  The Bill requires registration boards to submit to the Competition Authority by-laws relating to codes of professional conduct and ethics.  There is, however, nothing in the legislation to prevent a registration board or the council from agreeing to seek an opinion from the Competition Authority concerning any other by-law if it is felt that such an opinion is necessary.</p><p>I am also concerned that this amendment could delay indefinitely the making of an important by-law.  Critically, there is no provision in the amendment that the council may proceed with the approval of the by-law if the Competition Authority does not give its opinion before a date to be specified.  For these reasons, I am opposing this amendment.</p><p>The argument that Senator Crown has made in favour of this amendment is probably one of the reasons it should be opposed.  What if, for instance, there was someone on the board who was particularly obstructive and who demanded that every by-law be submitted to the Competition Authority?  We have seen that type of obstructive behaviour in the past.  Clearly, it is open to anyone - not just a person on the board, but a member of the profession or a person who wishes to become a member - to refer any issue to the Competition Authority if he or she deems it to be anti-competitive.  There is nothing in the legislation to stop someone from doing that; nor is there anything in the Bill that would stop the board itself from seeking the opinion of the Competition Authority.  The difficulty with the amendment is that there is no specified time limit.  Furthermore, it could be used as a mechanism to obstruct, which is why I oppose it.</p></speech>

This legislation will serve us all in future.</p><p>It is not that the people we now hope to register with the new board were previously failing to do their jobs.

I ask that she reflect on the points made by Senator Crown and others regarding amendments that I understand she could not accept.  We all want optimum regulation to ensure quality of care but the Minister of State should consider prioritising counselling, psychiatry, psychology and suicide prevention.  One can call oneself a professional therapist after a weekend course in areas relating to diet, weight and other matters and this does not serve us well.  The Minister of State might consider this as her next legislative move in this area.</p></speech>

I also thank the Department for the consultation that took place prior to this.  It is important that there be consultation prior to bringing forward legislation - as many people as possible should be involved in the process.  This legislation is evidence of this.  I thank everyone who contributed to the debate, particularly those who tabled amendments.  I may not have agreed with all the amendments but it is important that each area be examined carefully and amendments force us to do so.  I thank Senator Crown and my colleague on the other side of the House, Senator MacSharry, for their amendments as they contribute to the debate.</p></speech>

This evening is an opportunity for the Seanad to ensure its legacy of commitment to its own reform, thereby leaving a legacy of genuine commitment to political reform.  This evening we can do something immensely significant: we can focus on the good.  Having spoken with most Senators, I know that everyone wants to achieve the good of Seanad reform.  I know that every one of us present wants to demonstrate before the next general election that we will not be counted among those who are part of a system that is unwilling and unable to reform itself.  Well over a year ago, the people voted to retain the Seanad so that it could be reformed.  No one wanted the Seanad retained in its current form.  Many in this Chamber, including myself, have talked to the people we live among or represent, and their disappointment that reform has not yet been delivered is palpable - understandably so.  Let this be an evening that is not about resisting change; rather, it should be about hearing how we can co-operate with each other and allowing the agenda of reform to be advanced.</p><p>One of the excuses the Government has used for not advancing any reform is that we cannot agree among ourselves.  Let us own the responsibility to work co-operatively and demonstrate that this questionable statement is inaccurate.  I ask for the co-operation of all sides of this House, along with Senator Quinn, so that the Seanad will be viewed as one body wherein we can do the business of the people.  At the very least, we know that the huge majority of our people want a vote for this Chamber.  Universal suffrage and the principle of one person, one vote are fundamental tenets of a properly functioning democracy.  It is absolutely critical to note that Articles 18 and 19 of the Constitution do not specify universal suffrage for Seanad elections.  In fact, they do the direct opposite.  The Constitution refers to the election of the elected Senators as a general election and states that &quot;... elections of the elected members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann shall be regulated by law&quot;.  We can provide for universal suffrage in legislation.  The Constitution says so.  This will not make the Seanad a rival to the D&aacute;il.  There are many sections of the Constitution that demonstrate that the Seanad was specifically designed in a manner that could not rival the D&aacute;il or consistently obstruct the will of the people as expressed through the D&aacute;il.  </p><p>We have very little time left to do our work of Seanad reform.  Therefore, in the spirit and practice of reform, I am requesting that Senators be brief in their remarks on this debate, in the very limited time that we have left, so that we will be able to complete the passage of Seanad Bill 2013 today.  We are almost out of time because the Government has done nothing substantive to advance Seanad reform.  However, within the time provided today, we can have a good debate on the Bill and still bring it all the way through.  Senator Norris, as the father of the House and champion of reform in the House for so many decades, is introducing some amendments.  We are together in this.  I again ask for the co-operation of Senators on all sides of the House in keeping their remarks brief so that we can achieve and demonstrate our integrity and commitment to advance the will of the people and embrace political reform in this Chamber.</p></speech>

As Senator Zappone has said, I have spoken and campaigned for Seanad reform over the last 30 years and more.  When the proposal to abolish Seanad &Eacute;ireann was launched, I and a number of other people met outside in the ante room to get a committee going and so on and so forth.  We were on the way to that.  We had two of these informal meetings.  Then it was taken over as a vanity project by the people proposing this Bill, Senators Zappone and Quinn.  I stepped back.  I said, "If it works, that is the only thing that matters.  If it works, it does not matter what the motivation is."  I attempted to be included.  Although I attempted to become informed and be briefed, I was, like other people, ruthlessly excluded.  This Bill does not emerge from Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</p></speech>

The title of the campaign was "Democracy Matters".  Well, it did not matter that bloody much to them.</p><p>I have to say these things.  We have to talk this Bill through.  I am not in agreement with a lot of it.  In fact, I am strongly in disagreement.  However, I will leave my remarks at that.  I feel very strongly about this.  I did not speak about it at the time but I speak about it now because I thought this confection might disappear into the general mix of discussion documents.  Yes, I want reform.  I want real reform.  I want radical reform.  I do not see it in this, however.  It is a lawyers' hotchpotch.</p></speech>

Their valuable contribution should be put once again on the record of this House.<br/>However, I am somewhat disappointed with the suggestion by Senator Zappone in her opening remarks - I am sure she did not mean it - that because the Senators are bringing forward the Bill, this should somehow stifle debate, the inference being that we should not talk about it at all but embrace the Bill enthusiastically.  That was the inference, and I am sure that was not what the Senator meant.  However, she did indicate, to put it another way, that she wanted this Bill to go through without too much debate.  I think &quot;too many contributions&quot; was the term she used.  I can only draw from that the inference that she would prefer if there were no debate.  I am sorry to disappoint the Senator, but I certainly will be debating various issues.  <br/>To pick up on the Senator's remarks, which are relevant to section 1, I will be opposing the Title - which, by the way, I will not an opportunity to speak on until we get to that stage.  I have reasons for doing so.  It is linked to the Senator's comment that this reform proposal would not put the Seanad in competition with D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in any way.  That may be correct in theory.  However, I put it to the Senator, in the context of the Short Title under section 1, that if we extend the mandate to the entirety of the Irish electorate, there is absolutely no question, in my mind, that there would then be a very strong view among those Senators who are elected that, in fact, they do have a mandate to compete with D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  That is not what the Constitution suggests.  I would strongly defend the right of this House to continue in the form that was originally set out, which was of a vocational nature, although it sadly did not develop along those lines.  I do not think it would be workable in an Irish democracy to have two Houses in competition with each other.  I am suggesting to the Senator that extension of the mandate to the entire electorate would result in elections that were similar to D&aacute;il elections.  We will rest there; we may just disagree on that.  However, I believe that is a fundamental issue.  This House should not be seen to be in any way in competition with the other House.  We cannot have the two.<br/>I have a specific question about section 1.  The Bill states, on page 9:<blockquote>&quot;relevant Irish Embassy or Consulate&quot; means the Irish Embassy or Irish Consulate which has been assigned responsibility for the country in which the voter is ordinarily resident.</blockquote>Ireland does not have an embassy or a consulate in every country in the world.  It certainly does not have an embassy or a consulate in every country in which there is an Irish diaspora.  Ireland - I am sure the Minister will confirm this - is represented by the EU or by EU countries or by the UK, depending on the country.  I have not got the full list, but there is quite a significant list.  I think that particular subsection of section 1 will have serious difficulty in being passed because it would mean through its very wording that access to voting would be confined to quite a significant number of the Irish diaspora.  It refers specifically to Irish embassies or consulates.  That is a major problem.</p> <p>That was the main objection I would have to section 1, which is essentially about the Short Title and commencement and interpretation.  This is significant because if this were passed without extending it to those countries where there is no Irish consulate or embassy, it would deny the franchise to some of the people to whom it is hoped to extend it.</p></speech>

The Bill also seeks to amend a number of existing Bills, so there should be some latitude given because of that.</p><p>I am very slow to get in the middle of a disagreement between Independent Senators in this House, but I will say that the two Senators who approached me and my party most frequently on this issue were Senators Zappone and Quinn.  In fact, they had met us and requested to meet with myself as the group leader of Sinn F&eacute;in and with the Sinn F&eacute;in Party long before the referendum and they have been active on the issue of Seanad reform.</p><p>I disagree with many aspects of the Bill.  I am not in agreement that we should keep the sectoral panels or the university panels.  We should look at geographical panels.  We should have the principle of universal franchise on the basis of one person, one vote.  I do not agree with the system where county councillors and members of certain universities have votes.  It should be open to Northern representation and voting rights should be extended to the diaspora, which is included in the Bill.  I am also opposed to the 11 Taoiseach's nominations.  </p><p>We will have more discussion as the Bill progresses.  It is not beyond the ability of the two Houses of the Oireachtas, and indeed of influences and organisations outside those Chambers, to come up with Seanad reform that actually wins the support of the people.  Months ago I attended a meeting organised by the Taoiseach, which the Leader of this House was also at, at which we discussed where the Government was going to go with Seanad reform following the referendum.  There has been no meeting convened since then.  There has been no update to any of the group leaders or party leaders on what the Government----</p></speech>

He may have an opportunity on a later Stage to elaborate on the line he has gone down, but with respect, we are talking about section 1.

The Taoiseach promised a referendum and it was held.  He said that he would set up a group to look at it and consultation did take place with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  We have lots of reports.</p><p>While there is an awful lot to admire within the Bill, there are some problems with it as well.  It repeals two existing Seanad electoral Acts and does not adequately put in place what I would see as a workable solution.  The Taoiseach has agreed that the procedural reform will take place quickly and the all-party groupings in both Houses, including the Government through the Leader of the Seanad, put forward proposals.  I have also been informed that the Taoiseach is to establish a working party to examine the issue.  We must all put our heads together and today I welcome the Bill.  I think we will learn a lot from it, and with all parties working together it will be a better proposal at the end of the day.  Submissions and proposals that have already been submitted to the Leader of the Seanad and to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges will all be taken into consideration.</p><p>The working party will be----</p></speech>

I agree with you on that.  I will be making a comment on that as well because we do not have an embassy in every country and I have a lot to say on that.  The Taoiseach has said that the committee will report by February and he has put a time limit on it and given it to the Leader and to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  There is nobody in this House who does not want to see reform of the Seanad and I want that said loud and clear from the Fine Gael Party.  This legislation is 35 years overdue and this is the only Government that has acted in ensuring that all universities will get the vote.  We have had the first Stages of the Bill and the heads published.</p></speech>

As someone who broke ranks early on without any direction or instruction from anyone and who is still here to tell the tale, I would say that the Whip system is not as cruel as people make out.  I defied Government direction and policy on the referendum and, along with other colleagues, prevailed in preserving and retaining the Seanad.  In that regard I particularly welcome the Bill as it gives us an opportunity to reopen this debate in a meaningful way.  I do not think we should seek consensus.  This House is known for its lack of consensus and long may that thrive and live.  However, all colleagues will agree that the electorate at large, at home and abroad, will not thank us if we do not at every opportunity endeavour to introduce meaningful reform.  Finally, I am intrigued to see that most infamous of Irish institutions is alive and well - before we even got out of the traps we had the split.</p></speech>

Last year, 600,000 people voted to retain the Seanad.  They did not intend to retain it as it was; they intended to have a reformed House.  This Bill is an effort to bring about that reform.  I listened very carefully to Senator Norris and I think that is exactly the reason for having a Committee Stage debate, so that we can discuss and debate these things and improve the Bill.  This effort that Senator Zappone and I have made is an effort to have reform without having to have another referendum.  I believe that is possible and that is why I support section 1.  There may well be some changes that should be made and suggestions to that effect have been made already.  Let us make sure that we have a proper debate to ensure that the reformed Seanad that comes about is one that we will be very proud of.</p></speech>

We are probably suffering from an Irish problem, which is that if we have not got it right first time we put it back on the shelf and wait 40 years before taking it down again and brushing the dust off it.  Anybody who has ever been at school knows the way to write an essay is to sit down and start writing.  The Bill is here in front of us.  A lot of work has been put into it and I commend both Senators for bringing it forward.  I do think it will need serious debate.  What I do not want to see happen is what I am beginning to hear, namely, the notion that we can reform the university seats, broaden that out, and to hell with the rest of it.  If we are going to reform the Seanad we should take it root and branch and open it more to the people of this country.</p></speech>

My election was no triumph of democracy, it was a triumph of pragmatism.  At the end of the day I thank God for that pragmatism, but if we are going to reform the Seanad let us start by tearing this Bill to pieces, rebuilding it and making it into something we can all work with.</p></speech>

I have been watching the debate on the monitor.  The Government gave very clear commitments on Oireachtas reform prior to the election .</p> <p>Seanad reform, unfortunately, from that party's perspective meant abolition.  As we know, the people decided not to abolish the Seanad.  </p><p>I commend the Senators who put this reform Bill together.  As I said to Senators Quinn and Zappone, it has imperfections and there are things I would change, but at least it is a basis for reform.  The major issue I have is that almost a year ago I, the Leader of the Seanad, Deputy Maurice Cummins, and others sat down with the Taoiseach about eight weeks after the Seanad referendum.  The Taoiseach said reform of the Seanad would be dealt with as a matter of priority and urgency, but nothing has happened.</p><p>There has been no reform, and worse still is the fact that the Seanad was picked upon as the one area requiring reform while everywhere else did not.  Seanad reform cannot be considered solely in the context of reforming the Seanad, rather, Oireachtas reform must be considered.  Oireachtas reform has not worked.  The programme for Government refers to the necessity to allow proper debates, and not to shut down and guillotine debates.  I commend the Leader for, in the main, facilitating and seeing good that promise.  However, more than 60% of all legislation in the D&aacute;il has been shut down or guillotined.  There is still no proper oversight.  The pre-legislative process does not work.</p><p>A lot needs to be fixed.  People around the country are concerned about many different issues, but political reform is something they want to see happen.  This Bill gives a basis for that, but I would not like to see the Seanad identified as the only place where reform is required.  Let us consider the Whip system-----</p></speech>

At the same time, I hope that the sponsors of the Bill would take account of the remarks I made.  The Minister of State might have a view to express as well.</p></speech>

My point was that we have very little time left to debate anything related to Seanad reform.  We requested a number of times that Government give us time to debate this Bill and we were not given that time.  It is within that context that I requested that people be brief in their remarks, not to restrict our opportunity to hear the brilliant contributions of every Senator.</p><p>On Senator Mooney's comment on section 2 about the relevant Irish embassy or consulate, he has made a reasonable point.  The current provision in the Bill was the best measure we could identify at that time to reach out to the diaspora.  If there are suggestions of how to make it more inclusive we would of course be open to that.</p></speech>

I did not for one moment think that she was in any way motivated by a desire to stifle debate but it is important to clarify the context in which she made the comment.  This is a drafting issue; perhaps the Senators' advisors did not take account of the point that I made, that there are parts of the world where there is no Irish embassy or consulate but there is a significant Irish population.  Even if there is only one Irish national, why should he or she be deprived of the vote in the proposals they have made.  That is the reason I raised the issue.  If we get as far as Report Stage, perhaps this might be something they might introduce by way of amendment.</p></speech>

On the interpretation of section 2, obviously much of the interpretation is as it stands in the Bill and "local authority" means a city or county council, naturally enough - nobody could disagree with that.  As I agree with the interpretations, for example, on a gender sub-panel I will be saying much on that issue and other issues as they arise.  However, while I agree with the interpretation of most of section 2, I will not agree with the actual section of the Bill itself.  I will agree with the section 2 interpretation but when the different items come up I will be coming in again and I reserve my right to do that.</p></speech>

It is comprehensive and I commend the Senators for their work on it.  However, there are fundamental legal, policy and administrative issues spread throughout the Bill which are problematic.  I will expand further on those.</p><p>The Government is opposing section 2.  The interpretation section is integral to the effect and functioning of the Bill as a piece of legislation.  I will address a number of specific issues within this section, while also dealing with matters that arise as a consequence.  Section 2 makes provision for foundational elements, and for a key feature of the Bill, namely, the extension of the franchise in Seanad elections to all registered local government electors living in the State, persons resident in Northern Ireland who qualify for Irish citizenship, and Irish passport-holders living abroad.  This would create a second directly-elected Chamber of the Oireachtas, with a significantly wider franchise.  It must be observed that if the Seanad were to be so configured and the right to vote in Seanad elections so provided for, the Constitution would have been framed in this way.</p></speech>

This relates specifically to interpretation in section 2 of the Bill.</p><p>To continue where I left off, this would have the effect of creating a second directly-elected Chamber of the Oireachtas.  Although the Bill does not quantify the likely electorate, it can be estimated that some 5.2 million persons would be entitled to vote.  Apart from the policy question and the matter of whether this proposal is legally sound, serious costs and administrative considerations must be taken into account.  Notwithstanding the removal of the requirement for registered post, these have not been addressed in the Bill or the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.</p><p>Included among the interpretations in section 2 are the definitions for the terms &quot;constituency&quot;, &quot;electoral commission&quot;, &quot;gender sub-panel&quot;, &quot;local authority&quot;, &quot;Minister&quot; and &quot;university constituency&quot;, among other terms.  The definition used for &quot;constituency&quot; is confusing and unclear in its usage in the Bill.  Throughout the Bill the term &quot;constituency&quot; is used to describe a panel of candidates, which does not fit with the common understanding of the word as an area of territory or a particular electorate or group of voters.</p><p>Section 2 provides for a definition of the term &quot;electoral commission&quot;, which is then used in section 35 of the Bill in regards to voters in Northern Ireland.  These provisions in the Bill are legally flawed and unworkable.  They envisage a role being performed by the Northern Ireland division of the electoral commission of the United Kingdom in verifying eligibility to register by applicants based in Northern Ireland.  Legislation made in this State could not compel or direct a body in another state to perform a particular function.  This is notwithstanding the position that the wrong body was identified in the Bill in any event.  Functions in relation to electoral registration in Northern Ireland are carried out by a different agency, the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland.  The electoral commission is a separate body with other electoral responsibilities, but not voter registration.</p><p>Elections to the gender sub-panel, as defined in section 2 seem potentially to offend the equality provision in Article 40.1 of the Constitution.  Votes would carry different weights, with some candidates elected even though they have fewer votes than a candidate elected by reason of gender preference.  This would give rise to a difference in the treatment of voters and candidates.  Overriding policy objectives to achieve gender equality would not be enough to counter the discriminatory treatment of individuals where key democratic rights and the election of candidates chosen by voters is in question.  The Government has some experience in legislating for gender balance in elections, having introduced provisions in the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act 2012 affecting D&aacute;il elections.  What is proposed in the Bill before us is of a different order and is potentially unsound.</p><p>There is also an issue of discriminating between citizens living in the North and those living in other jurisdictions outside the State, who would have to have an Irish passport to vote.  This would impose a cost on them in order to exercise a vote which would not apply to a voter in Northern Ireland or in this State.</p><p>The definition of &quot;local authority&quot; is incorrect, having regard to the Local Government Reform Act 2014.</p><p>The term &quot;Minister&quot; is defined in section 2.  Later in the Bill, certain functions are assigned to the Minister which would appear to undermine the independence of the Seanad returning officer, a term which is also defined in section 2.</p><p>The universities constituency is defined in section 2, but the provisions for the universities constituency are significantly lacking.  The register of electors, candidate nominations, conduct of the elections, the composition of the constituency, and other elements are framed in a way that is problematic from a legal perspective.  Administratively, it is questionable whether an election in the six-seat universities constituency proposed in the Bill could be organised using the Bill as a basis.  The alternative offered by the Government is a better approach.  Earlier this year, the Government published the general scheme of a Bill to reform the Seanad university constituencies and expand the franchise.  Work is currently progressing on the preparation of a Bill and this is to be published in 2015.  </p><p>My final point is significant with regard to the Bill as a whole.  As Senators are aware, this House has the right under Article 15.10 of the Constitution to set its own rules and Standing Orders.  Chapter 3 of Part 3 of the Bill, which sets out additional roles for the Seanad, appears to be in contravention of this article.  The Bill directs the Seanad in how it makes its rules.  There are also implications under Article 15.10 for the D&aacute;il, in so far as the Bill impacts on how it sets its rules and procedures.  The Government has already, through the Leader of the Seanad, presented a package of reforms to the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges to improve the operation and effectiveness of the Seanad.  The Government's proposals are comprehensive.  Importantly, they are also capable of being implemented, and are consistent with constitutional rights afforded to the Seanad and its Members.</p> <p>Some of the provisions in the Bill dealing with inquiries undertaken by the Oireachtas have already been implemented in other legislation since the Bill was published.</p><p>In making these initial observations on the Bill I am mindful of the hard work and effort put into its drafting.  Committee Stage is where we test a Bill.  Just as Opposition Senators have a duty and an obligation to robustly test Government legislation, so too the Government must test Private Members' Bills being considered in the House.  While there are policy differences in the Bill, there are also questions about the legal and administrative provisions included.  These are particularly evident in section 2.  While we will oppose other sections of the Bill, the Government opposes section 2 as it stands.</p></speech>

Sadly, as we have heard from the Minister of State, the Bill is fatally flawed.  Section 2, for example, refer to a relevant amnesty, the consulates and so on.  Would this not require another referendum?  What would happen to an Irish citizen resident in an area where we did not have an embassy or a consulate?  Would that person be disenfranchised under the Bill?  There is no provision to deal with that issue.</p><p>I do not want to get into the issues of election expenses, having an electoral commission, a gender sub-panel and a judicial assessor and the provisions in respect of local authorities which, as the Minister of State points out, conflict with what was passed in the most recent local government Bill.  For the reasons outlined and others that could be included, we should start again.  With respect, we should not be starting from this position, although I respect the work put into the Bill.</p></speech>

In fact, some of us managed to persuade the Leader who started off from a position where he wanted to abolish the House to take a policy decision that he would seek to have it reformed.  We have had an internal debate within Fianna F&aacute;il on the issue.  There is nothing inherently wrong with what Senators Katherine Zappone and Feargal Quinn are attempting to do through the Bill and I commend them for using their Private Members' time to highlight the issue because we all accept that there is a need for reform.</p><p>I do not have the Minister of State's response in front of me, but I am intrigued by it.  Please correct me if I am wrong, but when giving a reason for his opposition, he referred to section 2 and the proposal made in it for Irish passport holders to have the right to vote.  He said this would be an extra cost.  I am intrigued by this.  Like many on all sides of the House, I support the recommendation of the Constitutional Convention that Irish people abroad be able to vote in presidential elections, as a first step in widening the franchise for the Diaspora.  Part of the recommendation of the convention on the criteria to be used to establish who should be entitled to vote was that one be a passport holder.  I do not see any other criterion to prove identity than ownership of an Irish passport.  I am aware that the Government is going to introduce legislation in this regard and that it will act on the recommendations of the Constitutional Convention.  However, will the Minister of State clarify why he believes there would be an extra cost involved?  If there would be an extra cost in this regard, it is inferred there would be an extra cost in regard to any other proposal to extend the franchise through using the criterion that a person be an Irish passport holder.  I hope I have made myself clear to the Minister of State and will be grateful if he clarifies his remarks and the reference he made to Irish passport holders in the context of the Bill.</p></speech>

However, what about the difficulty in the case of the university seats where the electorate has been expanded to almost 1 million?  What about the difficulty in keeping that register and managing that election?  It is complete and utter nonsense.</p><p>We should keep in mind that the referendum was nearly lost because it was a vanity project.  We also need to keep in mind that it was in the last two weeks of the campaign that the result of the referendum was turned around by Members on the back benches and in the Independent seats.</p><p>In response to Senator David Cullinane, I wanted Sinn F&eacute;in to be included in the debate at a time when many others wanted it to be kept out.</p></speech>

We may not get another opportunity to say this, but no provision is made for people to change their choice subsequently.  While I believe we should have a "panel" rather than a "constituency", no provision is made in the Bill for a move to another constituency.  It is conceivable that some panels, or "constituencies" as they are labelled in the Bill, would have significantly more voters relative to others and the respective number of seats.  It seems eminently possible that this could arise, but there is inadequate provision made in the Bill to deal with such an outcome  Therefore, the interpretation of "constituency", as it stands, is inadequate.</p><p>On the issue of having a gender sub-panel, I agree that there should be a 50:50 gender balance policy for a panel, but the difficulty is how we would achieve it.  Providing for a specific electoral outcome for women may be legally problematic.  This issue has not been tested.</p></speech>

I appreciate the fact that the Government has put such thought into this section, for which I thank the Minister of State.  I will do my best to respond to some of the remarks made and issues identified, despite the fact that there is no one behind me to help me out, but I will do the best I can.</p><p>One of the issues identified by the Minister of State was that the Bill would mean that we would have a second directly elected Chamber.  In the context of what we have suggested, I agree that it would be a directly elected Chamber, but it would be directly elected in a different way because of the panels to be established.  The people would not be electing Members on a geographical constituency basis but on the type of candidate they wanted to be on the different panels.  The Bill is an effort to put forward the fundamental principle of having a universal franchise, one person, one vote, instead of the current system which largely means that we have politicians electing other politicians, to which we object strenuously, as does the public.</p><p>On the point made about the use of the terms &quot;constituency&quot; and &quot;panel&quot;, we used these terms interchangeably to try to unpack and make more accessible the notion of a panel.  We wished to ensure those voting to elect Members to a particular panel would feel part of that constituency.  It would not be a geographical constituency, but use of the word &quot;constituency&quot; was deliberate and interchange of language.</p><p>The Minister of State also suggested various aspects of the Bill were legally flawed or problematic from a legal point of view.  With others, Senator Feargal Quinn and I look forward to considering more deeply the meaning and detail of what has been put forward by the Minister of State, although, in many cases, he has just identified something as legally flawed or problematic.  It would be helpful if he provided more detail on the reasons.</p><p>On gender equality, like Senator C&aacute;it Keane, I do not believe there is a major issue in that regard.  As far as I understand it, nobody in this Chamber is against the principle of gender equality.  We debated thaeissue previously in the context of the Electoral Act.</p> <p>This was our best effort to try to find a way to bring gender equality into this Chamber with the use of sub-panels, which in the past were referred to as inside and outside panels.  If there is a better way and if the Government is in favour of gender equality for this Chamber, then it should put forward its proposals, as distinct from simply opposing what we have done with this Bill.  It was our best effort at that moment in order to incorporate the principle of gender equality, which we all knew we wanted and which was passed for the other House.  If the other House has it, then this House should have it too.</p><p>In his concluding remarks, the Minister of State spoke about why the Government is opposing section 2.  He said he had an alternative on offer, which was to extend the franchise for the university panel.  Yes, the heads of a Bill dealing with this were published a long time ago.  I understand that many people were consulted about those heads, including the Seanad, which had a good debate.  The consultation process was concluded in April 2014, but many months later the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is still considering what to do with the Bill.  As the Minister of State said, that Bill will be published in 2015.  If it is published next year, however, it will be too late, in our view, if we want that kind of change to happen, even with regard to that particular composition of Members of this House.  </p><p>In the D&aacute;il yesterday, the Taoiseach said he was establishing a working group on Seanad reform.  We welcome the fact that he is finally doing so.  I read his comments and noted that none of us will be participating in that working group.  The discussion on this Bill concerns what we as Senators want to do by way of Seanad reform.  There are few alternatives on offer and we do not even have a Government Bill.  If we had such a Bill in 2015, we probably would not have enough time to pass it through both Houses.  Even if we did so, however, there would still be elitism in the Seanad.  In addition, the people would not have direct elections for the Seanad that were different from those for the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

Those Members were elected on the promise of political reform but have split themselves asunder on the issue of abolishing the Seanad.  Most Government Senators were either lukewarm in their support for abolition or, in many cases, frankly opposed their own Government's position.  They should be warmly embracing every opportunity for meaningful Seanad reform.  If the 2013 referendum meant anything, it was an endorsement of Seanad reform.  I do not believe any single person went into the polling station on the day of the referendum wishing to maintain the <i>status quo</i>.  A plurality of people, a majority of those who cast their ballots, voted effectively for reform.  This message needs to be taken on board.<br/>For the Government merely to implement the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution 40-odd years later and say that this is long-promised political reform is absolutely unsatisfactory.  Their use of tactics such as calling a vote on the Title of the Bill speaks somewhat to the insincerity of their commitment to the whole question of reform.</p></speech>

The people said "No" to abolishing the Seanad.  We are all democrats and we believe that we should have a popularly, generally enfranchised second Chamber, elected in a different fashion from the first Chamber, so that we have people representing a different spectrum of interests; perhaps not local electoral constituency interests, but more national interests.  What could be simpler?</p><p>We have a number of opportunities with various reform Bills - including the Bill from my esteemed colleagues, Senators Quinn and Zappone, my own Bill, and now the Fianna F&aacute;il Bill - to deal with substantive reform.  If the early signals we are getting here mean anything, it seems to me that there is going to be no reform whatsoever.  There will be a little bit of adjusting around the edges, changing the way we elect the current six university Senators.  By the way, I will support that.  Anything that increases the number of people who have a direct popular vote for any seat in this House is something I will support.  I will support enthusiastically anything that moves us away from a situation in which 200,000 people elect six Senators, 1,000 people elect 43 Senators, and one person elects 11 Senators.  It can only be an improvement.  That is what we should all be striving for.</p><p>The whole question of political reform is not hung just on the Seanad.  Much as we like to think it, we are not the centre of the political universe or the centre of politics in Ireland.  We are what we are.  It has been an interesting forum for debating meaningful political change.  Such change should apply not only to the processes of this House but to politics in general.  Right at the core of it, we are seeing example after example of the system's failings - specifically, how they revolve around the Whips in the D&aacute;il.  It should be an opportunity for us in this House to try to break free from the turgid shackles of whipped, unthinking, slavish, sheepdog-like behaviour and, instead, to think, come up with some constructive suggestions, and vote with our consciences on how we can make the politics of this country a little bit better.  I see no evidence of it, however.</p><p>We know who the winners are when the true democrats start behaving like this.  Those recent converts to democracy, who may have a rather lukewarm commitment to it, suddenly start to look not so bad when those who are supposed to be the expert exponents and passionate devotees of democracy start behaving in a fashion that is a little bit undemocratic.</p><p>I am sorry that Senator Paul Coghlan has left, because I wanted to ask him about a point of information.  I know that today many people in his esteemed County Kerry decided that they might elect to have it deemed an island in a separate category from the rest of the country.</p></speech>

That is not the case.  Everyone has access to a consular office.  For some of them it will be in the same country they live in, while for others it will be a designated consular office in another country which assumes responsibilities for their country of residence.</p><p>I hope we will get this Bill through Committee Stage today and that we will pass it.  I also hope that my Bill will be afforded the opportunity for a full debate when it comes before us.  Our colleagues in the other House should also have an opportunity to see these important pieces of legislation and have a debate that relates not only to the way we do business here but also to the way we do business in our Parliament.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-11-12a.489" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1172" speakername="Aideen Hayden" time="17:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014111200049#ZZ00900"><p>I agree wholeheartedly with the motivation behind Senator Zappone's Bill.  On a number of occasions, I have said on the record that the Seanad referendum provided us with an opportunity to closely examine our political system and ask searching questions about what we believe our system of Government should be.  As a member of the Constitutional Convention, as many other Members of this Chamber were, I think the question of reform goes way beyond this particular House.  It also concerns the D&aacute;il and wider aspects of our governance structure, including how we will reform the presidential election system.</p><p>The Joint Committee on European Union Affairs is currently looking at how, in a broader context, we can enable our diaspora to vote.  There are many reform issues that we must face as a country, of which Seanad reform is one.  I believe that the people voted for reform of the Seanad.  To be frank, there is no real, credible proposition on the table at the moment, other than reforming the election process for the university panels.  I am personally disappointed that the Government has not taken this issue more seriously.  </p><p>Having said all that, I must now consider the Bill before us.  In the first instance, it was accepted by this House because the Members of the Seanad wanted to express their views on reform.  They wanted to give a clear indication that we wanted to see reform of the Seanad.  One of the strengths of any Upper House must be that it is seen as being independent from the mainstream political process.</p> <p>I do not believe we can go forward with a Bill that has, unfortunately, been designed to result in the Seanad becoming a D&aacute;il 2.0 or a D&aacute;il-lite, for want of a better phrase.</p><p>I have said on a number of occasions that any reform of the Seanad must focus on the issue of representation, particularly of minorities in our society.  It must also focus on providing expertise within the political system.  One of the issues raised consistently at the Constitutional Convention was the concept that the D&aacute;il was far too clientelist and did not spend enough time in contemplation and bringing expertise to the table.  A system based on the existing panel structure will not bring us to the position we wish to achieve.  A number of people have commented on this issue.  Professor Diarmaid Ferriter, for example, has suggested we need a properly representative and independent Seanad &quot;moving towards a state conducted for the public interest, not one that is a separate, unaccountable and arrogant entity, divorced from the people it is supposed to serve.&quot;  That is the reason I raise the issue of minorities.  Many communities are not represented by the current political structure.  One need look no further than the D&aacute;il Chamber to see the extent to which impoverished communities are not represented in the current political structure.  Yesterday, I raised the incidence of cancer in impoverished communities where people do not have access to health care.  I do not believe modelling this Chamber on D&aacute;il-lite is the way to proceed.  Opening the Seanad to a popular vote with the current panel structure would not do anything to improve the current situation and would bring us to what should be a novel and representative system.</p><p>The current measures have been criticised by a number of people, including law lecturers in University College Dublin, UCD, Dublin City University, DCU, and the University of Limerick, UL, for retaining panels provided for in the Constitution.  Panel seats have never been meaningful.  In the years I have been a Member, Senators have stood up and said they represent such and such an interest group and the like, but there is no real, meaningful panel system within the Seanad and there is no good reason to believe more can be done with that panel system by simply extending the franchise.  It will yield a miniature and pointless replica of the D&aacute;il, risking parliamentary gridlock.  If we are to reform the Seanad in a meaningful way, we should not do it by rushing a Bill through the House.  I understand Senator Katherine Zappone's frustration.  We are rapidly approaching the end of the Government's term in office and, of course, there is frustration that we have not brought forward meaningful reform, as the people of Ireland have asked us to do.  However, I do not believe the Bill achieves that purpose.  We might get a better version of an old system, but we are losing an opportunity to do something meaningful about representation in this country.</p></speech>

I have not seen him in the House since his appointment.  I welcome the words he used.  He might have got some help in drafting them, but he was making points about the Bill.  Members who were involved in drafting the Bill put a great deal of effort, thought and time into it.  Nobody is saying it is not flawed in some way or other, but the purpose of Committee Stage is to debate the Bill, criticise it, comment on and change it, if necessary.  One of our main aims on Committee Stage was to ensure we could have change.  We thought the Government did not have the heart, stomach or enthusiasm for another referendum and on that basis our effort was to see if it was possible to have change without another referendum.  I believe a reasonably good effort was made in that regard.  That does not mean the Bill is not foolproof or that it is not possible to make some changes to it.</p><p>I was delighted with the Taoiseach's announcement yesterday that he was establishing a working group, but that is 13 months or more since the referendum was held.  It has taken too long.  I have often criticised the length of time required to get something done in the Oireachtas, but 13 months after the Taoiseach had said there would be change and that the Government wouild do something about it, he is only now setting up a working group.  As Senator Katherine Zappone said, nobody from this House is on the working group.  That is not democracy.  If we are to have democracy, we should at least ensure that when people vote against the abolition of the Seanad, the Taoiseach will act on his words that there will be change and reform of the Seanad.  Given that 13 months on he is setting up a working group that is due to report in another three or four months and does not include a Member of the Seanad, I do not believe the Taoiseach's heart is in reform.  On that basis, this debate is necessary.  This is one of the few chances we have had to debate the possibility of reform.  The reform provided for in the Bill is an effort.  Nobody is saying it is foolproof, but if it must be improved, let us ensure we can do this.</p></speech>

However, I must defend my electorate - county councillors throughout the country.  With all due respect to Senator Katherine Zappone, I suggest she run for election in the near future in a D&aacute;il constituency or the Seanad election.  She speaks in a derogatory fashion about our electorate because we are elected by politicians.  All county councillors will only be elected and re-elected if they look after the people in their communities in which they are social workers.  The Senator should inform herself more about the work of a county councillor.  The hardest election to win is a Seanad election by county councillors.  I have run and been successful three times.  I will not do it again as I wish to hand over the baton to another person.  The Senator should make herself aware.  She refers to being elected by politicians, but if only she knew how hard it is to be elected by politicians - it is far more difficult than to be elected by the public.</p></speech>

We all want to see change and reform in the way we do our business.  I agree with some items in the Bill but there are some that I totally disagree with.  I reject totally that the Government has been in any way obstructionist in relation to this Bill.</p><p>Let us look at the Title of Bill - the Seanad Bill.  I would have thought that it would have been called the Seanad Reform Bill, the Seanad (Amendment) Bill or whatever.  Therefore, I reject totally the charge that the Government side is being in any way obstructionist about this Bill.  The primary duty of this House is to scrutinise, amend and debate legislation.  That is exactly what we are doing with this Bill and is the same for any other Bill.  That is what this Bill deserves, namely, the scrutiny of this House.  It deserves to be amended and discussed so that we can pick the good things out.  Obviously we are not going to agree.  There are people on this side of the House who disagree with my sentiments.  The same applies to the other side of the House.  People disagree with each other on some aspects of this Bill but we will debate it.  As a democracy we will debate the legislation.  </p><p>As has been mentioned, and as the Taoiseach announced yesterday, the Government decided last week that a working group would be set up within the next number of days.  Its jobs is to bring together the reports and all the proposals that have come before the House and it will report back by February.</p></speech>

We have already met the Oireachtas Sub-Committee on European Scrutiny.  Senators Quinn, Leyden, van Turnhout, Colm Burke and myself will examine the EU work programme which will be published this month of November, probably next week.  We will look at areas we can debate from that work programme in this House.  That is one item.<br/>We will also have debates on the North-South Ministerial Council in this House, which has not happened heretofore.  Those are just some of the items.  At the Committee on Procedure and Privileges we are talking about scrapping Adjournment motions and replacing them with commencement debates which would avoid clashes with committees.  These are all very laudable items of reform.<br/>The vast majority of things that people are caught up with when they talk about reform, is reform in terms of the election of the Seanad.  That has been the topic for 80% of the reports carried out.  The ten reports that have been mentioned have dealt with how the Seanad is elected and not with Seanad reform <i>per se</i>within the House.  We can do so much within the House and will do so with co-operation.  We will bring everyone on side to discuss how we can do so within our own rules.  That is my intention.  That is what we are doing and will continue to do.  There is a greater agenda in regard to the election.<br/>The Government has mentioned that university seats should be elected now by institutes of technology as well as universities.  That is something which the people decided in 1979.  It is the Government putting in place what the people decided in 1979 and that is how it should go.  Why have we not had a Bill on something that the people decided in 1979?  </p></speech>

Some people do not like it because it will affect them personally in terms of how they get elected.  They are right to fight their corner in that regard.  They are very right in fighting their own corner and we have to listen to them as well.  This Government has listened to what the people said in 1979 and will try to legislate for same.</p><p>I reject totally the claim that this side of the House is being obstructionist in regard to this Bill.  We commend the Senators who moved the Bill, and we commend many of the items that are contained in the Bill.  I think, and the movers themselves will acknowledge, that this Bill deserves the same scrutiny, amendment and debate that any other Bill should get in the House. </p></speech>

Having reflected on this Seanad I think the problem it encountered was the attempt at abolition.  We came in here, hit the ground running and had a brilliant year or so.  The move to abolish us knocked us off course but we tried to come back as best we could.  We did the task that the Leader annunciated and took legislation.  For example, some legislation had 15 amendments on one day or 19 amendments on another day.</p><p>I have just remembered that I must welcome the Minister of State to the House.  Unfortunately, the amendments on water that we tabled were not listened to and, at this juncture, I think they could have saved the Government an awful lot of trouble.     </p></speech>

I do not want a mini-D&aacute;il, a double sized D&aacute;il or whatever.  We are here to revise legislation.  All second chambers are an artificial construction but the people voted to keep us.</p><p>In response to the important points made by Senator Hayden, the strongest vote to keep us came from working class areas.  I do not know how that happened but it indicates disillusionment with party politics.  In constituencies where every single Deputy wanted this House abolished as much as 68% of the people wanted it retained.  That proves somebody out there has great faith in what we do but we have never really responded.  What did the people vote for?  They voted for some hope and acknowledged that party politics was going wrong.  The Seanad referendum was the start of the Government starting to get into trouble.  </p><p>People mentioned the county councillors.  </p> <p>Why did the county councillors not say to the abolitionists on the Government side that this was not what the grassroots public wanted?  County councillors should have been more active in describing their role in electing people.<br/>The five Independent university Senators are the last part of the vocational element, with 64 departments in my case.  We try to bring that wisdom here.  With regard to the minority aspect, we have unwittingly been chosen by people, especially in working-class areas in Dublin, to represent them as best we can.  They rejected all the party politicians.  I recall posters in Dublin West indicating that only ten or 12 people in the area ever vote in Seanad elections but thousands do so in Ballsbridge.  The people turned out and voted for us to bring an element into the system that is not there currently.<br/>The eighth amendment to the Constitution has been mentioned and I spoke with people in a Fianna F&aacute;il Government some time ago about it.  They told me that every time they tried to implement the amendment, they realised that in reforming the Seanad, they would lose as well as gain.  It was not that people did nothing but rather that every time they tried to act, they realised there were costs associated with change.  The whip system has also been criticised and I agree with those comments.<br/>The Leader has spoken about minorities which we are here to represent.  We had politicians from Northern Ireland in this Chamber on Friday.  In the university constituency, particularly the Trinity example, there are a substantial number of people who support this House and have a vote.  They have rights under the Anglo-Irish Treaty, the 1937 Constitution and the Good Friday Agreement.  They value these rights.  On Friday and today, we discussed the possibility of more quotas for people from both communities in Northern Ireland to attend universities in the South.  Inadvertently, the rate of exchange between the systems has led to a dramatic reduction in the number of people attending our universities.  The Northern Irish Unionist is a minority on the island and one of the functions of this House is to ensure such a person is represented.  We have tried to do so and we have had people from the Orange Order come before us.  We sent a message of sympathy when the Orange halls in Newtowncunningham and Convoy were burned down and attempts were made to burn down the Presbyterian church in Newtowncunningham.<br/>We have tried to reach out and implement many reforms but we must be very careful about the nature of a second House and why it should never be a rival to the other House.  Within those constraints, particularly the reforms proposed by the Leader and the points made by the Minister of State, we can develop a role.  It is a pity for this House that it has spent a year or more trying to stop its abolition rather than the daily work that may not be seen on television and which is barely reported in newspapers but which is extremely valuable nonetheless.  Do Bills leave this House in better shape than when they came in?  Absolutely.  We never use the &quot;R&quot; word - resign - in here as we go through a Bill line by line.  I hope the Ministers bring legislation back to the other House having had the benefit of the wisdom here.  I hope we will always have that in whatever shape the Seanad takes.<br/>People did not vote for a rival to the D&aacute;il in the referendum and perhaps we should have studied those results.  I recall an opinion poll in <i>The Irish Times</i>on the Tuesday before the referendum indicating that 27% of people were in favour of retaining the House but by Friday, that became 52% of people.  It caught the media and political commentators unaware but it is the feeling we experienced on the ground.  We should implement measures on foot of those wishes.</p></speech>

Senator Quinn referred to the working group and it is important that when it is established, it should have input and representation from the Seanad.  That is a very important point that may not have been raised if Senator Quinn had not made it.  The terms of reference should be drawn from the submissions coming from the House, including Senator Crown's Bill and the other legislation from Senator Zappone.  There were three Bills.</p><p>Yesterday, the Taoiseach indicated that he is examining the submissions already made and that other submissions will be taken by the working group.  The door has not been closed and is being opened further for consultation with the working group.  Senator Barrett argued that the second House is always an artificial construction but there is nothing artificial about councillors.  As Senator White stated, they are the most discerning group of people that one could come before.  As Senator White also indicated, the councillors are elected to represent the people-----</p></speech>

Apprenticeship programmes must also be recognised as there are multiple types of education and intelligence, which must recognised to ensure we can be inclusive of all people and cultures.  It is important that the cultural aspect of society is included.   I will contribute again on the relevant sections but it is important to have commented on the composition, as raised by Senator Quinn, as well as the terms of reference of the working group.</p></speech>

I agree with Senator White.  I only needed nine politicians to sign a nomination form and it took me the best part of 12 weeks to get them so I cannot begin to understand how difficult it must be to get past the most discerning group of politicians one would ever find.  I would not discount city or county councillors at all.  There may be some argument for a college system that would allow the general population vote in a geographical area before the process would be passed to councillors.  We could consider that at some stage.</p><p>I am concerned that there is a drive to change the university panel but not examine the rest of the panels.</p></speech>

People involved with the trade union movement and in business should be involved with the labour panel, for example.  Those involved with agriculture should have a say in who is elected to the agricultural panel.</p> <p>I would like to see some reform of the vocational panels.  I would not like to see the vocational panels disbanded or some other change made to them.  One of the riches I have witnessed in this House is the interests of people and the way in which they are able to bring those interests into debates on the Order of Business and on legislation.  I have been extremely impressed by Members from both sides of the House in the short time I have been here.</p><p>I am a little concerned about including the diaspora, although it is a lovely, populist thing to say.  I hold two passports, as do many other people around the world.  Such people could hold up their stars and stripes passport, for example, when there is an election in America and then hold up their Irish passport and vote in a Seanad election, even if they have not been in the country for 40 years.  I believe that is wrong in every sense of the word.  </p><p>Regarding the issue of whether one has a degree or not, I would agree that apprentices are equally as well educated and qualified to elect a Senate Member as anyone who holds a degree.  I did not manage to get a degree until I was nearly 40 and have no academic snobbery about me whatsoever.</p><p>Finally, I would like to see every member of the public given the option to stand for election to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  We have set the bar extremely high, particularly when it comes to a Seanad by-election, where a potential candidate must find nine people to support him or her, rather than the four people that are ordinarily required.  As I will be throwing myself before city councillors in the not-too-distant future, I want to acknowledge their wonderful contribution to the Seanad.  </p></speech>

I agree that unless we initiate electoral reform, the public will not be happy.  We have had a lot of operational reform of the House already.  Indeed, on the first day of this Seanad, the appointee Members were given the option to stay independent if they wished, rather than accepting the party whip, which was a big move.  Many of the appointees have not taken the whip, have been performing very well and have vote for or against the Government as they saw fit.</p><p>I would like to see the franchise for the university panel extended to all graduates.  My own daughter is a graduate of Cork Institute of Technology and very proud of it.  However, she is very aggrieved that her brother, who graduated from University College Cork, can vote in Senate elections while she cannot.  She is not at all pleased about that and cannot understand why her qualifications are not deemed adequate.  She is now working in a professional line and doing very well, which proves that there is nothing wrong with institute of technology qualifications.  Graduates of the institutes of technology are just as able and willing to vote as university graduates.  </p><p>In fairness, the Leader has reformed many of the operational procedures of this House and continues to do so.  Indeed, he will be introducing more new procedures in the near future.  He has always done his best to avoid the use of the guillotine during legislative debates and he must be commended for that.  I hope he will continue in that vein for the remainder of the lifetime of this Seanad.  </p><p>I must disagree with something Senator White said earlier.  I do not know what gave her the idea that it is very easy for a member of the Labour Party to be nominated to run for the Seanad.  </p></speech>

That is being confirmed by Senator White today but I would point out to her that it is no easy task to secure a nomination or to get elected.  We have to go out and face members from all of the councils, the same as everyone else and we have a much smaller electorate than Fianna F&aacute;il has.</p></speech>

As a former Member of this House, I respect every Senator's view.  I commend Senators Quinn and Zappone who have put a lot of work into this Bill, which is well intentioned and which has generated a very welcome debate this evening.  We have only reached section 2 of the Bill and have heard very diverse views across the board.</p><p>That said, I have an obligation as a legislator to point out where the Bill is fundamentally flawed.  </p> <p>As legislators, we are required to robustly scrutinise and analyse all legislation that comes before us.  A number of Senators made the same point. </p><p>The Bill gives rise to significant issues which impact on a number of articles of the Constitution.  I referred previously to Article 15.10 of the Constitution.  The Bill would impact on that Article because the Seanad cannot be directed in legislation on how it does its business, which is what the Bill sets out to do.</p><p>To address some of the points made on Seanad reform in general, given the wide and diverse range of views expressed in this debate, it is clear that it will be difficult - in my view impossible - to arrive at a consensus.  With this in mind, the Taoiseach announced the establishment of a working group which will examine all previous reports, proposals and submissions on Seanad reform and welcome new submissions from Senators and members of the wider public.  The Government has given a commitment that the report will be finalised by the end of February 2015, when it will be submitted to the Government. </p><p>I acknowledge the work the Leader is doing in the background through the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</p></speech>

Those who have been Members of this House for much longer than four years will agree that the frustration of Senators predates the election of the current Government.  In 1979, the people decided in a referendum to extend the university franchise.  Why has this decision not been implemented?  I am pleased to note that I am part of a Government that will introduce legislation in 2015 to extend the university franchise to all graduates.  While this step may be too little too late, Senators must acknowledge that it constitutes progress.  The new working group presents another opportunity for all of us to contribute to the wider debate by making submissions to assist its deliberations.<br/>I propose to respond to a number of queries raised by Senators, specifically Senator Paschal Mooney's question on the issue of passport holders.  The point I tried to make was that the Bill, if enacted in its current form, would place voters overseas at a disadvantage by requiring them to have a passport, whereas people in this country would not be required to have a passport.  The proposal would create an element of discrimination.  We cannot impose a charge on a person by virtue of having a vote on the basis that he or she must have a passport.<br/>I accept the Senator's point on presidential elections and the views and recommendations of the Constitutional Convention.  The Government's response to the recommendations of the convention's report is being prepared in the Department and we will address them in detail in that response.  The Bill, if enacted, would create an element of discrimination against voters outside the State <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>voters in the State.</p></speech>

I will nail my colours to the mast and state that I fully support the right of members of the diaspora to vote in presidential elections.  As to the wider issue of how to deal with the diaspora in other elections, I have a problem with the proposal to extend the franchise that far.  As the Minister of State will be aware, the question of whether to afford the diaspora the right to vote is not new.  It is an old political chestnut that has been tossed around for the past 30 years.  All sorts of lobbies have emerged over the years, particularly in the United Kingdom, seeking a vote for Irish people living abroad.  I distinctly remember a point made by the former T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dick Spring, that under our proportional representation system, he would hate to have to wait for the result from the last box of votes from Boston to decide the final seat in Kerry North, as his constituency was then known.</p><p>Given that the diaspora numbers approximately 70 million people, the decision on how to address the issue of enfranchising Irish people abroad is a considerable problem.  I do not believe it would be possible to do so under the current system, except in the case of presidential elections.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for his indulgence in allowing me to stray a little from the point.</p></speech>

One of the issues the committee considered is that Ireland has a very large diaspora.  While we may wish to engage with members of the diaspora, serious issues arise in terms of how we could do so, particularly in respect of the level of influence the diaspora could have on the electoral system.  One of the issues that arises is whether there should be representation without taxation.

With respect, I do not know how in blazes one could compile an electoral register for the diaspora, scattered as it is throughout the nations of the earth.  Given that we do not have diplomatic representation in half the countries of the world, how would we account for Irish people living in such countries?  They would be disenfranchised under the proposed system.  As I stated, this is a crazy proposal.  Let us start again, because we are in the wrong place, one from which we cannot make progress.  With respect, the Bill is fundamentally flawed, as the Minister of State said.  While I respect the points made by all speakers, we must address basic issues such as the registration of electors, which is not dealt with in the Bill.</p></speech>

Section 35 envisages a role being performed by the Northern Ireland division of the Electoral Commission of the United Kingdom in verifying eligibility to register for applicants based in Northern Ireland.  Legislation passed in this State cannot compel or direct a body in another state to perform a particular function.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-11-12a.615" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1147" speakername="John Crown" time="18:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014111200055#FFF01400"><p>I thank the Minister of State who has certainly been serving above and beyond the call of duty in Seanad &Eacute;ireann today.</p><p>The working conditions of nurses are a source of particular concern to me.  I know that in a health services such as ours we are absolutely blessed by the presence of an extraordinary cohort of nurses.  That they are so much in demand internationally is not a coincidence.  We have extremely high standards in terms of education, professionalism and culture.</p><p>From the perspective of nurses, it looks as if they are under a sustained assault by the Government.  I am sorry to have to say this, but these points have been made to me.  Nurses have seen their salaries decrease by 15% or more; they have experienced the same increases in tax that others have, with the impact of the universal service charge, water and property charges.  They have found that they have to work harder.  One of the unappreciated side effects of the downturn in the economy has been that a number of specific policies which have been put in place have affected the working conditions of nurses who are still in a job.  As there has been an embargo on nursing numbers, units that may have had a number of staff above what was officially sanctioned suddenly experienced the non replacement of staff who had left their jobs.  In addition, there has been a rowing back in the use of agency nurses to fill the gaps, jobs that in truth were filled to try to circumvent issues related to the embargo.  As a result, nurses are doing more of other nurses' work.  The cutbacks in other professional categories in hospitals have meant that nurses are not getting the support of other allied professions and are doing other work that they should not have to do.</p><p>I have previously voiced grave concerns about the graduate nursing scheme.  It is very difficult from where I sit to see this as anything other than an opportunity to get increasing numbers of nurses working at a lower pay grade.  It must be acknowledged also that it is not Civil Service or HSE officials who have to face people when they are confronted with deficiencies in health services as delivered to them.  It is usually nurses who have to bear the brunt.  In the face of all of this why are they being asked to accept another increase in their registration fee to the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland?  This most recent increase means that in a two year period the fee has increased by 80% at a time when the general rate of inflation is approximately 1%.  What extra service or what extra duties are being included in the job description of the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland?</p><p>The representations I have received from nurses and their representatives suggest the two functions of the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland are, first, to take their money and, second, to discipline them.  Nurses are not seeing anything such as career advancement, the protection of the profession or the setting of appropriate standards.  They are very troubled by this.  They believe the board has not been a powerful advocate for their working conditions.  For all of these reasons, they are wondering why they are being asked, uniquely among the health professions, to accept such an extraordinary increase in their registration fee compared to other allied professionals or those involved in medicine.  I remind the Minister of State, as a long-standing supporter of trade unionism, that nurses are still a very highly represented group.</p> <p>I am glad of this.  If it had not been for the strength of the representative organisations conditions of employment would have been worse.  It is important to realise that nursing organisations are very concerned about the latest increase and consider it a bridge too far.  There has been a march towards increased austerity, deteriorating working conditions, less worker satisfaction and increased contribution demands.  Nurses are now being asked not to pay the full newly-increased retention fees that are being demanded.  They are suggesting the standing orders be amended to pay the old fee.  If this happens a huge number of nurses would not be able to turn up for work the next day because they would not be legally registered and would not be indemnified for professional activities.</p><p>I ask the Minister of State to use her good offices to look at this matter critically and find out why this body needs such a large increase in such a short period at a time of low general inflation.  What is being done with the money?  I ask that the actions of others be followed and that there be a freeze on allied health registration fees for at least three years and until there is a change in the working conditions of some of the most hard-working, under-appreciated and unrewarded members of our health service.</p></speech>

As both the Senator and I know, they spend most time at people's bedsides in hospital, no matter what kind of traumatic event has occurred.  Not only do nurses deal with the person in the bed but they usually deal with concerned relatives too so I do not think they are unappreciated.  In different circumstances no Government would contemplate doing what we had to do - everyone had to take a share of the burden.  Nurses are not unappreciated; they are hard-working and have had to do extra work due to the fact that the Government had to lower the number employed.  The moratorium is being eased and we hope that in the near future we can convert some agency staff to the status of full-time staff, though many agency staff do not want full-time contracts, as the Senator knows.  Some people prefer to remain as agency staff as that status can allow flexibility to deal with family obligations and the like.  We hope to convert some graduate nurse contracts into full-time contracts as this is only right and proper.  The measures we took were necessary due to the circumstances facing the country.  I do not wish it to be thought that the Government does not appreciate nurses because it very much does.</p><p>I am responding to this matter on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and on conclusion of my formal reply I will convey to him the Senator's concerns on this issue.  The Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, NMBI, is a self-funding regulatory body with powers to charge such fees as determined by the board in accordance with the Nurses and Midwives Act 2011.  As such it must generate its own income to meet its statutory requirements.  The board is an independent body answerable to the Oireachtas.  It has the responsibility to ensure that it has the financial capacity to undertake all its legal obligations.  These costs include an enhanced regulatory process with supporting systems for continued professional development and certain education and training requirements for the professions.</p><p>The Department of Health is responsible for oversight of the governance of the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland.  The Department has no role in setting or approving registration fees.  It was also made clear at the time of the legislation that the board would continue to be self-funding and needed to plan and cost how it would fulfil its legal obligations.  Following detailed negotiations with the Executive and board members in 2013, it was agreed in October 2013 that an initial once-off sum of &euro;1.6 million would be granted by the Department to the board to cover 2013-14 costs and that the board would have to increase its income in 2015 to undertake its commitments in the legislation.</p><p>On 17 September 2014 the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland voted to increase to &euro;150 the annual retention fee of each registrant nurse and midwife for 2015 from the retention fee level of &euro;100 for each registrant in 2014.  The annual retention fee in 2013 was &euro;88 and this, as the Senator already pointed out, amounts to an 80% increase in two years.  In a recent letter to all nurses and midwives the president of the board explained that the &quot;decision to increase the fee was taken after a democratic vote and much debate&quot; by the board.  He stated that the increase was necessary &quot;to ensure NMBI can continue to perform its regulatory functions effectively.&quot;</p><p>The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, is aware that a campaign not to pay the new fee is actively underway among the staff associations.  His Department has written to the president of NMBI indicating concerns regarding the possible implications for the health service and patient safety should this action continue.  It is therefore imperative that the board proactively engages with the staff associations at the earliest opportunity with a view to reaching a negotiated resolution to the current impasse.  The necessity to avoid a scenario where non-payment of the fee will potentially become a serious matter for both publicly and privately-funded health services must be an urgent priority for the board.</p><p>The Minister has requested that the board give this matter very careful consideration at its meeting on 18 November, with a view to agreeing and implementing a course of action most likely to achieve a satisfactory outcome.  It is understand that the staff associations have sought discussions with the board in this regard.  We would ask the board and the staff associations to take appropriate steps to reach a satisfactory resolution to this situation in the interests of patient safety and continuity of care.  Irish nurses are some of the best-educated and most sought after in the world and we also ask for such steps to ensure this reputation remains intact.</p></speech>

I am reassured by the personal attention of the Minister of State and therefore wish to raise some specific questions.  Nurses are troubled by the board's lack of transparency.  I do not refer to vagueness or waffle in terms of transparency; there are specific concerns.  How much is being spent on external consultants?  What is the hourly rate?  How much is being spent on public relations and legal fees?  The professional competence assurance scheme is a statutory duty of the board that was set up by legislation three years ago but it still has not been implemented.  This is becoming embarrassing.</p><p>Nurses believe the board does two things: it takes nurses' money and it disciplines them.  Nurses need to see something in return for this money.</p></speech>

I mentioned that Dr. Finn Breathnach contacted me to say how vital it is that a specialist maternity hospital be co-located with the national children's hospital.  The life of a baby could be at risk if he or she must be transferred by ambulance rather than pushed across a corridor to the national children's hospital.</p><p>The site at St. James's Hospital has become controversial.  It is a brilliant adult hospital but we are trying to build a children's hospital in its car park.  I hope the national children's hospital gets planning permission but I am worried because the board of that hospital has obviously told the Minister that there is insufficient time for architects to have plans ready in time to submit the two planning permission applications together.</p> <p>What if we get planning permission for the national children's hospital but in a year's time fail to obtain planning permission for the national maternity hospital?  It would be a complete mess.  I am interested to hear the Minister of State's response.</p></speech>

It is a pertinent question.  Not alone is it a pertinent question, but those of us with an interest in children's health are terribly worried about any other barrier being put in the way of the national children's hospital.  We have had too many obstacles and need to push ahead.</p><p>As decided by the Government in November 2012, the new children's hospital will be co-located with St. James's Hospital in Dublin 8.  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board has responsibility for planning, designing, building and equipping the new hospital.  A project brief has been approved and a design team is in place.  The aim is to make a planning application in June 2015.  The Government's intention is that a maternity hospital will be developed on the campus in the future, achieving tri-location of adult, paediatric and maternity services and providing comprehensive health-care services to drive improved clinical outcomes for children and mothers.  The project brief for the children's hospital acknowledges this key policy recommendation and, accordingly, provides for consideration of future maternity hospital requirements in certain shared service areas.  This will underpin future efficiencies in shared services.</p><p>Tri-location is consistent with the recommendations of the 2008 KPMG independent review of maternity and gynaecology services in the greater Dublin area.  In 2008, the proposal in the report was that the National Maternity Hospital be relocated to St. Vincent's, the Coombe to Tallaght and the Rotunda to the Mater, achieving co-location of maternity and adult services in all cases and tri-location of adult, paediatric and maternity services at the Mater Hospital.  With the decision to move the children's hospital to the St. James's campus, previous plans must be reviewed in respect of the Coombe and the Rotunda.  The relocation of the National Maternity Hospital is already under way.  That review is now being commenced and will be completed in early 2015.  This is the first step in progressing the future tri-located maternity hospital.</p><p>As I stated last week in this House, the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board's planning experts have advised that, for a project of this scale, any planning permission application would require significant preparatory work.  This, in the board's view, could not be done by June 2015.  The Minister for Health has no intention of introducing a delay to the project by requesting the board to seek planning permission for a maternity hospital at this stage.  The development board has advised that in submitting its planning application for the children's hospital it intends as a matter of good planning practice - and this is key and was stated in last week's answer - to provide full information on all known future developments for the St. James's campus, including the tri-located maternity hospital.  This will enable An Bord Plean&aacute;la to consider the children's hospital planning application in the context of these future plans for the campus.</p><p>That is key.  We have had the KPMG report since 2008, which is what makes this such a frustrating issue.  However, letting An Bord Plean&aacute;la know that it is intended to apply for a maternity hospital on the site as well should allow it to do the pre-planning preparation that is needed.  In an ideal world, the hospital would have been built by now, but it is not.</p></speech>

The Dolphin report recommended that a master plan should be provided by whatever hospital was chosen.  I have written to the Minister for Health and made a freedom-of-information request and the only master plan I could find from St. James's Hospital dated from 2008.  It has never had a master plan including a maternity hospital.</p><p>We are all human beings and this is vital to the future.  We all care so much about children and the future generations and we should be prepared at this stage to take a step back.  I go back to St. James's, the idea of wasting time and the idea that the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, might consider swapping to Connolly hospital or Blanchardstown for a site.  A media report yesterday said that Deputy Varadkar had written to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, to say he did not have the money to put the information technology systems into the children's hospital.  The money is only sufficient to build it, not to kit it out.  I have not spoken to him since I saw that.  If we went to Connolly hospital, we would not only have the space for the maternity hospital, but the cost would be &euro;500 million as opposed to &euro;650 million.  I remind the Minister of State that with St. James's Hospital, we started with a budget of &euro;485 million and are up to &euro;650 million now.  It was admitted yesterday that we do not have anything in our budget.</p></speech>

Why can we not consider a move at this stage?  St. James's Hospital has 200,000 tonnes of soil and grit to be removed, which is 10,000 lorry loads.  It will take nine months before building can even begin and that is after the planning permission has been obtained.  The site is rife with problems and there are signs that we should take a step back and look at the more cost-effective site, which is the greenfield site where we know the space exists now and for future expansion.  Whether it is in Texas or Toronto, they have doubled their children's hospitals in size in every decade since they were built.  I thank the Acting Chairman for her patience.</p></speech>

I understand what the Senator is saying but I have an awful fear of further delay.  We will not be completed in any event until 2019.  I do not believe the equipping of the hospital will be an issue at that stage.  Hopefully, the economy will have recovered sufficiently.  Everyone involved in the project has an awful dread of moving again.</p></speech>

In light of recent Exchequer figures and the more healthy economic position, it may be a good time to review cuts to such essential services.</p><p>Home Start, Athenry, is a scheme through which volunteers offer support to parents and young children through weekly home visits.  Volunteers offer emotional support and practical help to parents struggling to raise their children due to lack of support in the context of mental health issues, ill health and relationship breakdown.  The scheme has been operating since 2005 and is embedded in the community.  People are aware of its existence and it has aimed to help parents become more independent and confidant so that they no longer need support in future.  There is no doubt about its value.  Up to 50 families a year use the scheme through home visits to 15 families at a time, parent and toddler weekly support groups and courses in parenting, stress management, play and cookery.  Families find the programme most beneficial on foot of the informality of the home visits undertaken and the way in which it is tailored to the needs of each individual parent.</p><p>There are a total of 18 active volunteers and five new ones have just completed preparation courses.  They are ready and willing to continue to help families in the area who need their support.  Unfortunately, Home Start, Athenry, has financial support only up to December 2014 and it is fundamental that extra funding of &euro;30,000 is provided as that is what the scheme reckons is required to facilitate its work supporting families in the Athenry area into next year.  The funding would be put toward co-ordinators' salaries, travel expenses, training and support and other miscellaneous expenses required to permit this badly-needed service to continue to be provided in the area.</p> <p>It is fundamental that it receives extra funding of &euro;30,000 as that is the amount it reckons it will need to carry out their work in supporting families in the Athenry area into next year.  The funding received would be put towards co-ordinators' salaries, travel expenses, training, support and other miscellaneous expenses required to continue with the service that is so badly needed in the area. </p><p>There is no doubt it is an essential service for the area.  I urge the Minister to consider refunding the scheme for 2015 to allow Home-Start Athenry to continue to provide aid and services to families in need. </p></speech>

The Minister is not directly familiar with the organisation in question but the Department of Children and Youth Affairs has sought clarification from the Child and Family Agency on the issue raised.  l understand Home-Start is an organisation which provides support, friendship and practical help to families with one or more children under five years of age, in their own homes.  The establishment of the agency on 1 January 2014, as a key priority for Government, brings together family support services which previously were the responsibility of two State organisations - the HSE and the Family Support Agency.  It provides a platform for better integration of these services.  With the establishment of the agency we now have, for the first time, a situation where support services for families, who need assistance, are being provided under one roof and in a more co-ordinated and integrated way than before.</p><p>The establishment of the agency forms part of an ambitious programme of reform of services to children and families to which the Government is committed.  The reform programme involves a series of initiatives which, taken collectively, are designed to radically overhaul the services for which the agency is responsible.  In the area of family support, the responsibilities of the new agency include that of supporting and encouraging the effective functioning of families, with a particular focus on preventative family support services and early intervention.  A number of priority objectives are being progressed which will inform future service developments in the area of family support.  These include: the development of a strategy for family support and parenting to complement my Department's national policy framework; the alignment of the family resource centres with the overall agency approach to prevention and early intervention; a quality review of the implementation of family support processes in each area as well as the integration of family resource centres within the service delivery framework; and the introduction of Meitheal, the national practice model for all agencies working with children and young people.</p><p>Family is the most important influence on a child's life.  From birth, children depend on parents and family to protect them and to provide for their needs.   Often parents need help and support.  Family support services offer a flexible programme of interventions which are provided through a broad range of skilled family support staff.  The Senator will appreciate that decisions with regard to the recognition of family support organisations for receipt of funding, are appropriate to the Child and Family Agency in the first instance.  The agency has authority under the Child and Family Agency Act 2013 to distribute funding to organisations providing services to children and families.  </p><p>At local level the agency is in the process of realigning its services across Galway city and county.  As part of this process, the Child and Family Agency opened a family support service in September 2013, based in the Athenry primary care centre.  The service covers the greater Athenry, Oranmore, Gort, Craughwell, Ardrahan and Claregalway areas.  This is being done in partnership with For&oacute;ige and the service has five full-time staff.  Plans are also advancing to open a similar community based family support service in the greater Loughrea area later this year.  The agency is also undertaking a wider review of commissioning arrangements generally with a view to ensuring that funded services are provided in line with agency priorities and to ensure that there is ongoing evaluation of value for money.  The strategy will also ensure best practice and evidence-informed interventions.  The commissioning strategy is nearing completion and is due to be rolled out in 2015.  The scope of the agency to provide any additional support for organisations engaged in the provision of both family support services such as Home-Start, will be informed by the analysis and decisions on the allocation of funding available to the agency in 2015.  </p><p>I will ensure that the Minister responsible, Deputy James Reilly, will have the Senator's remarks and the reply conveyed to him.  I hope that will be of some help.  </p></speech>

This is a Gaelscoil in Loughrea, County Galway, which has made a request for a new school building.  I understand it has made a formal application for a departmental review of whether it is a building project, as set out in the Department's three-year building plan, that merits inclusion in the rapid delivery projects.  The board of management is extremely concerned that the school build will not go to construction in the 2015-16 school year and believes, for the following reasons, it needs to be included in the list of schools that are part of the rapid delivery project.  Gaelscoil Riabhach was included in the ministerial announcement in December 2011 to progress to the construction of a 12 classroom school in 2015-16.  Since that date, Galway County Council has assisted the Department in the identification and acquisition of a suitable site in the town for the school.</p><p>Sites were investigated through 2012 and a suitable site was identified in 2013.  Negotiations failed at an advanced stage.  I am informed that another suitable site has been identified and that negotiations are again at an advanced stage.  However, even with the speediest expedition with contracts, four months for planning permission and sale would still be required.  Following this, a tendering process would mean that it would be late 2015 before any construction might commence.  If the project was included in the rapid delivery projects it would ensure an earlier commencement in construction and a project completion date prior to September 2016.</p><p>At present the school has 30 confirmed enrolments for September 2015 and 24 for September 2016.  This is prior to its official enrolment period of December to January, during which it envisages an additional enrolment of at least ten children for each of the years.  The board of management is tasked with planning for school improvement and has been working on the basis that a school building will be provided by September 2016.  Additional accommodation was required last September due to the appointment of an administrative principal and this was declined by the Department.  Additional accommodation will be required in September 2016 on its present site if the new building is not available.  Leasing prefabricated buildings at that stage on a year-by-year basis will be expensive for the Department and will require major groundwork on the present temporary site.</p><p>At least three of the classrooms are inadequate for the provision of the primary school curriculum in a manner that does not compromise the health and safety of the students.  In the past two years the school has implemented the Aistear programme and the volume of the classrooms is limiting its ability to provide this central aspect of the curriculum in a safe manner.  By 2016 it envisages that it would be necessary to remove two of the four classrooms, which are less than 45 sq m.  Its landlord, Coiste D&uacute;iche, will remove the buildings but the leasing of two classrooms on short-term leases will require an application for additional funding from the Department.  I would appreciate if the Minister of State would clarify the position and, in particular, if this application could be forwarded to the rapid delivery project section.</p></speech>

I thank the Senator for raising the matter as it provides me with the opportunity to clarify the current position in regard to the major capital project for Gaelscoil Riabhach, Loughrea, County Galway.</p><p>The Senator will be aware of the demographic challenge facing the education system in the coming year.  Primary enrolments, which have already risen substantially in recent years, are projected to rise by almost 37.000 pupils by 2016 and they are set to continue to rise, with a likely peak in 2019.  In order to meet the needs of our growing population of school going children, the Department must establish new schools as well as extending or replacing a number of existing schools in areas where demographic growth has been identified.</p> <p>The delivery of these new schools, together with the extension projects to meet future demand, will be the main focus of the Department's budget for the coming years.  Loughrea, County Galway, has been identified as an area of demographic growth.  In that context, the project to provide a new school for Gaelscoil Riabhach is included in my Department's five-year building plan and listed among those to proceed to construction in 2015-16.</p><p>The site acquisition for Gaelscoil Riabhach, Loughrea, is currently under way.  The Senator may be aware that a memorandum of understanding between my Department and the County and City Managers Association was signed in 2012.  This memorandum fosters increased levels of co-operation and formalises the local authorities' part in identifying and securing suitable sites for educational use.  In that context, officials from my Department have been working very closely with officials from Galway County Council on securing a suitable site for a new school building for Gaelscoil Riabhach.  I can confirm that a suitable site has been identified and the site acquisition process is at an advanced stage.  However, as I am sure the Senator will appreciate, there are sensitivities associated with land acquisition which limits the information which can be provided.  At this time I am not in a position to provide further information about the site acquisition.</p><p>In the interim, an application for office space was received from the Gaelscoil.  However, it was advised that it was not possible to accede to its request in view of the general need to prioritise the provision of essential mainstream classrooms for demographic growth and the short-term need, given the inclusion of a new building for the Gaelscoil in the five-year plan.  I wish to advise the Senator that, subject to no unforeseen issues arising, it is anticipated that the project for the Gaelscoil will be advanced into architectural planning with the aim of bringing the project to tender and construction as soon as possible.  In that regard, the accommodation project brief for the new school building is currently being finalised and the Department will continue to liaise with the school authority on progress.   I again thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to outline the current position in regard to the major capital project for Gaelscoil Riabhach, Galway.</p></speech>

The children were in it by September.  It was quite incredible to watch.  Having the same structure and architectural drawings in place for six, eight, 12 or 16 classrooms works.  The buildings are not prefabricated with sections being dropped in, rather, they are good quality school buildings with good environmental features.  They are well placed and surrounded by good areas.  I did not think it was possible to complete a building so quickly.  It is a well designed, modern and cheerful building, all the things we expect for our children.  Sometimes we forget that the building industry, like everything else in this world, has advanced considerably.</p></speech>
