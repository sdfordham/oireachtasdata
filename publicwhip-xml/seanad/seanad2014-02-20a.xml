I hope that the Government will show the new Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga, R&oacute;n&aacute;n &Oacute; Domhnaill, a lot more respect than it showed the previous one, Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Cuirre&aacute;in.  Perhaps the Government will listen to the thousands of people who marched in Dublin last week to celebrate L&aacute; M&oacute;r na Gaeilge.  Today's debate will be interesting.  I hope that the Government fully commits itself to the protection and improvement of the Irish language and allowing State services to be accessed through Irish.</p><p>Does the Deputy Leader support or have full confidence in the Minister for Justice and Equality?  Does the Minister have the confidence of her colleagues in Government but particularly the Labour Party?  As junior coalition partner, her party has a role to play in the matter.  On a daily basis over the past two weeks we have witnessed the Minister's attempts  to rubbish whistleblowers and attack the man but not deal with the issue.  Yesterday my party leader gave details to the Taoiseach about allegations made by the whistleblower, Garda McCabe, who needs to be commended.  Let us recall, a short two weeks ago, the evidence that the Garda Commissioner gave to the Committee of Public Accounts and the Minister, Deputy Shatter, in which they tried to rubbish the whistleblower.  Very serious allegations were made.  Even if there is a scintilla of truth to them they deserve to be looked at and not swept aside.  The Government has tried to drape a veil of secrecy over the issue.</p><p>The same applies to the Government's handling of the GSOC.  I am glad that there is now some type of a review although the Minister said that we did not need an independent review.  Let us remember what type of review we are getting.  It is an independent desktop review and is not an inquiry.  Two very serious issues have arisen.  The Seanad led the way because we tabled a motion of no confidence in the Minister nearly 18 months ago and I am inclined to do the same again.  However, we need to get to the truth of these matters, which are very serious.  The Minister has acted as if he owned the Department, the justice system and the Garda; he does not.  He is a servant of the people of the State and should act accordingly.  He should show due respect to the people who put their necks on the line to publicise the truth of these matters but he has not done so.</p><p>I ask for a debate to be arranged, in due course, on the way the Minister has handled these matters.  I specifically want to know whether he has the confidence and support of the Deputy Leader.</p><p>On a lighter note, I congratulate the Irish cricket team on its magnificent victory yesterday over the West Indies in Jamaica.   </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-02-20a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014022000003#B02400"><p>I welcome the research broadcast this morning by Mr. Kieran Cuddihy on Newstalk radio because it reflected the issues raised here on Tuesday afternoon about penalty points.  We raised, with the Minister, the fact that there were some 318,000 penalty points in 2012 that were attached to people with no licence.  Mr. Cuddihy has updated that figure to 445,000.</p><p>It appears there is a problem in the Courts Service.  Mr. Cuddihy's findings show that one can turn up in court without a driving licence and nothing will happen.  He said that at the moment the reality is that drivers can turn up in court without a copy of their licence and be issued penalty points that will disappear into the system.  We have the undertaking that the Courts Service will, in the near future, commence providing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with details of the incidence of the non-production of driving licences.  It will then be a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to commence prosecutions.</p><p>On Tuesday last during the course of the debate on the relevant legislation we had asked, in an amendment, that what is currently published as the category, people with no licence, be broken down into numbers.  The Minister gave other categories to the House such as learner permits, no licences, licences from outside the jurisdiction, the non-appearance in court and unmatched penalty points from previous years.  Therefore, we received quite misleading data and the Minister, on the instigation of the House, has taken steps to correct the situation.  The result will be safe roads and more reliable data.</p><p>The House has played an important role in this.  We had a listening Minister who realised that the penalty points should have been attached to existing drivers rather than attributed to new drivers without a licence.  The result is that we will have a more reliable basis on which to formulate road safety.  Undoubtedly, if penalty points are properly attached then the roads will be much safer.  We are indebted to the broadcaster today but also to the House and to the fact that the Minister listened to us last Tuesday.</p></speech>

However, in an adjoining room, before the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality a more serious debate was taking place, which we are now charged with addressing, on the issue of domestic violence.  I made a clear statement about my family situation yesterday.  Following that, I had to telephone my mother and my three brothers and sisters who did not know what I was going to say.  I did not know what I was going to say myself but it is something that we needed to publicise.  I could have done any number of radio or television interviews this morning and I did not do so because of that.  I spoke to my sister in Australia earlier.</p><p>I have never drafted a Bill but I am going try to do that before we finish our session in this House and I am lucky that Senators Bacik and Zappone are members of the justice committee along with me.  We need to criminalise domestic violence.  We do not need to do much else but at least we might wipe out between 30% or 40% of the problem if we criminalise yet.  Many groups appeared before the committee yesterday and it was a harrowing meeting that lasted almost three hours.  They talked about refuge.  We had this terrible situation in Ireland of talking about reform but that happens after the act or the crime has been committed.</p><p>Over the coming months I would appreciate the help of colleague to bring forward legislation to criminalise domestic violence, to provide that garda&iacute; when they visit a house become witnesses after the event and to give evidence in court about what they have witnessed and to call the doctor to effectively take a picture of the crime scene.  In addition, a peace commissioner should be empowered to sign a paper to remove the perpetrator of the crime, male or female, from the home.  The notion of taking the mother or father and the children away from the home to a refuge is wrong; we need to take the perpetrator away from the family home and we need to deal with the person who committed the crime.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach and the Deputy Leader will be supportive of that but, as a House, we need to do this.</p><p>This has been a chronic issue all over the country for many years.  One man at yesterday's meeting referred to the 1990s when reviews and reports were carried out.  I am aged 54 and I was able to take him back to 1964 or 1965.

We are charged with correcting this and I hope we can do that over the coming months and bring legislation forward to deal with it.</p></speech>

The Minister likes to attend the House and he often attends for lengthy periods but there is a great deal of disappointment and frustration about the manner in which the alignment process has unfolded, especially in respect of documentation and letters that have issued to local authorities, in the first instance, that are then made available to the LDC network.  An alignment working group was set up and that brought together representatives of the Irish Local Development Network, ILDN, the City and County Managers Association, Pobal and the Department to work through proposals to effect the process but, unfortunately, the group has not met since last September.</p><p>The ILDN believes the release of the documentation to front-runner local authorities and then to all other local authorities by the Department has undermined the credibility of the working group process.  There is a great deal of confusion about the delivery mechanisms and the working and contractual arrangements between local community development committees, LCDCs, and LDCs.  The Minister should come to the House to clarify issues relating to the tendering process, the delivery of programmes, the need to provide Leader programmes and traditional funding for a number of LDCs, the proposal that LCDCs will become local action groups in the context of the Leader programme and the implications of this decision for relevant LDCs and the management of communications, for example, with networks such as the ILDN, which is a key partner in the alignment process.  I have received correspondence from local groups such as Breffni Integrated Limited and Monaghan Integrated Development and there is a great deal of concern about what the future holds for these groups, how they will navigate their way through the next funding period and what that will mean for the work they do in their communities, for example, with businesses and disadvantaged young people.  This is an important debate the House should have and it would give us an opportunity to discuss these important outstanding issues.</p></speech>

Three players from my area will, hopefully, play a major part in securing a win in Twickenham.</p><p>I was also subjected to violence not in the home but in the school and on the football field in my young days.  When one did not pass the ball properly one had to drop one's togs and one was given six or ten of the best across the &quot;you know what&quot; with a cane that length.  That was violent and these people should have been locked up.  I support the call by Senator Mulcahy and, although I did not attend the committee meeting yesterday, I congratulate him on defining his own issue.  It is criminal and nothing else for somebody to turn up at a house, see blood on the floor and say it is a domestic issue and no concern of the Garda.  That is unbelievable and it is time domestic violence was criminalised.  My peers and I witnessed violence in school and elsewhere outside the school.  It is time we did something about it.  I hope the violence of yesteryear is not happening today.</p></speech>

This was the Abbey Theatre at its best; it was electrifying.  There was no doubt it was world class.  I had to laugh inwardly because many commentators and critics were moderate in their praise when John B. Keane was alive and they rather looked down on him.  This play is a masterpiece and there was no flaw in the Abbey Theatre production in respect of the lighting, Deputy, direction and the setting, for example, the way in which the cottage interior blended with the ruggedness of the mountain.  There were laughs in it and the language was wonderful, as language from Kerry is always, but there was tragedy and drama with the two wonderful thinkers and the bodhr&aacute;n.  I saw the first production of the play in the Queen's Theatre, Dublin, many years ago when I was a teenager and I never thought it could be exceeded but this production has done so.  I am not ashamed to say that the extraordinary moment at the end when the bodhr&aacute;n was played softly almost as a lament brought tears to my eyes.</p> <p>I was very glad that John B. Keane's family were there to see it.  It was a triumph for our national theatre and should be celebrated as such.  It analysed not just evil but its causes and misery.  I would like Senator Mac Conghail to pass on our congratulations to all the actors, including his wife who was wonderful.</p></speech>

It concerns the recent trip to Japan.  I am sorry the Cathaoirleach is not here today because he is charged with defending the rights of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  They were not defended and the Cathaoirleach was pathetically weak.  I remember a situation before when I almost managed to get a Cathaoirleach removed for interfering with a delegation.  I accept the Cathaoirleach did not interfere in this trip to Japan but he stood idly by while a Deputy from the other House, Deputy Emmet Stagg, the Labour Party Whip, stuck his nose into this House.

It took much courage but, knowing him for a long time, he is a straight talker and always calls it as it is.  He has done the State some service with his contribution yesterday.  I did not know, until l had a discussion with Senator Mulcahy last night, that it is not a crime to commit an act of domestic violence.  I thought violence of any nature was always a crime.</p><p>This is a real shortcoming in our legislation that this type of behaviour can go unpunished if it is regarded as a domestic incident.  We need to empower the Garda to be able to act as witnesses in these situations.  We need, as Senator Mulcahy said, to remove the perpetrator from the family home.  I look forward to legislation to this effect being brought forward by the Government as a matter of urgency.  All colleagues will contribute to ensure a speedy passage of such legislation.</p><p>The allegations contained in this morning&rsquo;s newspapers and passed on to the Taoiseach by the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il are very worrying.  I hope we get to the truth of this.  There is no person better than the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, to get to the truth quickly and to seek total openness and transparency.  We all need to express confidence in the justice system and get to the bottom of any wrongdoing.</p></speech>

Fianna F&aacute;il joins with other Members in offering support to the Senator and to legislation, whether amending or new, to criminalise this quiet act going on across the country.  It not only affects women and children but also men, a point some forget.  Men are bullied and beaten in their homes.  It affects every segment of a family and should be criminalised.  I am horrified.  Until Senator Mulcahy&rsquo;s contribution yesterday, I did not realise it was not a criminal matter.  I encourage the Senator to bring forward legislation in this regard as a matter of urgency which Fianna F&aacute;il will support.</p><p>I attended yesterday&rsquo;s presentation by the Irish Postmasters Union in Buswells Hotel, as did many other Members.

As a result, people in larger counties have to travel up to 80 to 90 miles to a centre to apply for a driving licence.  This is not acceptable.  Will the Deputy Leader impress upon the Government the importance of a level playing field to allow our post offices tender for any State contracts and thus ensure they can remain in rural areas?

Spats aside, it is important the whole issue of domestic violence has been put back on the agenda.  I would welcome a debate on this issue again.  We have already had several debates on it.</p> <p>It is a very serious issue to which I have drawn attention on a number of occasions in the joint policing committee meetings I have attended.  It is one of the statistics that has been increasing month after month and meeting after meeting.  </p><p> We have been talking about performances.  I am looking forward to going to the Abbey Theatre to see a version of &quot;Sive&quot;, in which I performed when I was a young fellow with hair.  That is a few years ago.  We certainly had a wonderful performance yesterday at the Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions.  I would call it a performance and a <i>tour de force</i>worthy of the Abbey stage.  The Minister for Justice and Equality certainly gave a great rendition but I do not think any of the Deputies or Senators there fully believed him in respect of what has been happening in connection with GSOC.  The inquiry certainly does not go far enough.  I know the Labour Party has been trying to take the kudos for pushing for an inquiry but the fact that it will not be done under the Commission of Investigation Act 2004 is regrettable.  We should be pushing for that because we need the compellability that would go with that.  The handling of the whistleblower affair leaves much to be desired, as does the fact that the confidential recipient has ostensibly been fired.  There are some very worrying reports in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>and I believe on &quot;The Pat Kenny Show&quot;, particularly one by Michael Clifford, about the case of Sylvia Roche Kelly who was murdered.  The article by Michael Clifford states:<blockquote>The reality, though, is that the case was an example of serious malpractice within the garda&iacute; for which there can only be two plausible explanations.  Either there was gross incompetence by a number of officers, or there was an organised cover-up designed to avoid scandal in the wake of an initial mistake. </blockquote>That is a very serious allegation at which we really need to look.  Given all the shenanigans that have been going on relating to these very serious issues, does the Deputy Leader and the Labour Party have full confidence in the Minister for Justice and Equality or does the Deputy Leader agree with our deputy leader, Deputy Mary Louise O'Donnell that-----</p></speech>

Speaking as a member of the legal profession who practised family law, as did the Leas-Chathaoirleach, I can say that sometimes even when one uses the courts system, abuse of it can take place, particularly in respect of the prolonging of litigation and proceedings.  I have seen situations where family law cases have gone on for 12 years.  Some 25 court orders later, the case goes to the Supreme Court.  There are a number of cases going to the Supreme Court with long delays and it is just a protracted exercise.  It is something at which we need to look.  In respect of family law and domestic violence, it is very easy to criticise a Minister for Justice and Equality.</p></speech>

It is important that this recognition is given.  I believe domestic violence, particularly the number of serious incidents in private settings in the past two months, is frightening.  The number of stabbings and murders is frightening and is something at which we need to look.  However, we also need to look at it in our education system in terms of respect for one another.  I am not too sure about whether we are doing enough of that.  Regardless of whatever law is put in place, we must also change the culture in that area in some quarters.  We need to look at respect for one another in our education system.</p></speech>

The loophole will now be closed by the Courts Service and credit must go to Senator Barrett for drawing our attention and that of the Minister to this and for putting down an amendment on that basis.</p><p>  In respect of GSOC, my attention was drawn to the fact that it is just so involved so I went back to look at the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  Section 80(6) refers to various reports by GSOC which it set up at that stage.  The constitutional position is that GSOC reports to the legislator - the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  I will outline two very pertinent points.  Section 80(3) states that &quot;the report submitted under <i>subsection (2)</i> may contain recommendations for improving the effectiveness of the Ombudsman Commission&quot;.  Section 80(5) states that &quot;the Ombudsman Commission may make any other reports that it considers appropriate for drawing to the Minister's attention matters that have come to its notice and that, in its opinion, should, because of their gravity or other exceptional circumstances, be the subject of a special report to the Minister.&quot;  Section 80(6) is the important one because it states that &quot;as soon as practicable after receiving a report under this section, the Minister shall cause a copy of the report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas&quot;.  I have not seen that report.  I assume it has been given to the Minister and that the Minister is obliged to lay it before each House of the Oireachtas.  I am not sure if this has happened and I ask the Deputy Leader to confirm that this has not yet happened and confirm whether it is due to happen.  The subsection states &quot;as soon as practicable after receiving a report under this section, the Minister shall cause a copy of the report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas&quot;.  To the best of my knowledge, we have not seen it here.  I would welcome knowledge as to whether we are going to have it laid before us and the reason the Minister has not done so up to now.  </p></speech>

A Government action plan is required for the survival of the post office.  The dismantling of rural Ireland continues apace.  We have seen Garda stations close in many rural areas and an increase in the amount of break-ins and burglaries that have ensued when garda&iacute; are not on the ground to deal with these issues.  We have also seen the local pubs and shops all being seriously affected.  We have seen emigration, which has decimated many GAA clubs, and now we see post offices being abandoned by this Minister.  I am appalled that a Minister, particularly one from the Labour Party, would favour big international business interests over small post office operations that often are run by families and indeed people in rural areas who need those operations.  I accept fully that there is a need to have an economic balance.</p><p>On my local radio station this morning, I heard a former colleague of mine, Hugh Byrne, speak about the decimation of rural Ireland and the need to deal with these issues.  There is a dearth of social capital in rural Ireland which must be addressed.  I call on the Minister to say that while economic issues must be addressed, they must also be balanced with the social issues involved in this.  If we are just going to deal with the administration of Government as a fiscal issue, it would be far better to engage accountants and let them do the job because they would be far more proficient at it.  Unfortunately, democracy depends on politicians who have an interest in social issues and who balance economic issues with those social issues.  That is not happening.  As a member of Fianna F&aacute;il, I must say that we have always subscribed fully to proper rural development and infrastructure that underpin good healthy rural societies.  Our post offices were one of the fundamental pillars of that.  I am asking this Government to turn its back on the route it is following and the influence huge businesses are having to the detriment of the citizen.</p></speech>

The first is the very serious crisis in Ukraine, the political ramifications arising from such a crisis and the interaction with the European Union and Russia.</p> <p>We need to hear the official Government position and response from the T&aacute;naiste.</p><p>In recent days the UN report issued a report on the ongoing humanitarian, political and social crisis in North Korea.  It was of no surprise, as North Korea is a Stalinist, almost hidden state.  The shocking details in the report must result in the strongest possible response from the UN, the EU and every civilised country.  Families and citizens are being detained in concentration camps.  The UN report likened the situation to the Nazi regime, but pointed out the significant difference that we fully know what is happening.  The T&aacute;naiste, on behalf of the Government, should issue a strong response and ensure the international community does not keep turning a blind eye to the shocking humanitarian and political crisis in North Korea.  We are referring to a country that might have access to nuclear weaponry and is certainly a danger to international relations, yet there has been no response at UN or EU level of meaningful import.  We must debate the matter and try to initiate some degree of response.</p></speech>

With this in mind, I will ask a question of the Deputy Leader, herself a distinguished lawyer.  Let me state at the outset that I have great respect for the intellect and reforming zeal of the Minister for Justice and Equality, one of the smartest and most able to ever occupy that office.  He has brought a real energy for reform, which I commend.  However, there is something deeply troubling about the culture of a public service in which the person who is responsible for protecting whistleblowers advises a whistleblower that perhaps the latter should not blow the whistle because of personal consequences for himself or herself.</p></speech>

If individuals blow whistles about problems, it is not the job of the public sector to put down the shutters, pull up the drawbridge and protect itself.  Rather, its job is to protect the people in whose interests it should be acting.  Frequently, and with no disrespect to our many fine public servants, this does not happen.  The higher up the food chain one goes, the less likely it is to happen.</p><p>One then factors in other recent disclosures, for example, public bodies like the HSE sending threatening letters to people who publicly and legitimately criticised aspects of public policy.  One must have a serious think about from where this culture is emanating.  Is the Deputy Leader happy that an appropriate culture of respect for whistleblowing exists in the public service or is it something about which we need to have a serious think?  I wonder if this would be an opportunity to hold a public consultation forum in this Chamber at which people might have the opportunity to discuss specific examples of the protection of the State not being appropriately accorded to people who brought serious concerns that, five, ten or 15 years later, we know were often legitimate and involved matters as diverse as child abuse, financial mismanagement and specific acts of malfeasance by individual public servants.  Perhaps we need to have a little retreat on this issue to readjust ethical compasses.</p></speech>

Only one question now counts - has the public confidence in this review?  It does not.</p><p>To achieve confidence, it is becoming clear that on this issue alone, the Minister, Deputy Shatter, must step aside.  He is a fine Minister with an incredible work rate and a great intellect but he is too heavily embroiled in this issue for the public to have confidence in him.  The review must be seen to be independent of him.  It is critical that the public feel confident around such security issues.  If the Deputy Leader commented on what I have said, it would be useful.</p><p>Other questions arise.  Will the review's terms of reference be debated in the Houses?  As Senator Quinn stated, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, which set up the GSOC in 2005, makes it clear that the GSOC should report to the Legislature.  The confidential recipient was stood down yesterday.  When will a new one be appointed?</p></speech>

It was not easy for him and took a lot of guts.  It was good to see, as we need a bit more of that.</p><p>I also join with others regarding the threat to rural post offices.  I was brought up beside a post office.  My grandmother had the post office and my father is now its postmaster.  In my experience, rural post offices are under pressure.  My village has lost its bank, which used to be across the road.  We have an ATM somewhere in the town.  The Garda station was closed recently.  Services are dwindling.  As was mentioned during a presentation yesterday, the post office is the heart of the community.  It is a place where people meet in the morning.  Most importantly, it provides a social service.</p><p>With a small bit of will, the network could be improved.  My sister and mother, who work behind the counter, tell me stories about how they can see in the faces of the young fellows who go to the post office every week that the latter are despondent and down on their luck.  The dole has been cut for lads aged under 25 years.  To keep their old cars on the road, they can only tax them for three months at a time.  They are being penalised because they cannot pay an entire year's tax at one time.  If they could pay the tax in the post office, that would be something.  They used to be able to rent flats in town but have had to return home to mammy and daddy.  They do not have the few bob to have a few pints at the weekend, so they must sit inside with their mothers and fathers watching &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; or whatever.  The situation for young fellows in rural Ireland is demoralising.</p><p>I have asked the Minister for Social Protection to speak to me about this matter.</p> <p>The post office should be the first point of call for people who are unemployed and on the dole.  They could be directed from the post office by the people who know them and who work there.  I was going to set up a register of people who are unemployed and looking for work and to list the skills that are available.  People who are looking for work locally could then check the register to see what is available.  Unfortunately, the Minister does not want to do that.</p><p>There are many other ways in which the post office can be enhanced and used better.  What about the likes of motor taxation?  Why can that not be renewed in a post office?  I cannot understand why the new driving licences were not given to the post offices.  There is plenty that the Government, including the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Minister for Social Protection, could do if those responsible liaised with the Irish Postmasters Union and An Post.  This is something that should be done.</p><p>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for his indulgence, but before I finish, I believe it must be made clear that if the service is not being used by local people, then we will lose it.  I appeal to people who are getting their pensions to think beyond simply getting it into their bank account in a handy way.  People should use the post office and the services it provides.  They should go down and meet the neighbours and the people there.  They should keep the community alive and keep the post offices alive, because when they are gone they will not be coming back.</p></speech>

Of course we do.  Senator Crown put it eloquently when he spoke of the intellect and reforming zeal of the Minister and this is undoubtedly the case.

It is welcome that we will now have an independent review carried out by Mr. Justice Cooke.  The terms of reference, as colleagues will be aware, provide for the judge to take oral or other evidence; it is not simply a desktop review, as has been suggested.  It is a tightly drawn review in terms of timing.  This is welcome because we are all keen to see the review dealt with swiftly and to see clarity in particular on the sequence of events.

I would be glad to have a debate on the issue generally in the House, including the terms of reference and the independent review.  I am unsure whether we are better off doing it when we have seen the independent review report or now.  That is a matter I will take up with the Leader's office.</p><p>I wish to correct the record because some colleagues are a little unclear about the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  This Minister inherited a rather flawed structure for accountability of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the 2005 Act.  Many of us were highly critical of the 2005 Act introduced by a previous Government under the then Minister, Mr. McDowell.  In fact the Act created a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that is accountable directly to the Minister.  Someone suggested the force was accountable to the Legislature but that is not correct.  Senators should examine the provisions of the Act.  One of the problems is that it creates too close a relationship between the Minister for Justice and Equality of the day and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I remember speaking in 2004 and 2005, as did many other people, contrasting that legislation with the PSNI reforms, under which there is a policing board that is directly linked between the political leadership and the operational leadership of the Commissioner.</p></speech>

I am pleased the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality has been asked to advise on changes to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act.  We discussed the matter yesterday afternoon at our meeting.  We will be looking with urgency at necessary reforms to the provisions relating to the GSOC.  There was cross-party agreement on the need to consider broader reform of the Act to ensure greater accountability mechanisms.</p><p>I am pleased the Minister has already promised reform of the GSOC by way of an amendment to enable a serving garda to make complaints to the GSOC.  This has been a clear flaw with the GSOC.  At the time the GSOC was set up I was critical because it was clearly a weakened version of the structure in Northern Ireland with the tripartite model rather than a single person.  Straight away we were diluting authority.  We will debate all of this at the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  There are many issues here and many of them cannot be laid at the door of the Minister.  This is a flawed structure and I am pleased we will have an independent review of the allegations around bugging, which are serious indeed.</p><p>Senator O'Brien should do good news more often because it suits him.</p></speech>

I commend the Senator on his important contributions and on his proactive engagement.  It is a good example of the important work the Seanad can do with a listening Minister and it is good to hear this issue was highlighted this morning on Newstalk.</p><p>Senator Mulcahy spoke about his contribution yesterday at the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality on domestic violence.  I was privileged to be present for the full three hour hearing on domestic violence and to be there in particular with Senator Zappone during Senator Mulcahy's powerful and moving contribution in which he spoke about his personal experience.  As others have said, he deserves our thanks because he brought home to everyone listening the appalling experience of domestic violence.  I support Senator Mulcahy in his call for legislation and for a change in culture in respect of criminalisation.</p><p>I emphasise for colleagues, however, that domestic violence is criminalised.  The Garda police this and there has been a change in culture to take it more seriously.  However, what we do not have is a specific offence of domestic violence.  This was the issue several groups, including Safe Ireland, raised with us yesterday.  By contrast, for example, Sweden has a specific offence of domestic violence.  Here, the Garda prosecutes on the basis of assault or non-fatal offences against the person legislation, which has a range of assault offences.  Naturally, domestic violence encompasses these offences and sexual offences, under the sexual offence laws.  Indeed, most commonly it is prosecuted as a breach of barring orders.  This is because where a barring order is in place, a breach of that barring order by a perpetrator of violence is of itself a criminal offence.  There is extensive criminalisation but perhaps not the targeted focused criminalisation of a specific offence, which might improve the culture of policing and apprehension of perpetrators.</p><p>Senator Mulcahy spoke eloquently about the need for the Garda to be more proactive by removing perpetrators from the scene of the crime, which is what the family home is, rather than having the victims and, usually, children having to flee the family home, as often happens now.  It was powerful and we were all moved by it.  The Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality is drawing up a solutions focused report on the changes to legislation necessary to make domestic violence policing more effective.  I know we have a listening Minister on the matter who is very committed to this legislation.</p><p>Senator Reilly commented on the local and community development companies and the alignment issue.  I imagine the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, would be happy to come to the House to take statements on this issue and to update us on progress.  I understand councillors will have more powers and there will be more formal alignment arrangements.  The Senator raised some practical issues that may be teased out with the Minister.</p><p>Senator Brennan also congratulated the cricket team and remarked on the need to criminalise violence in all its forms in the home and in schools.  Again, we heard powerful testimony and I thank him for his support.</p><p>Senator Norris congratulated Senator Mac Conghail and give a strong endorsement of the performance of &quot;Sive&quot; last night.  I was sorry I could not see it myself but I hope to see it at some point.  Senator Norris's description of the play as a masterpiece sounds right.</p><p>The Senator also mentioned the visit to Japan.  I will be following that up with the D&aacute;il Whips.  I understand the invitation came from the Whip's office, which is not the appropriate place.  Senator Coghlan has pointed out to me that we should put this on the agenda for the next meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</p> <p>Perhaps we will have cross-party support for it.</p><p>Senator Mullins complimented Senator Mulcahy on his contribution and spoke on domestic violence and on the policing allegations.  Senator Wilson also commended Senator Mulcahy and spoke of the need to ensure more effective criminalisation of domestic violence.  He also spoke about the issues in respect of the Irish Postmasters Union.  I gave a full response to that yesterday, when I said that the Government is committed to sustaining a viable An Post network, and supports the maintenance of a maximum number of economically viable post offices.  We have one of the most extensive post office networks per head of population in the EU.  I gave the numbers on that and pointed out that we could have a debate on the report published last year by the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications on the sustainable future of post office networks.  However, as I said yesterday, An Post is a commercial State body.  It has seen an enormous drop in its business in the traditional mail volumes, which have fallen by 25% in five years, simply due to changes in people's practices.  It is bidding for other business on a level playing field.  Local property tax is paid through the post office and An Post has been recently selected, following competitive tender, by the Department of Social Protection to provide over-the-counter cash services to social welfare recipients.  It will pitch strongly in the tendering process for the e-payment business of the Department of Social Protection.  Senator Mooney proposed an amendment on the Order of Business on this issue yesterday, so those who raised it today should look at the record to see what was-----</p></speech>

If we table a motion on that and have a debate on it, we can tease out those issues.  An Post certainly has been successful in tendering for State business in the recent past, and I hope it will be successful in the near future as well.</p><p>Senator Moloney spoke about domestic violence and a motion she put forward recently in the House.  She also spoke about A Vision for Change and last night's debate.  It is unfortunate that it was dominated by a particular issue, and I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, would be happy to come back to address the broader issues.  We will certainly ask her to do so.  She has been here on many occasions to debate these and other issues.</p><p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh spoke on the issue of domestic violence and raised the issue of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, which I think I have dealt with.  There are very worrying new allegations about failures in policing, such as the Sylvia Roche Kelly case.  The flaws in the investigation process of the Sophie Toscan du Plantier murder are on the record for a long time.  There are particular issues, but they are more operational policing issues that we need to examine.</p></speech>

He pointed out the contribution the Minister has made already in improving family law.</p><p>Senator Quinn commended Senator Barrett on the Road Traffic Bill 2013, and raised the issue of GSOC.  He referred to reports under section 80 of the 2005 Act.  In fact, that is not the relevant provision in the current controversy.  It was wrongly raised in the D&aacute;il by the Minister, but he later corrected himself.  It is section 102 and section 103 of the Act, and I suggest colleagues look at them.  Section 102(4) provides for the public interest investigations of the sort which GSOC in fact commenced, although it is unfortunate we did not know that until later last week.  Once such an investigation begins, under section 103, GSOC has an obligation to supply the Minister with a report.  It is a different, qualified obligation in the sense that GSOC does not have to provide the information if it believes it is not in the public interest.  The legislation is complex in terms of reporting requirements.  GSOC has placed other reports before the Oireachtas under section 80, but in this controversy there are different provisions which deal with reporting obligations.</p><p>Senator Walsh also spoke about post offices.  Senator Bradford spoke about international affairs.  I can certainly ask for the T&aacute;naiste's presence.  He was in the House recently for a debate on Syria.  I understand he is in Brussels this morning, attending an extraordinary Foreign Affairs Council meeting of EU ministers on the crisis in Ukraine.  That is a very serious crisis and I am sure he will be happy to update us on it in future.</p><p>Senator Crown spoke about the 2005 Act, and again I would like to stress that it is not the Legislature which oversees the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under that Act.  Senator Crown is quite right on the culture of a lack of protection and support for whistleblowers.  The Government is bringing forward the Protected Disclosures Bill 2013, which is currently on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  That will be the first time we have comprehensive protection for whistleblowers.  It is very important across all sectors.  Senator Healy Eames also spoke about whistleblowers and the 2005 Act.  In respect of Oliver Connolly and the call for a new confidential recipient, I think the Minister is now saying that he will amend the Act, which is very welcome, to enable serving garda&iacute; to go directly to GSOC, which they could not previously do.  I understand that the confidential recipient was introduced in the 2005 Act as an alternative.  It may be that there is no requirement to have a confidential recipient if we see that amendment come through quickly.  Clearly, there is a concern that at the moment there is no mechanism for internal complaints by garda&iacute;, so perhaps a temporary person will have to be appointed.  However, in the longer term it is envisaged that this will solved by an amendment of the Act.</p><p>Senator Heffernan spoke about rural post offices, and I think I have dealt with that.</p></speech>

The Bill is a relatively short legislative proposal, the purpose of which is to provide an explicit legal basis to enable the ESB to engage, now or in the future, in the installation or operation of electronic communications networks and services, either alone or by agreement with one or more other companies, and to provide for consequential matters.<br /> The Bill also makes the necessary statutory provision to change the name of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann to Ervia.  In my view this legislation affords an excellent opportunity to enhance significantly the quality and availability of modern resilient and future-proofed broadband infrastructure through the use of the ESB's extensive electricity networks.  This has the potential to extend the reach of fibre to the home broadband connectivity throughout Ireland.  I believe it is a further important step in this country positioning itself as a front runner in tackling the broadband infrastructure deficit.</p><p>  The ESB has identified an opportunity to use its electricity distribution network to provide telecommunications services in the Irish market.  I understand the company has sought a joint venture partner with a view to providing such services on a wholesale-only basis.  I am advised that this in turn could facilitate the delivery of high speed broadband services by retail telecommunications operators in the areas served.  The legislation is merely for the purposes of enabling the use of the ESB's infrastructure and is not specific to any given project.</p><p>  My Government colleagues and I consider this to be a very welcome development and one which is very much in the spirit of the national broadband plan. The plan, which I published in August 2012, commits to the delivery of high speed broadband throughout the country.  This commitment is to be achieved by ensuring the environment is right to maximise investment by the commercial sector, and through a State-led investment in those areas where it is evident the market will not deliver.  The plan also specifically commits to the use of State assets to accelerate the roll-out of high speed broadband infrastructure and services and recognises the role commercial State companies can perform in accelerating the roll-out of such infrastructure.</p><p>  I remind Senators that the national broadband plan followed on from the publication of the next generation broadband task force report in 2011.  The task force, which I chaired, comprised the CEOs of all the major telecommunications service providers in the Irish market plus representatives from some of the smaller players.  It considered in detail a number of policy challenges including target speeds, spectrum, investment barriers, demand stimulation measures and the role of State assets in assisting broadband infrastructure deployment.  The report of the task force and the subsequent public consultation undertaken by my Department laid the foundations for the national broadband plan.</p><p>  I have advised the House on progress in implementing the plan on a number of occasions and would like to take this opportunity to provide a further update.  Of particular note is the ongoing very significant level of commercial investment that is taking place in the fixed and mobile telecommunications market.  In some instances, commercial telecommunications providers are investing in services and coverage that significantly exceed the targets they committed to when the national broadband plan was published.  This is good news for consumers and business where high speed broadband services are being rolled out.  It is also a vote of confidence in the broader indigenous economy.</p><p>  Despite these welcome developments it remains the case that many towns, villages and communities, particularly in rural Ireland, will see very little of this investment.  Ireland's widely dispersed population and topography means that there are some areas where it is simply not viable for the commercial sector to provide services.  Intensive technical, financial and preparatory work to define the scope of the State-led investment committed to under the national broadband plan is continuing.  This investment will facilitate the widespread availability of reliable and guaranteed high speed broadband.  In parallel, a comprehensive mapping exercise of current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector is advancing. This exercise will identify where the market is expected to deliver high speed broadband services in the coming years and consequently the precise areas that will need to be targeted by the State-led investment.</p><p>  In order to progress the State-led investment, a full procurement process must be designed and EU state aid approval must be obtained.  The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.</p><p>  As I mentioned earlier, the national broadband plan promotes the use of State assets to accelerate the roll-out of high speed broadband infrastructure and services.  The national broadband plan recognises that a number of commercial and non-commercial State bodies are already leveraging their existing assets to actively provide infrastructure and services to the telecommunications market.  These assets continue to play an important role in improving broadband services and the plan commits to exploiting any further opportunities that arise, with a view to accelerating the roll-out of high speed broadband.  The ESB is already providing telecommunications services utilising the electricity transmission<b></b>infrastructure.  The purpose of the legislation is to allow the ESB to leverage its extensive and robust distribution<b></b>infrastructure to provide high speed broadband infrastructure in Ireland.</p><p>  I understand from the ESB that it is currently considering proposals to provide such services, on a wholesale, open access basis with a joint venture partner.  In August 2012, the company launched a call for expressions of interest in such a joint venture, attracting considerable interest from the telecommunications sector.  I await with interest detailed formal proposals from the ESB in relation to the proposed joint venture.  It should be noted that the legislation is not project specific and will allow the ESB's considerable distribution infrastructure to become available to the telecommunications market, even if the current joint venture proposals do not come to fruition.  The ESB's detailed proposals are awaited and my Department's assessment will, among other things, include an assessment of the proposal's compliance with detailed and binding EU and national regulatory requirements in the electronic communications market.</p><p>  The regulation of the liberalised electronic communications market is a matter for ComReg which is independent in its functions.  Should the ESB enter the telecommunications market, either in the manner outlined or by any other means, it will be subject to all applicable provisions of the Communications Regulation Acts 2002 to 2011, related secondary legislation and, where appropriate, binding regulatory decisions imposed by ComReg.</p><p>  I propose to outline the main provisions of the Bill.  For the convenience of the House a detailed explanatory memorandum has been published and this provides a synopsis of the provisions.  The Bill is relatively short consisting of nine sections.<br /><b></b>Section<b></b>1 is a standard provision providing definitions for certain terms and words used in the Bill.  Section 2,<b></b>if enacted, would provide an explicit legal basis for the ESB to engage in the provision of electronic communications networks and electronic communications services where the company identifies a commercial basis for doing so, either alone or with any other company.  The House will be aware that the ESB already operates a fibre network across its electricity transmission system.</p> <p>This network, which was developed by the ESB, originated to assist the ESB's management of its electricity network.</p><p> Over time additional capacity on that network has been sold to operators in the electronic communications market.  The current proposal differs from the ESB's existing fibre network in that it would be a stand-alone business with no direct connection to the management of the electricity network and it may be developed by way of a joint venture.  It is therefore considered prudent to provide an explicit legal basis to allow the ESB to engage in the electronic communications market in the manner now proposed as provided for in section 2.</p><p> Section 3<b></b>would permit the ESB to agree to provide access to its electricity infrastructure to another company, including a joint venture company, to enable the company to develop electronic communications infrastructure along its electricity network where it is commercially viable and to provide services of any nature to facilitate such development.</p><p> Section 4<b></b>redefines the meaning of electric line in the ESB Acts 1927 to 2004 and the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 to provide a single definition of electric line on the Statute Book.  The section also extends the definition of electric line to include electronic communications infrastructure which is suspended from the electricity network.  This provision also includes a retrospective element to maintain the status of the existing electronic communications network following this amendment.  The ESB's electricity network crosses private land in some places.  In recognition of this, the existing Electricity (Supply) Acts 1927 to 2004 provides statutory wayleave rights to the ESB which allows it to cross private lands subject to the payment of compensation where appropriate.</p><p> Section 5<b></b>would extend this right to any company authorised by the ESB to install electronic communications infrastructure along its electricity network, subject to the requirement to pay compensation where appropriate.  This section qualifies this right by requiring the consent of the Commission for Energy Regulation in order to exercise the wayleave right.  As I have said, section 5 would extend the wayleave rights currently available to the ESB to construct the electricity network on private lands to the construction of electronic communications lines attached to its electricity network.  These wayleave rights include a right to secure fixtures to any wall, house or building.  This right is not available to other providers of electronic communications infrastructure.  It is not appropriate therefore to make that power available to the ESB or any subsidiary or joint venture in relation to its commercial activity in the electronic communications market.  Accordingly,section 6<b></b>provides that the authority to secure fixtures to walls, houses or buildings will not apply in respect of the construction of an electronic communications network.</p><p> Section 7 is a standard provision enabling the expenses of my Department to be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</p><p> Section 8<b></b>concerns the change of name of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann to Ervia, a change which requires a statutory footing.  The Gas Regulation Act 2013, which was enacted late last year, provided for the sale of the energy business of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann.  As part of the sale process the ownership of the Bord G&aacute;is brand will transfer to the new owner.  Once the bidders have acquired the Bord G&aacute;is energy business and its brand, Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann may no longer use the words &quot;Bord G&aacute;is&quot; in the name or brand of either its group or network business.</p><p> BGE has given careful consideration to appropriate alternative names, having regard to the changing nature of its business, given both the sale of the energy business and the establishment of Irish Water as a subsidiary of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann.  The name change from Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann to Ervia will take account of the expanding functions of BGE.  The word &quot;Ervia&quot; is based on the Irish word &quot;&Eacute;ire&quot; and the Latin word &quot;via&quot; and is intended to capture BGE's new role as the parent company of Irish Water together with Gas Networks Ireland, the subsidiary of BGE which will have responsibility for the gas networks infrastructure and interconnectors, which are to remain in State ownership.  It is important to note that Ervia will simply be a corporate name, and the main interactions with customers and the public will be through Irish Water and Gas Networks Ireland.  There is therefore no strategy to advertise or market the Ervia name and the costs of re-branding will be kept to a minimum.  Section 9<b>, </b>the concluding section of the Bill, is also a standard provision providing for the Short Title, collective citation, construction and commencement provision.</p><p> As I have stated, the current Government policy is to deliver high speed broadband access throughout the country by creating an environment conducive to commercial investment and by using State assets and commercial State companies where appropriate.  There is already significant progress in the provision of fixed broadband and mobile data services which is attributed to significant network investments, particularly by Eircom, UPC, Sky, Vodafone, O<sub>2</sub>, 3 and Meteor, among others.  This investment is delivering both higher broadband speeds and increasing numbers of users opting into bundled communications services to secure better value.</p><p> As of September 2013, there were more than 1.67 million broadband subscribers in Ireland, an increase of 1% on 2012.  In the fixed line market, approximately 42% of all broadband subscriptions were equal to or greater than 10 Mb per second, up from 31% the previous year.  In the same period 33% of all broadband subscriptions were equal to or greater than 30 Mb per second, up from 20% in September 2012.</p><p> In the mobile market the most significant headline in recent times was the &euro;855 million commitment made by four mobile services providers to secure radio spectrum capable of delivering next generation 4G services capable of providing significantly increased data services.  In the year to September 2013, data volumes across mobile devices increased by 40% as the number of SMS or text messages sent by mobile users fell by 25% in the same period during 2012 to 2013.  The increase in data traffic is reflected in a 17% increase to 2.7 million in the number of smartphones and tablets in use in the year to September 2013.</p><p> It is worth noting that the digital part of Ireland's economy is growing at a rate of 16% per year.  The opportunities this presents must be harnessed to maximise the accruing economic and social benefits.  Reliable connectivity to the Internet is critical for business growth and development, and is an essential requirement for more flexible work patterns.  From a societal perspective, it is an important facilitator of many activities, including education, entertainment, business, e-health, e-Government and, increasingly, a simple and effective way of communication through social media.</p><p> The exponential growth of digital technologies across the globe is further driving demand for high speed broadband.  Consequently, high speed, quality and reliable broadband as an enabling infrastructure for economic and social development is becoming a critical component of a 21st century society.  I believe this Bill is a positive step in facilitating the accelerated roll-out of high speed broadband infrastructure in this country.  It is my view that the ESB's proposal will have positive impacts on the Irish market.</p><p> We have already seen the benefits that competition can bring in delivering commercial investment in electronic communications infrastructure and providing customer access to higher broadband speeds.  In the mobile market, last year's successful auction of spectrum, following the switch-off of analogue television, shows that the commercial operators clearly believe there is a vibrant market here.  The national broadband plan is a clear expression of the importance of broadband infrastructure to the achievement of Ireland's economic and social objectives.  High speed quality and reliable broadband as an enabling infrastructure for economic and social development is becoming a critical component of 21st century society.  I believe the potential to use the ESB's considerable network to deploy fibre will contribute significantly to the commercial deployment of high speed broadband and will be important in terms of meeting the objectives of the national broadband plan.  I look forward to hearing the views of the House on the Bill, a constructive Committee Stage debate and the assistance of the House in facilitating the early passage of the Bill into law.</p></speech>

We will support the passage of the Bill as it will increase competition in the broadband and electronic communications market and will reduce costs to the consumer.</p><p>Our concern relates to the investment required to provide broadband in rural Ireland.  I am sure the Minister is great at studying &quot;The House of Cards&quot; on Netflix, but that might be outdone by activities in the House this week.  Surveys conducted by Netflix, show the broadband speeds in Ireland are among the worst in Europe.  The issue of high speed broadband will be resolved only by investment in infrastructure, especially in rural areas.  My colleagues and I deal with communities who cannot even access a proper mobile phone service in places such as Caherdaniel, Castlecove and others in County Kerry.</p> <p>They are fighting to have a better mobile telephone service.  Today we are talking about broadband and high speed broadband.  My concern is that it will be mainly concentrated in Dublin in terms of investment and to give a maximum return for the new structure.  There will be some element of having to provide broadband in rural areas - the 15% that generally lose out in that regard are those people who live on the peripheries.  That would further isolate and make sure that those populations continue their history of population decline.</p><p>I seek clarity about the use of the term &quot;compensation where appropriate&quot; in the explanatory memorandum.  The Minister is aware of the Supreme Court rulings on the rights of private property owners.  Perhaps he will clarify what is meant by the words &quot;where appropriate&quot;.  I know that the use of State facilities, such as Garda stations and other facilities, including ESB and Telecom &Eacute;ireann yards, and even hospitals, are utilised by agreement.  The term &quot;compensation where appropriate&quot; is worrying.  What does it mean?  Does it apply to private landowners such as farmers, forestry owners or private individuals?  What about monopolies and the commitment given to supply 30 Mb to all rural homes by 2016?  We all are aware of previous governments making commitments and asking for targets and guidelines.  Having targets and guidelines is all well and good.  However, there must be financial consequences if those to whom we give the rights do not install a proper infrastructure in rural Ireland.  If there are no financial consequences for them then they will not meet the guidelines and targets.  They will not benefit commercially because installing the infrastructure will cost them more than what they will earn from the revenue generated.</p><p>I am concerned about this new structure.  It gives companies serious powers and some regard the provision of fibre broadband for resale to be a monopoly.  I wonder how the issues of compensation where appropriate and providing a broadband service in rural Ireland will be addressed.  The mobile telephone service is not up to scratch so  I am concerned about the proposed broadband service.  We welcome the legislation but we have a few concerns.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-02-20a.121" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1134" speakername="Tony Mulcahy" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014022000012#L00200"><p>I echo the sentiments expressed by Senator Daly on mobile telephone coverage.  One does not have to go to south-west Kerry to encounter the problem.  The worst area for coverage is between Roscrea and Nenagh.  Anybody who travels the route regularly will have discovered that there is no coverage in the region.  Mobile tekephone coverage is another issue that we need to do something about.</p><p>  Outstanding work was done by ESB crews since the first storm hit the country at Christmas.  We know that there was a threat to power supplies before Christmas but mother nature did not have a hand in it because, thankfully, the danger was averted.  Since Christmas various storms have wreaked havoc on power supplies all over the country.  ESB crews have been out 24 hours a day in all weathers trying to restore power where it was lost and for that service the House is most grateful.  Thank God no pylons were blown over so we might be able to deal with the issue of pylons.  The crisis might set off some other story and we may need to strengthen the current network of pylons.</p><p>  I welcome the Bill because it will give a legal basis and will enable the ESB to engage in the electronic communications networks and electronic communications services.  The Minister has described the various sections.  As has been highlighted, the Bill may be cited under the Electricity (Supply) Acts 1927 to 2004 as part of the ESB Acts 1927 to 2013.</p><p>  A feature of modern life and business in Ireland in the 21st century is the need to enable us to communicate quickly and cheaply with each other and with those we do business with daily.  The days of having to organise the operator to arrange a telephone call in advance in order to speak to someone either in the USA or further afield are a distant memory.  Nowadays we can use a mobile telephone to contact anybody located anywhere in the world that has a network connection.</p><p>  We may be writing a lot fewer letters now but we are communicating a lot more than we did ten years ago.  We have various applications on our mobile devices these days such as Viber, WhatsApp, Messenger, Facebook and Twitter.  We can even Skype relatives and friends at home and abroad.  However, there are communications issues that we need to address.  One of the biggest issues for consumers outside of large urban areas is a fast reliable broadband service.  Some people who live in large urban areas take for granted the broadband services that they currently enjoy.  Broadband speeds have improved but they need to improve further if the country is to attract major foreign direct investment.  Also, our own domestic job creators need to have faster speeds if they are to compete on an equal footing with overseas competitors.</p><p>  In rural areas people can only dream of fast broadband and in many areas the inhabitants can only dream of getting broadband.  While Senators catch up on the latest instalment of the &quot;House of Cards&quot; on Netflix, please spare a thought for people who live in rural areas who may, if they are fortunate to have an Internet connection, get broadband speeds of 2 Mbps but only at certain times of the day.  Due to the way the population is spread it does not make commercial sense for various communications providers to roll out a network that would connect to every property in the country.  It would be far more efficient if they could hobby horse on the back of a wholesale partner that currently has such a network.  The ESB can be and is that partner.  The company has built up a large network of lines and infrastructure all over the country.  It also has the expertise and the proven track record that has been internationally recognised.</p><p>  Over 30 years ago the then semi-State company, Telecom &Eacute;ireann, had a very good international reputation for its communications network.  Years of neglect since privatisation and asset stripping has led to a build up of debt by various owners.  It is only in recent years that Eircom has started to reverse the situation and has invested heavily in broadband.  Such a development is welcome as investment by telecom companies will strengthen our economy.</p><p>  Every week millions of euro are spent online on overseas e-commerce sites.  That money could be spent here if Irish entrepreneurs had access to a super-fast broadband service.  They could build profitable e-commerce sites that could operate whether they were located on top of a mountain or in the middle of a city.  Jobs can be created in businesses that do not yet exist but we must first create the right conditions for this to happen.  By opening up the ESB network to suitable partners from the commercial sector we can create suitable conditions.  The more players in the market the better for the end consumer.  Such an initiative would also contribute to the Government's national broadband plan, which promotes the use of State assets for the provision of high speed broadband in areas not currently served.</p><p>  The recent announcement that the four mobile service providers will commit &euro;855 million to secure radio spectrum capable of delivering 4G is a very welcome development.  There were 2.7 million smartphones and tablets in use up to September 2013.  They need a secure and robust network to enable access to content on the Internet or data storage by the provider.  By enabling the ESB to sell space on its network we can speed up access and penetration.</p><p>  I welcome the provisions in the Bill for wayleaves<b></b>on private land to be provided to such bodies as the ESB as it enters into commercial arrangements.  Compensation will be provided to landowners where deemed appropriate.  All works will come under the remit of the CER, thus ensuring that it will be regulated.</p><p>  In summing up, this major issue has been talked about for a number of years and we have an existing infrastructure.  The big difference between this Government and all of the governments that went before it is that we are using the infrastructure now and have made a decision to make progress.  The difference is that decisions have been made and actions have been taken.</p><p>  With regard to the ESB, I believe that there is no house in the country that does not have electric light.  I should ask Senator Mark Daly but I think the last place to be connected was the Black Valley in County Kerry.  The ESB has a network so it makes perfect sense for us to use it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-02-20a.122" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014022000012#L00300"><p>I welcome the Minister.  I noted the reference to the Black Valley.  It was former Deputy Peter Barry who was the Minister responsible for connecting the Black Valley with the system.  It was one of the last locations to be connected, as Senator Mulcahy pointed out.</p><p>I welcome the Minister here and I also welcome the Bill.  The more competition in telecommunications the better.  The networks do exist and I have seen the range of equipment used at ESB stations throughout the country.  There is also some scope for CIE to contribute.  The railways had a communications network between the stations and so on.  It is available and can form part of the technological developments.  Senators on this side of the House support the Bill as it will bring Ireland forward in this age of technology, as the Minister has said.</p><p>I wish to mention another aspect.  The Minister and the Commission for Electricity Regulation must keep pressure on the ESB, previously a monopolistic company, in order to keep electricity prices down as much as possible.</p> <p>International comparisons highlight that prices are high in Ireland.  Professor Colm McCarthy estimated recently that prices are 41% higher than the EU average.  The Minister has been known to attend the Kenmare economics conference from time to time and complaints have been made there that the regulator is easy on the ESB given it is a high cost operation with executives being paid multiples of what the Taoiseach earns.  That pressure on behalf of the consumer and overall national competitiveness to keep energy costs down has to be maintained and I will support the Minister in all his efforts to do so.  We cannot afford to let that slide in any way.</p><p>This is a worthwhile measure to increase competitiveness in a growing sector of the economy, electronic communications.  The more people in it, the merrier.  I will support the legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-02-20a.124" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1143" speakername="John Whelan" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014022000013#M00200"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  Any move to enhance and add value to the State's infrastructure is positive, including the extensive infrastructure overseen by ESB Networks.  I echo Senator Mulcahy's commendation of the Trojan work in ferocious, difficult conditions over the past number of weeks of ESB crews who braved the elements and put their own health in risk to restore power to homes, businesses and farms.  I also commend them on the industrious and committed way they set about their work.</p><p>I welcome the Bill and the capacity it will provide to address the chronic rural broadband deficit.  The Minister and his Department, in concert with others in government, have made great strides in improving investment in this area, which was neglected for years largely following the ill-judged privatisation of Eircom at a time when the then Government should have protected the infrastructure for the benefit of the State rather than selling it off.  This is an example of infrastructure that the State does a better job of managing by taking a long-term strategic view rather than short-term profit taking.  There has been considerable progress in the roll-out of high speed broadband in post-primary schools.  The Minister and the Minister for Education and Skills deserve great credit for pursuing this project.  I have witnessed first-hand how much this has enhanced and improved the infrastructure within our education system to the benefit of future generations as they emerge to pursue their careers.</p><p>Unfortunately, in keeping with comments by previous speakers, Timahoe, where I come from, is a Netflix no-go area just like Ballyroan and other towns and villages in the area.  Like others in rural Ireland, I will have to wait for the box sets because, despite changing service providers and despite investment in the infrastructure locally, the broadband speed is not fast enough to support the watching of movies or television programmes.  This is an inhibiting factor in respect of job creation in the regions, for example, in the agriculture sector, and it is also an issue for businesses and domestic users.  The enhancement of rural broadband infrastructure could be enabled by this creative initiative through which the ESB will form strategic alliances with other companies and this will improve quality of life and stimulate job creation and spin-offs for small businesses, which are inhibited by the lack of high speed broadband.</p><p>I tracked the progress of the legislation through the D&aacute;il recently.  It would be remiss of me not to take the opportunity in an overall context to refer to ESB Networks and the expansion of the national grid and the comments of my party colleague, Deputy Anne Ferris, in the Lower House.  The Minister will be only too well aware of ongoing public concern about the EirGrid's plans to double the size of the national grid.  I do not need to go through the data but energy consumption during peak periods in the State averages 5,000 MW.  Currently, proposals to generate 3,500 MW of energy through wind turbines is going through the planning process, which would provide a high proportion of our energy needs.  However, it is more alarming for me and others throughout the country who have come to me with their concerns that there are plans in the pipeline to generate an additional 28,000 MW via wind energy for domestic use or export.  Would it be wise for us to step back a little from that - I know the Minister will address a key wind energy conference later today - to conduct a mapping exercise in this regard?  Senator Landy has referred to the mapping exercise in recent weeks because this would provide us with an audit of existing wind energy provision, including wind farms and turbines, the projects going the planning process and those that are proposed and what would be required to connect them to the national grid or undergrounded through DC cable to the European grid.  We would then have an overview of the grid capacity required to facilitate this extensive provision, which I believe is excessive and will not, ultimately, be economically, environmentally or socially sustainable.</p><p>There is considerable and growing unease among the public with questions raised with us as public representatives on an ongoing basis about who is driving this policy and to what end.  I am trying to be fair to everyone and I ask the Minister to look into this.  Throughout his political career, he has always upheld the highest standards of probity and integrity but there are questions, to which we cannot turn a blind eye, regarding vested interests and conflicts of interest among those involved in policy formation and those who will ultimately benefit if the policy is implemented.  We have a duty to explore this.  Brochures were circulated throughout the midlands by a large wind farm company during the Christmas period, which named people who are working for it as public affairs consultants and who are members of its board.  I will not name them because it is not appropriate.  They are lobbying in the interests of wind farm companies and developers while playing an insider role in policy formation and design.</p> <p>The roll-out of the grid in a bid to double its capacity by EirGrid, on behalf of the taxpayer, with a cost of &euro;3.2 billion will add value to our infrastructure which is important.  It is also important, however, that we do not build a house of cards that could be blown over if it is not economically sustainable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-02-20a.126" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1145" speakername="Feargal Quinn" time="12:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014022000014#N00200"><p>I am glad the Government with this legislation is recognising that we have to invest for the future.  For several years, I was chairman of EuroCommerce, an organisation which spans the retail, wholesale and international trade sectors in the 28 European Union member states.  I recall when visiting Estonia, I was impressed how they were so far advanced in e-commerce because of their excellent communications infrastructure.  We need essential infrastructure such as next generation broadband.  In Ireland, by estimate we only have 0.5% of fibreoptic connections compared with 61% in Japan and 57% in South Korea.  This legislation is about giving the ESB a legal basis to engage in broadband provision.</p><p>  Should we be giving the customer some legal right in this area?  For instance, in 2010 it became a legal right for every Finn to have a 1 Mbps broadband Internet connection.  If we included a similar provision in this legislation, it would give the Government a huge incentive to stay true to its commitment to provide next generation broadband.  It would be interesting to hear the Minister&rsquo;s views on this proposal.  Businesses can really benefit from a broadband connection but I am concerned this legislation will not benefit everyone equally.  As could be expected, it will be urban areas that will benefit first from fibreoptic broadband.  Indeed, a recent report in the <i>Irish Independent</i> points out the deficiencies in the plan.  Any ESB related fibre broadband will most likely simply be in areas that already have - or are scheduled for - high-speed broadband deployment already.  The ESB has indicated that it will only look at towns of at least 4,000 buildings for new broadband services.  Geographically, this metric rules out most of Munster and Connacht.  The reality is that ESB-based fibre broadband is almost certainly not coming to rural locations.</p><p>  I am particularly concerned for those running businesses in rural areas.  Realistically, rural communities and businesses will be the last to benefit from such broadband. Will the Minister provide any guarantees that rural communities and businesses will not miss out?  When I was chairman of An Post, I got to know nearly every post office in the country.  I now see how they are threatened by such developments.  Would it be possible to guarantee there will be such broadband for rural areas?  Will the Minister be open to placing some such guarantee in the Bill?  Should we first, as a priority, be targeting business and homes which have poor Internet access?</p><p>  It has just been announced in the North that &pound;24.5 million will be put into improving broadband access for 45,000 premises struggling to get online.  BT has even pledged to complete the improvements by December 2015 to ensure consumers and businesses can benefit from them as quickly as possible.  That is very quick.  Will we include provisions in this Bill to target and help those businesses in particular who are suffering because of poor connection?  If BT can provide access to 45,000 homes in such a short timeframe, should we be looking to get such a company to bid on providing similar access here?  Do we need the ESB at all?  Why not just open up the process and pick the best company at the lowest price?  Why is the ESB&rsquo;s expertise needed to set up fibreoptic broadband connections?  That is a serious question.  We saw where the expertise of those at Irish Water got us.  It hired some outside consultants and paid them millions of euro.  Why not simply cut out the middleman in the first place?  We need to question moves such as this given the Irish Water situation.</p><p>  How long will it take for this Bill to pass through the Oireachtas?  Over 90% of homes in the North are connected to superfast fibre cabinet.  Why are they so much faster across the Border?  Is it because we have had so little investment over the years?  Will we have a situation where businesses just across the Border will move further ahead in advantages compared with us in the South?  I support the Minister&rsquo;s moves in dealing with these challenges.  I hope, however, it will be a quick process.  One of my criticisms of what happens here is how long it takes to get things done.  I believe we could move faster on this.</p></speech>

B&iacute;onn s&eacute; anseo go minic agus t&aacute; &aacute;thas orm &eacute; a fheice&aacute;il ar&iacute;s.  I commend all ESB, local authority and Eircom workers, as well as garda&iacute;, on the work they did to restore services during the recent storms in very dangerous conditions.  Unfortunately, one Eircom subcontractor paid the ultimate price with his life while trying to restore telephone services.</p><p>I, along with other colleagues, have highlighted the deficiencies in broadband provision in rural parts.  This Bill will enhance our broadband infrastructure, utilising the ESB&rsquo;s networks which traverse our country.  The extensive ESB network will provide an opportunity to extend the reach of fibre in Ireland with the potential to enhance the provision of high speed broadband and increase competition in the telecommunications market.  The Bill provides an explicit legal basis to enable the ESB to engage in the business of electronic communications and services either by itself or in conjunction with other companies.  It is a further step in Ireland positioning itself as a front runner in tackling the broadband infrastructure deficit.</p><p>Many small and medium-sized enterprises operate on the Cooley Peninsula in north Louth, employing up to 2,000 people from precision engineering to the hospitality sector.  The area, however, has inefficient mobile telephony and broadband networks.  I hope the Bill will enhance broadband provision there.  This is a ground-breaking initiative, one which is in the spirit of the Government&rsquo;s national broadband plan.</p> <p>That plan specifically promotes the use of State assets to accelerate the roll-out of high speed broadband infrastructure and services.  The Government is firmly committed to delivering high speed broadband throughout the country through a combination of commercial and State-led investment.  The potential to use the ESB&rsquo;s considerable network to deploy fibre will contribute to the commercial deployment of broadband.  As I said, ESB networks traverse every townland throughout the country and it is great to see the co-operation by the ESB in regard to this initiative.</p><p>The national broadband plan is a clear expression of the importance of broadband infrastructure to the achievement of Ireland&rsquo;s economic and social objectives.  High speed, quality and reliable broadband, as an enabling infrastructure for economic and social development, is becoming a critical component of a 21st century society.  I welcome the Minister's assurances that he will pursue the national broadband plan, which is essential.  This Bill is a major and very important step in the provision of high standard, quality broadband, and is most welcome.</p></speech>

Is c&oacute;ir aitheantas a thabhairt d&oacute; sin agus t&aacute; s&eacute; sin &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh againn inniu.</p><p>As has been stated by previous contributors, the value of the ESB teams was seen in recent weeks.  It was ironic that, before Christmas, when there was a danger of a strike being called by ESB workers who were standing up for their rights in regard to pension schemes, people were very critical of them.  However, we did not hear much criticism of them since Christmas.  Fair play to them for the great work they have done in recent weeks, as they always do.</p><p>Ba mhaith liom ceist bheag b&iacute;deach amh&aacute;in a chur sula dtos&oacute;idh m&eacute; isteach sa phr&iacute;omhrud.  Bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag &eacute;isteacht le Se&aacute;n &Oacute; hArg&aacute;in ag labhairt ag comhdh&aacute;il an Lucht Oibre ag an deireadh seachtaine.  D&uacute;irt s&eacute; gurb &eacute; P&aacute;irt&iacute; an Lucht Oibre an p&aacute;irt&iacute; is l&aacute;idre &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn.

Is trua &eacute; nuair a bh&iacute; deis ag an Rialtas ainm bre&aacute; Gaelach a chur ar an gcomhlacht ar&iacute;s.</p><p>I welcome the Bill.  It is important legislation that deals with the networking of fibreoptic cables that will, hopefully, develop an area of infrastructure where Ireland has been severely lagging behind.  There are many areas in Ireland, most of them rural, which still do not receive an adequate broadband connection.  The lack of broadband or poor service levels is becoming a constraint in accessing services.  I know, particularly from my own experience in Connemara, that a number of years ago &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta was in a position to put investment into exchanges to increase the broadband capacity that Eircom was able to carry, but, due to some competition laws, it had to stop doing that.  Since then, we have been lagging behind in the provision of broadband in certain areas.</p><p>There is a nest of companies in the Indreabh&aacute;n area in Connemara, where there are particular issues around broadband, and many of them are finding it difficult to survive because of the capacity that is available to them.  Therefore, I share many of the concerns and I agree that many of the questions raised by Senator Quinn are very valid, in particular whether this new model will be able to deliver that last mile of broadband.  At present, the capacity running down the line from an Eircom exchange to a house in a rural area is not able to carry broadband for the last mile, which, ironically, is the situation in my own house, where Eircom cannot provide me with a service.</p><p>It is important to note that we have seen huge strides forward being made in the North, which seems to be way ahead in the provision of broadband.  The Minister might comment on that.  It is possibly because there is a different style of delivery and more investment.  While the Minister is carrying forward from a legacy of lack of investment in the infrastructure, the North seems to be much further ahead in terms of quality of broadband.</p><p>On the ground service delivery in many rural areas is contracting and many services are being further curtailed in the current economic environment, for example, through the closure of banks, post offices and rural Garda stations. There is now near universal acceptance that online access is the norm for some services and quality broadband is an imperative.  Proper broadband access is essential for developing a healthy and vibrant economy.  The Government must be to the forefront of pushing this agenda if it is serious about Ireland's economy recovering to its full potential.  International research shows that the Internet contributes up to 6% of the GDP in advanced economies and most of the economic value created occurs outside of the information technology sector, with 75% of the benefits captured by companies in more traditional industries.  The research also found that the Internet created 2.6 jobs for every one lost arising from technology related efficiencies.</p><p>I am glad to learn that the ESB is potentially going to deliver a so-called fibre to the building network.  I have one question in this regard.  We have been contacted by a number of landowners who are concerned there may be a piggy-backing effect by other companies on the network in question, for example, other media providers, and that there would be no compensation for the people who own the land.  The Minister might refer to this in his reply.  If there are very profitable, high worth companies that are making a lot of money in providing services in the telecommunications area, and which piggy-back on the ESB network under this new arrangement, will landowners receive some form of recompense for the fact the cables are going through their land?</p><p>This so-called fibre to the building network would, hopefully, provide for the highest speeds to be brought to a home, which shows there is forward thinking in the development of the fibre network.  Fibre is one of the optimum technologies as it is regarded as the most future-proofed and is, therefore, likely to yield better value for State investment.  At a wider economy level, the OECD has examined the benefits arising to other economic sectors of a national fibre to the building network.  The analysis examines the cost of deploying fibre to the building across different OECD countries, including Ireland, and has estimated that the combined saving in each of the four sectors over a ten year period could justify the cost of building a national fibre to the building network.</p><p>Investment which is designed to deliver next generation broadband should be based on technologies which are future-proofed over the longer term and not just aimed at meeting immediate targets for 2015 and 2020.  While the immediate target is to ensure what is outlined in the national broadband plan is reached, the infrastructure that should be put in place should be designed to have benefits far beyond this.  Proper investment will not just deliver targets in the short term, it will also benefit the State in the medium and long term.</p><p>Ireland performs badly in regard to broadband connection when compared internationally.  We currently have one of the lowest access levels in the European Union to broadband, which hardly makes us the best small country in which to do business.  This cannot be solely blamed on our size or our population density.  Ireland has a relatively low proportion of people living in urban areas compared with the OECD average.  The western region has suffered significantly in terms of broadband access, which has put us at a distinct disadvantage compared with more populated areas of the country.  The western region is a predominately rural region, with 64.9% of its population living outside of towns with a population of 1,500 or more, compared with 38% nationally.  In the western region, 16.4% of the urban population lives in small towns, while nationally only 6% of the urban population lives in such towns.  It is clear, therefore, that any strategy rolled out must recognise the distinct population structures in the west, and the Government must adopt a policy that recognises this fact.</p></speech>

I join other speakers in complimenting the ESB workers on the effort they have put in.  We sat here on Private Members' legislation one Wednesday night to prevent utility workers from having the right to withdraw their labour.  On that occasion, I spoke of the efforts that the ESB workers, among other workers, put in during the 2010 snow storms.  Little did I think we would be giving the same praise to them for working in the difficult conditions caused by the last three weeks of storms.  I commend every one of them on their work, as well as all of the other front-line services, who were out day and night to make sure the country was able to get over the difficult storms.</p> <p> I welcome the legislation that is before us today.  It is important to tackle the difficult problem of broadband supply to rural areas.  I echo colleagues' concerns regarding the mobile network service.  In the very early days of this Seanad I raised the problem of poor mobile coverage on motorways, which encourages people to break the law by pulling in on the hard shoulder.  This problem could be tackled very easily but, three years after I raised it, it is as bad as ever on the Waterford-Dublin motorway, where there are least three or four blackspots.</p><p>Senator Daly referred to the wayleave issue.  When this issue was discussed in the Lower House, the Minister responded that there would be very little intrusion onto private lands.  My concern is that new contracts will mean new personnel going onto people's land.  Most rural people know and trust their local ESB staff, but might have reasonable concerns about unknown workers coming onto their land.  I am also concerned about the compensation issue, as raised by Senator Daly.  There must be clarity regarding the word &quot;appropriate&quot; in the legislation.  In addition, will the Minister indicate how the policing of access and intrusion will be effected?</p><p>The problems regarding broadband coverage in rural areas have been well outlined to the Minister both here and in the Lower House.  He told the D&aacute;il that a mapping exercise is under way with a view to obtaining approval at European level.  Will the Minister indicate what progress has been made in this regard?  Reference was made to the detailed formal proposals the ESB will bring forward with regard to the roll-out of broadband on the existing network.  Are we any closer to seeing those proposals?  What type of detail can we expect and how far will the improved service extend into rural areas?</p><p>In regard to the role of the existing network, is this proposal dependent on the new Grid 25 proposals?  Given that EirGrid is a sister company of ESB and the proposals by EirGrid are projected to cost &euro;3.2 billion, is ESB's hand likely to be weakened in terms of its roll-out of the broadband scheme?  I realise that it intends to bring in a strategic partner - according to the media, it will be Vodafone, which will bring in an investment of &euro;400 million - but there will still be a major shortfall in terms of rolling this out.  Will ESB be exposed by pursuing the concept of EirGrid 25 at a cost of &euro;3.2 billion?</p><p>As already mentioned, the wind energy idea sector in this country has the potential to generate between 23,000 and 28,000 MW.  Do we need this for our own use or is it intended for export?  If the latter, where is the market?  We are given to understand, for example, that the United Kingdom will be able to meet its own requirements through wind from Scotland and through nuclear energy, with several nuclear plants being brought forward in the coming years.</p><p>Although I welcome the legislation, it does raise a number of questions which need to be answered.  One of these questions relates to the situation of the former CEO of EirGrid, who is now sitting on the board of Element Power.  In other words, the person who headed up the concept of the build-out of EirGrid 25 is now sitting on the board of a wind energy company.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-02-20a.136" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" time="12:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014022000016#P00200"><p>I thank Members for their contributions to the debate.  The Bill was warmly welcomed in the Lower House, where colleagues were confident, as am I, that it will make an important contribution in terms of improving connectivity, especially in provincial Ireland.</p><p>We could have a debate all day long on the question of the international figures, how good or how bad our system is, what happened in Northern Ireland when BT came in, and so on.  However, to use the great clich&eacute; of the day, we are where we are.  We can have an interesting academic debate on why certain things happened, including why Telecom &Eacute;ireann was privatised in the fashion it was, why its subsequent owners engaged in asset stripping and why the necessary investment in broadband infrastructure was not made.  We can also discuss the circumstances in which BT intruded into Northern Ireland, secured state aid approval and did a splendid job there.  The decisions made here were different.  We certainly can debate those decisions but, ultimately, what is done is done.  The task I have now is to ensure there is quality connectivity available as widely as possible in this country.</p><p>It is not true that where there is a similarly sparse population in rural parts of other countries, including the United States, that they all have a quality service.  Indeed, some parts of the United States have no service at all.  The previous Government implemented a commitment under the national broadband service contract whereby a guarantee was given of the provision of between 2 and 3 Mb.  Of course, as a result of contention, the actual service can be inferior to that.  Nevertheless, the then Government did put in place arrangements for the monitoring of the implementation and delivery of that contract and those channels are there to the present day.  The reality is that there would not even be a basic service in many rural areas if that had not been done.</p><p>Senator Mulcahy and others referred to service blackspots.  A number of providers are currently seeking to roll out 4G and enhanced 3G services.  A consequence of that and other work that is under way is that there will, for certain periods, be a deterioration of service in some of these areas.  This should be a very short-term problem and the enhancement programme will ultimately see significant improvements in the service.  The investment of &euro;855 million by four different providers is a vote of confidence in the future of the country's economy.  It was a considerable quantum when we had the spectrum auction following the closure of analogue television.</p> <p> In respect of the questions about way-leave, compensation, etc., the position is that we propose to use the existing distribution network.  As a result, the level of intrusion onto people's land will be minimal.  Where and if such intrusions occur, they will involve ESB employees or those of companies contracted by it.  I do not believe there is great cause for concern in this regard because, as already stated, the existing supply system is going to be used.  In the context of compensation, the term "where appropriate" means that if there are particular circumstances where land must be acquired or leased, the matter will be dealt with as appropriate.  We are talking here about taxpayers' money.  I recently received a deputation the members of which wanted to advance some arguments about a particular matter.  One of the individuals involved was very aggrieved because he thought a particular transmission line was going in the direction of his land.  The man in question has suffered a significant loss of income as a result of the line being changed.  There is nothing new in all of this.  We had the same experience with the roads programme and any difficulties which arose were resolved.  We also had a similar experience in the context of the erection of mobile phone masts.  Members of both Houses lodged complaints about those masts but the quality of mobile phone services would be much worse had they not been erected.  The outcry which occurred at the time was similar to that in respect of the issue under discussion.  However, I do not believe anyone would now seriously suggest that there were any scientific or other bases for the outcry, which some of us recall.</p><p>We live in a market economy and the rules relating to that economy apply.  Under state aid and European Union rules, it would not now be possible to do what Senator Quinn has asked me to do.  However, he is correct with regard to the decision taken in Northern Ireland.  What we are doing is seeking to acknowledge that the commercial sector is delivering high-quality connectivity in Northern Ireland which is comparable with anything available in Europe and which that sector will not deliver to communities in rural areas of this jurisdiction.  As a result, State intervention is going to be necessary.  In order for the State to intervene, we will be obliged to engage in the very detailed process that is necessary to satisfy - or cut the mustard with - those in Brussels.  That is why we are approaching the end of a very detailed process relating to mapping every area of the country.  When this is complete, we will make a submission for approval to Brussels.  The purpose of all of this is to ensure that remoter areas will have enjoy quality connectivity in the future.  The Bill fits neatly into this process in the sense that, in the context of the overall broadband plan, it is one more piece of the jigsaw.  When that jigsaw is complete, the ESB will be able to use its existing distribution system, in co-operation with one or more partner companies, to roll out fibre-optic cable to parts of Ireland where residents would never have imagined that they might have access to future-proofed fibre capacity.  In most countries, the latter does not happen.  In that context, the Bill is a very important measure and I welcome the support for it.  Senator Quinn need not be concerned about the length of time it will take to enact the legislation.  The Bill was not a matter of contention in the Lower House .  If it proves to be contentious in this House, I do not believe that will be the result of anything it contains.  We should be able to enact it quite quickly.</p><p>The ESB has already concluded its expressions of interest process and must be very close to announcing a preferred bidder.  When that is done, the joint venture will be created as quickly as may be and the process of providing this Rolls Royce service to rural areas will commence.  In the meantime, we will be submitting our plan in respect of state aid to Brussels for approval.  As Senators will be aware, competition is hotting up all the time in urban areas.  In general, the quality of service provided in such areas is already very high.</p><p>Senator Barrett referred to energy prices.  I hope we will have an opportunity to discuss that matter at another time.  I am sure the Senator will welcome the news that the remuneration package of the new chief executive of the ESB is half that of his predecessor.  I am not referring to Senator Barrett when I say this but we should not, as Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh observed, use information that is out of date in order to denigrate people who work for a company such as the ESB, particularly at a time when the position with regard to remuneration has changed dramatically.  During the past six weeks we were all very grateful for the extraordinary efforts those people made in very dangerous circumstances to try to ensure that citizens had access to energy supplies.  In that context, Senator Brennan highlighted the tragic death of Mr. Michael O'Riordan who worked for Eircom.  Like their counterparts in the ESB, Eircom employees were out working in all kinds of conditions in recent weeks.  Mr. O'Riordan's death is a terrible tragedy for his family.  I take this opportunity to again extend my sympathy and that of the Government to Mr. O'Riordan's family.</p><p>I take no issue with colleagues who argue that it is not possible to have balanced economic recovery in this country without the necessary infrastructure being put in place.  In order to have a strong economy, it is necessary to have water, power and connectivity.  We have shown in different ways over the years a disposition to obstruct and delay infrastructure that is fit for purpose.  The mobile phone masts I referred to earlier constitute one example in this regard and the road network constitutes another.  Money was bountiful at the time when road projects were commenced and, as a result, the authorities were able to buy their way through the country.  That was an expensive exercise but at least the necessary infrastructure is now in place and can be used.  As a number of Senators pointed out, such infrastructure is not in place in the context of either energy or water.  We are attempting to deal with this through the creation of a water utility in State ownership.  All I can say to Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh is that the &quot;Er&quot; in &quot;Ervia&quot; is intended to represent &Eacute;ire, while &quot;via&quot; is the Latin word for way.  The new name for the company was arrived at by means of a competition among staff of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann.  I cannot say that I am overly attached to it-----</p></speech>

While the matter the Deputy referred to is not directly related to the Bill, I must inform the House that she was both mistaken and wrongly advised in respect of it.</p> <p>The fact of the matter is we cannot disperse employment to provincial Ireland unless we have an adequate grid system.  There are concerns, some of which are fervently held by people and deserve a serious response and consideration, and others of which are daft and off the wall.  I have tried to explain that building out the grid for domestic consumer and employment purposes has nothing to do with whether there will be an export project in green energy to Britain.  That is an entirely separate issue, yet we are confusing the question of building out the domestic grid with that of interconnection.</p><p>The thrust of European energy policy is interconnection.  The age of the island energy market is over.  Interconnection is a two-way street.  The interconnector that we opened approximately one and a half years ago between Wales and Rush is used to import cheaper electricity, which in turn is exerting some downwards pressure on prices in Ireland.  In future, we will import nuclear generated energy from the neighbouring island.  That will not cause us problems so long as we are importing it.  Unlike some of our other problems, we managed to get over that.</p><p>It is a pity that the other debate is haunted by misinformation and, in some cases, disinformation and that the fears of ordinary people who understandably want to protect their domestic environment and so on should be unnecessarily stoked.  We must have the necessary infrastructure, be that connectivity, energy or water, to develop and accelerate economic recovery.  That is unavoidable.  The planning process is rigorous in this country and people ought to give it an opportunity to work.</p><p>The question of a wind export project to Britain is an entirely stand-alone one that will fall or rise dependent on the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement between the two countries.  Under the European directive, we must have an intergovernmental agreement before we can develop a traded sector in wind energy with the neighbouring island or anywhere else.  Since we have uniquely abundant indigenous resources, we have the capacity to exploit those for gain in terms of revenue stream and employment, but we cannot do it without an intergovernmental agreement.  We do not have one currently.  I have made plain several times that there can be no question of developers throwing cables back and forth across the Irish Sea to plug into the British grid wherever it suits them.  The two Governments must and will stay in control.  An intergovernmental agreement would facilitate the emergence of a traded sector.  We have done all of the preparatory work necessary on our side and are in the concluding stages of a cost-benefit analysis of what economic benefit would redound to Ireland.  On several occasions during Question Time and so on in the Lower House, I have explained that, unless the economic benefit to Ireland was clear, there would be no point in proceeding with such an agreement.  The analysis tends to show clearly that there would be significant economic benefit for both jurisdictions.  Having said all of that, it takes two to tango.</p><p>The answer to whether there will be an agreement will emerge early this year, but decisions about our domestic need to provide a grid for the future that is fit for purpose will have to proceed in any event.  We must respond to public consultation in respect of how one best does that.  This is the issue confronting us.</p><p>I thank those Senators who contributed to the debate for facilitating the passage of Second Stage.  I assure Senator Quinn that, judging from the welcome the Bill received in the Lower House, we ought to be able to enact it quickly.  In those circumstances, my understanding is that detailed work is under way in anticipation of the legislation being passed to bring the joint venture into being.  As such, we should be able to put a serious dent in what is admittedly a less than universally adequate service.</p></speech>

Bh&iacute; s&eacute; thar a bheith soil&eacute;ir go raibh daoine buartha n&iacute; hamh&aacute;in faoi st&aacute;das na Gaeilge ach freisin faoi thodhcha&iacute; na Gaeilge.

Cuireadh an strait&eacute;is 20 bliain le ch&eacute;ile ina dhiaidh sin mar thaca&iacute;ocht don reachta&iacute;ocht sin.

Bh&iacute; a leith&eacute;id d'&oacute;c&aacute;id&iacute; ann sna 1960&iacute; agus na 1970i, ach d'imigh an ghluaiseacht sin diaidh ar ndiaidh.  T&aacute;imid ar ais ag an bpointe sin ar&iacute;s.</p> <p>T&aacute;imid tagtha thar n-ais go dt&iacute; an pointe c&eacute;anna ar&iacute;s.  Beidh m&oacute;rshi&uacute;l i gConamara, beidh ceann i mB&eacute;al Feirste freisin agus tiocfaidh m&eacute;ad&uacute; ar seo.  Creidim f&eacute;in, m&aacute;s rud &eacute; go mb&iacute;onn aon rian de "party politics" ag baint le ceist na Gaeilge, nach gcabhra&iacute;onn sin leis an Ghaeilge.  Chreid m&eacute; &eacute; seo i gc&oacute;na&iacute; agus chuir s&eacute; &aacute;thas chro&iacute; orm nuair a ritheadh an tAcht Teanga, a thug comhionnanas don Ghaeilge, agus An Strait&eacute;is 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge d'aonghuth san Oireachtas.  Thug sin an-spreagadh domsa.  Caithimid a bheith cinnte nach bhfuil d&iacute;obh&aacute;il &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh don dul chun cinn sin agus caithfidh an tAire St&aacute;it, m&aacute;s f&eacute;idir leis, na ruda&iacute; at&aacute; leagtha amach anseo, maidir le tabhairt faoi cheist an st&aacute;tch&oacute;rais agus an cheist earca&iacute;ochta, a dh&eacute;anamh.  T&aacute; gach rud eile ann cheana f&eacute;in.

D&eacute;anaim comhghairdeas le R&oacute;n&aacute;n &Oacute; Domhnaill, at&aacute; ainmnithe ag an Rialtas le ceapadh ag an Uachtar&aacute;n don phost mar Choimisin&eacute;ir Teanga.  T&aacute; d&iacute;om&aacute; orm, &aacute;fach, gur &eacute;irigh an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga, Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Cuirre&aacute;in, as oifig.  D&uacute;irt s&eacute; agus &eacute; ag &eacute;ir&iacute; as oifig: "N&iacute; fhaca m&eacute; in imeacht 30 bliain mar iriseoir n&oacute; mar Choimisin&eacute;ir Teanga an oiread &iacute;sle br&iacute; agus lagmhisnigh."  It was a sad moment when the first ombudsman ever for the language resigned and felt so dispirited.</p><p>We have work to do in this regard.  It was a mistake not to have democratic elections to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, particularly with a &quot;c&uacute;&oacute;ta na mban&quot;.  This would have made a substantial difference to the next elections.  We have a lot of ground to make up to restore faith and misneach don teanga.  Fuair an iar-Choimisin&eacute;ir Teanga, Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Cuirre&aacute;in, n&iacute;os m&oacute; n&aacute; 6,000 gear&aacute;n maidir le cearta teanga, 28% d&iacute;obh &oacute;n Ghaeltacht.  These issues must be dealt with.  There is great support for the extension of oral Irish in exams.  We put too much emphasis on Irish as a written language and the increase in the points to be allocated for the oral element of Irish as a spoken language, to 40%, is very welcome.  This development must be encouraged.</p><p>In TCD recently, Linda Ervine, from the PUP spoke about Irish language lessons taking place in east Belfast.  This is a development, but it is a disappointment that, as the Council of Europe pointed out, the language rights Bill in Stormont was blocked.  Perhaps in the context of cross-Border issues, we should consider the rights of the Ulster-Scots language and an Ghaeilge in the North of Ireland.</p><p>I wish R&oacute;n&aacute;n &Oacute; Domhnaill every success.  He is well known around the Houses, is popular and well liked and I am sure he will do a good job.  However, the job will be somewhat difficult.  A lack of hope brought 10,000 people onto the streets last Saturday and a mending of fences is required.  As I said, I have felt we should not have replaced the democratically elected &uacute;dar&aacute;s by a nominated or appointed body.  However, we will always look forward in hope.  I hope the developments in east Belfast will inspire people and that the growth of Gaelscoileanna and in the number of people wishing to go to the Gaeltacht to learn Irish- bigger numbers than ever - will do the same.</p><p>In the wider Europe, the growth of interest in Welsh, Scottish and other minority languages shows this is not an isolated issue.  This is about respect for minorities and their language rights.  It is an enrichment for all of us to have that diversity.  I wish the coimisin&eacute;ir and an tAire St&aacute;it every success and hope the appointment heralds a new era for the development of the language.</p></speech>

I think she is on business with the Good Friday Agreement committee today.  I welcome the appointment of R&oacute;n&aacute;n &Oacute; Domhnaill as the new Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga.  Others have spoken eloquently about his distinguished career as a political correspondent with Nuacht RTE and TG4 over the past seven years.  He has also presented "The Week in Politics".  We know him well.  As others have said, he is very popular and well liked in here.  The Minister of State has expressed the high esteem in which he holds Mr. &Oacute; Domhnaill.  We all wish him the best of luck in this post.  We know these issues arouse great passion.  Others have referred to the large numbers of people who took to the streets at the weekend to show their support for the strength and position of the Irish language.  I know the commissioner will have a great deal of work to do.  I am sure, given his very impressive career to date, that he will carry out his tasks very well.  On behalf of the Labour Party, I welcome his appointment and the cross-party support that has been expressed for it.</p></speech>

Caithfear deireadh a chur leis an maol&uacute; ar st&aacute;das na Gaeilge mar theanga oifigi&uacute;il don Aontas Eorpach.  Beidh na toghch&aacute;in Eorpacha ar si&uacute;l go luath agus seo an t-am anois leis an cheist seo a chur ar ais ar an gcl&aacute;r.  Caithfear an pobal Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta a aithint mar gheallsealbh&oacute;ir&iacute; i gcur i bhfeidhm na Strait&eacute;ise 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge &oacute; Dheas agus sa Strait&eacute;is don Ghaeilge &oacute; Thuaidh. </p><p>N&iacute; bheidh muid in ann gach rud at&aacute; sa strait&eacute;is 20 bliain a dh&eacute;anamh, ach caithfimid c&uacute;ig n&oacute; s&eacute; phointe a phiocadh amach agus iad a dh&eacute;anamh.  Molaim don Aire St&aacute;it &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh.  Caithfidh s&eacute; seo a dh&eacute;anamh ionas gur f&eacute;idir linn na coinn&iacute;ollacha a chomhl&iacute;onadh in am.  Caithfidh s&eacute; freisin, Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la a l&aacute;idri&uacute; i mbliana.  Is &eacute; an tAire St&aacute;it an fear is fearr le seo a dh&eacute;anamh.  T&aacute; an teanga go l&iacute;ofa aige, i bhfad n&iacute;os l&iacute;ofa n&aacute; mar at&aacute; s&iacute; agamsa.

N&iacute;l againn le d&eacute;anamh ach cuimhneamh ar stair na t&iacute;re seo agus Conradh na Gaeilge a bh&iacute; ag dul ar aghaidh go bre&aacute;.  Bh&iacute; na hAontachtaithe, na Unionists, thart i mo cheantar f&eacute;in agus col&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge ar bun acu.  Bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag caint le fear uair &eacute;igin agus d&uacute;irt s&eacute; liom go raibh a shean aint&iacute;n mar bhall de Chonradh na Gaeilge.  Ba gharmhac de Lord Brookeborough &eacute;.

Luaigh an Seanad&oacute;ir Barrett oirthear Bh&eacute;al Feirste, &aacute;it a bhfuil an teanga ag teacht ar ais.  Ach, bh&iacute; tamall ann, 30 bliain, ina raibh an teanga mar chn&aacute;mh spairne polait&iacute;ochta.  Bh&iacute; dream amh&aacute;in ag iarraidh an teanga a fhuadach agus nuair a tharla&iacute;onn sin, is &iacute; an teanga a bh&iacute;onn th&iacute;os leis.  Caithfimid an pobal ar fad a thabhairt linn agus aonta&iacute;m leis an bpointe sin.</p><p>  Maidir leis an m&oacute;rshi&uacute;l a bh&iacute; ann D&eacute; Sathairn ag Conradh na Gaeilge.  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh aon taca&iacute;ocht at&aacute; le f&aacute;il ag an teanga - aon &aacute;it.

Baineann an cheist at&aacute; &aacute; ard&uacute; agam inniu leis an t&aacute;ille de &pound;10 in aghaidh an lae, n&oacute; &pound;1,000 sa bhliain, at&aacute; le gearradh ar thrucail&iacute; a bheidh ag taisteal ar bh&oacute;ithre Tuaisceart na h&Eacute;ireann.  This charge, which is being proposed on foot of British legislation, will apply to trucks that are registered outside England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland when they travel on all British roads, including roads in the North of Ireland.  It will mean that a &pound;10 daily fee, or a &pound;1,000 annual fee, will apply to Irish trucks when they travel on roads in the North.  This will have a devastating effect on many Irish haulage companies that use HGVs over a certain tonnage.  It will have a substantial impact on trucks in the Border counties, including the Minister of State's county of Louth.  It will have a particularly significant effect on County Donegal, given the nature of the geography of the north west.  Trucks that travel between Donegal and Dublin will be severely penalised as a result of this additional charge.</p> <p>It does not make sense.  It will affect businesses and jobs and it will increase the cost of goods moving in and out of areas.</p><p>I wish to raise the matter with the Minister today.  An urgent meeting is required between the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and his British counterpart.  I understand that a meeting may have taken place today.  Perhaps the Minister of State can enlighten the House on whether the issue was on the agenda of that meeting.  Has it been discussed?  What attempts are being made by the Irish Government to deal with the issue?  Has an amnesty been sought for trucks from the Twenty-six Counties when they travel into the North?</p><p>The new charge does not make sense.  We must protect the haulage business and accompanying jobs.  Not only that, the cost of consumer goods will also be affected.  The Government is aware of the situation as the issue has been raised previously.  I hope it is making progress and will have the matter dealt with as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

T&aacute; me ag tabhairt freagra thar cheann an Aire Iompair, Turas&oacute;ireachta agus Sp&oacute;irt, an Teachta Varadkar.  Mar a d&uacute;irt an Seanad&oacute;ir, t&aacute; cruinni&uacute; aige inniu leis an Aire i Sasana.</p><p>Since 1999 various EU directives have set common rules on distance related tolls and time-based user charges for heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain roads infrastructure.  It is open to any state to introduce road user charges if it wishes.</p><p>The new road user levy, which is being introduced by the UK Parliament as opposed to the Northern Ireland authorities, applies to all HGVs weighing 12 tonnes or more for use of UK roads, including those in Northern Ireland.  The levy will come into effect on 1 April 2014.</p><p>The concept of the scheme is that all HGVs over 12 tonnes, including those that are UK-registered, pay the charge.  UK-registered HGVs will also get a reduction in their annual motor tax which is more or less equivalent to an annual charge, which they are charged for and pay annually with their motor tax.</p><p>The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, is very aware of the concerns of the Irish haulage industry regarding the introduction of a HGV road user levy by the UK authorities.  On a number of occasions he has strongly expressed his concerns to both the UK and Northern Ireland authorities regarding the impact the levy will have on Irish hauliers.  Furthermore, he has strenuously sought exemptions for roads in Northern Ireland to reduce the impact of the levy on Irish hauliers on the basis of the Irish Government's contribution towards the cost of roads infrastructure in Northern Ireland.  The issue has also been discussed at transport sectoral meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council.</p><p>The Minister is in the United Kingdom where he has met Stephen Hammond MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport, and he again pressed the issue at the meeting.  Clause 3 of the UK HGV Road User Levy Act 2013 allows the Secretary of State to vary the extent of the scheme by order.  The UK has proposed to include approximately seven miles of cross-Border road between the Republic and Northern Ireland.  This would allow all operators to use these stretches of road without paying the levy, as it would be a breach of EU legislation to grant an exemption to just one country.  In this context the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, has sought an exemption for the A5, which is often used by operators starting a journey in the Republic to deliver goods to another location in the Republic and transiting the A5 during the operation.  He also emphasised that Ireland has contributed &pound;20 million to the A5 and has committed a further &pound;50 million.  He expressed the fact that he felt it was unreasonable that we contributed to the cost of a significant piece of infrastructure yet our hauliers are now expected to pay for it.  Both Ministers agreed that further consideration would be given to exemptions by officials of their Departments.</p></speech>

I can see that progress is being made.  I wish to highlight the fact that the charge is due to be introduced on 1 April so it is a pressing matter.

If progress has not been made, when are we likely to see it?  When will a formal arrangement or proper procedures be put in place?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-02-20a.216" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1069" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014022000026#Z00700"><p>I thank Senator Colm Burke for bringing the matter before the House.  I am taking the matter on behalf of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.</p><p>The Republic of India has ratified the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Inter-Country Adoption.  As a contracting state under the Hague Convention, the Adoption Act 2010 provides that adoptions by Irish prospective adoptive parents may be made subject to Irish and Indian requirements being satisfied in line with relevant laws and the provisions of the Hague Convention.</p><p>It is a matter for contracting states whether they wish to impose restrictions on whether and how inter-country adoptions of citizens of that state may be effected.  In this regard, the Adoption Authority advised that there remains a general moratorium by the Indian Central Authority on India accepting adoption applications from other countries other than in special circumstances.  The authority has recently received an announcement from CARA that India is currently accepting packs from non-resident Indian prospective adoptive parents for the adoption of Indian children in the normal category.  This means that India remains closed to non-Indian prospective adoptive parents at this time in respect of its normal categories of children.  The Adoption Authority understands that CARA is accepting applications in respect of special needs children, which includes children over five years of age and sibling groups.   The authority is attempting to establish from CARA a possible timeframe for the acceptance of application packs in the normal category from non-Indian nationals.</p><p>The Adoption Authority has advised that it is its position that it is necessary to have an Irish registered accredited body to facilitate inter-country adoptions from India in order to safeguard the process for the child and the adoptive parents.  The authority has two applications for India from Irish agencies that are being considered.  Any accreditation being considered by the authority can only apply to the Indian special needs programme at this time.   The accreditation of agencies to facilitate adoptions is solely a matter for the Adoption Authority under law.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has raised, with the Adoption Authority, the likely timescale of reaching conclusions on these applications.  I understand it is intended to finalise the process promptly.</p><p>The authority advises that it is the policy of CARA to impose the following age limits and age differentials.  Again, they are a matter for the Indian authorities and are not specific to Ireland.  To adopt a child in the age group of zero to three years, the maximum composite age of the prospective adoptive parents should be 90 years, wherein the individual age of the prospective adoptive parents should not be less than 25 years and not more than 50 years.  To adopt children above three years of age, the maximum composite age of the prospective adoptive parents should be 105 years, wherein the individual age of the prospective adoptive parents should not be less than 25 years and not more than 55 years.  In the case of a single applicant, he or she should not be less than 30 years of age and shall not be above the age of 50 years.  The maximum age shall be 45 years to adopt children in the age group of zero to three years and 50 years for adopting children above three years.  Updates regarding inter-country adoptions from India will be posted on the authority's website.</p><p>On 3 March the Minister will meet a group of prospective adoptive parents who have declared an interest in adopting from India.  She hopes that the meeting will allow for a full exchange of views on the issues related to inter-country adoption from India.</p></speech>

He said that the accreditation of agencies to facilitate adoptions is solely a matter for the Adoption Authority under law.  Earlier he stated that accreditation can only apply to the Indian special needs programme at this time.  In other words, we are confining any adoptions from India to children with special needs.  That is what I understood from his reply.  Is that my correct interpretation?</p></speech>

I take this debate on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan.</p><p>The new Building Control (Amendment) Regulations will greatly strengthen the arrangements currently in place for the control of building activity by requiring greater accountability in relation to compliance with building regulations in the form of statutory certification of design and construction, lodgement of compliance documentation, mandatory inspections during construction and validation and registration of certificates.  The new regulations are necessary following the widespread instances of failure by owners, designers and builders to comply with their legal obligations under the Building Control Act 1990 to design and construct buildings in accordance with the building regulations.</p><p>An extensive public consultation process was undertaken in 2012 to inform the development of the revised building control regulations which will come into effect on 1 March 2014.  Comprehensive consultation documents were published, including Strengthening the Building Control System - A Document to inform public consultation on Draft Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2012, which sets out the context in which the reforms, which are now signed into law in the form of SI 9 of 2014 which supersedes SI 80 of 2013, will operate and the regulatory impact of these for building owners and industry stakeholders.  This document is available on the website of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p><p>In summary, it can be said that the arrangements being put in place for the control of building activity may result in additional design, inspection, certification and, possibly insurance costs which must ultimately be borne by the building owner-contracting authority.  Such additional costs would be justified by the enhanced quality and standard of design and construction of the building project concerned in light of several notable instances of non-compliant buildings which failed to meet minimum building standards.  We all know of instances of this in the past year or so.</p><p>It is anticipated that the statutory inspection process will reduce the incidences of defective works on site and the resultant associated costs of carrying out remedial works will reduce accordingly.  Owners will now be required to assign a competent person to inspect and certify the works.  For buildings where this would not previously have been the case, industry sources suggest this requirement could add between &euro;1,000 to &euro;3,000 per housing unit to the overall building costs, although in reality this actual cost will be decided by market forces.</p><p>The Government is acutely aware of the employment and competition consequences that may result.  Overall the new regulations will have a positive effect on employment in the sector.  The regulations will serve to ensure the involvement of competent registered professionals in the design, inspection and certification of buildings generally and competent builders in the execution and certification of works.  In this way, owners, designers and builders will meet and account for their legal obligations under the Building Control Act 1990 which recent experience has shown to have been widely flouted.  The cost of this, which must be borne by the responsible parties, will be justified by safer, compliant buildings in keeping with the legitimate expectations of consumers.</p><p>There have been wild exaggerations in circulation of the increased costs the regulations will impose on the self-build home sector.  There has been no change in the technical performance standards.  Any person who intended meeting their statutory obligations to design and build in accordance with the building regulations will face the additional design and certification costs referred to, but any additional building costs will be negligible.</p><p>The construction industry, in particular the residential sector, includes an unusually high number of SMEs.  A large proportion of the work of such firms would involve repair, renewal and renovation work or extensions to existing dwellings.  Such works would not come within the scope of the proposed Building Control (Amendment) Regulations.  In addition such firms would operate as subcontractors on larger projects.  In such cases the impact and the administrative burden would fall on the principal contractor.  The impact of the proposed regulations on SMEs has thus been kept to a minimum.</p></speech>

I know he is not the Minister in charge of this.  The question I asked was whether a regulatory impact assessment was carried out on the Building Control Act regulations of 2013.  The Minister of State knows that this question was not answered in the reply.  In fact, my questions could have been answered by a simple "yes" or "no" answer.</p><p>The Minister of State has had to take matters on the Adjournment for other Ministers and Members have argued that the question they asked was never answered in the course of the reply.  I will take the matter up with the Cathaoirleach and the Minister.  It is important the reply from the relevant Department answers the matter that was raised on the Adjournment.  One of the proposals in the programme for Government is that regulatory impact assessments would be conducted continually.  I believe that fewer than three have been done in some Departments in the past three years.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-02-20a.227" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1155" speakername="Kathryn Reilly" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014022000027#AA01100"><p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd to the House,and I know he is responding on behalf of the relevant Minister.  Last week my colleague, Councillor M&iacute;che&aacute;l Mac Donncha and I met the Kilbarrack youth project outside the gates of Leinster House, protesting at the cuts that have been imposed on their project that has been in operation for almost 20 years.</p><p>A recent meeting of the City of Dublin Youth Services Board has led the board members to believe they can no longer function or carry on the work, given the drastic decreases in funding in recent years.  This particular project has worked over the past 20 years with more than 500 young people from an area of economic, social and educational disadvantage.  They have faced the issues that are common to many other disadvantaged areas - drug addiction, teenage drinking and essentially a very disaffected youth population.  Between 70 and 90 young people attend the project every week for peer education, health and sexual health education, sports, art, drama and leadership courses, which are pivotal for these young people.  The staff have told us that the work of the centre and the voluntary commitment of the young people in the past 20 years has made this a more settled area.  They are now faced with the closure of the project.  The reality of what is happening to the project is not the exception but is fast becoming the rule across youth services throughout the State.</p><p>I have met many of those in the youth services sector in the course of the work I am conducting.  At a time of mass youth unemployment and educational opportunities that are out of reach for many young people, the funding for youth opportunity should not be decreasing and should in fact be increasing.  I know the Government held a referendum on children and has set up the Child and Family Agency but at the same time it is cutting key supports such as supports for youth services.  Youth services across the State give young people a positive focus and are undoubtedly helping to keep many away from the anti-social behaviour, addiction and homelessness that are plaguing society.</p><p>The youth groups feel that Government is culling and dismissing them by stripping away these valuable services from areas that need as much funding and resources as possible.  What is worse is that the young people we met outside Leinster House in hurricane weather conditions in which one would not put out a dog believe their independence is being taken away by these cuts.</p> <p>In the context of community and wider society, all evidence shows that investment in youth services is money well spent, and it is widely accepted that these services provide for value for money.  An Indecon report published last year found that every &euro;1 invested in youth work saves the State &euro;2.20 in the long run.  We cannot shirk our responsibility in this regard.  At a time of cuts, we must bear in mind these statistics as they go to the core of evidence-based policy-making.</p><p>It is important to highlight that cuts to youth services apply not only to the young people who attend youth clubs but will also impact on the structure and cohesion of local communities.  It is short-sighted to continue with these cuts.  Projects in areas such as Kilbarrack are important for the fabric of the community.  It is illogical to get rid of them.  It became clear in my recent discussions with young people and youth groups that these are frequently the only services provided by the State that enjoy the trust of young people.  They work for young people irrespective of their circumstances and in a non-prejudicial manner.  As such, they offer a vehicle for young people to develop into confident adults.  The Government has a duty to protect rather than cut youth services.</p><p>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, stated earlier this week that youth employment is the wind beneath the wings of extremism, which is on the increase.  A recent report found that young people are not engaging with the European Union election process.  If young people feel disenfranchised and believe the system is not working for them, they will become disengaged and refuse to vote.  If we invest in services for the young or provide a youth guarantee, they will engage more with society.  As the Indecon report emphasised, social structures are extremely important for the community, society and economy.</p></speech>

Youth projects and organisations present valuable opportunities to young people for their personal and social development.  The youth affairs unit of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs supports the delivery by the voluntary youth sector of a range of youth work programmes and services for all young people, including those from disadvantaged communities.  These schemes include the youth service grant scheme, which supports 30 national and major regional youth organisations, the special projects for youth scheme, rounds 1 and 2 of the young people's facilities and services fund, local drug task force projects and certain other programmes, including the local youth club grant scheme, youth information centres, L&eacute;argas - the Exchange Bureau - and Gaisce, the President's Award.  These funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 400,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 paid staff and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities nationwide.</p><p>This year, the Department has provided funding of &euro;50.53 million, including &euro;750,000 for capital funding, for these schemes.  The capital funding element comprises &euro;250,000 for play and recreation initiatives and &euro;500,000 for staff-led youth projects under the various schemes funded by the youth affairs unit of the Department. The focus of this financial support in 2014, as in previous years, is on the consolidation of existing youth work provision and on the safeguarding of front-line programmes, particularly in disadvantaged communities.  Some additional funding that became available to the Department at the end of 2013 was of assistance in this regard and a number of local youth projects received a once-off grant to assist their sustainability in 2014.</p><p>The Department, in line with Government policy, has been required to achieve significant savings on schemes and services.  The final allocations for the provision of youth services in 2014 takes account of the additional &euro;1 million which the Minister secured in budget 2014 so as to offset the impact of the comprehensive review of expenditure on youth services and other identified efficiencies.  As a result of the additional funding secured, the Minister was in a position to scale back the reductions in 2014 to 3.75 % compared with the 10% and 5%, respectively, proposed in the expenditure review.</p><p>The detailed notifications about the allocations and payment arrangements for this year have issued from the Department to all organisations and projects.  As in recent years, national organisations and the grant administering agencies which administer youth funding on behalf of the Department are invited, where appropriate, to submit proposals to the Department for the reconfiguration of the funding allocations notified to them across projects and funding schemes to better meet local needs.</p><p>The Minister is aware of the challenges that the budgetary constraints raise for youth services.  She and her officials will continue to meet representatives of many youth organisations and groups to try to ascertain how we can work together to ensure the most effective and efficient use of the resources available to continue to support the provision of quality and responsive youth services for young people.</p></speech>
