Jody began her career in the Department of Fisheries and Food in 1975 and transferred to the Houses of the Oireachtas in 1978.  She worked in various sections in the Houses, including the interparliamentary unit, personnel, committees and the Questions Office, before being appointed Clerk Assistant of the Seanad in 1991.  There are not many Members who were here at that time, other than the Leas-Chathaoirleach and Senators David Norris and Paschal Mooney.  Senator Paul Bradford was in the other House.</p><p>Jody was the expert in this House on Private Bills and the Standing Orders relating to them.  She was a great person to go to for advice and we all very much appreciate the work she has done here for the past 23 years.  We wish her very well in her retirement.  She will be sadly missed in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

As the Cathaoirleach noted, she is and always has been a proud Tipperary woman.  She leaves after more than 30 years of dedicated service in Leinster House, 23 of those years having been spent in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  She certainly is a treasure and one we will miss dearly.  Many of us come and go through this House, whether on the Government or Opposition side, but Jody has been a constant for more than two decades, serving the daily administrative needs of the Seanad and keeping the wheels in motion.  She has always carried out her duties in a very efficient, competent and professional manner.  I am sure I speak for all Senators in saying that she was always helpful and obliging to each and every one of us.  On behalf of the Members, I would like to make a small presentation to Jody as a token of appreciation for all the help and assistance she has given us over the years.  We wish her many years of happy retirement.</p></speech>

The Cathaoirleach and Leader have highlighted what she has meant to this House and its Members over the years.  I hear some of her utterances from time to time because I am seated very close to her.  She has kept me in line on several occasions.  My first proper dealing with Jody was in the aftermath of the trauma of being kicked out of government by colleagues opposite, when I had lost my seat in the other House.  I had to sit through a Seanad count in the restaurant without having a clue how the whole thing worked.  I could see Jody and Deirdre working away and putting the scores on the board and, in due course, I got a wink to say I would be all right.  I was relived, but it may have been an unhappy outcome for some of my fellow Senators.</p><p>Jody has been brilliant to us on this side of the House and we really will miss her.  She is irreplaceable.  After 30 years in the Seanad, she definitely deserves a break to enjoy her life without having to worry about the House being recalled in the middle of August or sitting until 2 a.m. or 3 a.m.  Her professionalism, courtesy and friendliness have always shone through in everything she did.  She kept us on the straight and narrow and ensured we did our job efficiently, with a sense of humour and always knowing we could not overstep the line or we would get a slap from her.  I hope she enjoys the next phase in her life, which I am sure will be not so much a retirement but rather a moving on to enjoy the next 30, 40 or 50 years.  As my colleague, Senator Diarmuid Wilson remarked, Jody must have started in here when she was ten years old.</p><p>I welcome the allocation of time today to discuss the statutory instrument relating to building regulations.  We have tabled several statutory instruments for debate in recent weeks.  It is a useful exercise for the Seanad to tease these issues out, whether we agree or disagree on the specific issues.  I thank the Leader very much for allowing an hour to debate this important statutory instrument.</p><p>I wish to express my grave disappointment and that of my colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il at the non-attendance at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts today of Ms Angela Kerins and Mr. Frank Flannery.  Both of those individuals should know very well the importance of that committee as effectively the ranking committee in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is the watchdog for the public in terms of how the moneys they contribute in taxes are spent.  I encourage Mr. Flannery and Ms Kerins to attend a meeting of the committee at the earliest possible opportunity, where they can be assured of receiving a fair hearing.  Mr. Flannery has stated his view that the committee is behaving in a partisan fashion in carrying out its functions and is going beyond its remit in this matter.  He further stated that the committee is in &quot;pursuit of a partisan political agenda designed to damage the Party I have been associated with&quot;.  That is not the case at all, but it is very similar to what the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, said a few weeks ago when he tried to discredit the Committee of Public Accounts in regard to its efforts to have Mr. Flannery appear before it.</p><p>I remind colleagues that the Committee of Public Accounts has a majority of Government members and has been unanimous in its call for Mr. Flannery and Ms Kerins to give evidence.  For Mr. Flannery to claim he is being brought before the committee in order effectively to damage the Fine Gael Party, in which he has been heavily involved for the past 30 years, is a spurious charge.  He should reflect on his decision not to come before the committee to answer the very valid questions that committee members of all parties and none wish to put to him.  It is a pity that neither Mr. Flannery nor Ms Kerins will take the opportunity today to answer those questions and put forward their own case.  Will the Leader reaffirm that it is the Government's wish that Mr. Flannery and Ms Kerins appear before the Committee of Public Accounts to answer the questions the elected Members who make up that committee wish to put to them on behalf of the taxpayers of this country?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-04-10a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1148" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014041000004#C00100"><p>On behalf of the Labour group I join with others in paying tribute to Jody Blake.  We all wish her a very happy early retirement; I stress early as otherwise she would have had to be ten when starting.  She served 23 years in the Seanad, as the Leader has said, which is a long sentence by any stretch and she definitely deserves to have a very happy life outside of here.  We will all miss her very much.  When I was first elected seven years ago, I recall the welcome she gave me and I came to depend on her kind words of advice and support and, indeed, those of Ms Deirdre Lane also.  She brought always a great deal of professionalism and competence and a very high standard of skill and ability to her role, a sense of humour, a flair and, of course, an inimitable dress style which I will greatly miss.  On behalf of the Labour group I wish her the very best and want to say how much we will miss her in her early retirement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-04-10a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1171" speakername="Jillian van Turnhout" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014041000004#C00200"><p>I too wish to join in the tributes to thank Jody for all her help.  I am a Member for less than three years but I can still remember the day I entered the Seanad and met the formidable team between Deirdre and Jody who were very helpful in ensuring I had guidance and advice.  Straight talking is a word that applies when one asks if something can or cannot be done as one is given the absolute advice on it.  Jody has provided us with a fountain knowledge, individually as Members and collectively as a Seanad, for which I thank her.  On my own behalf, she has always been there to answer questions and to give advice and guidance.  Her immense experience in the Houses is obvious.  On behalf of the Independent group of Members, each of us with our own agenda, I thank her for helping to steer us through the challenge we have in the Seanad and wish her the very best in her early retirement, as Senator Ivana Bacik has said.  It is very much "good bye" and not a "farewell".  I hope we will still see her around the Houses and that she will come to visit and continue to give us advice as she looks on from a distance.</p><p>Today is the 14th anniversary of the direct provision system, a system we should not have in Ireland.  People have been in the direct provision system for many years.  I urge all Members to look at the Human Rights in Ireland blogathon today.  Every half hour, for 14 hours, it is putting up experiences of those in direct provision for asylum seekers and those from advocates who are seeking change.  </p><p>This is Irish Heart Foundation, stroke awareness week.  I remind Members that if they are looking for signs of a stroke to act fast.  One should look at the person's face to see If it has fallen to one side, check the arms to see if the person can raise them and note if speech is slurred.  If in any doubt I advise people to call 112 or 999.  We need to be much more stroke-aware.  If we can get in early with strokes, so much can be done for people.  If we delay giving help to a person suffering from a stroke irreparable damage can be done.  I ask everybody to promote stroke awareness week.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-04-10a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1136" speakername="David Norris" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014041000004#C00300"><p>I had understood that the tributes to Jody would be after the Order of Business but it is quite appropriate that we give it primacy because this is the most important event that will take place today.  I would ask for the indulgence of the House, since we have a rota, that after I say my few words on behalf of the Independents that I hand over to take the Order of Businesses with Senator Sean D. Barrett and then I will take my place to raise one issue later.<br />In a way it is an emotional day for all of us.  I certainly feel that because Jody will be greatly missed in this House.  When I was elected, the Clerk was another distinguished member of staff, Mr. Kieran Coughlan, who has recently retired from his position as Clerk of the D&aacute;il.<br />Jody has been here many years.  I will not mention the number of years but it is an alarming number which I would not be ungentlemanly enough to mention that she has actually served in this House, I simply could not believe it.  With regard to the dress sense, I am very glad that Senator Ivana Bacik raised it, because I have frequently complimented Jody privately on this.  I would be terrified to say anything in public because of the bourgeois PC<b></b>brigade in this House and they would tear me, limb from limb, if I dared to say anything so sexist, but coming from Senator Ivana Bacik it could not possibly be sexist.  It is a lovely human compliment and one that is deserved by Jody, not that Deirdre is very far behind in the fashion stakes.<br />May I say, I think Deirdre will miss her terribly because they have been a wonderful team.  I used to joke that it was good cop, bad cop, but I will leave one to guess which is which.  Jody was always so helpful, decent, genuine, sympathetic - the French only use that word &quot;<i>sympathique</i>&quot; very sparingly of very special people.  That is what Jody is.  One could go to her with anything and she would give one the best professional advice.<br />We have been very lucky to have Jody.  She battled some illnesses very bravely and came back to us.  Now she is going to enjoy life.  I hope Jody enjoyed life here with all the rough and tumble, even the late sittings, naughty Members like myself having to be occasionally told to behave themselves, always done in the nicest possible way and so civilised.  I hope we will see her from time to time.  I ask her, please, not to abandon us because it would be a great loss to us.  I hope she will be in.  There is a cliche as Gaeilge, that I think is appropriate on this occasion, n&iacute; fheicfimid a leith&eacute;id ar&iacute;s - we will not see the likes of Jody again.  We will get somebody different and I am sure he or she will be excellent, as is Deirdre.  I hope we get another team but nobody will replace Jody in her humanity, her decency and her extensive knowledge, but the principle thing is her good fellowship.  On behalf of the Independent group, every one of us, including those who are not present, who have to go abroad on professional business, or electioneering or whatever they are at, unanimously wanted a full and appropriate tribute paid to Jody today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-04-10a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1129" speakername="Susan O'Keeffe" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014041000004#C00400"><p>We will miss Jody very much.  I know that her dog, her garden, her friends and her family will be the beneficiaries of her time away from us.  She has been more than helpful, particularly to those of us who are new not only to the Seanad but to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I greatly appreciate her kindness and common sense.  We will miss her very much.  We hope she will take the opportunity in both hands and have a great time and think of us just every now and again.  When those long speeches are being delivered here and the little arguments break out, we will have her somewhere in our thoughts.  I extend a big warm "thank you" to her for everything.</p><p>On the subject of the Committee of Public Accounts and the issue of charities, it appears to me that the confusion in regard to Rehab concerns the role of private business and charities combined.  Behind Rehab is an extraordinary network of companies that defies belief.  Who are all these companies?  Who are the directors of them?  Some of them are names we already know.  How is it that they are able to build up such a network of private business while having charitable status?  In this day and age, is that the correct way for charities to function?  I would have very deep reservations particularly when I see extraordinary crossovers between those companies, not only here but in the UK, and the closeness of a particular group of people within those companies and those directors.  I ask the Leader if the House could assist in that issue.  The Committee of Public Accounts has its own role in scrutinising public expenditure but we too have a role in regard to future legislation in respect of charities.  I ask the Leader if we could have a debate on the issue.</p><p>I note President Higgins' remark when he addressed the UK Joint Houses of Parliament this week that he remembered Constance Markievicz was the first woman MP.  In so doing, he acknowledged the great role of women in politics and in public life.</p> <p>I hope to see more women elected in the forthcoming local elections.  This is something we need to strive towards in the future.  We got off to a great start with Countess Markievicz but we need to do more.  I thank the President for making that remark.</p></speech>

N&iacute;l aon amhras faoi n&aacute; gur thug s&iacute; an-chabhair agus an-taca&iacute;ocht d&uacute;inn anseo i gc&oacute;na&iacute;.  Is cinnte nach mbeidh a leith&eacute;id ar&iacute;s ann.<br />As a fellow Tipperary person, I would like to express my appreciation of Jody as Clerk Assistant of the Seanad.  I have often marvelled at her demeanour and stamina when the House sat for long hours and the courtesy she showed us at all times.  Her lack of arrogance was immensely important.  There is no doubt that Jody and Deirdre are an exceptionally dynamic duo, both of them with Tipperary connections.  In a way, they underline the calibre of people who come out of Tipperary.  It has been often said to me by people looking back on the records of others, including the background from which they came and so on, that an ounce of breeding is better than a tonne of feeding.  In this case, that is particularly true.  I believe that Jody in many ways epitomises all that is best in public service.  It is important to reflect on that also.  Very often the spotlight is on the Oireachtas and both Houses.  Even in the most exciting or over energetic debates held in this House, there was always a sense of calmness at the top table, which permeated down to Members of the House.<br />I was not a Member of this House during all of Jody's 23 years here.   Twenty-three years in terms of look-back on b&oacute;ithr&iacute;n na smaointe seems like a short period.  All of the service provided during that time was given in a quiet way.  That one could seek and be given advice at any time helped to bring cohesion into the House.  It is understandable in a House of Parliament that things can become somewhat confrontational.  We always need people to throw oil on troubled waters.  There is no doubt that Jody Blake did this.  As a virtual neighbour in Tipperary, I have no doubt I will meet her many times in the years to come.  Go raibh rath D&eacute; uirthi i gc&oacute;na&iacute;.  T&aacute;imid uilig go m&oacute;r faoi chomaoin aici.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith aici<b>.</b></p></speech>

I discovered early on following my election to Seanad &Eacute;ireann three years ago that we had mutual friends.  I will always appreciate the sound and solid advice provided by Jody to me when Acting Chairman and the help, support and courtesy she extends to all Members.  I wish her a long, happy and healthy retirement to do all the things she has not had time to do in recent years.  I wish her well and thank her for her outstanding service to Seanad &Eacute;ireann and to Ireland.</p><p>It goes without saying that we are immensely proud of the impact on Ireland and Britain of the President's State visit to the UK.  President and Mrs Higgins have made a huge impact on the British people and have made us all aware of how highly regarded the Irish people in England are and the great successes so many of them have achieved.  In my view, the success of the State visit must be built on.  Politicians must take the initiative in this regard.  We all hope that trade, commerce and tourism will be positively impacted in the years ahead.  In my view, the real objective must be a strengthening of the fragile peace process in Northern Ireland by dealing with the issues that remain unresolved from the failed Haass talks.  As we head towards the month of July and the marching season, all the goodwill currently out there must be harnessed.  For this reason, I ask that the Leader organise at the earliest possible opportunity in the next term a debate with the T&aacute;naiste on how this historic event can be built upon and how politicians can make the next positive moves to cement the work being done in Northern Ireland and to resolve the outstanding issues causing difficulty there.</p></speech>

When she left Golden in Tipperary she ushered in a golden era in the Seanad.  I thank her very much for all her kindness to us all.</p><p>This week, most generous tributes were paid by Queen Elizabeth in her speech at Windsor Castle to Daniel O'Connell as a parliamentarian.  This parliamentary tradition is extremely important in this country.  On Sunday, the people of Carlingford will honour Thomas D'Arcy McGee, one of the founders of the Canadian Parliament.  This is a notable tradition which Irish people have brought to Australia, South America, Canada and the United States and which has, as stated by Her Majesty during the week, also enriched the democracy of the United Kingdom.  It is a proud parliamentary tradition that should be included in all our centenary celebrations.</p><p>On a different note, yesterday Mr. Justice Peter Charleton made some strong remarks about stockbroking in this country.  This follows insurance levies in which business people were trading insolvently; the &euro;64 million bailout for the banks; the bailout of the credit union in Newbridge and others elsewhere; the bankrupting of all our building societies; pension funds which are hundreds of millions in debt and accountants who, in many cases, do not appear to be accountable.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Finance to the House to discuss the problems caused by the unsatisfactory regulation of financial services in Ireland.  The Minister can be assured of our support in any attempts to get some order into this sector which regularly brings itself into disrepute.  The question one must ask is what on earth they are teaching in business schools these days that seven sectors cause so much annoyance and grief to the remainder of society and the economy.</p></speech>

I, too, found her ever helpful, particularly when I was Acting Chairman.  Whenever Jody was there when one was in the Chair, one could not go wrong.  I am extremely grateful for her help.  I am sure we will get together again outside this House.</p><p>Reference has been made to the state visit.  I agree that the President and Mrs. Higgins, in terms of all they have done and what the President said, have done us proud.  Along with Deputies McHugh, Feighan and Wall, I had the pleasure of being in the Royal Gallery to hear the President's speech, which was very powerful.  As has been said, good things will flow from the visit.  Perhaps, as has also been said, we can mark it by an appropriate debate in this House.  I was delighted by the references in the Queen's speech to Countess Markievicz and the liberator, Daniel O'Connell.  As stated by Senator Barrett, that practice is a proud Irish tradition.  Perhaps the Leader would arrange for an appropriate marking of the occasion by this House.</p></speech>

As a new Member, I found the counts of parcels and sub-parcels and the inside and outside rules all very confusing.</p> <p>It was very confusing and a lot tougher than the old tallies that happened in count centres at a general election.  This is my first time in an elected position and I have been fortunate to have the benefit of Ms Deirdre Lane and Ms Jody Blake who assist us and try to keep manners on us at times.  I wish Jody well in her early retirement.  <br />Three other matters of note have also happened this week.  Youth Work Ireland week runs until 13 April and many of us attended the briefing in Buswell's Hotel yesterday.  EU Commissioner Andor held a high level conference on the youth guarantee in Brussels on Tuesday, and President Higgins addressed the Guildhall banquet in London last night.  In his address, the President said:<blockquote>... it is the ordinary people of Ireland, and generations yet to come, who have borne and continue to bear the cost of the painful decisions that have been taken ... In the end, it is how our respective peoples experience the result of our action or inaction that is the test of the quality of our decisions ... The human cost of the financial crisis has been enormous.  While unemployment is receding in Ireland, it remains too high and the emigration of our young people is a challenge to our future prosperity.  It is clear to us in Ireland that providing opportunity for our young people, and harnessing their talents, will be the true measure of our recovery.</blockquote>On 5 February, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, addressed this House on the youth guarantee.  She requested the Cathaoirleach to arrange another discussion on the issue a few months later to get an update on the progress made by the European Commission.  In light of the conference held in Brussels on Tuesday - which I was fortunate to attend and heard a presentation by the youth guarantee policy co-ordinator for Ireland - it is important to schedule another debate with the Minister on that issue as soon as we can.  <br />Some of the outstanding issues remaining include the starting point for young people who are not registered with public employment services.  Essentially, those young people are effectively disengaged from the mainstream.  As many of us pointed out in the last debate, and as Youth Work Ireland indicated yesterday, the youth guarantee implementation plan does not mention a role for youth organisations.  A footnote on page 15 merely states that the idea could be explored, but that is not acceptable. <br />A number of weeks ago, I travelled to Brussels to meet the youth guarantee policy officer in the Commission.  It was made clear that the editing and alteration of the implementation plan is at the Government's discretion and the Commission will not be making recommendations on it.  It is therefore up to us, having listened to the concerns of those who will be affected by this plan, to lobby the Minister for changes to improve the plan for the young people of Ireland.  <br />As it stands, the plan will not be evaluated until the end of 2015.  Funding for the guarantee is for the period 2014 to 2015, so the evaluation will only be made at the very end which is far too late.  Some of the glaring deficiencies should be remedied now before funding is committed, spent or has expired.  Leaving it until the end of 2015 or beyond is akin to closing the stable door after the horse has bolted.  The youth guarantee will not be as sexy as the PAC, so media outlets will not flock here to listen to the debate.  However, if we do not get this right now there is a danger that it could be a damp squib.  We could have worse social repercussions in future when there will be no point in Members of the Oireachtas scratching their heads about what they could or should have done, when they have the opportunity to do something now.  I ask the Leader to take up the request of the Minister, Deputy Burton, for us to schedule a further discussion on the youth guarantee.</p></speech>

I also want to echo the comments on her dress sense which is something we have had a good few chats about.  In fact, I think we have a dress or two in common.  She is very quirky and cool and I really enjoy her from that point of view, as well as her calm and lovely manner.  She has made me feel extremely welcome and has been a great help when I have been in the Chair.  That was certainly the case at the beginning when I did not have a clue and I still need assistance.  Ms Deirdre Lane will miss her, as we all will.  The Seanad staff in general are a pleasure to work with, but we will especially miss Jody.  I thank her for everything and wish her all the best.<br />Senator van Turnhout said she hoped Ms Blake would come back to provide advice.  I hope she goes off to have a great time, enjoy life and make the best of things.  I hope to see her every now and again, nonetheless. <br />I want to echo what others have said about the President's state visit to the United Kingdom.  He has given thoughtful and eloquent speeches there and I am personally very proud of him.  The results of the visit have been better than I expected and, as others have said, I hope we can build on this in terms of trade.  From an EU perspective I noted the Taoiseach's comments during the week when he gently tried to encourage the UK to think in terms of staying in the EU.  Many of us accept that it would be disastrous if the UK were to leave the EU.  I support Senator Mullins's request for the Leader to ask the T&aacute;naiste to attend the House to discuss how we can build on this state visit.  Even though it is an EU matter, from a Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade viewpoint, we should also discuss the UK's intentions <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the EU.  </p></speech>

I wish to express my gratitude to her, as others have done.  She was the first professional in the Seanad to give me a telephone call after my appointment.  It was her call and she shared her mobile number with me as well, which I was so impressed with because it was over a weekend.  From that moment on, I have consistently felt both her personal support and her extraordinary professional expertise.  She was always at my disposal for the things I needed to learn as a newcomer to politics.  I wish to express my extraordinary gratitude to her for that.</p><p>Together with Ms Deirdre Lane, Jody has also lent her support to the innovation which is the Seanad Public Consultation Committee.  I note her work in that regard which was extra work with no extra resources, yet she rose to the occasion every time as we went about our business.  Only yesterday, Jody was sending out letters to invite organisations to attend our next Seanad consultation process.  Up to the very last moment, she demonstrated her willingness and support in that regard.</p><p>I salute Jody's courage in her recovery.  As I witnessed her return to work, I learned a lot about recovery and one's approach to that, in addition to the healing process and being well.  Once or twice, we shared the great expression from a 14th century mystic Julian of Norwich, that all will be well and all manner of things shall be well.  That is what I wish Jody the most.  I shall miss her, as we all will.</p></speech>

It is hard to believe that she will be leaving here.  I remember before our first day's sitting, when I was new and quite nervous about the Chamber, I was trying to figure it out.  Jody very kindly brought me in and showed me around, so we figured it out.  Ever since then I have always found Jody to be a lovely person apart from being a great source of strength, advice and common sense.  She will be missed here but I certainly wish her all the very best in retirement.</p><p>I wish to welcome the staff and students of Kilrush community school who have just come into the Visitors' Gallery.  They are very welcome.</p></speech>

I hope they have a wonderful experience.  Ms Jody Blake has been very good to other schools coming up here, so it is fitting that this school visit occurred today.</p><p>Today is International Human Rights Day and many human rights issues need to be addressed, including the area of direct provision in particular.  It is 15 years to the day since the direct provision system was established here, but it is broken and is not working.  The Government has failed in its human rights responsibilities concerning this issue.  Millions of our ancestors emigrated around the world and made an indelible contribution to many countries. </p> <p>There are people who find themselves in difficult situations, who are coming to our country now and who, if given the opportunity, I have no doubt, would make an indelible contribution to this country.  I believe these people chose to come to Ireland for refuge because Ireland is a country that prides itself in human dignity.  It is something that needs to be addressed.  I have great hope and faith in the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, because I know the fundamentals are right in terms of where he is coming from on this issue.  I appeal to the Minister to make this a priority.  It is not a vote-winning priority and it is possibly not even a popular priority but it is a right priority and we have responsibilities in this area.  Perhaps at some stage the Leader might be kind enough to organise a debate on direct provision with the Minister in order that we can get the latest up-to-date position and apply the necessary pressure.</p></speech>

I was saddened to hear last week that she would be leaving us today.  As colleagues have already said, when one attends the count in the Members' restaurant Jody and Deirdre are two of the most prominent people one can see.  They conduct their business effectively and efficiently.  In particular, if a candidate is successful it is a very pleasurable experience.  Then, when a Senator comes into the Chamber he gets to know both Deirdre Lane and Jody very well and he soon realises that he is only a Member and that he has absolutely no say in what goes on in the place.  I wish Jody well in her early retirement.  All I can say is that she is a pure lady having worked with her.  I wish her well in whatever she intends to do with the many decades she has left.  As a treat for her I am tempted to call a walk-through vote, if only to see that expression of disapproval on her face one last time.  Perhaps we will do that for her.</p><p>I welcome the Government Whip, Senator Paul Coghlan, back from representing us during part of President Higgins's successful visit to England.</p></speech>

We were indeed proud of our President and country and I hope there will be many more such visits.</p><p>I wish to ask the Leader two things briefly.  I have mentioned on several occasions in the House that mobile telephone coverage has disimproved in recent months.  Will the Leader invite the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, to the House to find out what exactly is going on?  The coverage has been reduced but the cost of making a call or using a telephone has not.  It is nothing to do with more masts being needed because where there was excellent coverage there is now appalling coverage.  There is some reason for that and I would like to know it.  It is causing considerable difficulty for ordinary citizens and businesses and I am keen to get to the bottom of it once and for all.  I call on the Leader to make another attempt to get the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, into the House.</p><p>Will the Leader use his good offices to impress upon the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, the need for him to intervene personally in the dispute that started last Monday between the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland, ASTI, and the Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI, regarding the proposed changes to the junior certificate?  This dispute is not going to go away and it must be resolved.  I am keen to see it resolved sooner rather than later before the people to whom the teachers, the unions and the Minister are there to facilitate and to impart education, namely, the young people, become embroiled in the middle.  I call on the Leader to ask the Minister to intervene at an early stage in this dispute in order that it can be resolved.</p></speech>

I had not realised until today that between Golden and Rathcabbin we have a Tipperary team in the House.  We are losing half of it today but I hope we are not losing it permanently.  I imagine Jody will keep in touch with us after all those years.</p><p>I have been here for 21 years and she was one of the first people I picked up the telephone to when I came to ask for advice.  Between herself and Deirdre we have had great advice and we have heard about it today.  However, it is not only that; it is the sense that she talks and the style that she has shown, and not only the style referred to by Senator Bacik.  Anyway, she adds colour to the Chamber.</p><p>The other thing I have found about Jody is that she was always able to steer us through the difficult times.  Whenever we had challenges, whatever they were, we could go to her for advice.  She gave us advice and she did so with sympathy because she recognised the challenges we had as well.</p><p>I am using this opportunity to thank Jody.  I know her health has not been wonderful in the past year but she seems to be back, healthy and well, vibrant and full of energy.  I do not believe she will retire in the sense that some people use the term.  She has too much vigour, energy and enthusiasm to actually retire.  Whatever her plans are I hope she enjoys them, that she will keep the happy memories that she left here with and that she will have them when she looks back on her days here.  I thank her for those 23 years.</p></speech>

I wish to be associated with all the words of good wishes to Jody.  We had a great chat yesterday between Adjournment matters.  I expressed to her my considerable pride having worked with her and my sense of gratitude on our behalf being a smaller grouping in the Seanad.  One thing Jody always did was look out for the Independents and smaller groupings as well as the big parties, such that everyone got a fair crack of the whip.  It is fair to say is bean uasal amach is amach &iacute; Jody.  She is a quintessential lady and she will be sorely missed.  I, for one, am certainly looking forward to her memoirs once she has left.  I imagine they will be a fantastic read and I hope that they make the bestseller list.<br />I join with the statements made by Senator Conway and Senator van Turnhout this morning around the issue of direct provision.  It is an appalling situation that these people find themselves in.  Today is the anniversary of the setting up of direct provision.  I note that the <i>humanrights.ie</i>website is hosting a blog carnival on direct provision with input from many different people.  I encourage people to have a look at that.<br />Several Senators have been doing work quietly in the background on the issue simply to educate ourselves on direct provision.  We have a cross-party Seanad group on the issue which includes Senators van Turnhout, Conway, Moran, Power, Zappone and Barrett.  We have decided to mark the anniversary today by trying to open up the group as an Oireachtas cross-party group and organise some presentations and information sharing on the issue and try to educate ourselves even more.<br />A related issue concerns a group who find themselves similarly marginalised, namely, the Roma community.  I noted yesterday that I was appalled by some recent journalistic pieces on the Traveller community.  This morning Pavee Point launched three reports on the Roma community in Ireland and the situation they find themselves in.  The reports include an examination of the Roma community from an international aspect, particularly across Europe.  It would be good to debate the situation that the Roma community find itself in from a health perspective, an integration perspective, etc.  Some of the findings of the reports would certainly alarm people in respect of the situation they find themselves in.  A debate around the Roma community, their situation, how we can help to support them, how we can ensure they make the best of their lives in Ireland, how they become fully integrated and how they share with us their great wealth of knowledge, music and culture would be a good thing.</p></speech>

I thank her for her professionalism and courtesy to all of us over the years.  Present company excepted, it is sometimes the fate of politicians around here to be forgotten but not gone.  The opposite will be the case with Jody.  Certainly, she will not be forgotten and we hope to see her as much as possible.  I wish her good health and happiness in the many years ahead.  She became the temporary custodian of a book that was destined for me about the Camino de Santiago de Compostela some years ago.</p> <p>I hope she has an opportunity to explore the delights of that walk at some point.  In the meantime, there is a large 15 county constituency of Midlands-North-West, which has some great walking.  If she has any interest in walking around with me in the coming weeks, I would be delighted and honoured to have her by my side.</p><p>At some point, it would be good to hear from the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, about the operation of the local authority septic tank inspection regime, which is a function of the Environmental Protection Agency.  The deadline for registration was February 2013.  Now that the inspection regime has commenced and many septic tanks are failing the inspection, I have received a number of queries from people who missed the deadline and are concerned they may not qualify for the means-tested grant aid.  Given that a significant number of people missed the deadline, is it possible to extend an amnesty to them?  Many people have crippling financial commitments and face the burden of debt and worries as to how they will meet mortgage payments as new taxes accumulate.  Such persons do not wish to incur expenses of several thousand euro for the remediation of their septic tank facilities.  We should also recall that local authorities were glad to approve planning applications for once-off housing as they could avail of the development charges associated with such houses.  As a large amount of money has been raised through the septic tank registration system, it would be only just to extend the amnesty, should that be needed, to prevent people from being deprived of a grant in cases where they need to repair septic tank systems.  Perhaps the Minister will update the House on the number of inspections that have taken place, the failure rate of such inspections, the average cost for people to adjust and fix their septic tank facilities and whether it would be possible to provide an amnesty to those who missed the first 2013 deadline.</p></speech>

Fianna F&aacute;il Senators are smiling wryly because our party has been fighting this issue for several years.  The latter day conversion of Senator Mullen to the issue may have something to do with his tramping through the highways and byways of 15 rural counties.  I am sure that has been a new experience for the Senator, coming as he does from the leafy suburbs of Dublin 4.</p></speech>

Their visit has given a morale boost to Irish people in Britain and at home.  I also compliment Senator Paul Coghlan, who represented the Seanad yesterday.  I presume he was in the Long Gallery listening to the President's speech.  I had the pleasure of listening to the former Taoiseach, Mr. Ahern, when he spoke there.  Incidentally, he did not give me a ticket, which I obtained through my contacts in the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  The then Taoiseach was not one bit concerned whether I was present.</p></speech>

President Higgins lifted the morale of the diaspora, including the Irish in Britain, and those of us who are at home.  I pay particular tribute to the President's wife, Sabina, who has done an extraordinary job in promoting Irish fashion.  Sometimes the consort is left to one side in these circumstances, but it should be placed on record that she has promoted Irish fashion.  I read yesterday in one of the newspapers that she has been meticulous in ensuring everything she wears is the best of Irish fashion.  It is a wonderful tribute to the President and his wife.

I welcome the Supreme Court judgment in the Callely case, which vindicated the honour of the Seanad.  When there has been time to examine the case, more will be said on the matter in the House.  Yesterday was a good day as it vindicated the Seanad in this matter.</p><p>As it is human rights day, I propose to raise a serious human rights issue which pertains to the Department of Defence.  The Department instituted a ruling in 1994 that recruits had to reach the rank of sergeant in their 21 year term of service or, failing that, they would be automatically removed from the service.  This was an attempt to create efficiencies in the Defence Forces.  The ruling was completed and confirmed in 2006 just before the bubble burst.  An embargo on recruitment introduced almost simultaneously made it very difficult for Defence Forces personnel, even those with 15 or 20 years service, to attain the rank of sergeant.  This was no fault of their own as an embargo was placed on promotion.  The measure amounts to appalling discrimination, particularly as officers have been shown flexibility in this area.</p><p>The lowest paid, most vulnerable and weakest members of the Defence Forces have been treated in a highly arbitrary and callous fashion.  Many of the men and women in question have served the country with distinction in peacekeeping forces, regularly pass fitness tests and are a credit to the country.  They were not advised of this flaw in their contracts and have not been given any skills for civilian employment.  In early middle age, about 500 of them are being forced out of the system, which is wrong and a reproach to the State, particularly given that the age limits were recently extended for commissioned officers.</p><p>I ask that the Leader write to the Minister for Defence requesting that the position be reviewed because it is a gross injustice on young and vulnerable people, many of whom have mortgages and families to support.  They are being thrown onto the market without being provided with any skills by the Defence Forces.  This is wrong and I hope the House will register a strong protest or have a short debate on the issue.  Will the Leader ask the Minister to come to the House and answer questions about the treatment of people who serve our country with great bravery and distinction?</p></speech>

We accept that Ireland needs a very strong regulatory system to maintain a high quality standard of building for family homes.  I am sure the Minister will clarify the matter, but it appears the proposed statutory instrument is a response to the Priory Hall debacle.  I do not mean in any to take away from the hurt and pain experienced by those living in Priory Hall and I have welcomed the swift response of Government.  However, I wonder if the Minister is aware of the potential devastation the regulations will cause in rural Ireland.<br />It may sound like hyperbole, but I sat with a man in the last couple of weeks who has spent his entire life in the building industry.  He has worked as a draftsman and been involved in the planning, design and execution of many one-off houses and small developments in towns and villages in County Leitrim.  His family and income will be wiped out as a result of the regulations.  He instanced to me a recent example where a young man in a rural part of the county decided he wanted to build an extension to the family home following his recent marriage.  He and his father were to carry out the building work.  He has been told he cannot do that.  Under the regulations, he will have to employ an architect and a person who is legally obliged to sign off on the building.  He will also have to employ registered labour.  The estimated extra cost of the exercise is between &euro;40,000 and &euro;50,000.  That is what I mean when I refer to the potential devastation of rural Ireland.<br />The example I have set out is typical of what will happen as a side-effect of the regulations, which seem to have been introduced to address a primarily urban issue.  The potential difficulties they will cause in rural Ireland have been neglected and ignored completely.  It comes on top of every other decision the Government has taken on rural Ireland, although I will not go into the litany now.  When the people go to vote in next month's elections, I wonder if they will continue to be sleep-walked into believing the Government is considering their best interests.  The decisions that have been taken by the Government on rural Ireland have not been in the best interest of the people who live there.  If the Minister disagrees with me, I would like him to explain how the regulations will not place an unnecessary financial burden on many people who will be involved in one-off houses or extensions such as the one I referred to.  A further example is where someone has a residence which has not been properly processed and now seeks retention permission from the local authority.  While the local authority might - and it is a big might - grant the permission, the house cannot be sold by the family in future as it will not be insured.  As the local authority will be aware of the potential risk in this regard, it is likely it will reject the retention application.  The only option left for the family or individual is demolition.<br />I understand that local authorities are not geared up to take the new regulations into account and are reluctant to get involved in this area.  They do not have the necessary resources or will to take on much of what the Minister plans to implement in the proposed statutory instrument.  To recap, I note - allowing for the usual exemptions - that anyone who wishes to build anything will be required by law to employ an assigned professional engineer, architect or surveyor to inspect the property.  Does the Minister know how many people there are in Leitrim who could sign off on this?  There are two, one of whom I know is reluctant to be involved in this area at all.  That person has other business and does not want to get involved in this.  The regulations will place a hefty and disproportionate financial burden on one-off housing in the countryside.  I understand that the inevitable increase in building costs has been recognised by the Department but no action has been taken.<br />There has been no public information campaign, leading to speculation about the consequences of changes which may harm the construction sector.  The level of resources being provided to local authorities to handle the deluge of information and paperwork that will result from the new system is questionable.  Perhaps the Minister has a view on foot of his relationship with local authorities.</p> <p>Perhaps the Minister has a view on his relationship with the local authorities.  Even someone who understands every technology installed in the building would have to be on-site full time monitoring every building activity to make the claim on the certificate and this will increase costs.</p><p>They may have a broader impact on insurance.  The warranty is potentially uninsurable as it relies on warranting the work of a third party without any concession to the principle of reasonable inspection.  There needs to be a broader suite of measures to enhance the protection of building standards to make sure all construction is up to scratch and to avoid the worst excesses of the boom time building.  We propose that there should be a national building inspectorate examining at least 40% of the buildings under construction, a system of licensing or registration of builders and information on builders should be shared among the relevant local authorities with full prosecutions of any designers or contractors who are negligent in their duties.  We have other proposals and Senator &Oacute;'Domhnaill will expand on them.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister.  While we fundamentally support the need for a stricter building regime to make sure what occurred in Priory Hall never happens again, such a regime cannot be put in place if it means people will be unable to afford building a house on their own land.  The broad brush approach used by this statutory instrument endeavours to treat large scale developments in the same way as one-off rural houses and that is wrong.  Senator Mooney highlighted the position in County Leitrim but it is the same in every rural county where people want to live in their baile fearainn or townland.  It is estimated that the new regulation, which the Minister signed into force on 1 March, will increase the self-build costs for individuals who want to build one-off houses by approximately 25%.  Senator Mooney mentioned a sum of between &euro;40,000 and &euro;50,000.  It is amusing that while the regulation applies to one-off houses, multi-unit developments and agriculture sheds, hospitals and schools may be exempt.  Will the Minister address this?  The words "may be" are used in the statutory instrument.  Why is that the case?</p><p>A promise was made to carry out a regulatory impact analysis on this measure.  Was that done?  If not, why not?</p><p>Anyone wishing to carry out any building work from now on, with a number of exceptions, must by law employ an assigned professional - an engineer, architect or surveyor - to inspect the property on-site.  An owner who intends to self-build and who contracts elements of the work to various parties must assume legal responsibility for ensuring the building or works concerned will comply with the requirements of the Second Schedule to the building regulations.  The new regime will require an owner to assign a competent registered professional to certify the design prior to commencement and to inspect the works during construction.</p><p>The other issue is a person cannot build his or her own house because the person taking responsibility to sign off on the development must be a builder.  For example, I supervised the building of my own house, as many people from rural farming backgrounds have done down through the generations, but I would be precluded from doing that now because the house would have to be signed off by a builder and an architect.  That will result in difficulties and increased costs.</p><p>There are major anomalies in this regulation.  We have several alternative proposals, which include a national register, a broader suite of measures, a national building inspectorate and a national register of inspections abd prosecutions.  It must be ensured there is a score against the performance of anyone registered is a builder.  If the regulation remains in place, ordinary people in rural Ireland will be faced with two scenarios: having to pay an additional cost to build their own house to employ the services of professionals or to take the easy option and live in a town or city.  That will drive another nail into rural Ireland.</p></speech>

The previous speakers have confused SI 105 with another statutory instrument.  SI 105 deals specifically with compliance and applies to a limited range of publicly owned buildings.  Self-build and private builds are not covered by it.  I am a member of the environmental committee, which dealt with building control regulations.  I have become well acquainted with the subject over the past 18 months and it has been a learning curve.  The Fennelly report makes good recommendations and the changes that are being implemented are intended to strengthen building controls and, most important, to protect consumers.  The emphasis placed by the Minister on consumer protection throughout Bills, statutory instruments and regulations is paramount and he should be commended for that.</p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il Members say they want regulations, certification and so on but it is a bit like &quot;Make me holy but not yet&quot;.  There is a great deal of scaremongering as well similar to during the debate on septic tanks about how many thousands of euro they would cost, which was not the case.</p><p>The new building control regulations had to be implemented because of the legacy of a poorly regulated and non-existent inspection regime during the housing boom.  We are well aware of the unacceptable cases that have been highlighted in recent years.  Consumers were crying out for more stringent regulations and certification systems.  Unfortunately, there were not in place and many residents were left in, at best, shoddy living conditions and, at worst, dangerous conditions.  This should not be accepted in a developed country and the Minister has acted to introduced amendments to the legislation.  This statutory instrument applies to a limited range of public and privately owned buildings.</p><p>I was a member of a local authority for 20 years.  I want to ensure the Minister will look into the issue of inspections.  Such inspections place an additional onus on local authorities.  The Minister has stated in the past that the Department will continue to work with all concerned to ensure local authorities understand their obligations and take the steps necessary to meet them.</p> <p>I would like the Minister to comment on that.  It is important that the local authorities be facilitated and that they be able, ready and willing to carry out the stipulated duties.  The alternative need of compliance applies to a limited number of buildings.</p><p>On the self-build projects that the Minister mentioned, there has been a lot of speculation in the media.  I have received queries on the perceived increased cost and the new regulations. On having done some research, I understand there is no change at all in the technical performance standards that a newly finished home must meet.  The statutory obligations that currently exist in a self-build scenario are not new.  They already apply under the Building Control Act 1990.  I ask the Minister to confirm that the result of my research is true.</p><p>As before, buildings must be built in accordance with the building regulations.  The change that will occur is in the certification costs outlined.  I do not know where the additional building cost arises but I am not a builder.  It has been stated there is an additional cost but I do not believe there is one.  Certification, if carried out properly, competently-----</p></speech>

Panic reactions are never much use.  The measure under discussion will not protect the consumer.  Why has the Government found it necessary to exempt some of its own developments?</p><p>I, too, have received a lot of correspondence, including from two people who were presidents of the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, RIAI.  One is president of the Architects' Council of Europe, an RIAI council member since last January and an honorary member of the American, Russian and German architectural institutes, and was a member of the Government's building regulations advisory body from 2000 to 2007.  The members of the architects association voted 500 to eight that this was a dangerous proposal.  We seek its annulment.</p><p>It is not just a question of rural matters.  However, they are significant.  Requiring a competent builder to be appointed closes down the centuries-old tradition that flourishes in rural areas and still flourishes in well-regulated countries such as the United Kingdom and Sweden.  It does nothing for the new house buyer except set up an artificial paper trail.  Self-certification does not work, will not work, has never worked and should be withdrawn.</p><p>Two sectors, in particular, are affected by the proposal.  One is the contract building sector and the other, which will actually be protected by the proposal, is the very speculative sector that brought this country to its knees.  The new building regulation, SI 9, creates a new bureaucratic and untried system for the industry.  It is 27 pages long and there is no requirement that the Building Control Authority should inspect either the information to be lodged or the work on-site.  How practical is that?  The certificate of compliance must be validated and registered by the Building Control Authority before the building is opened, used or occupied.</p><p>The nub of the matter, which I would like the Minister to take very clearly on board, is that there is no provision for a retention fund, as there was in the past.  How is this protecting the consumer?  There is no provision for a defects list and remedial works 12 months after completion.  I refer to the checklist we all know about.  Anybody who has bought a house will have got a checklist from the builder.  The sensible, successful system developed over almost 200 years and which has served the country well has been abandoned with regard to the vast majority of buildings for a system that is close to the discredited one used by speculative builders.  That is the problem.</p><p>There is another really dangerous element.  The certificate does not contemplate the existence of fraud, dishonesty, fraudulent concealment, defects or omissions that a reasonable inspection would not have disclosed.  In addition, the architect used to be able to rely on the advice of consultants.  The SI certificates hold the certifier to be solely responsible.  We are actually to criminalise architects.  This may happen because of a bureaucratic delay within the system.  The Minister is shaking his head but this is what I am advised.</p></speech>

This is what debating in the Seanad is all about.</p><p>Legal opinion holds that the SI 9 ancillary certificates furnished by consultants and contractors cannot be relied on.  There is no protection for the architects, therefore.  The certificates do not have let-out clauses for fraud, dishonesty or concealment.  In other words, an honest professional architect could be trapped by dishonesty and become a criminal as a result.  The SI 9 certificates must be issued without provision for a defects liability period, a retention fund or continuing architectural authority to deal with post-completion problems.</p><p>Anybody who has bought a house, particularly a new one, will know that a certain amount is held back from the builder, thus protecting the consumer.  The defects list must be completed and certified within a year.  That system is gone, which is mad.  Senator C&aacute;it Keane, an old friend of mine and a very valued contributor to this House, made the point, probably on Government instruction, that this protects the consumer.  I have pointed out that it does not and actually brings us back towards the very speculative behaviour that created the difficulty we are in.</p><p>I am very glad Fianna F&aacute;il has learned from the mistakes and disasters in which this House was complicit.  A few people, particularly my former Seanad colleague, Joe O'Toole, were continually sending warning signals about this.  I supported the former Senator.  I am very worried about the impact of the introduction of the regulation.</p><p>I will finish on a point I believe is significant.  If the Government introduces regulations and then exempts some of its own operations from them, there is something pretty fishy about it.</p></speech>

I know that in order to protect the consumer, all those who take an active part in the construction process should be assessed on their own merits and within their own competence and then regulated as necessary.  The building control regulations zone in on the very essence of architectural technology, namely, building regulations but I do not think they see a role for those who are trained and experienced in that area.  I know it is felt that the skill set of the architectural technologist, while relevant to the construction industry and more importantly, in terms of the building regulations, is outside the terms of the current Act.  As a result, the situation of architectural technologists, while alluded to in the Act, is not adequately catered for.  In order to play a lead in this new regime, professional architectural technologists who have many decades of experience in that area must now deny their primary qualifications in architectural technology, claim to be either architects or building surveyors and seek entry into those statutory registers.  I think the Minister said that those who have been operating within the scope of the Act should now declare themselves architects or building surveyors and submit to registration in those fields.  It is felt that this is deeply flawed and will lead to many unsuccessful applications and many problems for the Department.  To present it as a solution to those faced with retraining or an exit from their profession is far worse.</p><p>Based on my understanding, professional architectural technologists carry out some, but not always all, of the duties of architects or building surveyors.  They do so on the basis of multiple shared competences.  Such individuals possess varying degrees of academic training but with a very different focus than either of the regulated professions.  While many architectural technologists will have completed a wide variety of construction projects on the basis of their qualifications or as part of the team, it is often without the necessity of using any of the protected titles so there would be a reluctance on their part to make a declaration regarding the breadth of their duties in comparison with those of an architect or a building surveyor on foot of the scope of the services they have provided.  </p><p>I am raising this issue because time is a major factor given that in May 2014, two years after the public consultation on the matter will have ended, another raft of architectural technology graduates will enter the employment market with no defined role or context under the legislation.  Again, we will see another intake into the same cycle in September.  Could the Minister tell me whether we will give consideration to providing a direct route for these architectural technologists?</p></speech>

This requirement is one of a number of reforms to the regulatory process for the oversight of building control activity originally signed into law in March 2013 which came into operation with some modification on 1 March 2014.</p><p>I am not surprised that my colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il are against these provisions because after 14 years, they did nothing about it.  There have been very serious and important developments over the past number of years which go to the heart of why this Government is trying to put the consumer first.  I am taking a bit of latitude to address some of the issues that were raised in respect of other statutory instruments.  These regulations have been the subject of consultation for the past two years.  People in the business knew that these were coming down the track on 1 March 2014.  The alternative means of compliance, SI 105, applies to a limited range of public and privately owned buildings classified that as first, second or third-level places of education; hospitals; or primary care centres.  I will explain what an alternative means of compliance is.  It only applies to projects subject to each of the following circumstances: planning permission, where applicable, has been obtained before 1 March 2014; contract documents have been signed before 1 November 2014; and a valid commencement notice has been lodged with the building control authority no later than 1 March 2015.</p><p>The background to the making of the regulation we are discussing arose in the lead up to the implementation on 1 March 2014 of the new building control requirements.  The Minister for Education and Science wrote to me asking that SI 9 of 2014 be deferred by at least 12 months to avoid delays to the school building programme.  It would be very remiss of me if I slowed down the public capital programme in any way because I did not take a pragmatic view and draw up an alternative means of compliance.  My Department immediately raised the matter with relevant Departments and agencies represented on the Government contracts committee for construction, GCCC.  Several Departments and agencies, including the Department of Education and Skills, the National Development Finance Agency and the HSE, were concerned the new requirements might delay the public capital programme.  Large-scale public projects, in particular, are prone to costly delays and strict national and EU procurement rules do not allow the same room for manoeuvre as with comparable private sector projects.  Other agencies, notably the OPW, reported that the necessary arrangements were in place to administer contracts in line with the new requirements.  On this basis, I made SI 105 of 2014 to allow for an alternative means of compliance for a limited range of public or privately owned buildings along the lines I have just already outlined.  The regulations are administered by an oversight group that is already in place and composed of registered construction professionals from the public sector and private industry.</p><p>The sole accommodation given is an alternative means of compliance with the inspection and certification requirements fulfilled by the assigned certifier.  The other new regulatory requirements - certified design, lodgement of compliance documentation, validation and registration of relevant notices and certificates - continue to apply to all projects availing of the provisions of this particular statutory instrument.  SI 105 of 2014 does not therefore amount to a deferral or a derogation.  Public sector projects always involve inspection and certification requirements and compliance with building regulations is not negotiable.  The House might be interested to know that 250 commencement notices have been lodged under the new regulatory requirements since 1 March 2014, which suggests that the new arrangements for building control are already working fairly well in practice.  I will come back to some of these as they have been raised.  Clearly, the concerns raised in respect of implementation did not warrant a deferral even though I can assure the House that I came under a lot of pressure to defer them.  When I make these decisions, I usually implement them unlike others who want to defer everything.  </p><p>While relatively few projects will avail of the alternative means of compliance provided for in SI 105 of 2014, it nevertheless provides a useful safeguard against contracting authorities being held to ransom by consultants or contractors who may seek to delay a major project citing the new arrangements for building control for their own personal gain.  I did not want to see a blockage in the system that would allow that to happen.  To annul SI 105 of 2014, therefore, makes no sense.  </p><p>I will return to matters that have been raised in the wider debate.  In respect of self-certification, people involved in self building have been consulted all along.  The organisation that allegedly represents them certainly did not make any particularly strong submission to suggest that these regulations should not be introduced in the interests of the consumer.  I would have thought that whoever is building a house, which is the largest investment in a person's life, will want the highest level of professionalism in order to sign off on these matters.  Direct labour will continue the way it always have.  A person does not need a registered contractor.  Contrary to what Senators might have been told, it just applies to new builds and does not apply to extensions under 400 square feet or refurbishment.  I know what Senator Mooney is probably getting at.  There is a limited number of people in some counties who have been worried for a considerable period of time that they would be taken out of this business because of the new regulations we are bringing in on a national level.  I have brought in new regulations to deal with that whereby the route to become a member of a professional body is being eased considerably.  They have had a difficult experience in the past when applying to the Royal Institute of Architects but they can also apply to the professional bodies such as Engineers Ireland or the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland.  </p> <p>If people become registered members of those bodies, they can undertake the necessary certification or be classified as assigned certifiers.  I encourage draftsmen, some of whom I know well in my constituency, to apply to the registered bodies.  The technical assessment route was quite expensive and could have cost up to &euro;15,000 just to apply to the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland, RIAI.  I have taken that issue on board and discussed it and others at length with the registered bodies.  I have asked the chairman of the admissions appeals board, Mr. Garrett Fennell, to do a report.  This is signalled and on the website.  Many recommendations could be made to make it easier for people to register with the professional bodies and allow them to continue their work.  They have built up a great deal of case work over the years.  That work can be taken into account when registering.</p><p>I am conscious of the fact that professional bodies have not been good at accepting applications in a way that helped people into the system.  Some of them have set up exclusion zones.  I will continually monitor that situation to ensure that the recommendations of the Fennell report are implemented so as to reduce the cost considerably and to take account of people's case work in the technical assessment route to registration.</p><p>I am also monitoring what implementing these regulations will cost self-builds and direct labour.  Many professional bodies have made outlandish quotations in my constituency and around the country.  I will not allow any professional body to view this as an easy way of engaging in financial extortion of people in rural Ireland who wish to build their own houses through direct labour by seeking extraordinary amounts of money to certify compliance with SI 9 of 2014.  I assure the House that, for the first time since the Act was passed in 1990, everything possible is being done to ease the burden on people who wish to comply with the regulations or become members of the registered bodies, having built up experience in the construction business, particularly during the boom times.</p><p>For the first time, there is a chain of responsibility in the consumer's interests.  From the beginning to the end, a consumer will know that he or she will get a much better deal in terms of mandatory certification of the work done.  Anyone who gets a mortgage from a financial institution requires sign-off from an architect, engineer or chartered surveyor, be one's property a self-build or an urban development.  A number of examples involving costs and insufficient numbers to make the market for quotations in particular areas competitive, particularly as regards self-builds, have come to my attention.  I will monitor them carefully.</p><p>Senator Reilly mentioned a number of valid issues, for example, architectural technologists.  The Building Control Act 2007 provides for the registration of persons entitled to use the professional title of &quot;architect and building surveyor&quot;.  The title of &quot;chartered engineer&quot; is protected by separate legislation, but the registration of title is necessary in order to protect consumers from unqualified persons passing themselves off as construction professionals.  The best interests of the consumer should be our starting point.  Unqualified persons passing themselves off as construction professionals is now less likely to occur, as the statutory certificates required for building control purposes must be given by registered professionals following the regulations that have come into effect.</p><p>The profession of architectural technologist is unregulated in Ireland.  Any such person who possesses the requisite competence in design and construction may seek inclusion on the statutory register.  It has been brought to my attention that a number of chartered architectural technologists have succeeded in becoming registered architects or building surveyors in recent times.  It is a question of having the confidence in the new arrangements to re-apply.  If someone does not succeed, he or she can appeal that decision.  I have put in place all of the appeals bodies that were lying dormant when I became Minister so as to ensure that people who believe they have the professional competence can become registered under the relevant bodies.</p><p>I am surprised that Senator Norris would take the side of a vested interest - the RIAI - and believe everything it told him.  The majority of architects are not against these proposals.  In fact, the majority are in favour of them.  Some media speculation may have misconstrued the situation.  The former president of the RIAI, Ms Michelle Fagan, is on the oversight group that is monitoring these regulations and has come out in their support.  I am surprised that people are taking a certain view about the concerns expressed by the RIAI, Engineers Ireland, the Society of Chartered Surveyors and so on.  These concerns have been part and parcel of the discussions for two years and bodies have had plenty of opportunity to make a case and comment on the regulations.  Indeed, they have been changed a number of times.  If people want to support a closed shop mentality, that is their business, but I am coming from the point of view of the consumer.  As Senator Power mentioned, we do not want to revert to the days of Priory Hall.  There are many Priory Halls around the country where a coach and four were driven through our modest regulations and professionals - architects in particular - signed off on buildings as matters of opinion rather than as part of a mandatory certification and chain of responsibility process.</p></speech>

I am delighted to have been in a position to change the regulations in the interests of the consumer and to rid ourselves once and for all of the shoddy development that passed for good development in the past ten or 15 years.  I make no apologies to the professional bodies for doing so.</p><p>The Building Control Act has not changed, but the regulations have.  They are much stronger and more robust.  Senator Mooney raised a nonsense about &euro;40,000.  It was the same with the septic tanks, which were supposed to cost &euro;20,000.  People have not even applied for grants yet, as they can comply with the septic tank regulations on the basis of desludging.  This point came out in the recent EPA report.  The scaremongering does not reflect the real world.  It might be fine for political purposes, but &euro;40,000 is nowhere near the real world figure I am expecting.  Taking account of the new regulations, people should be able to do this for a modest average of approximately &euro;3,000 in rural Ireland.  I aspire to ensure this is the case, particularly where, as the Senator rightly pointed out, only a few people in some areas are registered with a statutory body.</p><p>I will not apologise to anyone for amending these regulations over a two-year period.  People have had sufficient time.  We have taken a practical approach to ensuring that the customer comes first, and it is about time.</p></speech>

He went to the core of the issues that I raised, which were primarily based on an individual in my county whom I know and who outlined to me the impact of these regulations countywide.  I stand over the figure that the individual provided of just two people in the county being eligible to sign off on work.</p><p>I am particularly heartened by the Minister's attitude towards the professional bodies and by his assurance that he will monitor them so that they do not take advantage of the regulations.  The figure of &euro;40,000 to &euro;50,000 was given to me by the individual concerned based on his assessment.  I did not pluck it out of the air and I used it in good faith.  It was the cost to a father and son who were building a house extension in a rural area of County Leitrim.  I was given to understand that they would have to register as builders, but I hope I heard the Minister correctly when he stated that this would not be the case.  That is reassuring.</p> <p> My party and I fully support the overall thrust of what the Minister has said about shoddy development and the need to tighten up the regulations.  I graciously acknowledge that is part of what he has been doing in this regard.  I hope it will ensure that many of the bad examples of that nature that Senator Landy and others outlined will never happen again.  What is the usual reaction when we see images from other parts of the world of buildings that have collapsed as a result of natural disasters in the Far East, for example?  It is usually because of shoddy development, poor building regulations, etc.  We never want that visited on this country and I applaud the Minister for having done that.</p><p>The core of what I am saying is that there are upwards of 500 professionals in this country who will be affected by this.  This applies to my county.  That is the figure I have been given and it seems to have been widely disseminated in this debate.  I am heartened by what the Minister said.  I got some indication that he was thinking along those lines to ensure there would be an ease of passage for those people and for the individual I am talking about who genuinely believes that his livelihood will be impaired.  I do not want to single out anybody in particular, but Senator Keane knows who I am talking about because she met the individual concerned.  I hope she gave him some comfort and reassurance in this regard because he will be out of work.  She will know this because he put those arguments to her in very good faith.</p></speech>

I hope the Minister will continue to monitor that.  From our side of the House, we will be looking at it to ensure that is the case and that the professional bodies do not ride roughshod over such good people who have been providing a very valuable service for decades without any complaint.  The Minister said he knows of similar people in his county.  I hope he will be strongly influenced by that to ensure those people can continue to earn a livelihood.</p></speech>

I acknowledge, as I have done previously, the progress that has been made in the establishment of the Pyrite Remediation Board since I published my Bill two years ago.  I believe there is still an issue regarding amending the Statute of Limitations.  One of the recommendations in the report the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government commissioned was to amend the Statute of Limitations so that it would start from the day a householder received a confirmed test and reading that his or her home was affected by pyrite.</p><p>I have raised this with the Pyrite Remediation Board at meetings in the Custom House.  While I commend what the board is doing, I believe this would add to the process and would certainly give more protection for those who have not yet sought to take a legal case, in many instances because they cannot afford it.  For them the Statute of Limitations could run out and the purpose of the Bill is to amend the Statute of Limitations in this instance, so that the clock would start from the date of a confirmed pyrite test.</p><p>I hope the Minister will accept the Bill and allow it to pass Second Stage.  I do not claim it is perfect, but allowing it to go to Committee Stage would assist in the process.  Will the Minister be in a position to respond at the end of this debate?</p></speech>

There may be some imperfections that can be addressed on Committee Stage.  This is one additional element on top of the work that has been done by the Minister and the Pyrite Remediation Board to allow further protection for people whose homes have been badly damaged by pyritic heave.  The problem gets worse the longer the issue is left not addressed.  Some people may not be aware that they have pyrite at this stage.</p><p>I recommend that the Minister would accept the Bill on Second Stage.  I am in constant contact with the PRB.  Perhaps the Department could publish a statement outlining the progress in processing the applications received by the board.</p></speech>

An example in this regard is Skerries Educate Together national school, on which I will provide some background.  The school opened in 1 September 2008 with 34 pupils enrolled.  There are now 234 pupils attending the school and it is expected that by 2014 there will be 460 pupils enrolled at the school.  The school serves the greater Skerries-Balbriggan-Balrothery-Lusk-Rush area and is a busy school.  The Minister of State may be familiar with the Fingal schools model whereby the council sources land from developers, a school is constructed and then passed on to the Department of Education and Skills, which has been very successful.  </p><p>While Skerries Educate Together is going well, there is a major road safety issue at the school.  The school has requested on a number of occasions of Fingal County Council that a traffic warden and fully accessible crossing point, similar to those provided at other schools, be provided at the school.  The school caters for children from five years upwards.  However, the council response has been that this location was examined on a number of occasions and it was noted that the area immediately adjacent to the school is in private ownership and the school warden service is not provided by the council on private lands.  I hope we will not have to wait for a tragic accident at the school before this matter is dealt with.    </p><p>The principal and board of management at the school have been in contact with the developer of the adjacent site, who, with the council, has been endeavouring to have the road taken in charge.  I will provide my notes on this to the Minister of State later.  I am using Skerries Educate Together as an example of similar situations at other schools around the country.  The council will not even have proper road markings put in place around the school.  The owner of the road cannot understand the reason the council will not take it in charge.  The school now finds itself in the position of being unable to provide for the safety of its pupils due to circumstances beyond its control.  It is not in a position to compel the council to take the road in charge.  The matter is now left up in the air.  While the school fund-raised to pay for road markings, it is unable to have this done because the work is not covered by the insurance of the owner of the road.</p><p>In the local authority's view, this is not its problem.  I have written to the Department, which has stated that it cannot do anything even though the issue is one of safety of pupils at school.  I have given the example of Skerries Educate Together national school.  As I said, there are other schools in similar situations.  I believe a directive on this matter needs to issue from either the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government or the Department of Education and Skills.  Surely the safety of school children is paramount and the council should be directed to take the road in charge, perhaps by way of a caretaker's agreement initially while the outstanding issues are being dealt with, and to appoint a school warden and put in place a crossing point to ensure the safety of the children.  </p><p>I hope I have adequately outlined the issue which is prevalent in Skerries and at many other schools across the country.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's response.</p></speech>

I know from my experience at local government level for many years that there are always issues in regard to taking in charge, etc..  The local authority needs to be certain it will not ultimately be held responsible for obvious defects and in this regard needs to sort out all of the issues before taking roads, etc., in charge.  As stated by the Senator, this is not an issue for the Department of Education and Skills but more appropriately the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  However, local authorities cannot simply wash their hands of the need to address safety issues, which in this instance happens to relate to a school but could well be in relation to access to a housing estate and so on.</p><p>I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, who thanks the Senator for raising this matter.  In regard to sites for new school provision, of which many have been built owing to the increase in our population, which is good for all of us, there are a range of factors which are taken into account in assessing the suitability of a particular site, including safe access, traffic management and mobility issues.  Considerations include safe circulation on the school grounds, such as appropriate provision for school buses, pedestrian and bicycle access, staff and visitor parking, car set down and pick up provision and also safe access to the grounds. </p><p>With regard to the site layout and road safety provisions, safety in accessing the school by road can be improved by managing the traffic away from the routes used by schoolchildren, promoting diversity of modes of transport to reduce vehicular congestion and the provision of traffic calming measures.  I acknowledge this is not always possible where there is only one entrance to a school.  Access roads to school sites are governed by the planning requirements set by the local authority.  This is the situation regardless of whether or not the road is subsequently taken in charge by the local authority or remains in the ownership of the third party on whose lands it has been constructed. </p><p>As part of the planning process, the design team engaged to design the school site layout consults with the relevant local authority.  It is a matter for the relevant local authority as part of the statutory planning process to set out its requirements in relation to the provision of appropriate road safety measures.  In most cases, the preplanning consultations would identify issues such road signage or traffic calming measures which the local authority might require to be incorporated into the design and construction of the access roads.  Like the Senator, I am surprised this was not done in this instance.  In those instances, the Department of Education and Skills would take the requirements of the local authority into account when making the application for planning permission for the project.  Similarly, where a local authority conditions certain elements of a road design or additional infrastructure to deal with health and safety concerns or to facilitate pedestrian or cycle access, the Department would, in all instances, comply with such conditions. </p><p>In regard to the Senator's concerns about the health and safety of a school community he should advise the school to contact the planning and building unit of the Department of Education and Skills to discuss those concerns.  I agree with the Senator that this is also an issue for the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. </p></speech>

I did try to be more specific in the motion tabled but it can be difficult to have adjournment matters selected if they are too specific.  As requested, I will provide the Minister of State with the details and will take up the matter with the building control unit.  The Minister of State outlined in her reply the guidelines in regard to what needs to be governed in planning terms in regard to the location of a school.  In this instance, the local authority has not done its job properly.  It has now an opportunity to rectify this.  At the very least, it should give priority to this matter, particularly as what is involved is the safety of children.</p></speech>

Traditionally, people who cut seaweed do so on a particular strip of the foreshore, which is not then cut by any other person.  The old Irish saying, "spite feamainne" was used when rows broke out because some people had cut into other people's strips on the foreshore, etc.</p><p>I am aware of recent media reports of letters being sent by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to people who are cutting seaweed indicating that in future they will require licences to do so.</p> <p>This is a new occurrence and seaweed cutters are wondering why this has begun to happen.  In addition, people have been examining the issue and they noticed that a number of companies have applied to the Department for licences.  According to my research, four different applications are in train at the moment: one in Donegal; one from Arramara Teoranta, which covers the shoreline from Belmullet in County Mayo down to Clare; and two others, one of which affects Clew Bay and the other affects some limited seaweed cutting in Connemara.<br />In the last week, the seaweed cutters have organised two public meetings in Connemara which were attended by big crowds.  Quite a few elected representatives were also there.  The seaweed cutters are concerned that their livelihoods will be affected by any changes that may come forward.  There have been questions over the legality of cutting.  We know that the foreshore itself is in the ownership of the State, so where do people stand who may have a folio stating that they own part of the foreshore?  Does the latter group have different rights to those who only cut and sell seaweed to the factories?  People were seeking clarification of those issues.<br />In a broader scenario, people are also concerned that Arramara Teoranta, which is a State-owned company under the auspices of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, is being sold off as a State asset.  We understand that negotiations are going on with a Canadian company that wishes to by it.  The seaweed cutters are concerned that a licence regime is being introduced whereby Arramara Teoranta will get the licence which will then be sold on to the private Canadian company.  We will therefore be selling off seaweed cutting rights to a private entity.  The cutters are worried that in those circumstances they will not have much control over when, where and how the seaweed can be cut, as well as the price involved.<br />There are genuine concerns about this matter all along the west coast, so I would welcome any clarification the Minister can give us on the legal situation.  Where do people stand legally if they own a folio which says they have a legal right to the foreshore <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>those who do not have such a right but cut generally on the foreshore?</p></speech>

The Department plays a role in regulating the harvesting of wild seaweed and it is necessary to ensure that this valuable resource is managed appropriately both to ensure it remains sustainable and that the marine environment is protected.</p><p>The Foreshore Act 1933 prohibits the removal of beach material from any area of the foreshore.  The definition of &quot;beach material&quot; in the Act includes seaweed whether growing or rooted on the seashore, or deposited or washed up by the action of tides, winds or waves.  Seaweed that has been washed above the high water mark no longer belongs to the State.  Under the Act, individuals or companies seeking to harvest wild seaweed from the foreshore require a foreshore licence from the Department.  The legislative requirement to hold a foreshore licence for seaweed harvesting has existed since the enactment of the Foreshore Act in 1933. </p><p>I understand, however, that folio rights also may exist in certain cases and that deeds to privately-owned land adjacent to the foreshore may in some instances grant limited harvesting rights.  The Department is seeking advice on how such rights interact with the legislation.  It is worth clarifying, however, that the vast majority of foreshore is owned by the State and that continuing access to the foreshore by individuals does not lead to any ownership rights.  While private individuals may have been taking seaweed in small quantities for personal use, harvesting large quantities which might damage the seaweed crop in a particular area or have adverse effects on the marine environment, is something that Ireland needs to avoid. </p><p>Seaweed is a valuable resource and, in recent years, has become a growth industry.  Seaweed is now also being used as an ingredient in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, fertilisers, organic food and animal health supplements.  A number of foreshore licence applications for seaweed harvesting have been received by the Department and are currently under assessment.  These applications vary considerably and are made by both individual and commercial harvesters.  All foreshore licence applications are subject to a public consultation process and any person may submit comments to the Department.</p><p>As well as being an economic resource, it should be remembered that living seaweed acts as an important habitat for marine and coastal species, and can provide spawning and nursery grounds for many species. </p><p>Applications are therefore assessed in the context of the relevant regulatory framework, including any nature conservation obligations.  The Minister is acutely aware of the need to prevent the over-exploitation of this valuable resource.  The regulation of seaweed harvesting under the Foreshore Act facilitates the sustainable management of the resource.</p><p>Ireland's foreshore is a national asset and it is essential that seaweed harvesting on the foreshore is cognisant of the need to protect the foreshore for present and future generations.  The sustainable management of Ireland's wild seaweed resources is the focus of the Department's efforts in licensing this activity.</p><p>The specific issue of seaweed harvesting licensing is currently under review in the context of the forthcoming marine area and foreshore (amendment) Bill.  The issues raised today will form part of that review.  While I have provided some answers for the Senator, there are also a few things about which we will need to get further information in order to have them clarified.  </p></speech>

I ask her to relay to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government our desire to be updated on the legal advice he is getting.  It is an emotive issue for the people involved.  Can the Minister, Deputy Hogan, also take on board the wishes of the local community as expressed by 200 people at two local meetings in Connemara at the weekend?  They want to maintain a fair trade role if possible whereby cutters will have a role in the industry and the selling rights, be it through a co-operative or otherwise.  Those rights should not be given over to a private company which could dictate to the cutters who will, thus, have no control over their own industry.  I would appreciate it if the Minister of State could pass those comments on to the Minister.</p></speech>

In fact, it is the most serious matter that has ever come to my attention.  I am not raising it lightly and it is causing me serious distress and anxiety.  I ask the Minister to immediately call to task the Environmental Protection Agency over its lax oversight and light touch regulation of the ongoing and long-running unlicensed, unregulated, potentially harmful and hazardous open-vent emissions from the Enva waste oil recycling plant in Portlaoise.  This is happening despite a litany of public complaints dating back over 15 years.</p><p>I have irrefutable, irrevocable, empirical, documented and scientifically established evidence that this plant, which processes 20,000 tonnes of waste oil annually, is pumping hazardous and harmful emissions into the atmosphere in direct and total breach of its licence and regulations.  I am absolutely certain that the Environmental Protection Agency is privy to this situation and is aware of it.  In fact, the EPA is colluding with the company in what is a cover-up of what in some instances are carcinogenic emissions going into the atmosphere and wastewater in the vicinity.</p><p>People in the Portlaoise area, including residents and workers in nearby plants, are unnecessarily being exposed to hazardous emissions.  They should not have to be in this position.  If we have a watchdog we should be able to rely on it.  What is the point in having a watchdog if it does not bark, much less bite?  I believe it is the corporate culture of the EPA to work hand in hand with corporate elements and industry rather than putting the public interest and public health first and foremost.  </p><p>A litany of documentation proves a series of non-compliance.  The people who have come forward have been fobbed off and categorised as cranks, while a blind eye has been turned to what is going on.  This is an Erin Brockovich scenario where people are living in silent fear and do not know what to do.  It is our duty and responsibility as public representatives to ensure that this is not allowed to continue any further.  </p> <p>I have documentary proof that the harmful and hazardous emissions, some of which are carcinogens, from the Enva Ireland plant in Portlaoise measure up to 32 times and in some instances up to 1,000 times more than the accepted levels as set down by the Environmental Protection Agency and other authorities.  This matter was brought to my attention in the past two months.  I have gone to lengths to verify this information and ensure it stands up.  I have a litany of paperwork and documentation, including letters from Irish Rail management at the sleeper factory in Portlaoise.  They wrote on behalf of the workers to Enva and the EPA imploring them to do something because the workers were repeatedly complaining of nausea and headaches.  I hope that is the full extent of the problem being created by these harmful emissions because chemicals such as benzene are being pumped into the sky within 100 m of homes where people are living, including elderly people and young children.  These open-vent emissions should be brought to a halt immediately.  I am calling on Enva to clean up its act and on the EPA to do its job.  This is another example of the watchdog falling asleep at the wheel.  We have seen it in financial services and the charities sector and now we have it in the environmental sector.  The EPA should do its job and protect the public health and the public interest.</p></speech>

I thank Senator John Whelan for raising this issue.  Under section 60(3) of the Waste Management Act 1996, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is precluded from exercising any power or control over the performance by the Environmental Protection Agency or, in particular circumstances, a local authority of a statutory function vested in them, including enforcement functions.  Issues concerning the enforcement of waste management legislation are a matter for the appropriate regulatory authority and, therefore, should be pursued with the Environmental Protection Agency or the relevant local authority, as appropriate.</p><p>The treatment and management of waste material is subject to a registration and permit system by local authorities or licensing by the Environmental Protection Agency, as appropriate.  The particular facility is licensed by the EPA, as the Senator has said.  The primary purpose of the licensing, permit and registration scheme is to facilitate appropriate controls on waste facilities and activities to ensure good and consistent waste management practice and the implementation of high standards of environmental protection.</p><p>The role of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is to provide a comprehensive legislative and waste policy framework through which the enforcement authorities operate.  The Government's waste policy, A Resource Opportunity - Waste Management Policy in Ireland, published in July 2012 sets out the actions through which Ireland will make the further progress necessary to become a recycling society with a clear focus on resource efficiencies, the virtual elimination of land-filling and a rigorous enforcement regime.</p><p>The Minister and the Department are working to implement in full the objectives set out in the policy.  In this regard, the policy document contains a commitment to complete a review of the respective regulatory and enforcement roles of the Environmental Protection Agency through its office of environmental enforcement and local authorities.  In early 2013, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government established a group to carry out the review through examining current enforcement structures, identifying the existing strengths and weaknesses and making recommendations for the future.  The group is comprised of representatives from local authorities, the regional waste management offices, the Environmental Protection Agency, the national transfrontier shipment office, the national waste collection permit office and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The group has made recommendations and these are currently being considered by the County and City Managers Association and the Department.</p><p>Further to the obvious concerns of the Senator I believe it is always in the best interests not only of the agency but the people it serves that when a complaint like this comes to their attention, it does not simply act on it but it is open about its findings.</p></speech>

I accept that the EPA is an independent regulatory authority.  I am saying it is not doing its job.  Are we now saying there is no ministerial or Government oversight of this agency or authority?  The agency is turning a blind eye to what is going on in Portlaoise.  Why has the EPA not taken any action and allowed Enva to continue to release unlicensed, hazardous and harmful emissions from the plant?  I assure the Minister of State that I appreciate her response but I will be taking this further.  I will be calling on the Minister to conduct an inquiry into the matter and to bring in the director general of the EPA to be held to account.  What is unfolding in Portlaoise is not acceptable and must be brought to a halt.  People's concerns are genuine and they must be listened to.  This has been going on for the past 15 years and it must be brought to a halt now.</p></speech>

As I have already pointed out, that group is comprised of a wide variety of representative groups.  The group has made recommendations and these are currently being considered by the County and City Managers Association and the Department.</p><p>I take on board what the Senator has said.  I repeat my view that when there is a complaint and when there are clearly concerns about any issue they must be addressed.  We do not know whether the EPA has carried out an investigation.  It may well have done so.  In the event that we do not know, we should know.  Certainly, the people most directly affected should know and the agency should be more transparent about it.  After all, if people have concerns about where and how they live, it is a serious matter.</p></speech>

The set of rules seems be different depending on what time of the year the baby is born.  If the baby is born on 31 December then there is clear evidence that she comes within the qualifying criteria because the turnover in the business and the income will clearly show that she qualifies for maternity benefit.  However, if the baby is born on 1 January it appears she must submit an estimate of her income for the following four months.  If a woman is in a business or self-employed there are times in the year where income is at a lower level than later in the year, as occurred in this case.  The income for the first four months of the year is often at a low level because the turnover is not there at that stage.  In May, June, July and August there is a higher turnover for the person, who is able to take her income accordingly.</p><p>In this case the person has been told that she is not entitled to claim maternity benefit.  She can claim it, however, once she goes back to work and she produces the figures in January 2015.  Clearly, they will show that she was within the qualifying criteria for maternity benefit but only at that stage will the maternity benefit be paid.  This is altogether unfair for someone who is self-employed or who runs a small business.  The woman concerned must bring in someone to cover while she is out when the baby is being born and for several weeks thereafter.  She must pay for that person.  Therefore, she has no income and is seriously disadvantaged.  How was the policy that currently applies devised?  Why has the policy not taken into account the seasonal nature of the work of many people who are self-employed or the seasonal nature of income?  That does not appear to have been taken into account under the current regulations and I call on the matter to be reviewed.</p></speech>

However, it is a social protection matter and I am taking it on behalf of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton.</p><p>Maternity benefit is a payment made for 26 weeks to employed and self-employed pregnant women who satisfy certain PRSI contribution conditions on their insurance record to obviate the need for them to work pre- and post-delivery of their baby.</p> <p>The original scheme was introduced in 1970 and was extended to include self-employed mothers with effect from June 1997.  This year, it is estimated that there will be a weekly average of 22,000 recipients of maternity benefit at a cost of &euro;263.5 million.  The main provisions relating to maternity benefit are contained in the Maternity Protection Acts 1994 and 2004, chapter 9 of Part II of Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 and chapter 2 of Part II of the Social Welfare (Consolidated Claims, Payments and Control) Regulations 2007, as amended.</p><p>To qualify for maternity benefit as a self-employed person a woman must be in insurable self-employment.  This means she must have sufficient earnings in the year of her confinement to be liable to pay income tax and PRSI.  The current threshold for payment of income tax and PRSI is &euro;5,000 per annum.  In addition to being in insurable self-employment the woman must also satisfy one of a number of PRSI contribution conditions.  She must either have 52 qualifying PRSI contributions paid in the relevant tax year or have 52 qualifying contributions paid in the tax year prior to the relevant tax year or have 52 qualifying contributions paid in the tax year following the relevant tax year.  It is not a requirement that this three-year period be the three years immediately preceding confinement.  </p><p>Self-employment contributions, Class S PRSI, are not awarded for any particular year until all liabilities for that year are paid.  It is incorrect to state that benefit is not paid to a self-employed woman where her child is born within the first six months of the year.  I accept the Senator did not make such a statement.  Where a woman has recently set up as a self-employed person or historically has earnings from self-employment below the &euro;5,000 threshold, it may not be possible for her to qualify for payment until such time as her reckonable income and Class S liability for the year in question can be confirmed.  In such instances, the Department can review the insurable status of the woman after she files her tax return to the Office of the Revenue Commissioners for the year in question. </p><p>In cases where the Department finds that a self-employed customer has a record of earnings in excess of &euro;5,000 in previous years and has an expected due date early in the tax year, that is, within the first 16 weeks, her earnings in the previous year, if greater than &euro;5,000, can be used as confirmation of her insurable status.  All applications for maternity benefit from self-employed women are processed on a case by case basis and every effort is made to qualify the customer for payment, where possible, and in accordance with legislative provisions.  The Minister for Social Protection is, therefore, satisfied that current procedures in relation to the processing of maternity benefit claims in respect of self-employed women are fair and appropriate.  I accept, however, that the Senator did not claim that the procedures are unfair or inappropriate.  I hope the element that applies in respect of the previous year's income and returns for a woman whose due date is within the first 16 weeks addresses the issue raised.</p></speech>

I telephoned the Department about this issue when the decision was made in the case I raised.  Officials informed me that they cannot take into account income from the previous year in making their assessment.  The reply provided by the Minister of State does not correspond to the details provided in the letter I received from the woman in question, who is a constituent of the Minister of State.  Officials clearly set out in writing that the applicant must provide proof of income for the year in which the baby is born.  The problem in this case is that the woman in question cannot have income from 2013 taken into account, which is extremely frustrating.  Although she meets the qualifying criteria for the previous two years, she was asked to provide evidence of income for the first 16 weeks of 2014.  When she provided an honest answer she was informed she did not meet the qualifying criteria for 2014 and nothing further could be done until January 2015, at which point she can make a full tax return for 2014.</p></speech>

I suggest, therefore, that the Senator show a copy of the Minister's response to the official in question.  Perhaps it is an issue of interpretation.  The Minister clearly views the issue in the manner set out in the reply.</p></speech>
