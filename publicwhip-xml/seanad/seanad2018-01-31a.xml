That is due to increase in September of this year.  A new school facility with new classrooms is required under the capital investment programme.  Scoil Mhuire is one of the last remaining national schools in County Donegal that requires such investment.  I have visited the school on a number of occasions and I have seen the facilities, which are antiquated, to say the least.  They are cramped and are certainly not fit for purpose.  There are health and safety issues at the school.  There have been meetings of the board of management and the parents to discuss this matter.  The only solution is a capital investment project within the confines of the school.  The site is fine, but the conditions within the buildings are certainly not fit for purpose in the 21st century.  The pupils at the school deserve better facilities.</p> <p>I understand that the board of management of the school made an application to the Department of Education and Skills.  However, the Department referred the matter back to the board of management and indicated that the application was premature.  I understand that the board of management has since been in touch with officials in the Department again.  I would be very interested to hear the thinking of the Department of Education and Skills on this project at this time and if an application would be considered favourably given the unique circumstances in the school and the fact that its enrolment is due to increase by approximately 10% in September 2018 for the new school year.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2261"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2261&amp;amp;pid=BrianODomhnaill&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In view of that increasing enrolment, a capital investment project is required.  The answer provided to the board of management by the Department is that the enrolment figure is not increasing.  However, that is not the case.

The Senator will be aware that Scoil Mhuire is a co-educational national school that caters for pupils from junior infants to sixth class.  The school has a current enrolment of 111 and a staffing complement of principal plus three main school teachers.  In addition, the school has one special education support post.  As the Senator may also be aware, in order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, the Department of Education and Skills divides the country into 314 school planning areas.  The Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post-primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed.</p> <p>Scoil Mhuire is located in the Falcarragh school planning area, in which there are 13 primary schools in total.  The demographic data for the Falcarragh school planning area, as with other school planning areas nationwide, is being kept under ongoing review by the Department, taking account of updated child benefit and enrolment data.  In May 2017, the Department received an additional school accommodation application to provide a new mainstream classroom, a general purpose room, a library-computer room and ancillary accommodation.  When assessing the application, it was noted that the existing school accommodation comprises four mainstream classrooms, two special education teaching rooms, a library-computer room, staff room and a general office.  With a staffing complement of four mainstream teachers and one special education teacher, it was determined that there is currently no deficit of mainstream class accommodation.  The Department acknowledges the request by the school for the provision of a GP room and other ancillary accommodation.  The position, however, is that due to competing demands on the Department&rsquo;s capital budget imposed by the need to prioritise available funding towards the provision of essential school classroom accommodation in areas of demographic growth or in cases where an additional teaching post is being approved, the school&rsquo;s request cannot be prioritised at this time.</p> <p>I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to outline the current position regarding accommodation at Scoil Mhuire.</p></speech>

It is what I was anticipating.  Unfortunately, there appears to be a focus in the Department to prioritise to funding in urban growth centres.  This means that small rural schools, where teachers and pupils are dealing with antiquated conditions, are not being prioritised.  I do not think this is right.  A percentage of the overall budget should be made available to schools such as Scoil Mhuire.  Will the Minister of State inform the departmental officials that they should expect a new application from the board of management?  Will she ask the Department to take into account the revised figures for the increased enrolment in that application?  Those figures are due to rise in September.</p></speech>

I will be very brief.  The issue I raise impacts on a small number of local authority members - it impacts on them nonetheless  -and clarity in respect to the guidelines would be very much appreciated.</p> <p>Under the section on personal leave, Department Circular 0032/2007 states that those who are members of public bodies, for example, county councils or statutory local bodies, are allowed up to ten days in a school year.  Obviously, this absence applies only where meetings are held during school opening hours.   As a result of the 2014 local government reform, there are ten monthly meetings during school terms, five municipal meetings and one budget meeting.  There are also special meetings that can be convened occasionally.  Does the Minister have any plans to update the Department circulars to reflect the additional workload of the local authority members?</p> <p>In response to a parliamentary question on a similar matter, the Minister articulated that local authority members must get prior approval from the boards of management of schools in order to attend meetings and that, in approving such leave, the boards must take into consideration the welfare and educational needs of students.  I am told that is becoming somewhat problematic.  Department circulars provide for the absence up to ten days per year but cover for such absences is an issue for the schools and the local authority members involved.  For those members who have a duty as public representatives and as educators, this is undoubtedly a strain.</p> <p>We are all aware of the barriers that exist for women and men who are thinking of entering politics.  They are vast but some are much easier to address than others and I believe that we can make small changes and provisions to break down barriers and encourage inclusivity in politics.  It should not be a case of one or the other.</p> <p>I am seeking clarification on whether the Department has plans to update the guidelines to bring them into line with the increased workload of local authority members.</p></speech>

Prior approval must be obtained from the employer, that is, the board of management or education and training board, depending on the school type.  Substitute cover is not provided by the Department of Education and Skills for such absences.  In general, substitute cover is provided by the Department in the case of</p> <p>I presume the Senator will not be happy with the reply in light of what he outlined.  I have nothing further to add.  There are other types of leave that do not allow for substitute cover, including exam and study leave and extra personal vacations.  I cannot really add anything further but I will bring the concerns the Senator raised to the attention of the Minister.  Perhaps the Senator might be able to follow this up with a personal letter to the Minister.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  The situation in emergency departments in many hospitals was particularly acute over Christmas and the post-Christmas period.  University Hospital Limerick, UHL, is facing constant challenges.  It seemed to be in crisis management mode for most of last year.  The difficulties at the hospital reached an unprecedented level earlier this month.  According to some commentary, there are concerns about the management of the hospital, which is located in the Dooradoyle area of Limerick.  I do not know whether these issues relate to the management, the management structure or the management system.  I would like clarity on this aspect of the matter.  I know that the Minister, Deputy Harris, and the Ministers of State, Deputies Catherine Byrne and Jim Daly, and the other people are doing their very best to deal with this issue by allocating resources and managing change.</p> <p>I welcomed the investment of over &euro;20 million in the new accident and emergency department at UHL.  I would have expected that things would have improved with that investment.  I have noted commentary by the Taoiseach and the Minister in recent times to the effect that there are management challenges at the hospital.  I think the people of the mid-west have a right to know what those management challenges are.  What is being done about them?  Are they being addressed?  What are they?  Are they causing bed blockages?  Are there human resources issues or structural issues?  It is really not good enough to comment that there are management challenges at a time when people are on trolleys for between 48 and 72 hours, as has happened in recent weeks.  I would like clarity on what the management challenges are.  I would also like to know what is being done about them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-01-31a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1307" speakername="Catherine Byrne" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018013100002#C00600"><p>On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Harris, I thank Senator Conway for raising this important matter today.  It is unacceptable that patients, especially the elderly and the vulnerable, have to wait on trolleys for long periods of time.  The accident and emergency department at University Hospital Limerick, UHL, is one of the busiest in the country with approximately 67,000 attendances annually.  Demand for accident and emergency department services at the hospital continues to increase.  The number of accident and emergency department attendances at UHL in 2017 represented a 6% increase on the 2016 figure.  In recognition of this high demand, funding of &euro;24 million was provided for a new accident and emergency department at UHL which opened in May of last year.  The new facility is three times larger than the old accident and emergency department.  It has improved the patient experience in respect of comfort, privacy and, above all, dignity.  The Minister for Health visited the accident and emergency department for its opening last year.  I know he was impressed with the accident and emergency department, particularly its pod-based design, the aim of which is to streamline patient pathways.</p> <p>Notwithstanding this significant investment, the accident and emergency department at UHL continues to face challenges.  There are many patients on trolleys in the department each day.  Late last year, the Minister for Health met the director general of the HSE, the chief executive and the clinical director of the hospital group and the head of the HSE special delivery unit to discuss the situation in the accident and emergency department at UHL.  At his request, the hospital has submitted an accident and emergency department performance improvement plan, which sets out in detail how performance will be improved.  The plan is currently being implemented.  In December 2017, there was a 4.9% decrease in trolley numbers at UHL compared to December 2016.  We expect to see this incremental improvement continue in 2018.</p> <p>In order to alleviate overcrowding pressures this winter, 17 new surge capacity beds opened in the old accident and emergency at UHL in September 2017.  These beds will be converted into a medical short-term unit in 2018.  In addition, Limerick has been in receipt of access to 13 additional transitional care beds and four additional home care packages every week since the start of October.  These supports will continue until the end of winter in March.  UHL was chosen as a pilot site for a national HSE programme which is designed to improve patient flow across acute hospitals and the wider health service.  This programme aims to develop and assist different approaches to the improvement of patient flow.</p> <p>I reiterate that the Minister of Health is acutely aware of the current situation at UHL and is monitoring the situation closely.  The Department of Health, the HSE and the University of Limerick hospital group are carrying out measures to improve this situation.  We must bear in mind that behind every trolley number is a real patient who needs effective, timely and compassionate care from the health service.  I assure the Senator that the Government remains committed to driving this type of improvement in all accident and emergency departments in the country.  I will be happy to respond to any other issues the Senator may wish to raise.</p></speech>

With due respect to the senior Minister, this answer does not address the specific question I asked.  Is there a specific difficulty with the management of the emergency department at UHL, as has been alluded to in media reports lately?  Is there an issue with the structure of the management?  Is there a human resources issue with the management that is of concern?  I know that the nurses and the staff on the ground are run ragged.  They are doing their very best.  They provide an incredible service to patients in UHL.  I am concerned.  I would like to know whether there is an issue with the management.  Does the Minister have confidence in the management team that is running UHL?</p></speech>

In light of the concerns raised by the Senator, I will certainly speak to the Minister again about this issue.

I thank him for taking the time to respond to this question.  My rationale for submitting this matter is anecdotal in the first instance.  I have noticed an increase in the frequency with which the bus I use to travel from Belfast to the Seanad is stopped at Dundalk so that garda&iacute; can come on board to ask people for their passports or papers.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2477"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The garda&iacute; are entirely within their rights to do so.  The garda&iacute; who got on the bus asked passengers to produce their passports or national ID cards.

Does the garda allow them to proceed?  What are the terms of reference for such a stop?  I tabled a Commencement matter because I noticed an anecdotal increase in such instances.  I would like to hear his reflections on the matter.  We have an agreed duty, across the board, to ensure that there is no hardening of the border or, indeed, no return to the borders of the past.  I do not want to see a manifestation along our roads network that would indicate such a worrying development or trend, if indeed that is the case.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-01-31a.38" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018013100002#D00200"><p>I thank Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile for raising this issue which is of some importance.  It is important, in the first instance, to recognise that the purpose of any operation by the Garda or the Garda National Immigration Bureau, GNIB, at the Border is to detect any immigration abuses by non-EEA nationals who may wish to attempt to use the common travel area in order to gain illegal access to the State.  It is not focused on and nor does it impact upon Irish or UK nationals or EU nationals who, as the Senator will be aware, enjoy free movement under the common travel area and under the EU free movement directive.  The Senator will be fully aware of that, having regard to the fact that he said he does not carry ID with him and that he does not carry his passport.</p> <p>The number of specific operations held each year, to which the Senator refers, is an operational matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and it obviously consults, on a very regular basis, with the UK Border authorities.  Obviously a decision to engage in the type of operation referred to by the Senator is based on that consultation.  These decisions take into account matters such as emerging patterns of travel and emerging patterns of immigration abuses within the common travel area.  Again, the Senator will be aware of the importance of maintaining the common travel area in the context of our discussions, as part of the EU 27, with the UK on the matter of Brexit and the withdrawal of the UK, including Northern Ireland, from the European Union.</p> <p>An initiative, entitled Operation Gull, between the GNIB on this side of the Border and the UK Immigration Service has been ongoing for a number of years.  The sole purpose of Operation Gull is to address the issue of immigration abuses within the common travel area.  That has resulted in checks being conducted at ports and airports in both jurisdictions, including but not limited to, those along the Border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.  Over the past number of years, these operations have been conducted in Ireland under Operation Sonnet, which is specifically aimed at targeting, detecting and preventing illegal immigration into this State via the common travel arrangements.  These targeted operations are in addition to the day-to-day immigration controls in place in order to maintain the integrity of the common travel area.</p> <p>Detailed data on the number of operations pre and post the date of the UK referendum are not ready available.  However, I have listened to the point raised by the Senator and acknowledge his anecdotal evidence.  Indeed, I acknowledge his first-hand experience and knowledge in this area, having regard to his attendance here and membership of the Oireachtas.  Under Operation Sonnet there were 91 detections in 2015, some 27 detections in 2016 and a provisional figure of 22 detections in 2017 that I will confirm as soon as I can.  These detections came about as a result of a number of specific days of action.  There were four days of action in 2015, two days of action in 2016 and two days of action in 2017.  In addition to these days of action, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continually carry out routine checkpoints along the Border in an effort to help detect persons attempting to enter this State illegally.  As a result of such detections, some 774 people were refused leave to land along the land Border with Northern Ireland during this period.  The breakdown is as follows: 275 persons in 2015; some 282 persons in 2016; and 217 persons in 2017.  Out of the total, 20 people claimed asylum and the remaining 754 were removed from the State, in accordance with the law.  </p> <p>I am sure the Senator agrees that the continuation, preservation and maintenance of the common travel area is one of the main objectives of the Government in the context of the Brexit negotiations.  These key benefits are really important to our people.  The free movement of people and the wider economic benefits means that we must ensure that the common travel area is not abused by persons who are not legally entitled to such freedom of movement.  This will require appropriate checks to be made on the land border to maintain the integrity of the common travel arrangements.  Such checks will not, and such patrols do not, impact on the freedom of movement of the many millions of Irish and UK nationals who use the common travel area each year, and particularly the 35,000 people, like the Senator, who cross the Border on a daily basis.</p></speech>

The statistics he outlined this morning are worthy of reflection.  I am disappointed that the detailed data on the number of operations or where vehicles are stopped and checked is not readily available.  I understand that it was too short a time for officials to prepare the figures.  Therefore, I will ask one of my colleagues to table a parliamentary question requesting the details.</p> <p>I agree with the Minister that the Garda must maintain its obligations in terms of the common travel area.  I also agree with him that we must do all we can to ensure that the integrity of the common travel area is protected.  I am keen to know, whether it is from a political direction or, perhaps, an internal policing misunderstanding around their expectations in the first instance, if there has been a steady incline in the amount of checks, which I have noticed.  I do not think that there is necessarily a need for that beyond what the Minister has rightly outlined has been implemented pre-Brexit thus far, which has been reasonably successful in identifying people who enter the State illegally. </p> <p>Again, I thank the Minister for his response.  I am sure this is a matter that he will, like myself, keep a watching brief on and interest in.  We are very much in concert and agreement that the common travel area, in any future arrangement, must be protected.</p></speech>

I am happy to keep the House fully informed and will do so, and as far as my responsibilities to the other House are concerned by way of replies to parliamentary questions, in order to provide an appropriate level of information to Members.  Again, I am sure everybody will agree that the maintenance and preservation of the integrity of the common travel area continues to be a priority for us here.  It has always been a priority for our immigration services.  While Brexit has perhaps focused wider attention on the operation of the common travel area, the operational protection of the common travel area has not changed because of the result of the referendum in the United Kingdom.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charles Flanagan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I was pleased only last week to have the opportunity of meeting for the first time the recently appointed Lord Chancellor and Home Secretary, Mr. David Gove, in the United Kingdom.  Among the matters we discussed was that of the common travel area and the need to ensure, as the negotiations enter a critical phase, that both the UK and the EU 27 including Ireland continue to prioritise the need to ensure that the unique relationship on the island of Ireland and between the two islands of Ireland and Great Britain continues to operate as was.  One of the fundamental pillars of that unique relationship is the common travel area and I welcome the support of all Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; on that.  The continuation of the common travel arrangements, including their physical manifestation which is the open land border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, remains a key objective and a fundamental pillar of the negotiations.</p><p>The objectives of our Government and this State are to operate a fair and balanced immigration protection regime.  This means that the common travel arrangements and area are not subject or open to any abuse that might ultimately impact adversely upon on undermine their operation.  That means there will be appropriate checks, including on the land border.  I believe it is important therefore that any appropriate checks that take place from time to time be proportionate and that they be along the lines of ensuring that our immigration protection regime is both fair and balanced.  I acknowledge the close working relations between Ireland and the UK on immigration matters.</p><p>There are some specific issues in the context of the Brexit negotiations pertaining to home affairs and immigration of which we need to be mindful.  I would be happy to keep the House and the Senator informed of developments as they occur.  It is important that we continue to ensure that the close working relationship continues.  I am confident these efforts will continue in the run-up to the actual withdrawal of the UK from the European Union through the transition period and also beyond it.</p></speech>

However, not all first dates end well.  I welcome today the Garda backing a nationwide roll-out of an Ask for Angela campaign for those who feel unsafe on their dates.  This campaign encourages those who feel uncomfortable in a situation, whether it be in a bar or restaurant, to ask a barman or a waiter to ask for Angela.  This alerts the barman or waiter that the present company is making her feel unease and the barman or waiter will try to quieten the situation or put the woman at ease and in some situations, she could ask for a taxi home.  This campaign started in Lancashire in England and has been rolled out successfully in Waterford.  Cork County Council will also be rolling it out.  I very much welcome the roll-out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of this campaign to protect women.</p> <p>The second item I would like to raise today - it is with sadness that I raise it - relates to the 15th murder in connection with the Hutch-Kinahan feud last night.  It is ten days after the murder of Derek Coakley.  It is four days after the shooting on South Circular Road, where an innocent bystander was also shot.  It begs the question as to how many more murders must happen on our streets before the Government takes proper action.  Local communities are living in fear and there does not seem to be anything meaningful done by the Government.  All I can say is the Government seems to be losing its war on gangland crime.  I call for an emergency debate in this House and invite the Minister for Justice and Equality into the House to let us know exactly what he is doing to combat gangland crime in this city.</p></speech>

First, I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, into the House to discuss RT&Eacute; and its strategy plan in the short, medium and long term.  RT&Eacute;, as the public broadcaster, is a key communicator in Ireland communicating news, information and so on.  I happened to be on the board of RT&Eacute; two years ago and it does fantastic work.  It would be worthwhile and important for all of us to see what the Minister has to say in regarding the strategy for RT&Eacute;.  It is becoming far more competitive.  There are many more television channels available and other options available to consumers.  There are a couple of key areas I will share with the House this morning.  First, RT&Eacute; operating costs are &euro;355 million a year.  That has gone up from &euro;320 million the previous year, in 2015.  Operating costs are increasing by approximately 7%, and this is purely financial.  Some &euro;16 million of that was one-off items - the general election, the 2016 centenary, the UEFA cup, the Olympic Games etc.</p> <p>There is a significant challenge to its revenue, particularly in respect of the licence fee.  There has been some media information on this in the past two months, particularly last November.  I would like to ask the Minister to clarify the sources of funds and resources for RT&Eacute; in order that it remains viable and a key integral part of public broadcasting in the country in the future.  Advertising and commercial revenue is more or less static, at &euro;155 million.  The other main income is the licence fee, which is approximately &euro;180 million.</p> <p>Recently, a significant event happened in RT&Eacute; with regard to selling some of its assets, namely, selling of a vast amount of property.  The Minister should also address the House on how that income will be spent.  I hope it will be ring-fenced for RT&Eacute; but I would like to learn whether that will be going into capital expenditure or whether the revenue will be used to try to cover ongoing day-to-day expenses.

In 2007 the European Commission issued an infringement notice against Ireland in which a view was expressed that Ireland's local needs criteria for one-off rural houses are excessively restrictive and may be in breach of the treaties.  The Flemish decree handed down by the European Court of Justice in 2013 appears to clarify that to be the case.  It appears from parliamentary questions and a circular in May 2017 from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government that to avoid the escalation of the 2007 infringement case from the Commission the Department established a working group to examine those guidelines.  The replies to the parliamentary question indicate that the group is engaging with the Commission to identify a way forward.  The Department said in the circular last May that the guidance would be updated in the second half of 2017 but, unfortunately, we are still waiting for that guidance.  It is another missed target for the Government, along with the missed target for the publication of the national planning framework.  Both the new rural housing guidelines and the national planning framework must be viewed in the same context.  Both documents were due last year and both are essential for good planning and giving important advice to people who are hoping to invest in their own homes in rural communities.</p> <p>I have always been a strong supporter of robust frameworks for the operation of our rural housing policy.  They must be environmentally sound and operate on the grounds of sustainability, efficient use of services, good use of land, good design quality and so forth.  The delays in publishing the new revised guidelines are causing problems for families throughout the country and in the middle of an unprecedented housing crisis.  I know people who have deposits on sites in County Louth who are wondering if they can stop renting and if they will be allowed to build in the villages in which they have made their homes.  In many cases the villages are where they run their businesses and they are actively engaged in the communities they now call home.  There is a huge degree of uncertainty because of the delays in addressing this problem and in bringing forward the revised guidelines, as the Government is required to do.  It is causing problems for people and must be addressed.  Can the Leader clarify when the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government will bring these guidelines forward and when they will become policy for each local authority?</p></speech>

It is about children with serious and complex medical needs and the community participation in primary care that is vital.  It is widely accepted best practice that service users should be involved at every stage of service development and implementation.  A national steering group is being set up to decide on policy for children with complex medical needs but there is no representative of the parents' voice on that group.  It is disappointing and bizarre.  It is a ridiculous stance on the part of the HSE.  I am proposing this amendment to the Order of Business because of the urgency of the matter.  I believe the group will be established in the next few days and we might as well pack up and go home if parents are not included in it.  They are the experts.  They care for their children and have their best interests at heart.  That is true of the other people in the group but we need the ethos of community participation, which is well established in our systems and particularly our health system.  We must empower parents in the best interests of their children.</p></speech>

The rules for motions such as the one proposed by Senator Devine are that four days notice must be given, which means it should have been submitted last Thursday.  I was not asked to insert it and I have limited discretion.  I have decided that I cannot allow the motion because of the abridged time.  It has not been on the weekly Order Paper.  The other reality is that probably two thirds of the Members are not aware of this, so I must rule against the Senator in that regard.  I realise it is important to her but it is not of such urgency that one can decide otherwise.  I try to be fair in facilitating Senators but the four days notice is a precedent that is long established for good reasons.  It is not a case of it being an hour or two out, but two full days.  It should have been submitted last Thursday before 11 a.m.  With regret, I must rule against the proposed amendment.</p></speech>

It has been reported that the largest number of job vacancies in 2017 were in the banking and financial sector and in accountancy.  It appears there are not enough graduates in those areas.  There are also many vacancies in apprenticeships.  A small builder I know who is carrying out a project in Limerick is finding it very hard to get qualified bricklayers, carpenters and so forth.  There is a shortage.  This man is going to take people on and bring them through the apprenticeship programme.  I hope to see more of that happening.</p></speech>

I did not participate in the earlier debates that took place in this House because I was awaiting the decision of the Government.

It might have been very convenient for the Government had it abolished Seanad &Eacute;ireann but that was not the case.  We have a decision to allow a referendum and, if it is so permitted and the decision is made by the people, it will be our task to bring forward, support or oppose the legislation arising from that decision.  Particularly in television and radio, I notice constant mention of a decision by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  It is not a decision by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann but by the Oireachtas under the Constitution.  Seanad &Eacute;ireann is a separate House and we will make that decision in due course with proper information.  I am making no further comment in this House until either the legislation is brought forward or the Leader agrees to a calm and enlightened discussion arising from the decision on Monday and the Attorney General's recommendation.  We might then discuss, in advance of the legislation, what the views will be here, particularly of Members who did not speak initially.  I would extend that also to those who have already spoken without knowledge of what the Government's decision or the Attorney General's advice was going to be.</p></speech>

I heard a representative of this organisation on "Morning Ireland" on Monday railing once again against the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  By coincidence, as I was coming into the Chamber today, I saw its representatives busy lobbying.  Perhaps I am showing my own naivety but I am surprised by the amount of lobbying by the various arms of IBEC that goes on here every day.

I drink, so I am not coming here with a holier-than-thou attitude.  The facts of the matter are that alcohol causes mouth, throat, voice box, oesophagus, breast, liver, bowel and pancreatic cancer.  It is a cause of death and serious illness to people across the country.  The concerns of this organisation, which is busy in here lobbying the big parties in particular, are that the Bill is going to cost the producers money.  It is shocking to see that this organisation could come in day after day.  To be fair, I recognise that the Minister for Health is doing his best in this circumstance.  I am glad that the Seanad did not give way on this.  We need a debate on the level of lobbying by big business across both Chambers.</p></speech>

It is a very significant development and I warmly welcome it and commend the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, and the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, on finally bringing it to that stage.  I have spoken on the matter, as have Senators Dolan and Conway.</p> <p>However, that welcome news comes just 24 hours after Irish Rail's new pilot project to make using trains easier for people with disabilities was criticised by some users.  Under the new plan announced by Irish Rail, mobility and sensory-impaired rail users would have to give four hours' notice to a station if they want to travel so that ramps can be provided.  While this is an improvement on the 24 hours' notice that is currently in place, I do not think it is good enough.  No other rail user has to give notice.  If I want to go on a train, I buy a ticket and board a train and that is it.  Why should a person with a disability be treated any differently?</p> <p>Section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act, 2014 places a duty on public sector bodies to be proactive, to promote equality and to protect the human rights of people with disabilities.  Irish Rail is 100% owned by the Government and received a State subvention last year of &euro;133 million.  It seems to me that the subventions some public sector bodies receive rarely get to the service users.  I call on the Leader to request that the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, engage with Irish Rail to ensure that it is fulfilling its obligations.  Such action would help provide reassurance that our ratification of the UN convention is a meaningful process and not just a token gesture.</p></speech>

I can understand well the Cathaoirleach's decision on the timing of this.  However, this is a very important issue which has time constraints on it and it needs to be discussed urgently in this House.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that the Minister for Health should attend the House today to explain why parents' voices have been excluded from the national steering group in this respect.  It beggars belief that a parent's voice would be denied on such a steering group.  This needs to be urgently addressed.  I do not do this lightly or in an attempt to rob the Senator Devine of her hard work.  I offer it as a way of moving forward,  having a discussion, and allowing the Minister to come in and explain.  I urge the Leader to amend the Order of Business accordingly.  I hope the Minister will, if at all possible, amend the steering group to allow a parent's voice be part of it.</p></speech>

My views are pretty well known and I have stated them over many years.  I think I was the first person in Ireland to put abortion down on a manifesto in 1977, which is a long time ago.  I think the Government would be foolish if it attaches to the referendum suggestions of 12-week free-range abortion.  It would be much better advised to go for the removal of the eighth amendment <i>simpliciter </i>and then leave time for debate and discussion about what replaces it.  It took a long time for the leaders of the two parties to come to their conclusions after having read the report of the committee and all the rest of it.  The Irish public also needs sufficient time.</p><p>I was astonished to receive in the post a list of CEOs and their incomes.  It went from &euro;5.5 million down to a mere piddling &euro;1 million.  It is just astonishing.  Some of them were people from the banks, which are a public disgrace.  They are getting millions for making a balls of running the banks.

The museum is housed in a magnificently restored pre-penal laws church in the village of Straide between Castlebar and Foxford.  What makes the museum unique is that Michael Davitt was christened in the church in 1846 and is buried in the grounds of the 13th-century Straide Abbey beside the museum.  I need not educate the House on Michael Davitt or on his fantastically hard work because his legacy speaks for itself.  He advocated for the three Fs, namely, fair rent, fixity of tenure and free sale - allowing tenants to buy their lands from oppressive but mainly absentee landlords.  The Michael Davitt Museum offered guided tours to more than 5,000 visitors in 2017; it is probable that another 5,000 visited the site over the past year.   Despite existing on a shoestring budget, the museum offers guided tours and holds lectures, exhibitions and community events.  The museum caters for larger groups, which include schools, historical societies and active retirement associations.  It has been rated in the top ten in Ireland by TripAdvisor for 2017 and as the number one museum in the country outside of Dublin, yet the only funding it has received from central government over the past five years is a grant of &euro;20,000 from the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  This provided a heating system for the museum and a small portakabin, which is divided into offices and a kitchen.  Various applications have been made to the Heritage Council but no funding has ensued.  Applications have also been made to the Office of Public Works, OPW, but have failed to bear fruit.  It is essential that funding is made available to employ a small number of staff on a permanent basis.  This will provide continuity and expertise.  If this does not happen, the museum could cease to exist.  We are very good at commemorating and celebrating our past in this country.  Yesterday I received a lovely pack from the Houses of the Oireachtas with the programme for the commemoration of women's suffrage.  It would be an awful pity to celebrate and commemorate some individuals and movements, while letting others go to rack and ruin.</p></speech>

I cannot imagine where else in the State a major amenity such as a riverside park would be permitted to remain closed for six months without a sign of Government funding.  What adds to my anger is that a meeting was requested before Christmas with the relevant Ministers, including the Chief Whip, Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, who is from Donegal, and a cross-party delegation from the Inishowen municipal district to discuss and examine the options.  There has been no response; there has been radio silence.  It is a simple request to have a meeting facilitated as soon as possible.

It is the Minister, Deputy Ring, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, because Donegal County Council owns Swan Park, as well as the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh.  We want them to meet a cross-party delegation of councillors from the area.</p> <p>Yesterday there was welcome news, which was long overdue, that the Government would ratify the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The point was made here today that, whatever about the Government and the political system accepting the need for change, clearly the permanent government of civil servants are not accepting it.  The issue here is dealing with children with complex needs.  There is no State hospice for children who are dying; the LauraLynn facility is privately funded.  We are well behind established best international practice.  We are playing catch-up and I find it incredible that the HSE does not include representatives of parents from the Jack and Jill Children's Foundation, LauraLynn or the numerous parents' groups in the State.  I accept the Cathaoirleach's decision but this will come back next week and hopefully will not go to a vote.  I am asking that in the interim, the HSE reverses its decision immediately and includes representatives of the parents in order that it can make sure whatever new arrangements and supports are in place reflect the needs of parents and not what the HSE thinks they are.  </p></speech>

It was a very well made point.  It is an extremely important resource.  It is a national resource in terms of the contribution that was made to our history.  The assistant of my colleague, Senator Grace O'Sullivan, is a descendant of Michael Davitt and he would certainly echo that point.  Senator O'Sullivan also sits on the housing committee.  It is a sad reflection that the current chair of the Housing Agency, Conor Skehan, has a very different kind of message to the one Michael Davitt put forward in the early days of Ireland.  It is worth reflecting how far we might be from the three Fs now in respect of fair rent, fixity of tenure and so on.</p> <p>I want to emphasise the other point made.  The V&oacute;t&aacute;il 100 launch yesterday was a really powerful reminder of how democracy, change and women's equality was pushed forward in Ireland.  I acknowledge my fellow committee member, Senator McFadden.  I urge people to engage with the programme and to look at the women's franchise leagues that may have existed in their parts of the country and how they can help this to become a national moment.  Given that we are talking about the franchise and democracy and its extension, a clear and glaring oversight is the extension of the franchise in Seanad elections.  The Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, came to the House on the last day before the Christmas break and indicated he is moving forward on the issue.  I would like the Minister of State to give us a report on when we will move forward on Seanad reform, when we will have the long promised implementation group in place to see meaningful implementation so we are not going into the election in the same point of stasis again.  Will the Leader talk to the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, about when he might be able to come to the House and properly debate Seanad reform with us?  </p></speech>

It was in the previous programme for Government and the present one.  The previous Government did a lot of the necessary groundwork to bring us to where we are today.  It is absolutely appropriate that we acknowledge the significant commitment of the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, to achieve this.  Ratifying a convention is one thing; creating and protecting equality and the right to equality is a completely different thing.  It will require a number of Bills.  I propose that Seanad &Eacute;ireann be a willing participant in initiating legislation if it happens that the D&aacute;il programme is overloaded, in the spirit of moving this on to a situation where there are no barriers and where society is an equal playing pitch for everybody.  It is something we all want to see.  Seanad &Eacute;ireann is the appropriate House to push that forward.</p> <p>It was very distressing and disturbing to hear last night of a further person being shot dead as part of the gangland warfare that has gripped the north inner city of this great capital.  When resources are made available to deal with these things, it works.  If one considers Limerick, I note they were killing one another there a few years ago.  The resources were put into Limerick and it no longer has that situation.  The criminal gangs were taken out.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The same thing needs to happen in Dublin.

Of that 3,000, County Monaghan had only seven in that six-year period, and County Cavan only ten.  This pattern is replicated in many other rural parts of Ireland.  If the Government is really serious about rural Ireland and its future, it must make job creation there a priority.</p> <p>Unfortunately, last week's announcement that there would be further delay in the national broadband scheme will demoralise the people of rural Ireland further.  It is soul destroying when, year after year, these figures are published showing job creation or, more accurately, the lack thereof, in the Border counties and rural Ireland generally.  I do not see any reason the Government should not prioritise these areas.  In County Monaghan, for instance, we have two world-renowned leading companies, Monaghan Mushrooms and Combilift, which export globally.  These companies export daily and weekly to every part of the globe from County Monaghan.  There is no good reason counties such as Monaghan, Cavan, Donegal and other Border and rural counties cannot accommodate world leaders.  It needs Government to show direction but unfortunately over the last six or seven years, since the Leader's party has been in government, that has been lacking.  I ask that the Leader bring the Minister to the House so that we might discuss the future of rural Ireland and how the Government sees it develop.</p></speech>

T&aacute; s&eacute; thar a bheith t&aacute;bhachtach go nd&eacute;anfa&iacute; &eacute; sin.  I also welcome the recognition of people with disabilities and their international human rights.  I agree with previous speakers that there is no point in conferring those rights if the requisite resources are not put in place in order to allow people to vindicate those rights.  In the past, we have seen the recognition of Traveller ethnicity but on the ground, and particularly in Galway city, one sees an appalling situation where young Traveller families with children who are quite ill, and who come under both brackets of disability and Traveller, are treated in a disgraceful manner.  They are not being provided with proper accommodation.  It is a damning indictment of Galway City Council and Galway County Council that they have not put any appropriate accommodation in place for those families.  It is really important.</p> <p>Sometimes one can wonder if we do anything of value in these Houses.  In the past, Senator Mac Lochlainn was the Chairman of Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions.  As part of its work, the committee wrote a report on direct provision.  One of its recommendations was that the Ombudsman be given oversight of the direct provision system.  I welcome yesterday's report from the Ombudsman, Mr. Peter Tyndall, who has made a point of doing a report on the direct provision system, in which he notes that he has received 97 complaints about the system.  The report covers the whole range of issues which we have raised in this House repeatedly.  The Ombudsman reiterates the point that direct provision was designed as a very temporary measure and has been transformed into a long-term solution for the Government, but it is certainly no long-term solution for the people in the system.  We need to take what he says on board, along with the observations of the Ombudsman for Children, of international bodies and our own Oireachtas committees, namely, that direct provision is totally and utterly unfit for purpose.  It needs to be fixed.  It has nothing to do with there being a backlog of applications, the system in itself is an abuse of human rights.  This House and the other House need to take that on board and ensure that we address these issues around the direct provision system and put in place another, proper system.  A specific debate on direct provision with the Minister as soon as possible would be very welcome.</p></speech>

I say that because in 2008, I was very involved in a project involving the HSE and the Combat Poverty Agency relating to community participation and primary care.  It was a means of addressing the inequality and marginalisation that went on in decision making within the HSE.</p> <p>It mesmerises me that ten years later, we are still arguing over whether a parent should be on this primary care steering group.  It is without question that a parent ought to be there.  What is the HSE afraid of?  Is it afraid for its power and control, the institutionalised thinking of the senior management and the protectionism that exists in protecting the system that is there and is not serving the Irish people?  Is the HSE afraid that somehow, by a parent being on this group, that will be threatened?  </p> <p>I thank the other Senators who have supported this motion today and my own colleagues, Senators Devine and Mac Lochlainn, for bringing this forward.  It is crucial that parents' voices are heard.  Parents of children with disabilities are one of the most marginalised groups in this country.  They fight every day for their children and the rights that they should have.  They need to be there and their voices need to be heard.  I am sick and tired of the power and control within senior management in the HSE and the institutionalised thinking there.  It has to be tackled and this is just a small way of doing that.  We should not even have to discuss it here now, ten years after community participation in primary care was lauded. </p></speech>

It is having a devastating effect on SMEs and people in commercial entities but they can pass on the increased premium through the product or service they provide.  This morning's "Today with Se&aacute;n O'Rourke" programme featured representatives from charity groups and organisers of local events, such as small festivals or parades in rural Ireland.  These organisations are being crippled.  The programme featured a list, which is too long for me to rehash here, of festivals, events and parades organised by not-for-profit voluntary groups around the country which will not take place this year because of the exorbitant insurance prices they are being asked to pay.</p> <p>This has been brought up at committees, in the D&aacute;il and in this House but it is time to act when one sees volunteers, who are prepared to provide a service or entertainment and organise tourist attractions in their own communities being stopped, and when one sees charity groups and organisations having to abandon their great work because they cannot afford to pay the premiums.  One example was given where there was a claim.  It came to &euro;24,000 but the premium was increased in the following year by &euro;75,000.  There is no correlation or relationship between increased risk or previous claims, it seems that many of these insurance companies merely pick a figure and move on.  It is damaging for commercial entities but they have an opportunity to pass the costs on.  For voluntary groups such as charities and organisers of local events, there is nowhere for them to pass on the premium and all this means is that the events will not take place.</p></speech>

I join with Senator Ardagh in commending the Ask for Angela campaign.  I support and endorse it and advocate for its roll-out across the country.  Senator Ardagh in her contribution made reference to the television programme "First Dates Ireland" and the success that it is.  While I think it is important people move beyond the "First Dates Ireland" programme, Senator Ardagh is correct there are dates and incidences that go very badly wrong and where the woman is the vulnerable victim.  I hope the point Senator Ardagh has raised this morning on the Order of Business will emanate beyond this Chamber because it is an important issue we must highlight, articulate and advocate.  I congratulate her and thank her for raising the matter.  I was not aware of the campaign and I certainly think that we, as a House, should support and endorse it.  The programme "First Dates Ireland" perhaps sets a false picture because it is done under the guise of a television programme but, as Senator Ardagh said, there are incidences where people are victims and are vulnerable.  We saw an example yesterday where a young man was lured to a situation where two other men beat him up and they were brought before the courts.  They had created a false profile on a dating app and this young man was then beaten and severely injured.  What Senator Ardagh is raising is an important issue and I support her wholeheartedly.</p> <p>I join with Senators Ardagh and Conway in condemning the murder of any citizen of our country.  Senator Ardagh raised the issue of the 15th gangland murder yesterday.  Senators Conway and Ardagh made reference to what the Government has been doing in Limerick and Dublin.  It is important to recognise that the Government has increased resources.  Almost &euro;100 million has been made available by the Government to the Garda for overtime to support ongoing operations in regard to gangland crime.  To take the example of the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, and the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act, the Government has enacted new legislation to further target criminal activities.  We have also given additional power to the Garda for the immediate seizure of assets of those who are suspected of being involved in crime to prevent those assets being disposed of.  It is also important to consider the armed support unit where, at the request of the Garda Commissioner, in 2016 the Government moved to strengthen Garda resources to deal with gangland crime in Dublin.  The armed support unit for the Dublin metropolitan region, which was launched in 2016, is now operational 24-7.  In addition, the Government has created a special task force under the acting Garda Commissioner to target organised crime.   It is also important to say there are members of our communities who have information on gangland crime and those involved and they should come forward to support and assist the Garda in regard to the matter of organised crime, which has no place in our society.</p> <p>Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh made reference to RT&Eacute; and the Minister, Deputy Naughten's strategy for the national broadcaster.  I would be very happy to have the debate in the House.

I would be happy to support any initiative we could take at the CPP to support the Irish language and the use of the Seanad in promoting it.  I am sure we will be able to have a discussion on that at the CPP.</p> <p>Senator Nash raised the issue of the delays with the rural housing guidelines.  Many of my colleagues on the Fine Gael side of the House have been raising that matter at the parliamentary party level and with Ministers.  It is a matter for the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  I am sure that, as part of the national planning framework, we will have that decision soon.  I would be happy for the Minister to come to the House.</p> <p>Senator Devine raised the matter of the motion which the Chair ruled out of order and Senator Humphreys then jumped in to propose an amendment to the Order of Business.  I spoke to Senator Devine before the commencement of the Order of Business.  I am slow to divide the House because I share the view, and I think the memo went out to Sinn F&eacute;in in order that they would all come in and speak on it this morning-----</p></speech>

I thank the Senator for raising the matter this morning on the Order of Business and for ringing me before the Order of Business.</p> <p>I understand the difficulties involved for the parents in the situation she has raised.  There is no doubt in my mind that parents are the best guardians and the best advocates for their children and they are well aware of the needs of their own children who, as Senators Devine and Humphreys noted, have complex medical needs in this case.  I believe there is a partnership approach between the medical staff and the parents who aim to deliver the best outcome for children in terms of care and the pathways to care.</p> <p>To add to that, prior to the Order of Business I put in a request to the Minister's Department, although I have not got a response yet, which to be fair I expected, given the timeline was quite short.  I understand the HSE set up a working group in 2015 to review current policy, practices and the provision of all home care needs for children with complex medical conditions.  The review highlighted a number of significant areas where policy and practice required further change, enhancement and movement.  Having dealt with the HSE through my constituency office, I know of the matter of care for children.  The steering group came back with a recommendation under the national quality package assurance process.  Within that, while there is not a parent representative and while I accept my interaction has been limited in this regard, I understand there will be an ongoing process to ensure quality assurance in respect of paediatric home care packages.</p> <p>I would be happy to have the Minister come to the House next week, rather than divide the House today.  The Senators could also, as a matter of urgency, put the matter down as a Commencement matter as they would get the answer from the Minister quickly if they are successful in having a Commencement matter taken tomorrow.  It is a very important issue and I am not diluting that.  Rather than create a political football out of it, I would be happy to work with the Senators to try to get an answer.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Minister is in the House later today, and I would be happy to talk to him then.  Rather than dividing the House and making a political football out of it I would be happy to come back and talk about this again and try to get answers as to how we can help parents.  The HSE has made it quite clear and an independent process has been set up.  If the Senator can wait until tomorrow or next week I would be happy to talk again about that.  </p><p>Senator Byrne raised the issue of the CAO deadline for applications tomorrow and I wish all the students who are applying every success.  It is a very onerous time for students in filling out the CAO application.  Many parents in this House understand the pressures of the CAO deadline.  Picking a course and thinking about their choices of career is important for young people.  Senator Byrne also raised an issue which we as a State have an obligation to look at, namely, apprenticeship schemes and how we can advance apprenticeships in different key parts of our economy.  I would be happy to have that debate at a later time.  </p><p>Senators Leyden and Norris raised the matter of the eighth amendment.  I am not quite sure what Senator Leyden wants to debate.  We had a very important debate last week on the work of the Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution which was set up by the Oireachtas on foot of the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.  Government made a decision on Monday.  As part of the process of the holding of a referendum we will debate the referendum Bill, and I am quite happy to have the debate as part of that.  However, there was no secrecy or rush last week.  We came back, we sat and we held a debate which was open ended.  All Members were welcome to speak on it, irrespective of their viewpoints.  I am not sure what Senator Leyden wants to debate now.  We will have the debate on the referendum Bill.  If legislation is published we will debate it.  This is a time for people to reflect upon what the Government has recommended.  There are many different viewpoints in this Chamber and among the different political parties.  I am well aware of that, but we had a very good and very mature debate last week on this issue, and I commend all the Members of the House on that.  We will have the debate as part of the referendum Bill, which will cover what the Senator is looking for, if I understand him correctly. </p></speech>

Labelling is an important part of raising consciousness on issues such as alcohol.  I agree that we cannot allow a particular segment of this debate to be allowed to dominate.  The Senator spoke very strongly on the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill and was part of the deliberation.</p> <p>I am smiling because lobbying takes many different paths, and his own party is quite good at using the audiovisual room to lobby and advocate, as is its right.  Senator Devine should not get cross.  I said that it is her party's right, but it is a form of lobbying.  The drinks industry uses a different form of lobbying.  It takes place every day and we, as Members of the Oireachtas, are lobbied with regard to every part of what we do.  That is part of the job.</p></speech>

It is important that the register is kept, as per the Lobbying Act, and perhaps is looked at.  The point Senator Gavan raised, which perhaps is more suitable for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, or the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, is the question of when lobbyists are allowed to enter and interact with Members within the compound that is the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is a different matter and perhaps we should have a conversation about it in a different forum.</p> <p>Senator McFadden, like Senator Conway, welcomed the decision of the Government to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  She also spoke about Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and the issue of four hours notice versus 24 hours notice.  I saw the clip on the news, and it is extraordinary that a person with a disability has to apply four hours ahead of travelling.  It is discommoding to them, as citizens and as individuals, and they have a right, in my opinion, to be able to access buses or trains regularly.  I would be happy to have the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, to the House.  </p> <p>I gave Senator Humphreys his reply as part of the answer on complex needs.</p> <p>I am not sure whether Senator Norris wants a debate on the salaries of CEOs or what he was looking for.</p></speech>

I believe she has a very good suggestion in terms of different organisations and councils pooling resources to ensure that we have safe roads, particularly our non-national roads or primary roads which are dangerous because of overgrowing hedges and ditches.  Some people are against cutting hedges and ditches but it is a matter of safety, and I believe Senator Mulherin's suggestion is quite a good one.</p> <p>Senators Swanick and Higgins raised the issue of funding for the Michael Davitt museum.  I am sure the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, and the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, would be happy to talk to them about funding.  I do not have an answer for them on that question, but I accept the point that the museum is an important asset and we should support it.  </p> <p>I do not have an answer for Senator MacLochlainn in terms of Swan Park.  The Senator has raised the matter, and I thank him for doing so.  I have spoken to Members of the Government about that matter and I will do so again.

I have asked the Senators to name the Ministers.  I will do that for Senator MacLochlainn.  I support the Senator also in terms of the national hospice for children.  We need to have that debate.  The LauraLynn foundation does huge work.  I have visited it as Chair of the Joint Committee on Health and I commend all of those who work there and care for young children in a very stressful situation.</p> <p>Senator Higgins made a number of references.  Mr. Conor Skehan is before the Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government today and I will let him deal with it himself.  I do not believe he can be equated with some of the comments the Senator has attributed to him in terms of rent, etc.  He is a very fine individual who is doing a good job.  </p> <p>In terms of V&oacute;t&aacute;il 100, we commended Senator Bacik yesterday, along with Senators McFadden and Devine who were also part of that campaign.  The Taoiseach will be here tomorrow.  Not wanting to pre-empt his address, he might mention Seanad reform and the extension of the Seanad franchise and any changes to that franchise.  I am glad Senator Norris is gone.  There are six Members of the Seanad elected from the National University of Ireland, NUI, and Trinity College Dublin, and perhaps we can start there in terms of extending the franchise before looking elsewhere.  I am sure Senators will have different viewpoints on that, so I will not stray into that discussion.  I did not mean that to be a cheap shot.  The issue of extending the Seanad franchise is a bit like Lanigan's ball in that one steps in and one steps out.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-01-31a.150" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1391" speakername="Jerry Buttimer" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018013100002#O00600"><p>Senator Gallagher raised the issue of job creation in rural Ireland and the Border counties with which I agree.  I am sure he will join with his constituency colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, in welcoming the fact that last year 210,443 people were employed in IDA Ireland jobs in this country.  It is important to note that when the former Minister, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, was in the Department she was clear about creating jobs outside Dublin and in the regions.  That is why I think the Senator will be glad to see that since the period from 2008 to 2010, where we lost 35,000 jobs, we have created more jobs now.  I am sure he will join with me in welcoming the fact that today we have 11,469 people, an increase of 4%, employed in the Border region.  I agree with him that it is important in the Brexit era to promote, sustain and create jobs in the Border region.  I also agree with him that proper broadband, WiFi and connectivity is critical when it comes to allowing people to create jobs.  Job creation is a challenging task for IDA Ireland and I agree with him that we need to support and sustain IDA Ireland by providing the necessary connectivity and broadband.</p> <p>In response to Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh, I have read the remarks the Ombudsman made about direct provision.  I am happy to arrange a debate on the matter.  I commend Senator Mac Lochlainn on the role he played as Chair of the petitions committee.  </p> <p>I have addressed the comments made by Senator Conway-Walsh in the context of my reply to the queries about the issues of health.</p> <p>I fully agree with Senator Paul Daly about escalating insurance premia.  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy D'Arcy, was in the House before Christmas to discuss the matter.  It is a source of concern that the cost of insurance premia has gone through the roof which has forced, as the Senator has said, in some cases, local festivals, organisations or sporting clubs to stop or completely cease.  The premia hike has also had a huge impact on small and medium-sized enterprises and businesses.  I draw the attention of the House to what Pat McDonagh, chief executive officer and owner of Supermacs, has done for his own companies.  We must continually consider and address the cost of insurance premia.  Equally, we have a highly litigious society where people sue councils and organisations at the drop of a hat.  I will arrange for the relevant Minister to return to the House for a debate.</p> <p>I agree with Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile that justice and truth are important.  I support all sides and believe in cross-community support for all who seek justice, truth and answers to any atrocity that has happened in the North of our country.  That applies to all sides of our communities in the North of our country. </p> <p>Rather than divide the House, I ask Senator Humphreys not to push his amendment to the Order of Business thus allowing me to answer Senator Devine's very important matter.  I will not be accepting the amendment if his amendment is put to a vote.  </p></speech>

There are four fundamental issues to be addressed to break this cycle.  These fundamental issues are four priorities of mine for 2018: bed capacity; implementing reform through the Sl&aacute;intecare report; recruitment and retention of health care staff; and making that decisive shift to primary care a reality, once and for all.</p> <p>As well as dealing with emergency department performance, I will provide an update on some of the short-term, medium-term and longer-term measures I wish to see implemented in order to drive improvement in how we deliver our health services and promote better health outcomes for the people.</p> <p>At the outset, I acknowledge the distress for patients and their families, and the impact on staff, caused by cramped and overcrowded conditions in some of our hospital emergency departments.  There is no doubt that we are facing increased demand for health services.  A total of 1.3 million people attended emergency departments last year and more than 330,000 were admitted to hospital from emergency departments during the same period.  This represents an increase of 2.3% in emergency department attendances and a 2% increase in emergency department admissions, when compared to 2016.</p> <p>Despite the intensive efforts of staff, management and the HSE through the course of the winter, since the beginning of January this year we have seen a rise of 8.4% in the number of patients waiting on trolleys.  This reflects an increase of 5.6% in the numbers attending emergency departments - that is 1,247 more patients being seen - and an increase in delayed discharge figures as compared with the same period last year.</p> <p>Each winter, the system must also deal with the increased demand for services due to the prevalence of the flu, which is currently at its height.  Our system is also working hard to grapple with the challenge of infection prevention and control, specifically the emergence of virulent antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains or superbugs.</p> <p>This has been a difficult January for our hospitals.  Let me share something with Senators that they may not have heard.  In the face of increased demand, staff across the State continue working to improve performance and the overall number of patients on trolleys over the whole of winter so far - from 1 November to 31 January - is actually down almost 1,500 year on year.  This is a result of significant progress made by our front-line staff, especially in the November when 1,864 fewer patients were on hospital trolleys, and in December when there were 447 fewer patients on hospital trolleys.   On a bad day in a bad month we will always see it well commented on in this House and we always see it well commented on in the media.  We do, however, also have to comment on and acknowledge the progress that staff have made, particularly the progress made in November and December.  Despite their incredible efforts and despite the extra resources we provided, when it reaches the tipping point in January it is very clear to me that we have a health system that is not an appropriate size or model.  Despite the good work and progress made, despite the fact that fewer patients were on trolleys in November and December and despite the fact that more patients had been seen in hospitals, when we reach that tipping point we see that we do not have a health service that is the appropriate size or model for our demographic composition and our growing population.  This is why I bring the Senators back to the four key areas of reform on which I want to see progress this year.</p> <p>I assure the House that the Government is committed to further investing in health and to increasing the health budget.  That investment is having an impact.  I do not accept the logic that when funding is increased to the health service we do not see tangible benefits.  Tell that to a man or woman who got an extra home care package as a result of the increase investment, or tell it to a man or woman who has seen the benefit of the more than 170 additional beds already opened this year in the health service, or tell it to the person who has seen the benefit of the extra transitional care.  While there is a lot more to do, the benefit of the extra investment has seen 170 additional beds already opened this winter: 22 in St. Vincent's Hospital; 25 in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda; 17 in University Hospital Limerick; 28 in University Hospital Galway; 20 in Beaumont Hospital Dublin; 23 in St. James's Hospital Dublin; 24 in the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital Dublin; and 11 in Naas General Hospital.  Further beds will open throughout 2018, including at St. Luke&rsquo;s in Kilkenny, University Hospital Waterford and Cork University Hospital.  In addition, new critical care beds will come on stream this year in Cork University Hospital and the Mater in Dublin.</p> <p>Other capacity developments funded this year will include the new emergency department in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, which will come on line in 2018, and the development of a modular build for South Tipperary General Hospital, which I hope could be a model for short-term modular interim measures at other locations around the State.  We will also see the expansion of services at the Roscommon medical assessment unit this year.</p> <p>Bizarrely, even in times of great prosperity - and long before I was in Government - Ireland had a policy of reducing the number of beds in the health service.  Ireland now has fewer beds in its health service than in the early 2000s.  We saw a situation where the number of beds decreased in 2007, decreased in 2008, decreased in 2009 and decreased in 2010.  Since the Taoiseach was the Minister for Health, and in my time as the Minister for Health, we are increasing the number of beds in our hospitals, but quite frankly it is not at an adequate enough pace.</p> <p>We have to do more in respect of additional capacity and we must do it more quickly.  This is why last week I was delighted to bring to the Cabinet - and to publish for everybody to see - the health service capacity review, which outlines the projections of demand and capacity for our health services now and out to 2031.  This kind of analysis is integral to future planning.  We can all tell the important story of our own locality and if people believe they need more beds in a particular part of the country.  It is very important, however, to have an evidence base.  It is important that we look at international best practice and look at the impact on hospital bed capacity of moving more towards primary care.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Harris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2338"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is important that we do in health what we have done in the Department of Education and Skills and other Departments.  In that context, we must link the number of beds and the size of our health service to our population and the need that exists.  The Department of Education and Skills has done a very good job in recent years in that every year it knows that a certain number of children will require school places and it matches largely that demand with the provision of schools and teachers.  We need to do that in the health sector.  The heath service capacity review, which was internationally peer reviewed, provides us with a solid evidence base which will now inform future investment and policy decisions.  It is clear from that report that we will need approximately 2,500 additional acute hospital beds over the period out to 2031 and that we need to front-load some now and deliver some in as quick a manner as possible.  I am committed to doing that but it is also clear that if we just do that and do not reform the health service that it will not be adequate enough.</p><p>That brings me to the second key reform, Sl&aacute;intecare, I would like to highlight.  One of the first actions I took upon becoming Minister for Health was to work with the Opposition to establish the all-party Committee on the Future of Healthcare, chaired by Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall.  That committee worked for almost a year to come up with a plan for the future of the health service.  What is unique and important about the report it produced is the fact that it enjoys support from across the political spectrum, and this should not be squandered.  Political consensus is a great achievement.  Perhaps it is a creature of a minority Government but it is one that I am committed to ensuring is not wasted.  The Government has affirmed its commitment to implementing a significant programme of reform, as outlined in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  We had a special Cabinet meeting on the issue in Cork a few months ago.  I expect to present a response to the report along with a proposed detailed implementation plan to Government very shortly.  This will set out our ambitions for the next decade and will put concrete plans in place for the immediate years ahead.  Effectively, we will have an action plan where the Members will be able to see what we have committed to doing, when we have committed to doing it by, who is responsible for doing it and how that is progressing.  Importantly, this work, in line with the recommendations of the report, will be overseen by a new Sl&aacute;intecare programme office.  The Members will have seen in the national newspapers that the recruitment process, under our Public Appointments Service, has commenced for an executive director for this office and that is expected to be completed by April of this year.</p><p>I want to touch on two issues, which I am sure will come up in this debate.  We can have all the beds we want in the health service but we need to staff the beds.  I am very pleased that the public sector pay agreement was accepted by all our health unions and that the benefits of the agreement will now be seen in the pay packets of our health care staff.  I am also conscious that more needs to be done.  I am conscious of the fact that we see particular recruitment and retention challenges in the health care sector.  That is why I am particularly pleased that myself and the Minister, Deputy Donohoe went to Government and got approval to have our Public Sector Pay Commission do a specific piece of work on the health sector on recruitment and retention challenges.  That will give all our representative bodies and everybody else a chance to feed into the process with respect to what we need to do to keep Ireland competitive and attractive in terms of recruiting and retaining our health care staff.  That work is under way.</p><p>On general practitioners, GPs, which I know is an issue close to the hearts of many people here.  Senator Swanick speaks about this issue with a great degree of expertise.  We need to deliver a new GP contract.  To do that, we need to look at how we can unwind the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, FEMPI, legislation.  I now have Government approval to engage with GP organisations on the unwinding of FEMPI and I expect that process to commence very shortly.  We need to have a conversation about how we resource general practice.  There are matters that I need General Practice to do, matters that are currently done in the acute hospital setting that could be done in primary care.  I know that GPs are up for that but they want to know that the model is sustainable and that it will be resourced.  There is great deal more I could say, to some of which I will return in my closing statement.  I want to hear the views of Senators on all sides of this House.  We know the challenges in our health service.  I believe we know what the solutions are, namely, bed capacity, Sl&aacute;intecare, recruitment and retention, and moving more to primary care through community nursing and a new GP contract.  They are my priorities for 2018 and I look forward to working with all of the Members to advance them.</p></speech>

The Euro Health Consumer Index 2017, on which I understand people place different weight, ranked Ireland among the worst in Europe for waiting times for health care.  Ireland is now in 24th place, down two since last year's index.  The mismanagement of our health system is now being blatantly exposed.</p><p>In 2011, the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, vowed to bring to an end the overcrowding crisis.  Seven years later, however, the problem is worst than ever with record breaking numbers of patients languishing on trolleys across the entire country.  This has been a persistent problem but the Government has simply failed to take the required steps to tackle the crisis.</p><p>During a meeting of the health committee last year, I mentioned to the Minister the progress Macedonia has made by implementing the e-health platform, Pinga.  Macedonia has reduced hospital waiting times to approximately six months by means of a simple online live system.  GPs can go online during a consultation with a patient and access consultants' diaries, see what physicians have vacancies and refer appropriately.  That system can also be used for diagnostic scans.  In 2013, Macedonia was placed 27th in the Euro Health Consumer Index rankings.  In 2014, it rose to 16th place.  I asked the Minister at that time if we could look  at adopting or investigating such a system.  At the time the Minister said:</p><blockquote>I will certainly look at the suggestion regarding Macedonia.  We need all the suggestions we can get on this.  If there is good practice, we will look at it.</blockquote> <p>I understand that these matters cannot be dealt with overnight.  However, the Minister has asked for suggestions and they have been provided.</p><p>I do not believe that the problem with our health system can be the subject of an easy fix but it is infuriating to see areas where improvements could and should be made but in respect of which action has not been taken.  In my district, Mayo University Hospital was on course to have a piloted scheme for modular buildings last February.  Many local authority members, including councillor Michael Loftus, have contracted me about this.  The idea is that modular units would be put in place as extensions to existing emergency departments in some hospitals in order to relieve pressure.  This has not happened.  In fact, the plan, which was much sought after, appears to have fallen off the face of the earth.  Mayo University Hospital has used its budget wisely.  It has struggled on and been frugal with what it was given.  As a result, it appeared to have been punished through the withholding of the promised modular buildings.  Can the Minister advise me when it can expect those modular units to be delivered?  This is another solution to chronic overcrowding of an accident and emergency department but it has not been acted upon.</p><p>There is an urgent need to increase the number of beds available in our hospitals to help ease the burden.  Ireland has one of the lowest numbers of acute hospital beds - 2.4% per 1,000 of population compared with an average of 3.6% per 1,000 in 2015 - in the OECD .  We need to see an increase in the number of beds in our hospitals.  That is the only way overcrowding will be tackled in the long run.  The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, trolley watch-ward watch figures for the first week in January showed overcrowding records being broken.  The daily average so far this year is 560 people on trolleys.  This is the last day of January and I hope that it will be the last day of record breaking figures.</p><p>Currently, the HSE target for patients in accident and emergency departments to be seen by a doctor is six hours.  That is our target but in reality it should be an absolute limit.  International research suggests that there is an increased incidence of adverse outcomes for patients who have been in emergency departments for more than four hours.  Long waiting times, that is, greater than six hours, should be an exception; it should not be the norm.</p><p>I will conclude with a quote from the Irish Association of Emergency Medicine which states: </p><blockquote>This was always going to be how 2018 started in our EDs.  Everyone, from the Minister for Health to the clinician on the frontline, knew it - yet little of substance was done by the DoH and the HSE to address it.</blockquote> <p>Knowing what I know and having spoken to people on the front line, I can only conclude that people's medical outcomes are being compromised.  People are dying as a result of chronic overcrowding in our hospitals.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Keith Swanick:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2459"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2459&amp;amp;pid=KeithSwanick&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I do not say that lightly, but it is a reality.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-01-31a.195" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1396" speakername="Robbie Gallagher" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018013100002#S00200"><p>I will be brief.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, was in the House last week to respond to a Commencement matter I tabled in respect of this issue.  He talked about new thinking and new ideas to try to tackle this problem.  He said that if we continue to do what we have always done, we will continue to get what we have always got.  He put his finger on it.  We need fresh thinking on this issue.  I raised it in the context of taking a fresh look at smaller hospitals - I had Monaghan Hospital in mind - and the role they could play in helping to alleviate the overcrowding being experienced in accident and emergency departments throughout the country and in my region of Cavan and Drogheda.  This follows comments made by Professor John Hyland, president of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.  He said that the normal response during a trolley crisis is to cancel non-urgent and elective surgery.  He spoke about the repercussions of that and the heartache, pain and suffering people go through for years only to get a telephone call in the week they are preparing themselves for an operation to tell them it is cancelled.  We cannot lose sight of that.  He made the point that their conditions deteriorate so much that they end up in accident and emergency departments again, which brings us back to square one.</p> <p>I asked the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, to visit Monaghan Hospital and see what potential the facility has to offer.  It has a state-of-the-art theatre that is not being utilised to its full capacity.  It has what was an accident and emergency department at one time and is now a minor injuries unit.  Again, it is the same size as the department in Cavan.  I believe that campus could be doing more to help alleviate the problems being experienced country-wide.  I wish to extend to the Minister the same invitation I extended to the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly.  The Minister could visit with his colleague, hopefully in the not too distant future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-01-31a.196" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1409" speakername="Colm Burke" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018013100002#S00300"><p>I welcome the Minister.  I appreciate the work he is doing in the health care sector.  It is a huge challenge given the large number of hospitals providing services.  It is interesting to look at the figures.  A total of 1.3 million people attend accident and emergency departments, which is 25,000 per week or 3,571 per day.  Over 6,346 people per week are admitted to Irish hospitals through accident and emergency departments.  Those figures represent the challenges we face.</p> <p>We should also consider the demands that exist.  In my area of Cork city and county, the population has increased from 410,000 to 542,000, a rise of 130,000 over the past 30 years.  In that period, the number of beds in the county and city has decreased.  As a result, there is a challenge to ensure that there is an adequate number of beds into the future by planning for a new hospital facility.  Such a facility was proposed in the 1960s.  The Fitzgerald report referred to two major hospitals for Cork, but the city only ended up with one.  We are still trundling along with two hospitals, which have been there for over 100 years, trying to provide a service.  As regards waiting times in accident and emergency departments, unless there is an adequate number of beds to be able to admit people and care for them the logjam in those departments will continue.  I spoke to management at one of the hospitals over 12 months ago.  At that time the hospital was cancelling 40% of elective surgery because the number of people over 80 years of age arriving at the accident and emergency department had increased substantially.  That is due to the change in demographics that has occurred in this country.  We must plan and cater for that.  One good message is that people are living longer.  Life expectancy has increased by 2.5 years since 2000, so something is being done correctly in health care.  However, much more must be done.</p> <p>Another issue for accident and emergency services is that the GP contract must be prioritised.  We need to get the people who are working in the community to take on an additional workload.  They will not take it on unless the necessary support is in place.  I can give examples.  A GP approached me over two years ago and told me that his practice was offering to provide a service for people who have haemochromatosis.  Those people are currently going to hospital outpatient departments.  He and his colleagues were prepared to provide a service for those patients, and it is a service they could provide.  They offered to set it up, but two years later no progress has been made on it.</p> <p>The position regarding nursing homes is similar.  I have a big issue with the care of people in nursing homes.  It relates to where caution is being exercised, and rightly so if the GP is concerned, but admitting an elderly patient from a nursing home through an accident and emergency department should not be the way to deal with it.  We should have connectivity between nursing homes and geriatric services in the hospitals.  That is something we must do.  We also must do far more to help GPs deal with the concerns that nursing homes have about the people in their homes.  Rather than bringing them to the accident and emergency department, if enough supports were given to GPs they could look after many more people in the nursing homes.  It is all about ensuring that there are adequate supports and remuneration so the GPs can provide the service they currently find it difficult to provide.</p> <p>Recently, the HSE suggested allowing GPs to provide gynaecological services.  The GPs who contacted me said there was no problem doing that but pointed out that it is not covered by the medical card system.  That is another area where services could be provided by GPs.  Another issue, and I raised it in the health committee this morning, is not properly using the people who have skills.  I gave the example of people who have trained up in an area within the hospital system and for one reason or another, be it family commitments or other pressures, they have decided to opt out.  I was referring in particular to two doctors who had trained up, one of whom had six years in obstetrics and gynaecology and the other who had nine years.  They dropped out of the system to go back to working as GPs.  There is no reason that they should not be able to provide an additional service in obstetrics and gynaecology for the community, but they are not allowed to do that under the current GP system.  This is something we must work on, where people have huge expertise but are not able to use it at the coalface in the community because the system does not allow them.  We must start engaging on that matter.  That is why it is so important we put a new and innovative GP contract in place.</p> <p>I have a final comment with regard to building hospitals.  It was 1998 when a major hospital was last built in this country.  In the ten years between 1998 and 2008, when there was plenty of cash, not one was built.  This is something we must ensure does not recur.</p></speech>

The Minister will have a fair idea of what I wish to raise.  It is the urgent need to build a 96 acute bed unit in University Hospital Limerick.  The Minister is aware of that.  A new accident and emergency department has opened and it is making an enormous difference, but there is still a bed capacity issue.  The new accident and emergency department consistently has the highest number of people on trolleys.  That is mainly related to the lack of bed capacity.  It is a historical legacy from the reconfiguration of the services when Ennis, Nenagh and St. John's hospitals were closed in 2009 by a previous Fianna F&aacute;il Administration.  The Teamwork consultants report on reconfiguration stated that there were to be 136 co-location beds located on the grounds of University Hospital Limerick.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Kieran O'Donnell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2207"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2207&amp;amp;pid=KieranODonnell&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That never came to pass.  Consequently, from a situation where we had 35 accident and emergency beds in total between the four centres, University Hospital Limerick, Ennis, Nenagh and John's, our number was reduced to just 17 bays in one accident and emergency department.  We now are up to 35, which will be welcome, but we still have the lack of beds.  The Minister will be aware that I succeeded last year in getting &euro;100,000, both working with the local HSE management of University Hospital Limerick and through the Minister and the HSE, to allow the design work to get under way on this 96 acute bed unit which will be located adjacent to the new ED on the grounds of University Hospital Limerick.  I have two requests for the Minister, that this 96 acute bed unit will be included in the capital plan that is shortly to be announced and that funding will be provided to enable construction to get under way.  Has the Minister looked at other means, by way of modular facilities, to increase bed capacity in the region because I believe we in Limerick are relatively unique nationally in that our major issue is bed capacity and I want to see the 96 acute bed unit built on the grounds of University Hospital Limerick as quickly as possible?</p></speech>

I need to bring it up again.  The Minister has been gagged by this House, in particular, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il Senator.  An hour ago, supported by my colleagues and Senator Kevin Humphreys, I tried to get the Minister to answer as to why no parents were given a voice at the table for the national steering group on children with complex medical needs and the development of policy but, unfortunately, the Minister has been gagged.  The Leader stated he did not want to play political football with this.  He has actually done that, as have Fianna F&aacute;il Senators who went against their own sense of what is right in allowing participation by parents, who are the experts on this.  The Minister does not have to answer it.  I will resubmit the amendment to the Order of Business on Tuesday next but I am so unclear as to why it was not allowed.  I still do not know.  That is probably due to my naivety but also the political football that is being played out in this Chamber by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Senators.  Shame on them all.</p> <p>Returning to the statements on ED waiting times, a fortnight ago in the D&aacute;il, Members recognised the absolute severity of hospital overcrowding, including emergency department overcrowding, when a detailed comprehensive Sinn F&eacute;in motion was passed noting the current state of the health care system, the causes of this chaos and real solutions that the Minister should address.</p> <p>The shocking statistics around emergency department overcrowding include that there could be between 300 and 350 excess patient deaths each year due to the trolley crisis and the overcrowding.  The scandal of patients waiting on trolleys was declared an emergency by the former health Minister, Ms Mary Harney, in 2006, when the trolley count reached 469.  Twelve years later, on 2 January 2018, 677 patients were left on trolleys - the highest number ever recorded.  Throughout 2017, almost 100,000 patients were left to spend a night or more on a trolley in hospitals throughout the State.  I could go on and on.</p> <p>I have been watching the situation carefully in my area of Dublin South-Central on behalf of the community.  In my local hospital, St. James's, in 2017, a total of 47,500 patients attended the emergency department.  A total of 2,178 of these were left on trolleys.  Yesterday, there were 18 patients waiting on trolleys in that hospital.  In reply to a parliamentary question, the HSE outlined that in the event that all possible escalation steps have been exhausted and overcrowding persists, a package of measures, referred to as the full capacity protocol, is to be activated.  The beds given are not always the appropriate beds.  St. James's Hospital initiated full capacity protocol in February of 2017.  That is unacceptable.</p> <p>Even the most vulnerable children, including those with complex medical needs, are not safe from the ED chaos.  A total of 34,735 children attended the emergency department of Our Lady's Children's hospital in 2017.  They are not being seen to with the care that they deserve.  Nine were on trollies yesterday.  We need more beds.  There are capacity issues.</p> <p>There is a curiosity that perhaps the Minister could sort out for me.  In St. James's Hospital, it appears there has been a significant decrease in the number of beds over the past year.  In January, 2017, the HSE advised me that there were 837 inpatient beds and yet a parliamentary question reply that came in yesterday states that as of September 2017 there were only 686 inpatient beds, an anomaly of 151.  I am not sure if that is correct.  Is it anything to do with the development of the national children's hospital?  If so, it is no wonder we are seeing an increase in waiting times.</p> <p>I have long stood in this Chamber as a advocate of a community-owned approach to our health and well-being.  There is a certain level of attendance at ED which does not need to be there simply because there is no other place to go.  One such pertinent example is the presentation of psychiatric patients in the emergency departments.  The 2017 review of the National Clinical Programme for the Assessment and Management of Patients Presenting to Emergency Departments following Self-Harm, argued that "...a high number of patients without physical health needs have been presenting to the ED.  They would be better assessed by a Community Mental Health Team."</p> <p>This is the age-old call from me, Mental Health Reform and others for the desperate need for 24/7 crisis intervention and home-based management mental health teams within the community run for and by the community.  The lack of this service is damaging our people and placing them in an already full-to-the-brim emergency department which is inappropriate and dangerous on all levels.</p> <p>The Minister will be aware of recruitment and retention.  Unfortunately, what we are spending on nursing budgets is going towards private health care.  Our Lady's Children's Hospital in Crumlin spent five times the entire annual agency budget for 2013.  We need a great deal of step-down facilities.  I suppose the Minister just needs to get on with it.</p> <p>I want on the record my absolute concern, and worry from a clinical perspective as a nurse by trade, at how dangerous this emergency crisis is.  The INMO called it a humanitarian crisis yesterday.  Over half of the population who cannot afford private health care are the ones at risk of this health care chaos and we need to address that.</p> <p>Lastly, Senator Swanick is well able to represent GPs and medics.  My emphasis is on the largest sector in the health services.  There is no competition here.  I refer to the nurses.  We really need commitment to funding of the taskforce on nurse staffing to determine, on an evidence-based patient dependency scientific tool, the numbers of nurses required.  It is at pilot stage.  Can the Minister confirm its rollout, the additional nursing posts required for increased capacity and the ratio of nurses to patients?</p> <p>I would appreciate if the Minister would ungag himself and answer the question on having parents at the table for the national steering group on the complex needs of seriously ill children.</p></speech>

I can tell him that last year almost 5,000 patients in Donegal found themselves on trolleys at Letterkenny hospital.  That is double the number of 2016.  It is the highest number since INMO records began.  There is a real crisis at the hospital.</p> <p>There are so many stories every day but one story that sticks in my mind is that a 92 year old man gravely ill with pneumonia spent 23 hours waiting to get through into the hospital.  There are so many other stories but that one really stood out.  It is appalling.  When we talk about 5,000, it is not just a number.  That is 5,000 human beings who have not got what they needed from the health service.  They were not given their dignity.  That was their experience.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2321"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2321&amp;amp;pid=PadraigMacLochlainn&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I say all of that because I am outraged to have learned recently that the &euro;1.8 million applied for by the management of Letterkenny hospital last summer under the winter initiative was turned down.  It was money needed to reopen the short stay ward, which is a 19-bed ward lying empty in Letterkenny hospital at a time of crisis.  A full capacity protocol has been in place for almost a month in that hospital.  That is the scale of the crisis.  The staff, doctors and nurses work in impossible conditions and that is why that money was desperately needed.  Will the Minister comment on that today and clarify why that money was turned down?  Why is this 19-bed short stay ward lying empty at a time when it is critically important to have those beds available?  It would avoid situations like that of the man who was waiting 23 hours and would take the pressure off the nurses and doctors who are performing a heroic service in very difficult circumstances.</p></speech>

In the month of December, the number on trolleys was down by 447.  The Minister spoke about 170 additional beds being open this winter.  He does not mention University Hospital Waterford.  He says there will be beds open there but what criteria were used for the hospitals that were allocated beds?  I ask that because last week I spoke on the Order of Business about the last days of Michael Gallagher, a citizen of Waterford city, who passed away in December at University Hospital Waterford.  Mr. Gallagher&rsquo;s children, Catriona and William, wrote an elegant, thoughtful and open letter to the Minister, which was informed by their abysmal experience in the last days of their father's life in University Hospital Waterford.  Both Catriona and William have medical backgrounds; Catriona is a nurse in London and William is a professor of cancer care in UCD.</p> <p>I recently met with Professor William Gallagher to discuss the situation his father faced and the issues facing University Hospital Waterford, and all hospitals in Ireland.  We talked about the true nature of the trolley crisis and that while we know the total number of people on trolleys at any one time, we do not know the average or total duration that each patient spends there.  We discussed getting to the bottom of the existing Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, rules regarding maximum stays on trolleys and how the existing rules for people aged over 75 years are enforced.  To solve the crisis in our health service and to prevent its annual recurrence, we have to know exactly what it is we are up against.  </p> <p>I want to focus as much on solutions.  No more speeches are needed about how tragic the crisis is; we all now know this well enough.  We do not need and must not repeat the endless cycle of decrying these endless crises every winter only for them to return the next year.  The problem in University Hospital Waterford is that it is not a winter crisis, but a continual one.  Even in the summer it is a big crisis in Waterford.  I hear that from consultants.  What is needed is solid solutions and that means changes, some of which will undoubtedly be difficult and uncomfortable.  Over the past month we heard from health professionals working on the front line about what they think needs to change, including the way we handle diagnoses, the way referrals through accident and emergency are handled and the absence of more solid primary care paths in our non-hospital health system.  It means reorganisation from ground level of how hospital admissions operate and it also means providing adequate resources for the expansion and reorganisation of our health system as laid out in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  Getting new beds into operation in our hospitals involves not just money, but also training, employing and keeping medical staff, as the Minister referred to.  This is a major challenge.</p> <p>This week, I heard the personal story of a Waterford doctor, who was trained by the Irish university system and is now set to buy a house in Australia, where he can be assured of better conditions as a junior doctor and enjoy a much clearer career progression.  To guarantee such conditions for our junior medical staff, we will have to examine the balance between the private and public work of our hospital consultants and the pay and conditions of their junior staff.  One thing I have seen with dismay over the past month or two is resignation that this is just the way health care is and always will be in Ireland.  We cannot accept it.  We can and must do better, which means listening to patients and our regions, health care professionals and front-line staff and making it possible for them to deliver excellent health care services for all our people.  </p> <p>The Minister mentioned a parochial attitude but if it was a member of his family who had died recently, he would be talking about his town and his hospital.  That is why I am talking about University Hospital Waterford.</p></speech>

This year, the number of patients on trolleys in Kilkenny hospital was up.  The staff are worn out.  They are excellent and do a great job.  Over Christmas, there was one particular unit where there were 44 beds but 52 people being cared for.  They were on couches.  That is how bad it was.  We need to look at this because it is getting worse.  I often wonder about figures and I have to question them at certain times.  They do not add up when there is a unit with 44 beds treating 52 people.</p> <p>People are living longer and the system is not catering for that.  I visited people in Kilkenny hospital who were sick over Christmas.  When they were on a trolley and got into a ward, they were in a ward with ten people; there could be six men and four women or five men and five women.  It is at the stage where people do not have their dignity in hospital.  The staff are working hard and trying to put many people into the wards, but people's dignity and pride are gone.  They are sharing wards with strangers.  Men and women are sharing wards.  It is unacceptable.</p></speech>

This is an all too familiar problem.  It is something we - the previous Administration, the ones before, and this Administration - have been dealing with year in, year out.  Hundreds of citizens across the country are without hospital beds.  Their dignity, as Senator Murnane O'Connor said, is compromised.  Staff are working heroically against a backdrop of extremely difficult situations and conditions to do their very best for the patients for whom they care.  I have no doubt the Minister is working extremely hard to try to resolve this issue as all of his predecessors have.  We all acknowledge that.  There is no shortage of sympathy and expressions of regret about the experiences people have in our emergency departments up and down the country.  We know the nuts and bolts of this issue are being addressed with additional resources and supports, although they are not growing at the rate we would like.</p> <p>I can only speak with any great authority about the experience in my local hospital.  I reassure my colleague from Limerick city that Limerick is not unique in the problems it experiences.  In my local hospital, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, there are 18 patients on trolleys.  That is significantly down from the number on equivalent days in recent years.  There were 30 people being accommodated on trolleys yesterday.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerald Nash:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2281"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2281&amp;amp;pid=GeraldNash&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The figures are as I have described.  The reasons for that are manifold, but one reason sticks out; the lack of investment in new facilities and in hospital beds.  The Government in which I served invested very heavily in expanded services and capacity for Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.  The Minister correctly points out that there are now additional acute beds in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital and additional beds being made available this year, but that is nowhere close to what is required to address all of the many problems experienced by staff and patients in that hospital.  However, this investment has made a very strong contribution towards making the necessary beds available. <br/><br/>However, I need to warn the Minister of something.  That investment must be escalated very dramatically and very shortly.  It was alarming for the people of Louth and east Meath to read Mr. Martin Wall's recent front page report in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  Drawing from documents in the Minister's possession which came from the pen of the director general of the HSE, Mr. Tony O'Brien, it stated that this year alone Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital has an unmet critical need for 82 additional hospital beds and five new theatres.<br/><br/>I want to ask the Minister very clearly whether he will make that investment, which is required for the people of Drogheda, Louth, east Meath, and the communities right across the north east and north County Dublin.  Will he make that investment available for Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda this year?  As I understand it from the correspondence the Minister has received from the HSE, investment is also required in Beaumont Hospital, facilities in the west of Ireland, Mayo General Hospital, and in the University Hospital Galway dialysis unit.  I understand that this investment has been costed at approximately &euro;12 million this year and an additional &euro;30 million euros next year, in order to meet all of those critical needs across our acute hospital service.  That also includes five new theatres that are required in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.  I want to receive a clear response from the Minister on this.  Will he make those resources available this year?<br/><br/>Of course, acute hospital beds are not the only dimension that we need to deal with when it comes to the operation of emergency departments in this country.  The delays in boosting primary care provision are well known.  In 2013, two separate investments were announced in my own community.  One of these was the Bettystown Primary Care Centre, intended to accommodate the needs of the people in east Meath.  The other investment was in the north side of Drogheda, the area I am from and in which I continue to live.  It has taken until 2018 to see the opening of the new primary care centre in north Drogheda.  That is four or five years after it was originally announced.  Meanwhile, there seems to me to be little sign of the development in Bettystown.  This is something I am continuing to pursue with the HSE.  We know that investment in primary services addresses some of the issues that we are experiencing day in, day out on a year-round basis in emergency departments across the country.<br/><br/>In addition, in 2013 and 2014 I was central to the repurposing of what was a residential nursing home for older people in the Drogheda area called the Cottage Hospital.  That facility was re-purposed and retooled to become a transitional care unit.  This was largely to accommodate frail and elderly people who were leaving our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.  These patients were no longer acutely ill but required additional supports before they went home into long-term nursing homes.  Our ambition was that there would be additional beds available there for older people, to accommodate them in the context of the traditional care service.That was our vision, and the vision of the HSE; to assist Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, and importantly to assist those older people.<br/><br/>There was only a maximum of 24 beds in that particular unit.  That simply is not good enough.  In addition, the capital plan that was announced at the end of 2015 envisaged a new redeveloped public nursing home service in the Boyne View House facility and the St. Mary's Hospital facility on the Dublin road in Drogheda.  The boots were due to be on the ground in that development now.  There is no sign of any construction of that particular unit.  I use these local examples because the principles apply to the system right across the country.  We need investment in primary care, frail elderly programmes, transitional care units and residential nursing home units to take pressure off our emergency departments.  Those departments are staffed by people who are working heroically, often against the odds, to provide good services to the people for whom they care. </p></speech>

I know that the facts surrounding University Hospital Limerick and the issues there have already been highlighted to the Minister.  An 84 year old gentleman and his family contacted me yesterday.  He spent 70 hours on a trolley, and he had heart failure and other complications before he was actually put into a bed.  There are issues of which the Minister is very aware.  He has visited the hospital.  I cannot highlight enough to him, as my colleague has done, the issue of the 89 beds.  This must happen, and it must be complemented by the 90 replacement beds in St. John's Hospital.  St. John's Hospital carries out small operations on a daily basis and only has ten beds.  If its capacity for carrying out small procedures could be increased, it would help to ease pressure and to free up other beds.  However, they need replacement beds.  The two measures have to happen together.  It is very important for the region.  I welcome the fact that extra beds have been opened, but I note that Limerick had the smallest number of extra beds with only 17.  I cannot highlight enough Limerick's needs to the Minister enough.</p></speech>

I was responding to Senator Devine's comments.  In response to her query, although the HSE's primary care steering group does not include a parent representative, as part of its ongoing work around paediatric home care packages it will hold two focus groups with parents in receipt of such packages in 2018.  This will be a recurring annual process to make sure that parents' voices are heard.  I am sure we can engage further on that matter if the Senator wishes.</p> <p>I want to thank everybody for participating in this debate.  It is important that I hear Members' views.  I have heard them, and they very much align with the policy programme that I am pursuing  in regard to reform and capacity in our health service.  It is important for those working in our health service, and it is important for our citizens to hear also.</p> <p>There are several positive aspects of the Irish heath service.  I think it was Senator Murnane O'Connor who pointed out that our life expectancy is increasing in this country.  Our survival rates from cancer, stroke and cardiac arrest are increasing.  That is due to the Irish health service, the HSE, the people working in our health service, the policies being pursued by the Department of Health and the investment Government is making. </p> <p>We hear a lot of chatter about health.  We hear from people representing, people working in the health service, people like me and from commentators, and it is all very important.  Often, we do not hear enough of the patient's voice.  This is the first year in the history of the State that we carried out a national patient experience survey, where almost 14,000 people who had spent one night or more in an acute adult hospital actually gave their views on the health service.  A total of 79% of them said that they had a good or very good experience in being admitted to the hospital while 85% of them categorised their overall experience in our hospital as good or very good.  I absolutely accept that there are very serious challenges, but I also accept, and I think it is very important that we all accept, that many people who go in and out of our hospitals on a daily basis have a very good experience.  That is also part of the Irish health service. </p> <p>Senator Swanick raised a number of matters.  I will not have time to go through everybody's issue, but I will address the issue of ehealth.  I fully agree about ehealth as does Sl&aacute;intecare.  We are obviously in conversations about our capital budgets at the moment.  I want to see ehealth as a very strong component.  We need to move away from a situation whereby files are stored all over the health service, and towards an electronic health record that can actually help reform the health service and improve patient outcomes.</p> <p>Modular units were referred to.  This is something I am looking at as a temporary solution.  I have already outlined that in South Tipperary General Hospital I have provided funding and approval for that.  I expect that to be in place this year.  We will provide 40 beds, and I have asked the HSE to see if we could do that in other hospital sites, which is the point Senator O'Donnell raised with me.  This is not just about capacity.  It concerns capacity plus reform.  No Senator mentioned that some hospitals actually have fewer patients on trolleys in 2017 than in any other year since the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, began counting.  However, that is true.  Why are some hospitals doing better?  There are complex reasons, and every region and hospital is different, but it is not all about capacity.  Every issue in the health service is not about writing another cheque.  It also involves work practice and managerial grip.  It involves asking why a diagnostic facility might be closed after 5 o'clock in the evening.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Harris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2338"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is about ensuring the hospitals are appropriately staffed by senior decision makers outside of what might be perceived as more regular or routine hours.  It is a multifaceted issue of which resources and investment are part of the solution, but not the only part.</p><p>The issue of the GP contract as raised by Senator Colm Burke is a priority for 2018.  Senator Burke is very passionate about the issue and I take his point in respect of nursing homes.  I had the pleasure of speaking at the Nursing Homes Ireland conference at his request.  As the Senator said, the issue of frailty and how we differentiate between older and other patients in terms of hospital admission needs consideration.  We have started pilot projects to address that issue in several hospitals and need to do more in that regard.</p><p>Senators Kieran O'Donnell and Byrne raised issues relating to Limerick and I agree there is a capacity issue in University Hospital Limerick.  Beds that were promised during the boom years were never delivered.  We are going to deliver extra capacity.  I also take the point in respect of St. John's Hospital.  The 96 acute bed unit is under consideration but a capital planning process has to be gone through in that regard.  We will consider the interim solutions that were mentioned.  However, it is not just about capacity.  We must consider why there are sometimes very few weekend discharges in that part of the country and whether more can be done in that regard.</p><p>I will directly revert to Senator Devine in respect of the beds situation in St. James's Hospital when I have a factual answer to her question.  She is correct that there is much discussion of GPs, which is important, but that nursing has a very important role to play.  I will soon be meeting the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, to discuss several of the items the Senator highlighted.</p><p>As regards Letterkenny University Hospital and the 19 beds in the short-stay ward, I appreciate the point raised by Senator Mac Lochlainn.  I will be looking at capacity across the wider health service and we will consider the issue in Letterkenny and Donegal along with the rest of the country.  I take on board the points made by the Senator in that regard.</p><p>I thank Senator Grace O'Sullivan for her points.  She wants to focus on solutions, as do I.  The first solution on which I wish to focus is the reversing of failed policies, such as the decision during the boom years that we had too many hospital beds, leading to some being taken out of the health service.  We need to put in more beds and couple that with reform.</p><p>I thank Senator Nash for his comments regarding Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.  I acknowledge his role and the work he carried out in that regard during his time in government.  I had the pleasure of visiting the hospital not very long ago and noticed significant improvements that had been made by the staff and management team.  Senator Nash made the point that the investment, together with the work of staff and management has made a difference.  I accept that a significant amount remains to be done.  I am not here today to make announcements about specific projects but I appreciate what the Senator said regarding the need for new theatres and critical care beds.  If I were in his position, I would be asking the same questions.  We are finalising our capital planning and I am aware of the need to do more in respect of Drogheda as well.</p><p>I have tried to respond to as many issues as I can-----</p></speech>

It is a very specialised Bill which is necessary in order to meet obligations entered into by Ireland under European Union measures known as the Pr&uuml;m decisions.  These decisions are named after the town in Germany where the principles behind them were originally agreed and address the need to share certain kinds of information between member states in order to combat terrorism and other serious crime.  They require member states to share, in particular, DNA, fingerprint and vehicle registration data.  Legislation to share DNA and fingerprints, which is the responsibility of the Department of Justice and Equality, was passed in 2014.  This Bill will address the sharing of vehicle registration data.</p> <p>The Pr&uuml;m decisions were reached in 2008.  At the time, member states had the choice of whether to opt into them and Ireland did so by votes of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Once we opted in, the decisions became mandatory for us under EU law.  Compliance with the decisions does not only mean passing the necessary legislation, as we are not deemed to be compliant until we begin sharing information with other member states.  Under an agreement reached by the EU in 2009, data will also be shared with Iceland and Norway under the decisions.</p> <p>The legislative aspect of giving effect to the decisions has proven very complex.  As I said, the legislation to give effect to the sharing of DNA and fingerprint information was passed in 2014, six years after the decisions.  As that constituted the major part of the decisions, legislation for sharing of vehicle registration data was to be dealt with only after the DNA and fingerprint legislation.  A number of legal difficulties had to be resolved and it is only now that we are in a position to bring forward the necessary legislation to allow for exchange of vehicle registration data as required by the decisions.</p> <p>Due to these delays, as well as technical delays to the sharing of DNA and fingerprint data, the EU has begun the initial stages of action against the State for possible infringement of European Union law.  I understand that the technical processes necessary for arriving at actual sharing of DNA and fingerprint data are well advanced, with the crucial stage of EU evaluation visits to assess readiness being scheduled for February and March in the case of fingerprinting and DNA, respectively.  Vehicle registration data cannot be shared under the decisions until this Bill is passed.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Shane Ross:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1974"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1974&amp;amp;pid=ShaneRoss&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->When this Bill has been passed, we will proceed to sharing data under it as quickly as possible.</p><p>We are in a very fortunate position for rapid implementation in one respect.  Vehicle registration data are already being shared with other member states under a separate EU instrument dealing with the investigation of serious road traffic offences.  As this is being done over the same network that will be used for the Pr&uuml;m decisions, the technical measures required to implement the present Bill are mostly in place.  Speedy implementation will enable us to end EU infringement proceedings and avert the risk of reputational damage and financial penalties the State might incur in the case of being found to have infringed EU law.  On the matter of reputational damage, I would like to point out that the Pr&uuml;m decisions are rightly regarded as an important law enforcement tool by our EU partners, particularly those that have suffered from terrorism in recent years.  I need hardly stress the importance of retaining goodwill at European level in the present climate of the Brexit negotiations.</p><p>Before I set out the details of the Bill, I will explain what we are talking about in practice.  If a car that was involved in a serious crime in France, such as a terrorist incident or an armed robbery, was registered in Ireland, it would be possible under the Pr&uuml;m decisions for the French authorities to send an electronic request to check Irish records to ascertain the identity of the registered owner of the vehicle.  Equally, were a French-registered vehicle to be used in a serious crime in Ireland, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would be able to find out the identity of the registered owner by checking the French data.  The contents of this Bill may be described as falling into four areas, namely, general provisions for sharing of vehicle registration data under the Pr&uuml;m decisions, specific provisions for sharing Irish vehicle registration data with other member states, specific provisions for Ireland to access vehicle registration data held by other member states and data protection provisions.</p><p>The Pr&uuml;m decisions require each member state to designate a national contact point for the sharing of vehicle registration data under them.  As the statutory holder of the information in question is the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Bill names the Minister as the national contact point for the purposes of sharing these data.  The Pr&uuml;m decisions require that those involved in the processing of data exchange under the decisions should be authorised named individuals.  Therefore, this legislation will allow me as Minister to designate individuals as the authorised people to process data under the decisions.  These people may be officials of my Department - in other words, the people who already manage the data - or members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>The second area in the Bill is the setting out of specific measures relating to access to Irish data for the national contact points of other member states.  In line with the limits and safeguards set out in the Pr&uuml;m decisions, a search of the Irish data may be made only with a full registration number or vehicle identification number, VIN.  The purpose for which a search may be made is limited to prevention and investigation of criminal offences.  The Bill also sets out the content of any reply and limits its use by the receiver to the purpose for which it was supplied and to keeping records of data sharing under the Pr&uuml;m decisions.  The keeping of the latter records is a requirement to enable examination and verification that data protection rules are being respected.</p><p>The third area in the Bill involves searches by Ireland of vehicle registration data held by other member states.  It applies much the same rules regarding the conduct of searches by full registration number or VIN and the use of data solely for the purpose for which it was supplied or for keeping records or data sharing.  In this case, as we are talking about searches which are part of investigations of crimes in Ireland, the Bill allows the sharing of the data with the courts, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Director of Public Prosecutions, or other appropriate bodies, but only with the consent of the state that supplied the data.</p><p>As members can see, data protection must be at the heart of any process of this nature.  Anyone who is familiar with EU data protection law will be aware that the current EU legislation on data protection, as reflected in Irish law under the Data Protection Act 1988, is due to be replaced in May of this year by a new legal framework which consists of the general data protection regulation and the policing directive.  As Pr&uuml;m is a law enforcement measure, the policing directive is the part of the new legislative framework which would naturally apply to it.  However, the EU, in preparing the new legislation, decided specifically to exclude Pr&uuml;m from the new framework and require the continued application of existing data protection law.  Therefore, the policing directive explicitly states that it does not apply to Pr&uuml;m and that existing legislation will continue to apply.  The practical effect of this is that the Bill must - and does - state that the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1988 apply to data sharing under Pr&uuml;m.</p><p>In addition, the Pr&uuml;m decisions impose specific obligations on the data protection authorities of member states.  These obligations relate to the monitoring of data sharing under the decisions and the processing of complaints from individuals who may believe their data should not have been shared or the data shared may have been inaccurate.  Additional measures include the requirement on the national contact point to maintain records of data sharing under the decisions for two years and then delete such records, to carry out random checks on those records and to produce the records of such checks on request by the Data Protection Commissioner.  There are specific provisions for the correction of inaccurate data and the deletion of data which should not have been supplied.  The Data Protection Commissioner is given specific responsibility for monitoring data sharing under the decisions and for carrying out random checks on such data sharing.  Individuals may ask the commissioner to investigate the legality of the sharing of their data.  The commissioner is empowered to engage with data protection authorities in other member states to ensure proper investigation of complaints, regardless of whether those complaints emanate from within the State or from another member state.</p><p>The provisions of this Bill have been carefully examined and drafted to ensure they meet the requirements of EU in terms of the Pr&uuml;m decisions and in terms of data protection law.  We need to pass this Bill into national law to enable compliance with EU law and to proceed to data sharing under the decisions and thereby avoid being found to have infringed EU law.  I appreciate that this short Bill does not make light reading.  It is significant and something that our EU partners are very eager to see completed.  I thank the House again for its consideration.  I would appreciate the passage of this Bill as soon as possible.</p></speech>

As he has said, the Bill gives effect to the vehicle registration component of EU Council decisions 615 and 616 of 2008, which are known as the Pr&uuml;m decisions.  The aim of these decisions is to improve interstate co-operation among the nations of the European Union, as well as Iceland and Norway.  The Pr&uuml;m decisions allow the authorities in each member state to search each other's national databases of vehicle registrations, DNA and fingerprint information through the EU's vehicle and transport network.  Fianna F&aacute;il supports this Bill, which gives effect only to the vehicle registration aspects of the Pr&uuml;m decisions.  It represents a common-sense approach to cracking down on crime in this jurisdiction and in the jurisdictions of other EU member states.  I remind the House that Ireland was supposed to implement the Pr&uuml;m decisions by August 2011.  The former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Dermot Ahern, laid the legislative groundwork for the introduction of the Pr&uuml;m decisions in early 2010.  Unfortunately, this Government and its predecessor, which purported to be in favour of law and order, sat on their hands for almost seven years and totally failed to implement these much-needed security measures.</p> <p>Significant and rapid improvements in road and other transport infrastructure in Ireland and elsewhere have made it increasingly easy for criminals to move within and across jurisdictions.  As we know - this was mentioned in this Chamber yesterday - there has a been a large spike in travelling criminal gangs using our motorway network to move quickly between different parts of the country.  It is crucial that we make every effort to keep pace with criminals who do not hesitate to exploit all available technologies and opportunities to prey on innocent citizens.  We need to be proactive and innovative in our fight against crime.  This ratification represents just one of the steps that will need to be taken to keep our citizens safe.  Many proposals and suggestions have been made in light of recent criminal activities.  Fianna F&aacute;il intends to introduce legislation to facilitate the use of CCTV on our motorways.  The creation of this comprehensive database of vehicle registrations will greatly enhance our ability to use such CCTV systems locally and internationally for crime prevention purposes.</p></speech>

I thank him for taking us through this legislation in a comprehensive way.  It is tricky enough to read, but it is very clear in its message.  It is about sharing data and tackling national and international crime.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is about having knowledge about the movements of people within the Union or between Oslo and somewhere else.  It is important that we have data sharing, which is an important instrument and tool in terms of tackling people involved in terrorism and other activities.  No one who is compliant with the law has anything to fear.  I have always said that, such as when I advocated installing CCTV in my own town.  I had a lot of opposition in terms of the impact on people's right to movement, etc.  However, the greater right is the protection of our citizens and the importance of addressing full threats or anything to do with terrorism and dealing with them.  Law abiding citizens across this Union have nothing to fear from this legislation.</p><p>I note what has been said about DNA and the importance of fingerprinting and data sharing.  The registration of vehicles is a further added mechanism of tracking down the movement of people around the Union.  It is important that we share that data.  I initially had some concerns about data protection generally.  That is an area I am conscious of, as are I think most of us.  I am reassured by what the Minister said today about the Data Protection Commissioner.  If people feel data is retained on a system that is not correct or needs to be changed, they have an opportunity to address this, as the Minister pointed out very clearly in his statement.  There is also a role for the Data Protection Commissioner within Ireland and internationally with her counterparts.  If people genuinely have a concern or if there is some wrong information or misinformation they certainly have the right to make a case and have matters rectified.</p><p>I think this is very important legislation and I am happy to support the Bill.  I again thank the Minister.</p></speech>

It will be of assistance in combatting terrorism and serious crime.  I note that the opt-in happened back in 2008, as the Minister said.  One might wonder why it has taken until now to get to progressing the legislation.  It is very welcome, however.  Criminals should not use borders to escape the full rigours of the law for the crimes they commit.  The Bill will help to enforce that point.  There have been serious attacks in crowded cities throughout Europe in the past few years, perpetrated by terrorists who in many cases crossed borders in advance of committing mass murder and crossed them again when they were fleeing afterwards.  Hundreds of innocent people have lost their lives in European capitals like Paris, Brussels and London, to name but a few.  Anything that helps to prevent such slaughter has to be supported.  I very much support the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-01-31a.233" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1413" speakername="Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018013100002#Y00300"><p>I apologise to the Acting Chairman and the Minister for arriving late to today's debate.  It is never good to be late for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The purpose of the Bill is to protect citizens across Europe from criminals preying on them and evading arrest and detection in respective jurisdictions.  It argues for national and state police and justice systems across the EU to improve co-operation with each other.  The Bill allows state authorities to search each other's national and state databases of vehicle registration.</p> <p>This pooling of information and the freedom to delve into it across EU member states raises issues of concern to do with the privacy and personal data of individuals, as other colleagues have outlined.  It is, therefore, important that we understand the framework of protective measures that govern the application of the Bill for the general public here in this State.  In doing so, we must examine whether they are adequate for the task.</p> <p>The Pr&uuml;m decision, out of which this Bill arises, emphasises the importance of respecting privacy and protecting personal data.  Sensitive personal data will, therefore, not be disclosed as part of the response to searches.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is the State's point of contact for sending and responding to requests for vehicle registries and data under the Bill.  The data may be shared with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the DPP and other appropriate persons.  Data protection commissioners have the power to supervise the lawfulness of the treatment of the personal data under the proposed Act.  The Data Protection Act 1998 is applied to the requests for access to personal information.  It requires the use of the European car and driving licence information system, EUCARIS.  It is limited to individual cases and records are to be deleted after two years.</p> <p>On this basis, Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes any sensible and considered measures designed to protect people from criminals.  However, we may table amendments on Committee Stage.  As I suppose is often the case with this type of Bill, there is always concern that people are not given adequate protection as private citizens when dealing with data protection.  We have seen breaches across the institutions of this State on numerous occasions, despite being reassured frequently about the protection of our personal data.  Some of these breaches involve human error and others are more malign.  We approach the Bill with the intention of supporting it while raising some of those concerns now and on further Stages as the Bill progresses.</p> <p>We are concerned about a number of issues, one being the scale of the information sought.  It strikes me that information on individuals held on the Garda PULSE system, as well as driver licence details, would be sufficient.  In section 4(5), there is a reference to &ldquo;other persons&rdquo; the State considers &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; to share the requested data with.  Who are these other &ldquo;appropriate persons&rdquo;?</p> <p>We will allow the Bill to pass to the next Stage, when we hope the Minister will provide answers to these and indeed other questions that we might have.  From what I have seen and heard, I understand that the Minister gets our concerns in respect of data protection and protecting the rights of private citizens.  I look forward to hearing from him.</p></speech>

The Bill stands on its own.  It is not just about building confidence with our EU partners in the context of Brexit.  It is a necessary and long overdue Bill.</p> <p>We will certainly be looking at safeguards on Committee Stage.  In fairness to the Minister, he will want the safeguards on data protection issues to be provided for in the Bill also.  I have confidence that he and his Department will ensure those safeguards are provided for in the detail of the Bill.  Like all legislation, it is the detail and the unintended consequences that we have to be so careful about.  Our partners in Paris, London and other cities have experienced terrorism and loss of life.  It is important for legislation to provide for speedy investigation.  We suffered from terrorism for many decades on this island, as well as from serious crime and cross-border criminality.  The provisions of this Bill could have helped in the past with tracking down and dealing with things more quickly.</p> <p>I have one question for the Minister.  He stated that only full registration number plates will be accessible under the legislation.  Sometimes in cases of serious crime, witnesses may only note a partial number plate which would then be fed on to the policing authorities.  For the sake of excluding people from the investigation, sometimes a partial number plate trace can be helpful.  Is it the Minister's intention to exclude at all stages requests where the full registration is not supplied?  Sometimes it is in the detail of these Bills that we find where we need to help our authorities in a speedy investigation of crime.  Sometimes only a partial number plate may have been observed and sometimes it would help a police authority to track down or exclude large elements of the population on the basis of that partial number plate.  I am not laying a trap or anything in raising that question, rather it is just curiosity.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Kevin Humphreys :</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2289"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>

I thank all who have participated in the debate.  Deputies Paul Daly and O'Mahony asked what I think is a fair question, when they asked why the Bill had taken so long to come to the House.  It should not have taken so long.  We should not be getting into a situation where the European Union is showing quite so much interest in delays of this sort, but there were a great many legal problems along the line.  It is difficult to defend that fact when other countries have been able to implement the Pr&uuml;m treaty decisions and we have not been able to do so.  I take their point.</p> <p>I will now reply to the points raised by Deputy Humphreys</p></speech>

This Bill has taken long enough to prepare so I suspect that it is pretty watertight.

Through votes of the Oireachtas, Ireland is committed to implementing the Pr&uuml;m decisions.  This Bill is necessary in order to fulfil that obligation.  The decisions mean sharing of vehicle registration data, VRD, in order to prevent and to investigate crime.  We will not be compliant with the EU requirements until we begin sharing that data.  We will not be able to share the data until we have passed this legislation.</p> <p>The Bill makes all the necessary provisions for sharing of VRD in accordance with the decisions.  It also makes provisions for all of the necessary safeguards for data protection as is required by the decisions.  I recommend it strongly to the House and ask for Members for their co-operation in passing it.</p></speech>

I will highlight the actions we have taken and are taking to increase the social housing stock and meet the needs of those on the waiting lists and those at risk of becoming homeless, as well as to drive the increased supply of new housing across all tenures and maximise our existing housing stock to meet current and future needs.</p> <p>I recognise that, in doing this work and in making progress under Rebuilding Ireland, there is cross-party support for the work we are trying to do.  I know many want to do even more and we all agree with that, but most agree with the actions we are taking and both Houses of the Oireachtas support the spend of &euro;6 billion under Rebuilding Ireland and the action plan for housing.  Local authorities are central to this and I am conscious we have representatives from Waterford in the Visitors Gallery, in particular Councillor Declan Doocey.  It is important to recognise the role that local authorities have.  They are on the front line when it comes to housing delivery.  In working with the Department, State agencies, NGOs and approved housing bodies, the local authorities are the main drivers.</p> <p>Having increased capacity in terms of people and resources in the local authorities in the last year or two, we are in a much stronger position to try to address homelessness and the housing shortage than we were two or three years ago.  Much of that is because we now have money we did not have a couple of years ago.  I wish we had it years ago, so we would not have this housing problem, but we did not have it.  Now, with the increased economic recovery, with people back at work and with more taxes coming in, we have a lot more money to spend on housing, and local authorities can rightly resume their position as the drivers of housing solutions, working with all involved.</p> <p>I want to acknowledge the delivery of almost 26,000 social housing supports by local authorities, approved housing bodies and the other housing stakeholders to those who needed support and help in 2017.  We have over-achieved our initial aims for many of our targets, although we need to maintain and build on this progress in 2018 and beyond.  The Minister, Deputy Murphy, myself and the Department are clear that, while the action plan for housing sets out how to tackle this, action by action, over a five-year period, we cannot rest and sit back until there is nobody in a homeless situation, nobody living in an emergency house and the housing stock is under control.  When we say we are making progress and list our achievement of targets, it is not looking for a clap on the back but just to state the fact that we are making some progress.  We all recognise the urgency of going even further and doing even more work.  That is why an additional &euro;500 million was added to the overall housing budget last year and why we got an additional &euro;100 million for last year at the end of last year to enable us to do more in the 12 months just gone.</p> <p>I want to acknowledge the hard work across the country in tackling homelessness.  It was encouraging to see the reduction in homeless numbers in December but we must do more to advance additional preventive measures.  We know the numbers rise and fall in different months but we hope the trend will continue downwards, in particular in regard to the number of homeless families in emergency accommodation.  We will have the figures for January quite soon and they will, hopefully, give us something to build on and will prove the progress we are making.</p> <p>I often say in the other House that while I accept there are still thousands of people in an emergency situation, and a hotel is no place to raise a family, which we accept, progress is being made and we are getting there.  A lot of taxpayers' money is being spent on this so it is important we recognise there is progress.  All of the different agencies, local authorities, approved housing bodies and NGOs are at the coal face dealing with this on behalf of our Department, spending taxpayers' money to address homelessness.  They are doing a good job with the resources they have and they want to do more, as we all do.  We will make progress and we will get there.  Some 4,000 people last year left a homeless situation and are in a house today.  It is not enough, given there are still 8,000 people in emergency situations, but I want to recognise this and give a little bit of hope that there is progress and they are not going to be left in an emergency situation forever.</p> <p>I would like to highlight some key outcomes from the range of actions we have taken under Rebuilding Ireland.  Some 25,892 is the number of new households that had their housing need met in 2017.  As the Minister, Deputy Murphy, puts it, that is 100 new households who have had their social housing need met every working day of the week last year.  That shows the progress, although we want to build on that and do even more in the year ahead.  The Government exceeded its overall target for new social housing supports last year by 23%, which is more than 4,800 additional tenancies.  Compared with 2016, last year we increased our social housing supports by 36%, or 6,847 more households supported.  Over 7,000 new homes were brought into the active social housing stock through build, acquisitions, voids and leasing programmes in 2017.  This is a 40% increase, or almost 2,000 new homes, on what was planned for the year, and it is a 24% increase over what was achieved in 2016.</p> <p>Again, these are homes that were not in use and that are new to the stock.  We have all heard the stories of local authorities only delivering 75 or 100 houses a couple of years ago.  That is now changing, rightly so, and it could not change quickly enough.  That is why we are involved in putting in place new delivery mechanisms and new processes to speed up the delivery of houses.  To repeat, 7,000 permanent social houses came on stream last year, which is a major plus, and it will be about 8,000 this year.  Added to that are all of the temporary social houses under the HAP scheme, which we are also trying to strengthen.  There is progress although, as I keep stressing, it is not enough to help everybody and we have to keep going in order to do that.</p> <p>We came in slightly shy on our local authority and approved housing bodies build target for the year, having hit some 92% or our target.  This means there were 2,245 newly-built homes, which is still a positive result and is over three times the level built in 2016.  While it is not enough, the trends are going the right way.  The local authorities are getting their teams together.  We have regular discussions with them about changing the way we do business and about strengthening their teams and strengthening resources to get action on the ground, which is happening.  The progress is there to be seen.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Furthermore, when we look at the combined delivery for both built and acquired social housing homes in 2017, some 4,511 new homes were delivered.  That is 22% or an additional 827 homes more than had been originally planned.  Again, we are trying to put more money into delivering housing, certainly in terms of build and acquisitions.</p><p>We recognise that although we have made progress and thousands of people have been helped, thousands of people join the system having declared themselves homeless every month, as has happened over the past year.  We want to get ahead of that situation once and for all.  I hope that the figures will reduce on a regular basis thus indicating we have got ahead of the problem.  It has proven difficult to get ahead of the problem because 90 or 100 people present themselves as homeless every month.  I have outlined why the numbers have not reduced fast enough but we must keep pushing.  I believe we will make major inroads in this area in 2018.</p><p>We have changed the delivery mix for 2018, which means we can do more on the build side and less on the acquisitions side.  Where buying makes sense, and where it does not compete with young families or couples in the market, local authorities will continue to do so.  The Minister has made that very clear at the past two housing summits.  Last September, he made it clear to local authorities that we want them to resume building houses and not just to acquire houses.  It was very clear, at both summits, that it still makes sense for some local authorities to buy vacant stock that nobody else wants, particularly as one moves further away from Dublin.  It makes sense to use taxpayers' money in the best possible way.  While we build the system back up to capacity in order to build houses and deliver sites, it makes sense that we acquire sites and houses when they are vacant, when nobody else is competing for them and they are good value.  Local authorities know what they must do.  The closer local authorities are to Dublin, the greater the focus will be on building houses.  We have asked every local authority to up its game and drive the pipeline of new builds and new houses.  Today, about 3,700 social houses are being constructed across 190 sites.  On top of that figure, a total of 12,700 projects covering 720 sites are at different stages.  That is a good number of projects but we have asked the local authorities to double and, indeed, treble, their efforts because the current number will not be enough to deliver the target of 50,000 houses under Rebuilding Ireland.  We have asked local authorities to do more, to find more sites and to put more plans and processes in place.  We are working with them on these aspects on a daily basis.</p><p>Construction figures for September 2017 show that 3,700 new social houses were being built across 190 sites.  We hope to increase that figure because the plan aims to deliver 3,800 in 2018.  Activity in 2017, under Part V, reflects the overall increase in activity in the wider residential construction sector.  The 388 homes delivered represent an almost sixfold increase on the number of new social homes delivered using this mechanism in 2016.  These statistics reflect the fact that the private sector has resumed building houses.  Again, we can see the trend is going in the right direction.  When we put together the Rebuilding Ireland programme 18 months ago, we thought a total of 19,000 would be built by 2018.  The construction sector has estimated that about 23,000 houses will be delivered this year and the ESRI has estimated that 24,000 houses will be delivered.  That trend is much more positive than what we thought it would be at this stage.  I am glad it is because we need that many houses and even more.  Again, the figures show that there is activation on many sites and many houses are being delivered that will address various aspects of this issue, for example, providing housing for people living in emergency accommodation and in hotels, and addressing the price of homes, affordability and the cost of rent.  All of these issues can be solved by a major increase in the number of houses.  If we increase the supply of housing, we can tackle all the different parts of the housing difficulties that exist.  I am glad that trends are moving in the right direction.  </p><p>In terms of the housing assistance payment, HAP, the target of 15,000 was exceeded by almost 3,000 with 17,916 new HAP tenancies established in 2017.  Overall, some 4,000 exits from homelessness were achieved in 2017, which is 33% higher than in 2016.  I remind people, and I will keep saying it, that we are aware of the fact that hundreds of people present as homeless.  Although 4,000 people are no longer homeless, the improvement is not enough.  We know this number is not enough and we will do much more, but people must realise that there is hope. </p><p>In terms of HAP, we have received a lot of feedback from people in this House that they are unhappy with the scheme.  In contrast, the majority of people I have met who are on HAP have confirmed that they are quite happy with the scheme and they think it works very well.  They much prefer HAP over the previous rent assistance scheme because HAP allows people to return to work, thus increasing their household income.  As a result, they can source houses in different places.  It is getting more difficult to find a HAP house in the pressure zones and areas.  The scheme has worked well for thousands of people over the past couple of years, including this year when almost 18,000 people got a HAP tenancy.  However, we will always hear about the hard cases where HAP has not worked.  I am not saying HAP works for everybody, but I am saying that it works for the majority of people and the feedback has been quite good.  Again, we are changing HAP in the greater Dublin region in order to make the scheme more attractive to people, including those who are homeless.  </p><p>Regarding the residential sector more generally, in 2017, over 17,500 new homes commenced construction, an increase of 33% on 2016.  Again, this is another positive trend.  Last year, there were over 9,500 registrations in larger developments, a level not seen since March 2009.  Again, the trend is going in the right direction.  Such schemes will give us the houses we need to solve all of these problems this year and in the years ahead. </p><p>Last year, over 19,000 homes were connected to the ESB network, an increase of more than 29% on 2016.  Again, this is yet another positive trend.  This number includes newly built homes and those lying empty for more than two years.  We do not deny that the figure includes houses that are not new builds.  We do not have the exact number but we are trying to get it from the ESB.  The company generally records as a connection houses that were disconnected two years previously.  Therefore, the figure relates to houses that have been empty for two years or a new build.  Over 19,000 homes being connected is a very positive number.  That situation contributes to us being able to source over 25,000 tenancies for people in housing solutions as well.  Again, we are on the right track.</p><p>In terms of judging what is the right data set to use that can tell us exactly what housing has been built in the past year or two years, my Department and the CSO are working together to reach agreement on a set of figures that captures the number of new builds per year.  We will probably have figures by March or April that will give us the total figure for new builds in 2017, and for the second half of 2016.  Every year from now on, we will have the real figure for new builds.  Such information is important to all of us here who are involved in either making or judging policy.  My Department has used the same figures for years but we recognise that we can make the figures better and easier to work on by working with the CSO.  I hope that we will have the data for the second quarter of this year as well.</p><p>In the year to the end of September 2017, planning permissions were granted for more than 18,000 new homes.  As of 31 December 2017, An Bord Plean&aacute;la had received 13 applications for large scale developments under the new fast-track process, which we signed into law six months ago, including 1,900 houses, 1,750 apartments and over 4,000 student bed spaces.  All projects are due for decision in 2018 and, in fact, some decisions have been made in the week or two gone by.  Recently we have had the first positive decision under this scheme, which is welcome news.  Again, we hope that this planning method will fast-track some developments, thus enabling us to achieve the scale that we want.  Most of the cases have had a positive outcome.  </p><p>In recognising the positive developments in 2017, and as I have said a few times during this debate, our work is not finished.  I know that it is not finished by a long shot.  We all know, and the fact that Senators have arranged for statements to be taken here today shows they all know, that we have a lot of work to do when it comes to providing people with homes and houses at the right price and in the right place.  We understand that and we know it.  That is why I say that all of our work across all of the actions mentioned in Rebuilding Ireland is still a work in progress.  As I have said before, Rebuilding Ireland is similar to the Action Plan for Jobs.  In the first year and half of the Action Plan for Jobs, it was hard to see results and thus have full confidence that the plan would work.  At that time, everyone worried about whether jobs were being created.  All the work took place behind the scenes and then job creation kicked in from years two, three and four.  In fact, by the end of year five, the Action Plan for Jobs had doubled its stated output for job creation.  That shows the process can work, and the same applies to the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.</p><p>During the first 12 months we debated whether the plan had made progress.  The Government could see that it was making progress and we could see the trends, but it was hard to produce proof.  Eighteen months have elapsed and we have all the figures for last year which prove progress has been made and housebuilding is taking place in a private and public capacity.  The figures prove that local authorities are back in the game, are delivering and are putting teams in place to do even more.  Many projects are coming onstream that did not exist a year ago.  The Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness is beginning to show its value now, and we need to build on it.  We must drive the plan with increased urgency in order to make sure we provide enough homes for thousands of people, especially the families who are living in emergency accommodation.</p><p>Again, the five-year plan is 18 months old and has been allocated &euro;6 billion.  I know it is the least people in this House want to do.  Apart from delivering housing, the plan has put the construction sector on a sound and sustainable footing.  The plan will ensure that when we are finished with Rebuilding Ireland, and we have other plans, that people who invest in the construction sector, create a company, or develop an apprenticeship or provide skills in this area, will know that it is a safe place to develop a career or to invest in.  If we manage this issue right, we will always have a sustainable and stable housing construction sector and we will not be susceptible to the boom and bust cycle that we experienced in the past.</p><p>I will continue to outline the figures as they will give people confidence in the action plan.  As the Minister has clearly said, this is an evolving document and he has proposed a permanent review.  We are always open to new ideas and actions.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Even in the last few weeks, we have announced new schemes including the affordable loan product, which is a very good product and in respect of affordable sites and the delivery of affordable houses.  This morning, we launched the new enhanced leasing arrangement, which will help to deliver more housing stock.  On a weekly and monthly basis, we are coming out with new ideas to help drive supply.  Sometimes, that is a reform of old ideas.  The housing loan option was one local authorities always had but this is a better product.  Anyone who can get a guaranteed fixed-rate loan at 2% for 25 years is getting a positive outcome.  It puts people in a position to buy their own homes and provide for themselves.  There are small changes along the way and at other times there are structural changes such as the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, and funding infrastructure for sites.  All of these actions come together at different levels using taxpayers' money to form the solution.  They will all deliver something.</p><p>We had a housing summit on 22 January where the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, brought all the local authorities together.  We discussed with every local authority how to implement the targets we have set for social housing and how those targets will be achieved.  We have agreed a lot of new processes and systems and have put in place a new housing delivery team in the Department to work with local authorities and drive the agenda across the system.  We have a new land management and residential management team, which I chair, to drive the management of land and increase the pipeline.  We are looking at all zoned land to see how we can deliver public and private houses there more quickly.  We are looking at how we manage the process and plan for the years ahead to ensure we have enough land in place to deliver the houses we need.</p><p>The targets for delivery in each local authority area are based on the social housing needs assessment and waiting lists, which were published earlier this month.  I am sure most Members have copies by now.  The targets also take account of two changes in the latter half of last year: an increased focus on direct-build by local authorities and the additional money we have.  Each local authority chief executive is now required to furnish a report by mid-February confirming and setting out how that local authority will deliver on its social housing targets over the coming years.  At the summit, it was all about the urgency and how we can move faster to deliver more houses.  The quality and design of those houses and how we activate and use land in conjunction with the private sector to deliver social, affordable and private housing were also in focus.  A major part of the summit related to the emergency situation of homelessness and the number of people in emergency accommodation, including hotels and bed and breakfast premises.  We discussed how to improve services for them and deliver more accommodation of a permanent nature.  We discussed our obligation to ensure the resources are there to help individuals and especially families in that situation and guide them through the process as quickly as possible.  Local authorities have got the urgency behind that and we have given them all the different solutions, including bringing back vacant stock and building new stock.  There are a lot of solutions I can tease through later, but the message now is "urgency" and the need to build on progress, moving even faster, if possible.</p><p>I have touched on the leasing initiative announced this morning.  It is about activating sites.  We will take a long-term lease on some of these houses, which not only activates a site but provides us with housing stock for our overall target of 50,000 units.  Affordable housing is the big thing now.  The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has been very clear on that.  He set out the bones of a scheme a week or two ago and his aim is to deliver a minimum of 3,000 and up to 10,000 affordable housing units over the next couple of years.  That is the bare minimum through our schemes, but we believe in using State-owned land and working with different sectors, including co-operative, community and private groups.  We can use State-owned lands to deliver a great deal more in the affordable housing space and that is what we intend to do in the years ahead, along with cost-rental and other approaches.  Rather than to have me take up all the time available, I would like to hear Members' comments.  I can come back if there are questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-01-31a.254" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1395" speakername="Jennifer Murnane O'Connor" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018013100002#EE00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for addressing the House today.  Changes are being made albeit they are very slow to come.  Over seven years in government, the Minister of State and his colleagues have built 5,000 social housing units.  The most recent figures show there are nearly 9,000 homeless people in Ireland.  Nationally, there are approximately 5,500 adults and 3,500 homeless children.  However, the Taoiseach has stated that this is low by international standards in order to downplay the crisis.  There are over 100,000 people on the social housing waiting list despite the fact that only 653 social houses were built in 2016.  Fine Gael scrapped the affordable housing scheme in 2011 and never re-established it.  The new loan scheme will not address affordability if supply is not increased.</p> <p>While I welcome the fact that the Minister of State has been talking about supply, it really is the biggest issue here; the lack of building and the supply of housing.  Rentals have soared from over 23,000 above the previous 2008 peak.  Dublin city dwellers are now spending as much as 55% of their take-home pay on rent.  That is massive.  More than half the income they take in goes on rent.  House prices, combined with strict Central Bank rules, have meant that home ownership levels have slipped to record lows of 69% across the country.  The biggest issue is the removal of the local authority role through the slashing of Part V to 10% of housing schemes.  That was a massive issue.  In the future, we must ensure there is a home-first approach, focusing new units on wraparound services.</p> <p>There is confusion about the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme.  I am glad the Minister of State referred to HAP because this confusion is very serious.  I know I am always explaining about HAP but it needs to be looked at again.  One must be on the housing list to receive HAP.  When one qualifies and gets one's form, there is a requirement to fill in another form stating that one wants to be left on the housing list.  If one fails to fill that second form out, one will be taken off the list.  People are sending in their HAP forms but the other form applying to stay on the housing list is not being returned.  I had a case only last week where a lady who was on the housing list for six years went onto the HAP scheme.  We got her payment and everything was fine.  I asked her if she had filled in the form to ensure she was left on the housing list, which she had two weeks to return.  It is called the HAP transfer list form.  She said she had not.  I told her that if she had not filled it in, she would have been taken off the housing list.  We went back in and I tried to get her back on it.  She has to go back to the very start of the list.  She was on the housing list for six years.  These are the issues that are happening and they are massive.  Nevertheless, they are not difficult.  HAP is a lot better than RAS but can the Minister of State please get those forms out of the way and simply leave people on the housing list?</p> <p>I refer to social housing and the off-balance sheet model, which would allow AHBs to secure ISIF and credit union investment.  There is money in the credit unions and the Minister of State needs to look at their investment in housing going forward.  I also ask the Government to bring back the 20% Part V social and affordable homes provision.  I have asked the Government to establish a new affordable home purchase scheme on State lands and the Minister referred to that in his contribution, which I welcome.  I have massive issues with the rent pressure zone scheme, which still applies to only a few areas.  In my home town, Carlow, HAP provides applicants with &euro;537 a month.  However, the rent for a house in Carlow has gone from &euro;900 to &euro;1,000 per month, which means people have to pay the difference.  That is because they are not in a rent pressure zone.  The Minister of State needs to roll that out as a matter of urgency.</p> <p>I have addressed the following before.  Carlow has one of the lowest caps to qualify for the local authority housing list at &euro;27,500, whereas our neighbouring counties are at &euro;31,000 or &euro;33,000.  I have a commitment from the Minister of State to look at that.  It is something he must do.  Every local authority is different.  We need to roll out an NCT-style accommodation certificate.  We need to roll out a scheme where every local authority is looked at separately.  It goes back to the Minister of State.  I note the confusion over HAP, rent pressure zones and failing to qualify for the housing list.  These are all simple things but they are massive to a person who needs to go on the local housing list.  They are not being met and there is such confusion.</p> <p>I ask the Minister of State about landlords.  We need to put a system in place to reduce either local property tax or commercial rates.  We need to put a 90-night limit in place on Airbnb rentals.  The Minister of State needs to look at regulation in that area.  The Minister of State referred to new mortgages and I welcome the fact that we are bringing in new mortgages through local authorities.  It is a great initiative.  It is at the lower rate, which I welcome.  However, there is a problem with this new mortgage.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2470"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2470&amp;amp;pid=JenniferMurnaneOConnor&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->People now need to have savings of 10% of the loan to avail of a mortgage under this new scheme, whereas they only needed 3% savings under the previous scheme.  Who will be able to increase their saving to from 3% to 10%?  I rang a person this morning who had applied for a local authority mortgage.  She had to have a certain amount of savings, which was 3% of the loan and had been given six months to build up her savings.  From the introduction of this new mortgage scheme tomorrow, she will now need to have savings of 10% of the loan to avail of a mortgage under this scheme.  The Minister will need to look at that.</p><p>I welcome the fact that under this scheme mortgages are available at a very good low interest rate, but how will people come up with additional savings to avail of these loans?  How can people come up with the extra savings?  It is just not doable.  </p><p>I recognise the first-time buyers savings scheme, account taken of rent payments in mortgage approval and of course, the new tenant purchase scheme.  The new tenant purchase scheme that came into effect in 2016 is not working.  Unless there is an income of 50% coming into the house, one cannot qualify for it.  I had an elderly lady who lived in a local authority house all of her life.  She worked, she retired just before this scheme came into effect and she had a pension and lump sum.  She had a lump sum to pay for the house but because there was not 50% income coming into the house, she could not buy it.  Who is thinking up the terms of these schemes?  Many simple issues need to be addressed.  The Minister, together with his officials can work with the local authorities on these issues.  I know the Minister arranged a summit with the chief executives of all the local authorities.  These are issues that could be worked on.</p><p>We have been working on the five pillars for the past few months.  Housing is an issue of concern for many, from the homeless person to those who will not qualify to go on the housing list and those who could avail of the new Rebuilding Ireland Home loan.  I know all schemes have teething problems, but we need to address them.  Unless we get the issues sorted things will not get better for working people.</p></speech>

Councillor Ducey, who is a long-term local authority member of Waterford County Council, is accompanied by a delegation from Ardmore.  He and councillors around the country know the housing challenge that the country faces because they are dealing every day with the issues at the coalface.</p> <p>At the outset we need to acknowledge that we have had significant dysfunction in the construction sector for many years.  To address that dysfunction various measures have had to be adopted at policy and many other levels as well - Government, local authority, financial and building sector.  Rebuilding Ireland is a policy programme that has real objectives to address the housing crisis in the country.  While I understand the passion that Senator Murnane O'Connor brought to her contribution and know she is doing her best in her constituency to assist people, we should acknowledge the progress that has been made by the Government as well.  In the past year, more than 26,000 housing solutions have been met, where individuals and families have been offered solutions and now have homes.  That is major progress, given the state of the economy and the fact that local authorities have not been building for a number of years.  </p> <p>The Government prioritised the refurbishment of the existing vacant stock and provided adequate funds to local authorities so that they could turn around the vacant houses in their ownership.  There are also new initiatives to try to stimulate activity in the private sector in our towns and villages to ensure vacant housing stock in the private sector is given up to house individuals and families.  Of course the Housing Agency, the local authorities and the approved housing bodies have to be given the resources to make provision for housing, but we cannot ignore the private sector.  Criticism is levelled at the housing assistance payment scheme, otherwise known as HAP scheme, but it is a fact that more than 32,000 families or individuals have been housed through the HAP scheme.  If one were to remove that scheme in the morning our housing crisis would be far worse.  The HAP scheme is an essential interim scheme until we can ramp up the availability of local authority housing and approved housing bodies houses as well.  The role of the local authorities is very important.  That is why I commend the Minister and his colleagues in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government on increasing the financial resources and staffing levels of local authority so that they can get building again.</p> <p>The measure of a Government's commitment to housing is the provision it makes in its budget  The provision of a sum of &euro;6 billion over a period of five years is a significant commitment.  The various initiatives include the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund, LIHAF scheme, where major funds have been provided for local authorities around the country to open up lands and install essential infrastructure so that housing can be developed, the Capital Advance Leasing Facility, CALF scheme and the capital assistance scheme are means of providing funding directly to local authorities and the approved housing bodies for housing solutions.  Only last week in my county, I attended the opening of a regeneration scheme on the old cinema site in Dungarvan, where 15 apartments were opened on what was previously a derelict site.  We need to see more of that.  There are examples of this right around the country.</p> <p>The initiative announced by the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy only last week, the local authority home loan scheme will assist young families to get into the housing market to access funding to buy their own property.  That is to be welcomed.  It is being welcomed right around the country.  It cannot stop there.  I note the Minister announced a new scheme called the enhanced leasing scheme, which is to ensure that financing that can be secured from the private sector off-balance sheet, working with local authorities and under the auspices of the Housing Agency will open up new initiatives right around the country that will see the private sector working with the local authorities to deliver turnkey housing solutions in an emergency fashion.  </p> <p>I commend the Minister of State, Deputy English and the Minister, Deputy Murphy on the work both are doing.  I know they are leaving no stone unturned.  They are working with all of the stakeholders, including the local authorities, the approved housing bodies and the construction sector.  We need to see delivery.  That is the important message for all stakeholder.  We need to see the plans, budgets and policies that have been put in place delivering the housing units right across the country and where they are most needed, in our cities, towns and villages.  I welcome the work they are doing in that respect.</p></speech>

I thank him for his comprehensive response.  I have just come from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government of which Senator Murnane O'Connor is also a member.  We have had some ongoing dialogue.</p> <p>I acknowledge the enormous work and focus of the Minister and the Ministers of State at the Department.  They have worked together very strongly as a team.  They have been supportive.  I acknowledge the work of the public servants and the senior officials in the Customs House, who have gone way beyond the call of duty.  We have meetings off-site, down in the Customs House as well as our standard meeting and I have found them to be exceptionally helpful.  That has made our work a lot easier.  It is not all gloom.</p> <p>The problem with some politicians in both Houses is that they are hung up on an ideology about social housing versus private housing.  A multifaceted approach is needed.  At the end of the day, we want people in homes.  I personally speak for myself when I say this, I do not have a hang-up where these homes are coming from or who is providing them once they are good decent homes that tick the boxes in complying with the standards and regulations and are affordable.  We need to give people homes.</p> <p>It is important to say that historically all politically parties and none have had their hands on this housing brief in the past ten to 15 years and have failed to deliver.  There has been a wind down in local authorities for the past 15 to 20 years in the direct building of social housing.  To be fair, we must acknowledge that and that it takes time to crank it up and to get new housing.  For those who do not sit on the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government, we had the first quarterly report on this issue last week.  There are five pillars to Rebuilding Ireland and the information was set out in tabular form.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The pillars are as follows: 1, addressing homelessness; 2, accelerating social housing; 3, building more homes; 4, improving the rental sector; and 5, utilising existing houses.  When one looks at it in tabular form, it appears quite simple.  There are 166 key action items.  We have had a report on the progress of each of these in tabular form.  We raise questions.  It is represented by people on all the political groups.  It is worth saying that.  Yes, it will take time but let us not get hung up on the ideology of who is providing these homes.  What we want are homes for people.  I want to acknowledge what has been done because I want to be fair.  I am not part of the party political establishment but I see the work that is happening.  I was on a local authority for 20 years.</p><p>People ought to be fair and focus on Rebuilding Ireland and what it is about.  Rebuilding Ireland is about increasing construction of social housing.  I support that.  I would like to see more homes being built by the 31 local authorities.  That is reality.  It is about construction in the private sector.  Affordability is very important.  Affordability in rental, in construction and in the purchase of homes is important.  It is about partnerships with the private sector.  Let us not run away from that.  It is also about partnerships with the social sector and advocacy with the trade union movement and everyone pooling together, tapping into our experience and resources and getting new homes for people.  There is also focus on homes for the elderly and people with disabilities, people who rent homes and accommodation for students.  It has great potential.  </p><p>I will now turn to a number of things that we might do differently or that the Minister of State could consider.  We should identify why local authorities have so much idle land.  That should be audited.  We need to establish if local authorities do not have the competence, the will or the money to bring housing on stream and address that.  </p><p>We must re-examine NAMA and ask if it has a potential role to deliver existing housing stock for social, affordable and rental housing to the State.  I want the Minister of State to find that out and update the information.  Has it a role as an agency in its own right.  NAMA says it has vast resources, it reckons it will clear &euro;32 billion in debt this year.  Where are its resources, what is this money?  Can it be another agency to deliver houses for our people?</p><p>We, as politicians, need to hear what was agreed at the housing summit.  All 31 local authorities were set a target for delivery.  Was it broad enough?  Are we stretching chief executives of local authorities to deliver more houses?  I want to know what the target is.  I want the Minister to empower city and county councils across Ireland because they have a role to hold their executives to account and ask them if they are delivering.  We all know councils.  We want to empower the councillors to stand up in their local chambers and say, "Management what is happening, are you delivering"?  We need to ask the same in the Seanad, the D&aacute;il and in committees.  Our democratically-elected councillors need to know what targets were set by the Minister at last week's summit and they need to be empowered so that they can hold management to account on it.</p><p>It is important that we have housing solutions.  I like that word.  Senator Coffey referred to it earlier.  Let us find housing solutions.  Let us not get hung up on ideology.  </p><p>Finally, we need more data regarding the Part VIII planning process across Ireland and how it delivers social housing.  We want to see at what stage each Part VIII is at and I ask that the Minister of State instruct officials in his Department to publish a detailed report on each of the Part VIII projects.  He could circulate all councillors on the matter.  We need to empower councillors and part of that lies in information.  We must give councillors more information about the delivery in local authority areas and empower them to ask management if they have the resources, willpower and determination to deliver these houses. </p><p>I thank the Minister of State and acknowledge him for the work he has done in this area.</p></speech>

I was thinking about the representations that come to me.  At least 75% relate to housing.  It includes people struggling in the private rental sector to those living on the streets and everything between.  I looked for some statistics.  The area has a population of around 100,000.  There are 5,339 people waiting to be housed, a figure which does not include people registered as homeless or in receipt of HAP.  Some 588 people have been on the transfer list for over ten years, 982 people have been on the waiting list for over ten years and there are 335 people who are homeless.</p> <p>We are in a situation where these figures seem as though they are only numbers not people.  We are becoming used to discussing it.  There is no longer any awe or any shock factor to it.  What progress that has been made in Rebuilding Ireland is only a drop in the ocean, at least for people living in my area.  </p> <p>The figures are unacceptable.  As a public representative, I have met many of these people on their journey.  I have watched families disintegrate.  I have seen parents and children who are visibly anxious and have low mood, and children who have been born into homelessness.  I have seen them sometimes on severe psychiatric medication.  The only thing they can think about is finding a home for themselves and their children.  It is not working.  Homelessness, which is at catastrophic levels, is our society's great shame.  </p> <p>The housing crisis is not only a question of homelessness.  In Dublin there are over 2,000 people accessing the HAP scheme.  This is over-reliance on the scheme.  While it assists some people in the short term, it is not making progress in tackling the housing crisis in the long term, in Dublin at least.  HAP is often not competitive with the private rental market.  </p> <p>I welcome the 29 rapid-build developments in Drimnagh, although it is obviously not enough to address the figures I mentioned.  There are several projects running far behind in the south-west inner city, such as St. Theresa's Gardens.  People who were moved into emergency accommodation some years ago have not seen a shovel hit the soil.  I was with the previous Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government when it was demolished to great jubilation last summer but progress for these people has stalled.  The Dolphin House developments are to be welcomed but we will rapidly move on to phase 2.  I have been inside the units and they look really well.  They look smart and are large enough to accommodate families.  However, there are many people who cannot wait.  </p> <p>Thousands of people in my area and around the country are caught in an affordability trap.  They have incomes above the eligibility thresholds for social housing or social housing support, but they struggle to rent or buy.  They often live in over-priced rental accommodation, or in many cases live with parents while saving for a deposit or struggling to raise finance.  These problems are caused by inaction.  Last week's affordable housing proposals are disappointing.  </p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il's silence regarding solutions to the housing crisis is deafening.  Its alternative budget was a blank page.  It should not escape blame when we discuss this issue. </p> <p>The council loan scheme that was announced is a rehash of the existing scheme.  The 2% fixed interest rate will benefit some people but the scheme itself requires considerable tweaking.  It allows first-time buyers to breach the Central Bank lending rules in order to buy over-priced homes.  The existing council loan scheme has a very poor uptake and a large level of significant mortgage arrears.  We have genuine concerns that the revised scheme will lead to the same results.  </p> <p>The affordable housing scheme, which grants the local authority an equity stake in the home is cumbersome.  We are concerned that public funds will be used to facilitate the purchase of over-priced homes.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator M&aacute;ire Devine:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2468"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2468&amp;amp;pid=MaireDevine&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is no real detail regarding the affordable rental scheme.  Since 2014, there has been a Government commitment to introduce such a scheme.  In that context, there may be a pilot scheme at some undefined point in the future.</p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in has a fully-costed, comprehensive plan to address the housing crisis that does not rely on loans from parents, when the majority of those parents are struggling with their own bills.  Our sons and daughters, if granted mortgages, are signing up to terms of 40 years in some cases.  For the majority of children, owning their own homes is completely out of reach and they are, unfortunately, resigned to this.  We need affordable homes built on public land.  Our plan would lead to the delivery of 4,500 affordable homes in the first year and 9,000 affordable homes in the second, with an appropriate mix of rental and purchase homes determined by local housing needs.  These homes would be delivered as part of mixed-tenure and mixed-income estates on public land.</p><p>There is also a need to restore funding for Traveller accommodation programmes to 2008 levels.  This is a vitally important consideration as Traveller accommodation is often completely forgotten when we talk about housing.  For many Travellers, the current conditions are absolutely deplorable.  It is no wonder that mental health issues are at the highest rates among this ethnic group in Ireland.</p><p>People are competing to buy homes in Dublin, but I am not sure of the situation in the rest of the State.  In Dublin everybody is trying to buy a home.  There are queues out the door.  For those who are trying to rent the queues are even bigger.  Anyone who tries to rent with the housing assistance payment will face discrimination, even though legislation states that this should not be the case.  Landlords will say "No, it is okay, we have given it to somebody else."  This is happening in many instances.  We cannot close our eyes to the issue.  I urge the Minister of State to look at Sinn F&eacute;in's suggestions to address the housing crisis and to take them seriously.  They may help in the long term.</p></speech>

It is broken for the 3,079 children living in emergency accommodation.  It is broken for the hundreds of people with leave to remain but who are still stuck in direct provision centres because of the lack of housing.  It is broken for the women experiencing domestic violence who cannot leave their unsafe homes because of the lack of housing. It is broken for the refugees who we fail to welcome and who we say we cannot take in, so reneging on our international obligations and commitments currently standing at 1,259 people welcomed out of 4,000 as of last July.  It is broken for the Travellers living in overcrowded halting sites that have become deathtraps.  I saw evidence of the latter for myself in Spring Lane in Cork last year.  It is broken for people with disabilities languishing in congregated settings - again, evidence of missed Government targets and broken promises.  It is broken for the couple from D&uacute;n Laoghaire, one a physiotherapist and one a teacher, who can only aspire to buy a house Wexford, which is not really nearby for them.  It is broken for the teachers taking leave of absence in order to work in Dubai and save for house deposits who cannot be replaced and for the pupils they leave behind.  It is broken for the nurses who cannot be recruited to work in a Dublin child mental health centre, as we heard at the Seanad public consultation on child mental health.  It is broken for the companies that cannot recruit.  According to the Cork Chamber of Commerce, the crisis in the rental sector is the number one concern of 90% of Cork&rsquo;s largest employers.  The system is broken for the 14 people I counted sleeping in doorways on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Street in Cork on a wet, cold Christmas Day.  It is certainly broken for Kathleen O&rsquo;Sullivan, who died on the streets of Cork at the age of 48 and whose funeral I attended in December.  The Irish housing system, if we can even call it that, is broken from top to bottom for all those people and many more.</p> <p>On the gagging of NGOs, if that proposal is true, and I truly hope it is not, spin or a gagging order to protect Ministers and officials from uncomfortable truths about housing will not fix our broken housing system.  That said, there is a way out.</p></speech>

I set out some of my ideas in an article I wrote that was published by the Institute of housing last year.  I will leave a copy for the Minister of State.  We urgently need an activist and interventionist Government like we had before.  We also need Government to make the right interventions.  There were some &euro;400 million in transfers to landlords in 2017 via RAS and HAP.  The latter is dead money.  We need to invest that &euro;400 million - and billions more - differently.  We need to build more homes.  We built public housing in Ireland in the 1930s, when we had no money.  Governments in other jurisdictions, such as Singapore - which is not bastion of trendy, leftist socialism but which is, rather, a bastion of capitalism - have solved their housing problems.  We could use compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, in respect of land.  Local authorities already know where homes can be built.  We could zone land for housing, only once it is in State control.  We could use CPOs for the disgraceful 200,000 vacant and derelict sites that still blight our towns and villages.  We use CPOs all the time for infrastructure like roads and railways so why not for housing? Surely housing infrastructure is one of the most fundamental for our health, well-being and prosperity in the State.  As well as building houses, we could extend a Government-backed mortgage scheme to all.</p> <p>I ask that the Minister of State will listen to concerns of people talking about housing concerns, including NGOs.  I am glad he will not gag them.  Will he accept that the housing system is broken and that this is threatening the hard-won jobs recovery and prosperity for which we all fought? Is the Minister of State open to accepting radical thinking and ideas in respect of this matter such as those put into practice in Singapore and elsewhere?</p></speech>

I was attending a meeting of the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government at which the Fianna F&aacute;il Bill to refurbish vacant housing stock was being considered.  It is a really welcome Bill.  We are all aware of empty units above retail premises in our towns, cities and villages that could be used as housing stock.</p><p>I and my colleagues in the Seanad Civil Engagement group brought forward the Derelict and Vacant Sites Bill 2017 almost a year ago.  The aim of the latter was to bring the significant amount of unused land and derelict sites back into circulation by the introduction of a 6% levy, which was higher than one suggested by the then Government.  The Bill was rejected by the former Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, on grounds of constitutional protection of private property.  Since then, thankfully, the Government has increased the levy to a maximum of 7%.  I was very happy to see the Government change its mind on this matter.  Essentially, it is now a case of use it or lose it.  If a potential charge is put on the vacant site then people are certainly going to start using it.</p><p>We have seen the Government and the Minister of State's party's compromise on its insistence that capping rent was an impossibility.  The creation of a 4% cap in rent rises in rent pressure zones is a welcome recognition that the rights of landlords cannot be the only consideration in our approach to housing.</p><p>The Green Party will soon introduce the Living Cities Bill in the D&aacute;il.  That legislation proposes a comprehensive approach to ending dereliction and waste on our city streets.  I hope that the Government will be able to greet such a move more openly than they did last year.</p><p>The other issue I would like to discuss is the conditions currently facing those renting in Ireland.  This week alone, we have heard two horror stories in Dublin.  The first was the shocking and illegal eviction of tenants on Mountjoy Square.  They were victims, seemingly, of their landlord&rsquo;s ire after he failed to impose an illegal rent increase above the 4% last year, and on which the Residential Tenancies Board found against the landlord.  Most of the affected tenants are from abroad, guests in our country, who have come here to live, work, study, share their experience and make a home.  Instead they have been met with greed, criminality and brute force.</p><p>A story in <i>The</i><i>Irish Times</i>today<i></i>highlights the shockingly substandard and overpriced accommodation on offer to those who are priced out of even the cheapest offers on <i>daft.ie</i>and other websites.  This morning, Senators Swanick and Higgins mentioned the legacy of Michael Davitt, the founder of the Irish National Land League, whose work seems sadly unfinished in today&rsquo;s Ireland.  We still have as much need as ever for the first two of his &quot;three Fs&quot; - fair rent and fixity of tenure.  I have added an alternative third F, namely, favourable accommodation.  This is the right to live in a space that is suited to people&rsquo;s needs and is respectful of their dignity.</p><p>We have heard again about the gradual progress of Rebuilding Ireland.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Grace O'Sullivan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2467"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2467&amp;amp;pid=GraceOSullivan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is to be welcomed but what is required is a far more radical approach to housing that recognises it as a right, not an investment opportunity only.</p></speech>

It is a very important one and we should put it in context.  Senator Boyhan was right in what he said.

We want to see people housed.  As a politician working on the ground and working with the Minister of State, Deputy English, I want to see people housed in decent, quality accommodation.  That is challenge we face.  Senator Coffey was right in his comment to the effect that there was a dysfunctionality in our housing market.  I attended a briefing in Cork City Council in November 2017 for the Oireachtas representatives and there is activity taking place in Cork.  Houses are being built and acquired and they are not being acquired in run down, run-of-the-mill places.  They are being acquired in decent good places-----</p></speech>

Let us put this in perspective and not have the och&oacute;n agus the och&oacute;n.  There are challenges.  We understand that.  We had a banking system that collapsed.  People could not get money.  Those in the construction sector could not get people to work and they could not be financed.  As the Minister of State said, the local authorities have to employ people.  I also agree with Senator Boyhan that a group should be added to the housing summit, namely, our city and county councillors, who would bring a wealth of experience and ideas to the table.</p> <p>Let us reflect on what we are doing.  We are rebuilding Ireland from the depths of the worst economic recession we ever had.  I remind Members that the troika was here.  Nobody would give us money.  Senator Humphreys was a Minister of State at that time and was in government for three or four years.  He knew what it was like.  He was in government with my party.  We took decisions that we would never take in normal peacetime, as the former T&aacute;naiste, Eamon Gilmore, said, but we were at war economically.  We rebuilt the country socially out of the ashes of the legacies of the past.  We had to then to rebuild the infrastructure in terms of our roads and buildings.  I remember in the summer of 2011 there was not a crane to be seen in Cork city until John Cleary took a brave move to build in Mahon.  I am sorry if I am boring Senator Devine but those are the facts.</p></speech>

I certainly welcome announcement by the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, on the affordable mortgages scheme.  It will help some but not enough people.  We face challenges in delivering affordable housing, addressing rental costs and in allowing, as Senator Boyhan said, everybody to have access to a home and a roof over their heads.  </p> <p>We must also reflect on how we got into this situation.  I had the honour to work with community groups in the Dublin Docklands Development Authority along with Councillor Dermot Lacey when we developed the 20% social and affordable housing provision.  The split was 10% social and 10% affordable housing.  Credit must be given to the former Minister, Noel Dempsey, who came down and examined that provision and took it on board as part of Government policy.  I would consider him to have been probably one of the best Ministers with responsibility for the environment that we have had in recent years.  He championed the 10% social and 10% affordable housing provision while he was Minister.  Unfortunately, he was not Minister for long enough.  We then had the former Minister, Martin Cullen and the influence of the Progressive Democrats on that Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government.  Martin Cullen's changing of the regulation with respect to the 10% social and 10% affordable housing provision meant that right through the boom era, no social or affordable housing was built.  That was directly related to Martin Cullen, and the influence the Progressive Democrats had on that Government.  It destroyed our housing stock over that period.  We have to learn that lesson and not make the same mistake again.  I was part of the Government, as was the Minister of State, Deputy English, that tried to start house building again.  That is why a regulation was introduced that there would be no opt out of the 10% provision; there would be no buy-out or alternative -  many local authorities had taken a buy-out instead of providing housing - and that was a good decision.  </p> <p>Now the economy has moved on and we need to look at other solutions.  Following on from the Leader's comments, I have always got down and dirty when it has come to building houses.  We had the city housing initiative, which operated out of the Ringsend area, and resulted in the building of affordable homes.  Many tens of families were housed because of its work and the cross-party assistance provided.  I have also identified social housing need and worked to deliver social housing against the local community's wishes because there is always an element of nimbyism, in that people want social houses but they want them built somewhere else.  We saw that, unfortunately, with the proposed rapid-build housing across this country.  I use the word "unfortunately", because we must remember that the new members of communities are the people who rebuild communities.</p> <p>We need to take action and we need to do so now.  We need to look at low-hanging fruit.  I have raised the issue of Airbnb or short-term lets with the Minister of State on many occasions.  Airbnb is used as the handy word to describe short-term lets.  We have seen in Dublin that the migration of long-term lets to short-term lets in area stretching from Phibsborough to Stoneybatter to Ringsend has had a disastrous impact on housing.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Kevin Humphreys:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2289"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I have stated repeatedly to the Minister of State, Deputy English, that action by the Government could put 3,000 additional units back into the housing market in the Dublin region alone.  That is a tough decision because of the impact on the tourism sector to forgo that income to put families for whom these homes were designed into them.  That is the decision I have asked the Government to make repeatedly.  The former Minister, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, set up a working group and there was no report.  The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, introduced a working group and we still have not seen a report from it.  Two circular letters were issued, one by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and one by the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  In fairness, Deputy Eoghan Murphy has stated he will be looking at enforcement regulations and results.</p><p>I ask the Minister of State, Deputy English, to investigate.  Is he aware that the interpretation of the planning laws is that residences of four bedrooms or fewer do not need planning permission to become short-term lets?  That has been the decision of planning enforcement officers and no enforcement action has been taken against them.  That is disastrous for Dublin, Cork and Galway because we will see greater migration of two-up two-down homes to short-term letting, thereby putting families into hotels and tourists into homes.  That is unacceptable.  Unfortunately, it is due to the failure of the Government to take action.  It is not as though it has not been highlighted.  It is not as though it has not been brought to the Minister of State's attention because I am sick of bringing it to the Government's attention.  I see on a daily basis family homes being turned into short-term lets.  It has had an enormous impact on the community I live in because it has made people who go out to work every day homeless.  That is a grave indictment of the Government.</p><p>In a Commencement debate March last, I asked the Minister of State to bring forward a pilot scheme for affordable and cost rental accommodation.  Deputy English may remember, in the old Chamber, stating that we do not need a pilot scheme and that it was the intention of the Government to bring forward a national scheme.  He has failed.  What we have seen in the recent announcement by the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is a pilot scheme on affordable and cost rental accommodation for D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  We have wasted nearly a year.  The matter was highlighted and nothing was done.</p><p>I will highlight another issue that the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, referred to in the D&aacute;il, that is, the development of Poolbeg west.  Poolbeg west, which is in the centre of Dublin, has the potential to deal with a supply issue within the city.  It involves 3,500 units.  The 10% requirement will give us 350 social housing units.  There has been a commercial agreement to which Dublin City Council, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the receiver are party.  I have been informed that those units may not be affordable.  We have no clear definition of affordable housing.  That strategic development zone, SDZ, is currently before An Bord Plean&aacute;la with the proviso of 10% affordable housing.  The commercial agreement is outstanding.  It is with great reluctance, and because of inaction by the Department, that I say that if the first planning permission going to An Bord Plean&aacute;la on that site does not include affordable units, cost rental accommodation or affordable rental accommodation, I will challenge that.  I will seek discovery papers from the Department, the receiver and Dublin City Council because I believe they will no longer be commercially sensitive.  It will be a clear breach of an agreement across the three bodies.  The Department was on the phone to Dublin City Council as that vote went through Dublin City Council.  The Department is a party to the agreement, so is the receiver.  The councillors, in good faith, voted for that in the commercial agreement.  If that agreement is broken - the Minister of State should be very careful - I will take the Department through the courts.</p></speech>

I thank him for his address which outlines clearly a major amount of progress and welcome the fact that there is a full acknowledgement that there is a long way to go to correct a situation that evolved over the past number of decades stemming mainly from the financial crisis and our inability to fund housing in the way that we would have liked.  As the Leader pointed out, there was a Troika coming into this country every three months wanting a report and not prepared to write a cheque for the next three months to keep the country going if it did not like what it saw.</p> <p>I acknowledge the work that has been done.  I particularly welcome the affordable housing initiative.  I welcome the affordable mortgage initiative and I welcome the affordable rental initiative.  All these three initiatives will go towards helping ease the problem.  Clearly, there is much more to be done.</p> <p>My main purpose today is to try to ensure that the new national planning framework document, which is only in draft form and will be the subject of much more consultation, does not unintentionally make matters worse rather than better.  I want to specify a couple of issues that concern me, and, indeed, concern the planners in Fingal.</p> <p>The object of the plan is something I agree with entirely, that we should have a balancing of the west coast and the east coast, try to revitalise rural Ireland, and try to bring more population and jobs to the major urban areas outside Dublin by which I mean Limerick, Cork, Galway, Waterford and towns such as Sligo in the north west.  However, I am concerned specifically about the fact that we have a determination that 50% of housing in the Dublin area should be in Dublin city and suburbs.  This excludes Fingal.  It excludes Swords.  The population of Swords, when one includes Kinsealy, is 45,000.  It is a considerably larger town than Drogheda, which seeks city status.  It is also where we have the youngest population in the country, where many jobs are being created, and we want these young people to be able to have their families and live in Fingal.</p> <p>In Dublin city itself, a third of the houses must be built on brownfield sites.  This will drive up the value of these sites and drive up the cost of housing if we are not careful.  </p> <p>In relation to Fingal, having been excluded from 50% of the possible houses to be built, a further 30% have to be on brownfield sites.  That means a ratio of brownfield site houses to greenfield site houses of 1:2.  We have thousands of acres zoned in Fingal, with plans for 4,000 houses in the Donabate area alone.  There are more planned in Balbriggan, and Swords, as I say, has lots of land with planning permission available.  We also have plans for the metro, which may be slightly longer term.  We have plans for the electrification of the northern line, which is something that could and I hope will happen quickly.  With the infrastructure, both in place and planned, it does not make sense to have people having to leave Fingal.  Meaning no disrespect to the Minister of State, some of the planners in Fingal have pointed out that many people in Fingal would have to move to Navan but, although Navan is a fine place, they wish to stay within Fingal.  In addition, we had great news today that the Bank of America is coming to Dublin, and we heard its concerns around housing and schools.  Of course, thanks to the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, we have plenty of schools being built in Fingal and other areas.  I would hope there will be further consultation.</p> <p>I am looking forward to direct consultation with the Minister's team to address these issues.  They are of serious concern.  What I am concerned about is the unintended consequences that might result from the draft I have seen.  I hope we will have plenty of time to address this issue and modify the draft.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator James Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2180"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I congratulate the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Murphy, for the energy and effort they have put into this and for the many initiatives the Minister of State pointed out in his speeches recently and today.

I would ask that he puts an urgent redress scheme in place for those householders.  There is no way they can go through another winter, given the state their houses are in.  I again thank the Minister of State for coming and I understand that he knows the urgency of this issue.</p> <p>In Mayo, approximately 4,000 people are on the waiting list for housing schemes.  I fundamentally disagree with Senator Boyhan on this, when he said that it does not matter where the houses come from.  It really is the drive for privatisation which has left us in a situation where we are spending millions of euro on rental payments to private landlords when that money should be used for building houses.  I am not saying that it all should be used to build houses, but the vast majority of it should.</p> <p>Almost 4,000 people have housing needs in Mayo, and there is a proposed building programme which seeks to build 600 houses before 2021.  The Minister of State knows that, with the best will in the world, it is not going to happen.  Having worked in the local authority it concerns me that there is huge bureaucracy in the planning stages between the Department and the local authority.  It is not a case of the local authority being tardy with all of this; the bureaucracy slows it all down.  We have to find a way of speeding up the whole process.  The Government will say that there is plenty of money available to build houses and yet we cannot get them built.  There is a blockage there which needs to be addressed.  </p> <p>There is no doubt that we are in a housing crisis, and it really alarms me to hear Senator Buttimer say that it depends on perspective.  I stay in hotels when I am in Dublin and see the children who are living in them.  It makes me wonder what perspective they are going to have growing up, and what their perspective on the Governments and the society that let them down will be.  It is not about perspective.  It is about reality.  Attempts are being made to normalise this.  It can never be normal for a child to be homeless and to have to live in a hotel room.  The real urgency of the crisis we are in must be realised and understood.  Forget about the spin and the manufacturing of the numbers.  We need housing.  People deserve a home as a right.  I acknowledge the good things that are being done, and the cross-party work that has been done.  We are in a crisis from the perspective of people who need the housing, but also the stability of our whole country, including Dublin, is at risk because of the lack of housing.  </p> <p>I want to speak about the housing schemes, specifically the HAP scheme, the mobility aids grant and the housing adaptation grant, and to tell the Minister of State of the real problems that are there.  While Government will say there is plenty of money for housing and homes, barriers are being put up.  Barriers are in place in terms of age limits.  One once had to be 60 to avail of housing aid for older people.  There are also barriers regarding heating.  It was said that grants were available through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI.  Those grants are not now available through SEAI, so many homes are really not habitable because they do not have basic heating.  I ask the Minister of State to ask the local authorities to lift that ban on funding heating within homes, because there is no point in having a grant for windows or anything else if the basic heating system is not working.  The Minister of State should act on that as a matter of urgency.  It would be appreciated. </p> <p>The Minister of State should also look at situations where an elderly person is living with somebody, a carer, for example, or someone who needs to live with the elderly person.  That should not exclude them from getting an essential housing repair grant.  It should not exclude them, and it is being used again as an excuse.  The Minister of State should give a direction to the local authorities in this regard.  It would really help the situation. </p> <p>There are very many more issues.  We seek at all times to be constructive in order to solve this housing crisis in any way we can.  </p></speech>

Article 19 states, "Persons with disabilities have the opportunity to chose their place of residence or where and with whom they will live on a equal basis with others."  That is something the Government is committed to, and it has said it is going to ratify it.  It will ratify it in a number of weeks.  This has to be in place this year, otherwise we are being sold a pup.  I do not believe we are, but the work has to be done on it.</p> <p>On 13 July 2016, every party and entity unanimously agreed to a motion that sought to confirm that the Government's action plan on housing would include specific commitments to delivering housing for people with disabilities, that it would provide an annual update from local authorities of the number of social housing units and would ensure that housing projects supported by public funding, including Part V, would provide a percentage of pre-planned and reserved housing units, etc.  There was a request that the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government would draft a work programme which would routinely consider and review Government progress.  It is 18 months since that was done.  That needs to be picked up on, and I believe the House should have an update on that fairly soon.</p> <p>The week after that motion, Rebuilding Ireland was announced.  There were a few paragraphs in it about people with disabilities, and it covered the strategies for those people.  What I said then was very telling, and I believe it is coming home to roost now.  We have known since 2013 that there were 3,319 people with disabilities on the social housing list.  That information was gathered through the local authorities and was provided to the Minister of State's Department.  There was not even a mention of those 4,000 people in it.  </p></speech>

I thank her for coming to the House.  Sinn F&eacute;in has supported and will continue to support the Bill.  Merging institutes of technology has the potential to enhance regional development and build stronger and more dynamic academic institutions.  I pay tribute to the staff and students of the institutes of technology who have borne the brunt in recent years of chronic underfunding, lack of resources and staff shortages.  They have strived to achieve their institutes' academic objectives, retained a working level of quality and created valued graduates.  This has been in the face of a Government policy of indifference in the third-level sector.  Students and staff alike have seen funding and access levels brought beyond critical point and strived on regardless.  I stress, as did my Sinn F&eacute;in colleague, Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il in 2015, that all the efforts of institute of technology amalgamation will be in vain if staff continue to be underresourced and students fail to get fair and achievable access to third level.</p> <p>While I appreciate the scale of the operation proposed, the streamlining of individual institutes of technology into single structures must be a robust process involving constant consultation with staff, students and their respective unions rather than one dictated by the Department, the HEA and college management.  There are particular concerns about the definition of "student union".  The proposed wording in the Bill suggests that a student union must be recognised by its respective technological university in order to retain legitimacy.  This fails to value the longstanding histories of student unions, the mandate they receive from their students to represent them and their right to autonomy.  The proposed definition sets a bad precedent and could lead to instances in which technological university management could disregard the validity of a student union.  I am interested to hear the Minister of State's thoughts on this.  She meets regularly with the Union of Students in Ireland, which is particularly concerned about this.  I have met members of Technical University for Dublin student unions who have similar concerns.  As a trade union official for over ten years, I could not sign up to this.  It does not sit well that the university can decide whether the student union has standing.  The teaching unions would not agree to that and the student union should not have lesser standing.  It is not helpful in terms of where we all want to go, especially as we want to support the Bill.  There were strong feelings among the students and their representatives who we met last week and I hope that we can work together across the Chamber to achieve consensus.</p> <p>I am concerned that the proposed Bill does not guarantee parity of esteems for student unions in terms of representation on governing bodies and academic councils.  Student unions offer representation at key decision-making levels from the largest body within a university or institute of technology.  It could be argued that students represent the largest cohort within a college and that their union has received the most legitimate mandate to speak as a representative body.  To fail to give them fair representation denies this and devalues students as a whole.</p> <p>A number of amendments on this matter, which were tabled by my colleague, Deputy Funchion, were declared out of order in the D&aacute;il.  They sought to increase the number of seats at the table for students.  I ask the Minister of State to revisit the point.  More seats at the table will not impose a cost on the State.  They will not cost the State anything financially.  Anyone who has had any experience of a governing body will know that.  I ask the Minister of State to consider this properly moving forward and to propose amendments which provide for effective student representation as set out in the HEA's own best-practice policies.</p> <p>I commend the Minister of State and the Department on their engagement with the TUI to strike an agreement and address the key concerns of staff.  On behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in, I note that we will not support amendments or aspects of the Bill which may seek to diminish what has already been agreed by the Department and the TUI.  Hopefully, it will not come to that.  Sinn F&eacute;in is supportive of the Bill and its objectives but we stress that the student voice does not have parity in the proposed new structure.  Agreements similar to those concluded with the TUI can be struck with students.  It requires a desire on the part of the Department to give students that equal say.  I appeal to the Minister of State's colleagues in the Department to have a further look at this.  I think they will find that there is a broad consensus in the Chamber on the matter.</p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in agrees with the idea of technological universities, but in its current form the legislation raises some concerns.  We retain the right to bring forward amendments to address these matters on Committee Stage and will withdraw support for the Bill if these are not addressed adequately.</p></speech>

I noted from the Minister of State's speech yesterday that she has already accepted a number of amendments to strengthen the Bill in the D&aacute;il, which is a good approach to adopt in respect of legislation on a critical issue like education.  I recognise the fact that the Bill was introduced on the back of the report on the national strategy in education 2030 and the recommendations contained therein.  The report recommended significant reform and consolidation in the institutes of technology sector to allow these bodies to progress to technological university status where they reach certain standards and performance criteria.</p> <p>I support the Bill, albeit a number of aspects worry me.  The Minister of State may be able to assuage those worries for me.  While consolidation may refer to building efficiency and collaboration within the sector, it may also refer to protecting a cost base for other reasons within third level institutes.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paudie Coffey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2237"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2237&amp;amp;pid=PaudieCoffey&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Legitimate questions have been raised in that regard: is it consolidation of an existing budget or, rather, it using the budget more efficiently to better serve our citizens and education?  I suspect it is the latter - to serve our citizens and education in a better and more holistic way.  I welcome the multiple references to the regions by the Minister of State in her contribution, to which I will return.</p><p>The institutes of technology are not being forced into this process.  There is a voluntary application process whereby an institute must collaborate with two or more institutes to achieve technological university status.  In order to achieve such university status, it is important that they fulfil the performance criteria laid out under section 28.  I note those criteria, which it is important to state for the record.  The criteria set out in a robust performance threshold for institutions that wish to become technological universities include the composition of the student body, which must contain a certain number of students; the composition of the academic staff; doctoral level education and research activities; and the ability to perform the functions of a technological university, with particular reference to its governance structures, links to regional stakeholders, collaborations with other institutes, quality assurance and enhancement and the mobility of staff and students.  Those are rightly very high standards and they must be met.</p><p>I wish to focus on the regional aspects of the Bill because the south-east region, from which I come, is the only region in the country that does not have access to a university.  That has had a direct consequence for and impact on the economy of the region.  In recent years, more than half of students in leaving certificate classes have left the region to attend higher level education elsewhere.  That is worrying because Waterford and Carlow institutes of technology are excellent institutions.  However, even with them in place, almost two thirds of leaving certificate students leave the region.  That would be fine if they were leaving the region for education and returning thereafter but many find employment outside the region and, unfortunately, continue to reside outside the region.  They do not come home.  That is having an impact on the region in terms of brain drain, educational attainment at higher level, as is evident from the CSO statistics, and there are direct consequences for the local economy in terms of the quality of jobs, the attractiveness of the region and retail spend.  Everything across society in the south east is affected because there is no local university.  The Bill, which I thank the Government and Minister of State for bringing forward, presents an opportunity for Waterford and Carlow institutes of technology to progress a joint application in order that a technological university for the south east be developed.</p><p>However, concerns have been raised which the Minister of State may be able to address in her response or on later Stages.  There is often resistance at various levels to a proposed change but the concerns in this regard include the fear that this is a merger process to consolidate finances.  I do not agree with such concerns, and nor does the Minister of State, as she has indicated, but that must be publicly addressed.  Some opponents of the legislation and technological universities mergers have stated that it is only a change of the name over the door.  I do not agree with that view.  For the Bill to be successful, we need to engage the public and stakeholders and spell out how this reform of higher level education can bring benefits to the regions.  The institutes of technology have expertise and work very closely with industry and in the regions in terms of apprenticeships, construction, science and engineering and have now expanded into humanities, business and legal degrees.</p><p>The Bill is a huge opportunity and I welcome it but it remains to be seen how effective it will be on the ground.  I encourage the institutes of technology, in particular in my own region of Waterford and Carlow, to come together, as they have done in a very positive way, to deliver for the citizens of the south-east region.  It is long overdue.  The Bill lays a pathway for delivery of high quality third level degrees that can build and deliver for the south-east region as other universities have in their areas.</p></speech>

The amendments, tabled by my colleague, Deputy Catherine Martin, dealt with the need for technological universities to have an ethos focused on research and knowledge rather than one dominated by commercialism.  Deputy Martin also raised a number of issues with the Bill that have not been resolved, such as the lack of provision for sufficient student representation on the governing body and academic council of the new technological universities; an inappropriate prioritisation of business and enterprise over social and cultural factors that could undermine the status of Ireland&rsquo;s current universities as leaders in unbiased knowledge creation; the lack of protection for collective academic freedom, including that of PhD students, to direct research in new and innovative ways, such as in renewable energy, gender or ecological studies; and a lack of regional community representatives on the board or governing body of a technological university.  I will be putting forward a number of amendments to address these matters as the Bill progresses through the House.</p><p>As a public representative from Waterford, I have several concerns with the Bill and the process by which it has been put before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  First, the Bill was introduced to the D&aacute;il at short notice and Second Stage was dealt with by the previous D&aacute;il.  Thus, the wider, overarching issues of technological universities, and the effects of amalgamating rural institutes of technology in particular, have never been fully debated by the current D&aacute;il.  Secondly, the Joint Committee on Education and Skills, with the exception of Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, who was Minister at the time, is almost entirely composed of new Members, none of whom were on the equivalent committee of the Thirty-first D&aacute;il, which dealt with the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill.  The deliberative process of this substantial 96-page Bill has been rushed, thereby hampering the deliberations of public representatives.  </p><p>If the Bill is passed, Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, and Institute of Technology Carlow will merge to form a technological university for the south east.  The people of Waterford and the south east have never been content with WIT&rsquo;s designation as an institute of technology.  We believe that a city-region of Waterford&rsquo;s size needs an academic body with full university status and that WIT deserves that designation.  However, there are concerns that the planned technological university for the south east may be based in Kilkenny rather than Waterford.  I will be seeking assurances from the Minister of State in that regard.  These concerns are compounded by the sometimes less than perfect working relationship between the Carlow and Waterford institutes, as detailed in the 2015 Kelly report.</p><p>Despite the hard and determined work of Waterford City and County Council under its chief executive, Michael Walsh, Waterford city is still struggling economically and socially.  An ESRI study published this week shows that the south east will have the lowest job growth in Ireland in the coming years.  The Government needs to commit to a national planning framework that progresses sustainable development and equality across the country.  An improperly managed merger underwritten by a foundational lack of trust between the parties will not improve matters.  This issue deserves more deliberation and I would appreciate the time to so do.</p><p>I wish to express concerns relayed to me from WIT academics that the Bill as it stands may produce watered-down academic standards and that, as stated by Dr. Ray Griffin in last Monday&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>, we are in danger of &quot;taking out the educational engine of the regions&quot;.  Waterford has had previous bad experiences with grandstanding on academic matters such as the designation of Waterford Regional Hospital as University Hospital Waterford under the former Minister for Health, Senator James Reilly, in 2014.  We were promised that the change would deliver greater resources and staff and expertise for Waterford hospital but such resources did not emerge.  There is a lack of 24-7 cardiac care services in Waterford and lip service has been paid to the O&rsquo;Higgins report, with both those failings contributing to the recent tragic death of Thomas Power.</p><p>I am seeking reassurance that any merger of WIT will result in a technological university renowned as an international centre of excellence that will radically add capacity to the region's higher education system and allow the young people of Waterford and the surrounding counties to remain in the region.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Grace O'Sullivan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2467"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2467&amp;amp;pid=GraceOSullivan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We do not want to see the same mistakes with University Hospital Waterford play out with the loss of WIT.

It is important that consultation has been held with TUI, IMPACT, USI and the Technological Higher Education Association.  I was glad to see the Minister of State accept a number of amendments in the D&aacute;il.  Some of them were very constructive and positive, in particular the amendments which related to ensuring that we underscore the social, community and creative role technological universities can play.  It was mentioned by one of my colleagues today that we have increasingly seen these institutes of technology not only lead in various areas of technology, but be at the driving edge and moving forward in areas such as the humanities and the arts.  For example, Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology has had an excellent reputation in the arts for a while.  In fact, it was questioned in correspondence I received on the Bill whether "technological" was the appropriate heading for the Technological Universities Bill but I imagine that ship has sailed.</p> <p>This week, we have seen the research developed in the dairy sector and in agritech and the strong business and community engagement here.  The key point, however, is that when we speak about partnership between these institutions, which will now become universities, that it is not only about partnership with business but that we also talk about partnership with communities and public partnership.  We hear about public private partnership, but what of public public partnership?  We know that there is much to be learned from other states as they try to face up to practical and logistical challenges on the ground and it will be interesting to see how these new technological universities intersect with similar universities in other areas.  I am thinking of the polytechnics in the United Kingdom which have been a driving force in many areas. </p> <p>The record of the institutes of technology throughout the country has been exemplary in terms of delivering a wide diversity of courses in technical and applied skills and, in particular, in ensuring a diversity of students.  There has been engagement with and support of a diversity of students with what many would see as a more flexible and holistic approach than that seen in many other universities.  It is important that this is not lost and that it remains core within the work of any future universities.  As a result of this holistic approach and the understanding of the difficulties many students and prospective students often face, I believe the presidents of the institutes of technology have had a stronger and more accurate reading of the possible impact of student loans and I support their position on the Cassells report.  That is a matter for separate discussion, however.</p> <p>If we move towards having technological universities, there needs to be an increase in resources.  We are now moving into a position where research will not just be carried out where there are external partners.  These technological universities must be given the resources to set their own agenda to drive, for example, frontier and basic research forward.  We need to ensure that the space given to other universities-----</p></speech>

I have discussed with the Minister of State and others the amendments that I will probably table.  First, a students' union needs to be recognised as a students' union and to include "other student representative body" is not adequate or acceptable and this cannot be allowed go through.  Any of us who have worked in a union know of false unions.  Will this be a representative sample?  Will the university just pick three people from each year?  We need to be very clear about student union representation and the situation needs to be clarified.</p> <p>The Minister of State mentioned student representation on the academic council, which I welcome, but this needs to be provided for in the Bill.  If we are talking about a community of learning, it needs to be clear that student voices are to be heard on the council.  A key concern of ours at the moment-----</p></speech>

A key concern is that the Bill provides for "at least one and not more than 2" students on the governing board of a technological university.  What about where we have three campuses?  For example, there may be a campus in Galway, Sligo and Mayo.  It is important that a student from each institute of technology feeding into the process would be part of the governing body and feeding into the governance.  That is a key concern.</p> <p>My final point is that institutes of technology which do not opt for a merger or for the technological university route must be assured that they will be given resources and supported.  The Minister of State has emphasised that this is a choice for institutes to make but it is important to recognise that they will still play an essential role in and be part of the places in which they are located.  I look forward to Committee Stage and to engaging further with the Minister of State.</p></speech>

Some 65% of children who entered primary school this year will work in a type of job that does not currently exist.  This poses challenges for the education system and the third level sector in particular needs to be able to adapt to meet these challenges.  The Technological Universities Bill is an</p><p>important development in this regard, building on the excellent record of the institutes of technology and what they have contributed to Irish education and society since their inception.</p><p>The Bill allows for the incorporation of a number of existing institutes of technology into technological universities.  Where these mergers make geographic and educational sense, they have the potential to offer significant benefits for the sector, for students, for their community and for the development of the regions in which they are located.  Ten of the existing institutes are currently in the process of setting up such consortia and I wish them every success in that endeavour.</p><p>The fact that the remaining institutes of technology have not chosen to go down this road should not, however, be seen as a lack of ambition on their part.  In my home town, for example, Athlone Institute of Technology, AIT, has provided a superlative service to the midlands and to education in Ireland, with over 5,400 students currently engaged in all levels of study there.  Since its inception in 1970, it has adapted and changed to meet the needs of the region.  Living up to its motto &ldquo;Connect and Discover&rdquo;, it uses feedback from students, industry and community, to constantly improve the range and relevance of the courses it offers.  These efforts were recognised recently when it was named <i>The Times </i>institute of technology of the year, outstripping all other institutes of technology and rivalling some of the established universities.</p><p>On the type of criteria that are used to determine university status, Athlone Institute of Technology is one of the leaders in terms of these metrics.  Whether it is the percentage of staff with a PhD, the level of research activity or the diversity of the student population, AIT can match the best.  The fact that AIT did not take part in any of the consortia was not a sign of insufficient standard or lack of ambition or preparation, rather, it indicates a brave and nuanced analysis of the situation.  If the regional or geographical realities do not make sense or if there is not an educational synergy, going down the road of amalgamation just for the sake of fitting in to the policy of the day is the wrong decision to make.  I support the institute in its approach.</p><p>In terms of future development options for these colleges, it is not sufficient to say that their only option is to join up with one of the new technological universities at some stage down the road.  If an amalgamation does not make sense today, it may not make sense in five or ten years&rsquo; time either.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gabrielle McFadden:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2399"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2399&amp;amp;pid=GabrielleMcFadden&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We must also consider allowing them to build alliances with one of the traditional universities or to grow and develop appropriately in their own right.</p><p>In areas where the use of consortia makes sense, I wish them every success.

As Senator Higgins said, there was huge engagement on the part of the Department in respect of the Bill.  That is to be welcomed because it is a better Bill as a result.  This is important legislation.  The Minister of State said it is "critical legislation for the higher education sector and another important step in the advancement of the National Strategy for Higher Education."  Senator Grace O'Sullivan rightly indicated that it is about ensuring the management of the change that will evolve is done properly.  I fully agree with the Senator and the Minister of State that this must be done in consultation and in the context of a holistic approach.  It is very important to get it right from the outset.  I am very confident that the approach being taken by the Minister of State indicates that she will do this.</p> <p>Engagement with staff and students has been critical.  The Munster technological university will add to the local economy.  It will bring a benefit to the south-west region.  In an earlier debate, Senators discussed jobs.  This university will add to the south-west region, especially Cork, from where I come.  It will make the area more desirable to come to, to locate in and to live in.  It will offer different opportunities for people.</p> <p>With regard to Cork and Tralee institutes of technology, the technological university will offer more competencies and it will bring a value to research.  We are aware that in the higher education structure research has never been so important.  As Senator Coffey has referred to it must be more than just the changing of the branding over the door or on the letterhead.  I am confident that it will be more.</p> <p>I have had meetings and correspondence with a variety of stakeholders, one of whom was from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.  I am very familiar with some of the ICTU representatives in Cork who, I believe, are very capable, competent and sensible people.  These representatives are speaking about the composition of the external seats on the governing body.  They make a fair request about looking for a seat.  I wonder if this could be looked at again at a later stage.</p> <p>We all welcome the debate on this Bill.  It is about progressing to technological universities.  It is about ensuring that we have competencies and a better higher education structure.  Concerns have, however, been expressed to me about the composition of the academic council in the Munster technological university and the proportionality regarding the Tralee and Cork institutes.  I understand the Minister of State may not have the answer today - that is fine because I do not expect her to have it - but I hope it would be a proportionate composition in the case of Cork and Tralee.</p> <p>Cork Institute of Technology engenders a sense of positivity.  I congratulate the college and the staff on the growth of the institute, and on its ambition.  The issue of the academic council is an important question that has been raised with me.  Cork Institute of Technology has always been progressive.  If we look back to when it was a regional technical college, and see where it is now with the growth and what the college has done, it is a huge credit.  it is an important institution in Cork.</p> <p>I do not wish to speak disparagingly about anybody, but the deficit and the questions and anxieties need to be addressed around Cork and Tralee ITs.  I am Cork person, and I will speak for Cork.  It is very important.  The issue of apprenticeships also needs to be addressed as part of the Bill.  During the Order of Business in the Seanad we hear repeatedly about the need for apprenticeships.  There is a competency issue in that regard.</p> <p>The Bill and the creation of the technological universities will benefit graduates, colleges and the economy.  I may not agree with Senator Higgins on many things but I agree with her comments to the effect that the details need to be teased out on Committee Stage and Report Stage.</p> <p>I could say a lot more but I shall conclude.  I appreciate that I may have spoken for more than my five minutes.  I will speak on the Bill again on Committee Stage.  The Minister of State has demonstrated a willingness to listen and to engage.  I am aware that the Green Party has spoken about this issue in the D&aacute;il but the Minister of State deserves great credit for getting us to where we are today.  I thank her for that.  We have a road to travel.  There are issues around the students' union that need to be looked at, that I personally agree with.  The Minister of State may not be able to do something on that, but that is fair enough.  We are, however, in a good place with this Bill and it is to the credit of the Minister of State that we have go here.  The Minister of State has engaged with the TUI, academics, students and staff.  I commend all who are involved, especially the staff.  I have spent a long time waiting to say this and I wish to speak on this.  We lost the Bill in 2015 when the general election came around.  It is important to say that there was huge engagement-----</p></speech>

I very much welcome this Bill, which will establish technological universities with strong regional ties to support development.  In particular, I welcome the forming of the Connacht-Ulster alliance, of Galway-Mayo, Sligo and Letterkenny institutes of technology.</p> <p>It is very important that we have increased co-operation in the sector and on a regional level to ensure our technological universities are best placed to compete at national and international levels.</p> <p>My Roscommon-Galway constituency does not have an institute of technology currently, but we are surrounded by regions that have institutes of technology and our area must not be left out in the move towards increased co-operation.  There is a significant wealth of industry experience right across our region and when institutes link together it is very important that we create and continue to forge stronger links with industry across the region.  We want our students to access employment and we need to identify the employment sectors with increased opportunities.</p> <p>There have been a number of amendments to the Bill.  These are especially relevant in the context of existing staff and how they would transfer.  The variety of choice in courses has also been raised as an issue.  It is important that this choice continues to be available right across the institutes.  It is essential to ensure that prospective students have the greatest level of choice possible.  Many students in my community commute on a daily basis - be it to Sligo or Letterkenny institutes of technology - and it is essential that we ensure the current level of choice available in our institutes is maintained.</p> <p>I welcome all the work that has been done across the entire sector.  While it is important to have increased co-operation between the ITs, it is also critical to forge stronger links with industry to identify employment opportunities for our graduates.</p></speech>

I have taken a note of what the Senators have said and the concerns that have been raised.  I thank the Senators for their informed and interesting contributions to the Technological Universities Bill made yesterday and again today.  I wholeheartedly agree with the views expressed regarding the high quality of institutes of technology.  A number of the institutes of technology were referenced, including Carlow and Limerick yesterday and Waterford today.  Senator Hopkins spoke about the lack of an institute of technology in Roscommon and the fact that many students from her county go to many different institutes of technology in the area.</p><p>As I said in my speech yesterday, the institute of technology sector has always striven to deliver a first class service to students, businesses, enterprises and a range of local and regional stakeholders.  I have had the great privilege of visiting many of the institutes of technology.  There are two still left on my list.  I have seen the work that is being done with students and spoken to student unions in the various colleges.  The holistic approach of the colleges and their caring attitude towards students was mentioned.  I have visited colleges where the president of the college went into the cafeteria and honestly seemed to know every single person in the place.  It was not a set up for the Minister's visit.  That was one example.  In another example I was brought around to see different courses being taught.  The president of that institute of technology was able to talk to different students and knew exactly what they were studying.  She did not just know the students' names but also exactly what they were studying and where they come from.  That is really special and I do not want that to be lost when we bring the consortium together<b>.  </b></p><p>I want everything good about the institutes of technology to continue.  I am looking at Senator O'Sullivan.  I am really confident that, by ensuring that there is a technological university serving Waterford, the students that Senator Coffey mentioned who leave the area - some 75% of those who do the leaving certificate - who never return to the region will stay.  That is one of the reasons I am really passionate about this.  I believe that if students can be educated in their own home area and their own home county or region, the chances are that they will stay there and the benefits of the education they receive will stay there.  Foreign direct investment will be attracted to the area and people who want to set up businesses, or indeed our indigenous businesses, will know that those students are in the area.  It brings a lot to the table and it will be a game changer for the regions.  That is why I really want this Bill to go through. </p><p>Many collaborative approaches have been taken elsewhere.  I absolutely respect what the Senator said about Athlone.  I have visited Athlone.  It was another college that I was really wowed by.  The interest that the president and the staff took in their students was very impressive.  There is a place for these consortia, but there is also a place for individual institutes of technology to stand and deliver an education programme they feel is suitable. </p><p>I am of the view that the establishment of technological universities will enhance higher education options without compromising the services and products which are currently delivered.  When one reads the Bill, which is comprehensive, one will see that we have tried to deal with every sector.  It will allow for institutes of greater scale, capacity and reach to build upon the firm foundations that already exist and to create that unique brand.  As I stated yesterday, no institute of technology is being dragooned into seeking technological university designation.  It is a decision and a choice to be made by institutes where they are of the view that it is in the best interests of their students, staff and related stakeholders.  The possibility is also provided for in the Bill for a single institute of technology to become part of an established technological university if it so wishes at a subsequent stage.  There are more than Athlone in this category.  A wide range of possibilities and choices are being created, which can only be good for the entire sector.  The student will be placed at the top of that paradigm.  </p><p>A number of Senators rightly highlighted that there are multiple pathways to achieving high-quality qualifications and attaining high levels of in-demand skills.  In this context both lifelong learning and apprenticeships were referenced.  I acknowledge that.  In addition, some Senators mentioned the importance of institutes of further education and training, and their role in providing education and training.  I wish to acknowledge the contributions of the colleges of further education.  They will now be able to work with the new technological universities to ensure pathways of progression for their students.  I note that the example of the key role being played by the Monaghan Institute of Further Education and Training, and the Cavan Institute, were cited here yesterday as an example of the provision of these different progression pathways.  I could add many more examples, because I have had the opportunity to attend many graduations from colleges of further education and can absolutely vouch for the standard of education.  I have spoken to many of the graduates who have come through those colleges.  They often get jobs, which is most admirable.  Usually, as I hand them their script or certificate, I ask them what their plans are for the future.  Almost 95% have either got into another college or are going abroad to another university or institute of technology to study further, or they have got a job.  That is a great testament to what our colleges of further education are doing.</p><p>I want to state that the Government provided significant additional funding to the Department of Education and Skills in budget 2018, and funding for higher education and further education and training has increased by &euro;100 million in 2018 compared with 2016.  That is money on the table for higher education.</p><p>Key new targets for the next three years include increasing by 10% the number of those aged between 25 and 64 engaged in lifelong learning by 2020, and by 15% by 2025.  We have also set the target of increasing by 25% the total number of students studying on a flexible basis.  As I go around the country and talk to different people in institutes of technology who are interested in becoming part of the technological consortia, they are all talking about lifelong learning and flexible learning and want to offer those opportunities to the students that are there and to people who are in the community who want to retrain for jobs or reskill themselves.  That will be something extra which will now have a policy behind it within the technological university.  All students will have the opportunity to undertake a work placement by 2025.  Increasing entry from disadvantaged and disability streams and ensuring that every DEIS school partakes in higher education institute-led access programmes.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2284"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2284&amp;amp;pid=MaryMitchellOConnor&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I feel strongly about this.  This morning I met the National Council for the Blind of Ireland, NCBI, where I met students who were getting a bursary to attend a third level institute.  I heard there that some institutes are better than others at welcoming students, orientating them and helping them get library access, which I am now aware is a problem.  It is very important that access for the disadvantaged and disability streams is part of the policy for technological universities, as well as expanding alternate pathways by doubling apprenticeships and increasing Springboard provision by 30%. </p><p>The question of the presidents of the new technological universities was raised yesterday.  I can confirm that it is the intention that the appointment of the first president of a technological university shall be by way of open competition.  This will allow high-calibre candidates, national and international, to compete for the position.  I can also confirm that there will be no proscription of an incumbent president of a technological university seeking reappointment when his or her term of office finishes.  This is in line with other legislation in the higher education sector.  However, it shall be a matter for the technological university to appoint the next president.  The selection criteria and appointment procedures shall be established and published by the technological university.  </p><p>Several Senators have spoken in support of there being additional representation for various groupings on the governing body of a technological university.  Additional student representatives, or city and county councillors, or an Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, representative were mentioned.  While I will, of course, consider any amendments tabled in this regard on Committee Stage, the composition of the governing body has been carefully crafted in consultation with key stakeholders, including the Teachers Union of Ireland and the Technological Higher Education Association.  The Department has also interacted with the Union of Students in Ireland and IMPACT.  We are seeking to strike a balance in reducing, comparatively speaking, the overall size of the governing body, given that two or more institutes of technology, and even four or more, could be merging into a technological university.  This is in line with recommendations of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, and the national strategy for higher education to 2030.  We are also seeking to ensure, once again in line with best international practice, that the governing body has a majority of external members with a focus on the relevant competencies of these members as are required to drive forward the technological university in the modern education and training, business, research, community and skills environments.  These competencies include business, enterprise, finance, law, corporate governance, human resources, community organisation and any other areas relevant to the functions of a technological university.</p><p>The competencies must be agreed in advance with the Higher Education Authority and at least one of the external members on the governing body must have expertise in standards and practice in higher education outside the State.  In seeking to further expand overall membership of the governing body, or to juggle with the composition of the governing body and, in turn, the members' requisite competencies, we risk not least upsetting the balance of internal and external members.</p><p>Were we to accede to all requests for additional representation, the governing body would be expanded exponentially, would become unwieldy and be out of step with international best practice and would lack agility and responsiveness.  That said, I will consider any and all amendments proposed on this and any other areas of the Bill when Committee Stage commences next week.</p><p>I thank all the Senators, once again for their kind attention, their courtesy and informed contributions which seek at all times only to further strengthen and improve the Technological Universities Bill.</p></speech>
