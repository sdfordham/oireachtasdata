I have selected the matters raised by Senators &Oacute; Clochartaigh, Byrne, Colm Burke and Mac Conghail and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  I regret I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Higgins as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter.  Senator van Turnhout may give notice on another day of the matter she wishes to raise.</p></speech>

Following a decision of the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges some time ago, the inaugural Seanad &Eacute;ireann young Senator student challenge took place and will culminate with a special event in the Seanad Chamber next Tuesday, 23 April from 12.30 p.m. to 2.45 p.m. approximately.  The event will see the top 45 entrants participate in an event in which they will have an opportunity to present their essays to members of the Government and ask questions in an Order of Business-style fashion.  The Seanad bells will ring for one minute at 12.29 p.m. before the event commences at 12.30 p.m.  Senators are welcome to attend the event and those wishing to attend will be accommodated in the available seats and in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery.</p> <p>I advise the House that the event will take place on Tuesday, which means the Order of Business shall probably be taken at 4 p.m.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-04-17a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1139" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013041700004#C00200"><p>On behalf of my colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il, I extend our deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in the dreadful terrorist attack in Boston.  I also extend our sympathy to those who were injured.  We all roundly condemn the disgusting attack on those participating in the Boston marathon and spectators of the event.  We hope the perpetrators will be brought to justice.  I formally extend our condolences to the city of Boston and the state of Massachusetts following this terrible event.</p><p>On the basis that the Croke Park II agreement has failed, does the Government intend to proceed, as the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, has threatened, with an arbitrary 7% pay cut for public and civil servants?  What is the current position on the Croke Park II agreement?  Does the Leader agree that the Minister's handling of the negotiations was nothing short of disastrous?  The threatening manner in which he approached workers in the public sector was badly thought out and he got his answer from the unions.  There will be an essay competition in the Seanad next Tuesday, which is fine.  However, I would like ample time to be set aside next week for a discussion on where we go following the failure of the Croke Park II agreement.  That debate must happen.  The way the Minister and the Government handled the negotiations was nothing short of disastrous.  The Government does not have a plan and perhaps my party can assist in compiling one.  That is why I ask for ample time to be set aside next week to discuss other options and alternatives.  Does the Government intend to proceed, as the Minister threatened to do, with a 7% pay cut for public sector and Civil Service workers?</p><p>I ask the Leader to use his good offices to raise a matter with the Minister for Health.  I refer to the fact that the Minister and the HSE have breached Labour Court recommendations on home helps and gratuity payments for persons who worked in the home help sector between 2000 and 2008.  As the Leader will know, most of those who work in the sector are with voluntary agencies that are majority funded by the HSE.  They are low paid workers and the average payment due to them ranges between &euro;12,000 and &euro;15,000.  I wrote to the Minister and his Department and they acknowledged that Labour Court Recommendation 19550 stated the workers were entitled to gratuity payments of 4.5 weeks pay per year of service.  Furthermore, they explained that they would not pay it.  That decision affects thousands of workers across the State who low paid and provide a front-line health service.  The State has chosen to hold back the money due to them.  Even though they made their contributions, the State is unwilling to pay out.  I intend to raise the matter next week on the Adjournment.  In the meantime I ask the Leader to use his good offices to advocate on behalf of thousands of workers to whom the State owes money.  Will he ask the Minister why he has set aside a clear Labour Court recommendation in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-04-17a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1148" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013041700004#C00500"><p>Like Senator Darragh O'Brien, I extend sympathy on behalf of the Labour Party group to the city of Boston and the families of those who were killed and injured in the horrific bombing during the marathon on Monday.  We were all appalled and shocked to see the footage and read about the devastation caused by the bombing.  We all share the hope that the perpetrators of the massacre will be swiftly brought to justice.  I know that enormous resources are being brought to bear in that pursuit in Boston.</p><p>  On a more positive note, I commend the Government for accepting the Private Members' legislation brought forward last night to lift the Statute of Limitations for the survivors of s<font color="#222222">ymphysiotomy.</font></p> <p>It was great to see the survivors, most of whom are elderly, in the Visitors Gallery and who will be able to benefit from the legislation.  It is good that the other House should take on board Private Members' Bills and allow them to pass through Second Stage.  It is welcome that the Government will take on that legislation in aid of the survivors of symphysiotomy which is long overdue.  It is great to see it finally moved on a cross-party basis.</p><p>On another matter that has cross-party support, I welcome the decision of the Constitutional Convention, of which I am a member, at the weekend which voted by a 79% majority in support of calling on the Government to hold a referendum on the right to marriage equality, that is, the right to marriage for same sex or gay couples.  There was enormous support for it at the convention.  That report will go to Government and we look forward to a referendum on the issue in due course.  </p><p>In regard to the vote on Croke Park II, it is important that the unions and the Government have time to reflect on the outcome.   Many unions may wish to preserve some of the core elements of the package in respect of the protection of core pay for members earning less than &euro;65,000.  That was an important aspect of the agreement.  It is important to note that some sectoral agreements were conducted, for example, with the Prison Officers Association.  There are complex issues involved for those unions and for unions on both sides whose members either supported or rejected the agreement.  It is important to have time to reflect as we await the response from the unions and, in turn, the Government's response.</p></speech>

I am aware from the debate in the House last May that many Senators advocated this position.  It is a horror story which I have followed closely as a member of the victims of symphysiotomy all-party support group.  I pay tribute to the survivors, their families and supporters and those who advocated and campaigned tirelessly on their behalf.  I pay tribute to Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, convenor of the all-party group, whose determination and commitment to seek justice for the survivors has kept the issue firmly on the Oireachtas agenda.  While I do not condone the length of time it has taken to get here, this is how things should be done.  It has restored my faith in consensus politics and how we can work together to achieve good.  While the agreement by the Government to support the Bill through Second Stage is welcome, I ask the Leader to urge the Government to begin actively engaging with the survivors and their representative groups to address their immediate health and support needs and, in parallel, to put a structure in place that will ensure redress.  </p><p>I wish to raise the plight of the 32 thalidomide survivors.  At an Oireachtas briefing they shared some of their specific support needs.  Regrettably, they are being shunted between Departments.  I ask the Leader to urge the Government to engage with them and their representative groups at the earliest opportunity.</p><p>On Monday, in response to the publication of the European Commission's report on trafficking in human beings, I called on the Government to transpose immediately the EU anti-trafficking directive into national legislation.  This was due to be done by 6 April.  The directive has the potential to impact significantly on the lives of trafficked victims and will help prevent others from falling victim to this heinous crime.  I welcome the publication yesterday of the criminal law human trafficking Bill to give effect to certain provisions of the EU anti-trafficking directive.  I look forward to comparing the Bill against the directive and hope to find all the necessary elements incorporated.  Significantly, the Bill defines forced labour in accordance with ILO convention 29.  This is something I have called for in the past and I welcome its inclusion.  I ask the Leader to commend the Government for initiating the Bill in this House.</p><p>I welcome the appointment of the members designate of the new Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  They are of fine calibre and will bring extensive expertise to their role.  I hope a suitable chair can be found at the earliest opportunity.    </p></speech>

It is unlike the situation in which the people came here from the troika and lied to us to say we could not and must not, legally and morally, burn the bondholders.  Within a short matter of time, they went to Cyprus to tell people they must burn the bondholders.  There is no consistency or feeling for ordinary decent human beings.  Thank God for our President, Michael D. Higgins, who told it as it was today in the European Parliament, spelling matters out in a most wonderful speech.  The people of Ireland are the victims of an international swindle and the financial houses, ratings agencies and banks who organised it are now sitting up there dictating what we will do.  They are unelected and it is undemocratic and time we told them to "F" off.</p></speech>

Mr. Chopra has said himself that austerity does not work.  It is not working and it is driving the people down.  We should join a coalition of the southern European states and take the big boys on.  We should not let Germany win the third world war.  It is utterly wrong and shameful that we should go back.

Can we have a debate on the most important matter facing the country?  We are reverting to Thatcherism.  She said what she is quoted to have said.  I have heard it and seen it.  She said there is no such thing as society and it is only an economy, which is what our friends in the EU are telling us.</p><p>It is regrettable that there should be such a clear conflict between the Judiciary and the Government and we should have a debate on the matter.  There is an appalling article in one of the low-bred rags, which the editor has accompanied by a picture of a grossly fat person in a library, who is supposed to be a judge.  The editorial states that judges constitute a fat-cat elite and are overpaid, over-protected and wholly immersed in their own inflated sense of worth and entitlement.  I cannot think of a better description of that gentleman and some of his colleagues.</p></speech>

We must be clear about the situation being reported on the relationship of judges with Government.  It has all the appearances of a petty squabble over pay and related issues.  My colleagues in both areas see this.  It is the furthest thing from a constitutional crisis although I see how it would suit certain agendas to paint it as such.  It is more like a dispute on pay and related issues.  If the judges had taken a pay decrease when they were reasonably requested to do so, there would have been no need for the referendum and this conversation.  I remind the House that the closest we have come to a constitutional crisis in recent times was when half of Mr. Brian Cowen's Cabinet decided to resign rather than to face the electorate in their roles as Ministers.  There was a danger on that occasion that there would not even be enough Ministers to create a quorum.</p></speech>

As someone who was elected on the agricultural panel I am acutely aware of the difficulties that farmers face after one of the toughest springs on record.  March was the coldest month on record.  This is a much bigger problem than the one in 2009 when the then Government made emergency funds available to help out the farmers.  The situation is perilous and is causing a lot of angst, particularly in the south.  I am sure it is the same throughout the whole country but I cannot speak for areas in which I do not live and which I do not represent.</p><p>Farmers in west Cork are drawing round bales of silage from as far away as Kildare, at astronomical prices.  Unfortunately, in many instances they have run out of fodder and because of the lack of funding the banks, building societies and even credit unions are imposing strict constraints on farmers who are finding it extremely difficult to get extra animal feed because the animal feed providers are in a difficult situation.  One sheep farmer told me he lost 85 lambs in one week.  Dairy farmers are extremely badly hit.  One dairy farmer who has done his accounts said it is costing him approximately &euro;450 a day to feed his 50 strong herd of cows.  The difficulty at this time of the year is that dairy herds producing milk go into decline and will not recover which will have a knock-on effect.</p><p>Given the seriousness of the situation I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that we have an urgent discussion on the farm crisis today.  The situation is dire.  I am sure others here from rural backgrounds will understand the points I am making and concur with the need for an urgent debate today.</p></speech>

They are inappropriate with respect to the role of Germany in Europe today.  The Croke Park issue is very serious.  I very much doubt that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will have any trouble coming into the House for a debate on the matter.  It is, however, for the Leader to request that debate.</p><p>I congratulate the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute, INDI, which launched the inaugural Nourish Children Week on Monday.  INDI has conducted a mapping exercise of childhood obesity services around the country which shows that there are only three childhood obesity prevention programmes for children who are identified as being at risk of becoming obese, operating across seven counties.  There are only two group intervention programmes for obese children, operating across three counties and Temple Street Children's Hospital is the only children's hospital with an intervention programme for obese children.  It has also made several recommendations on what can be done about childhood obesity and we are all aware that the cause of childhood obesity, which affects one in four primary school children, is excessive calorie intake and lack of physical activity.  With that in mind I would like the Leader to organise a debate on the specific recommendations of the INDI report but also in particular on one of those recommendations which is a call to remove vending machines from schools.  In view of the seriousness of the matter will the Leader immediately ask the Minister for Education and Skills to ask all schools to remove vending machines selling calorific products?</p></speech>

I would support a debate in this House on the functioning of the convention, having attended two full sessions.  I have put on the record my lack of confidence in the ability of the convention properly to tease out some complex issues.</p> <p>I say that with the greatest of respect and appreciation for the hard work put in by the convention team.  I do not have confidence in it or in its ability to properly facilitate a full and searching debate.  I have extensive reasons for that, which I will happily put on record in the event of a debate going ahead.</p><p>Following the comments of Senator Darragh O'Brien on the Government's communication in the context of the Croke Park agreement and the decision of the public sector unions, communication is at the heart of the current dispute between the Executive and the Judiciary.  While it is not a constitutional crisis, serious issues exist in respect of the Government's conduct towards the Judiciary, which has been characterised by a culture of spin going back to the meeting between the Chief Justice and the Taoiseach, which appears to have been leaked.  I doubt very much that the contents of the meeting were leaked by the judges' side.  I refer also to the very reasonable request the judges made that there be an independent mechanism to establish and regulate judges' pay.  The constitutional protection we had, and still have to some extent, on judges' pay is a feature of-----</p></speech>

The vast majority of public sector workers said &quot;No&quot; to what they see as a grossly unfair proposal and a deal that would have had a disproportionate impact on low- and middle-income workers in the public sector.  The Government thought the proposal would sail through and that the bully-boy tactics of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, would work, such as the blackmail and coercion used by the Government and the Minister to the effect that if workers did not accept pay cuts there would be a unilateral 7% pay cut across the board.  These are pay cuts people cannot afford, certainly in the case of low- and middle-income workers.  There was a universal answer from the vast majority of public sector workers, who sent a clear, unambiguous and simple message that they had had enough to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the T&aacute;naiste, the Taoiseach and every Member of the Oireachtas.  We have heard from teachers, nurses, doctors, garda&iacute; and care assistants, and people on the front line of many public services have said &quot;No&quot;.</p> <p>Will the Leader give a commitment that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will remove the threats, end the coercion and not impose a unilateral pay cut of 7%?

It is no secret that most of this country is swamped and water logged and that there has been a huge loss of crops and livestock this year.  Last winter and the preceding year were the wettest on record yet bizarrely water in Dublin and the surrounding areas has been rationed during the past month.

We have rightly, to some extent, celebrated in this House the deal on the promissory note, the extension of the term of liabilities and progress on restructuring our debt profile.

I understand the Fianna F&aacute;il agenda.  It is natural to the adversarial system.  However, this is a time for calmness, cool heads and reflection.  I have no doubt that, given the responsibility that rests on the shoulders of the Executive and the union leadership, the necessary consultation and dialogue will take place.  We should allow what is happening behind the scenes to proceed.  Likewise, in the case of the Judiciary, we have confidence in the Chief Justice and the Attorney General.  As the Taoiseach noted yesterday, that channel has existed and it will continue to exist.  Judicial independence is constitutionally guaranteed and it will not be infringed.  We should not be reading into it.</p></speech>

There is a channel for discussion and we should allow that discussion to take place.  We have enjoyed an independent Judiciary for 90 years and it has worked well for us.  Let us make sure we do not do anything that loses it.  I think it is in the Government's hands to do something about that.</p><p>My attention was drawn to a case involving a Pakistani woman who has been in solitary confinement in Pakistan for four years.  She is a Christian and she was imprisoned for blasphemy.  The sentence was death by hanging.  I will pass her name to the Leader because I believe something can be done about the matter.  She has had no access to fresh water, light or a toilet.  She is the mother to five children.  We recognise the benefit of an independent Judiciary.  The only two senior people in Pakistan to speak in her favour, a Muslim governor and a senior official, have been assassinated.  We should value the independence of our Judiciary and the freedoms we enjoy.  I urge the Leader to draw this case to the attention of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to see if we can add our voice to those who are calling for justice.</p></speech>

I was there two weeks ago at the world Irish dancing championships and actually stayed at the Lenox Hotel on Boylston Street right across from where the second bomb exploded.  To think one was coming in and out of that hotel with one's wife and kids while a terrorist organisation of some description was plotting a bomb across the street puts the hair standing on one's neck.</p><p>The Fr. Niall Molloy murder case is considered to be the biggest cover-up in the history of the State.  There were media reports earlier this week that the cold case investigation into the murder had concluded after three years and had recommended to the Garda Commissioner to go ahead with a public inquiry because it too was met with a veil of silence.  We all know the cover-up involved five arms of this State - the Judiciary, the church, the health fraternity, the Garda and the political system.</p></speech>

This issue has lain dormant for 28 years.  Senator Whelan and I have supported the call for a public inquiry into the case.  The chairman of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party has written to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice and Equality calling for a public inquiry too.  As this House initiated the call for a public inquiry, will the Minister for Justice and Equality make a statement on the matter in the House?  The Molloy family, the people of Roscommon and all connected rightfully deserve an independent public investigation.</p></speech>

We are interested in tracing our roots, being more aware of the environment in which our ancestors grew up, their challenges and achievements.  Genealogy is an important tool when it comes to tourism because it helps the families of emigrants return to the homeland to see where their people lived.  In that context, I have a Bill on the Order Paper relating to the publication of the 1926 census returns.  The importance of this census is that it was the first since the foundation of the State.  As there is common interest on both sides of the House in publishing these census returns, will the Leader agree to take my Bill in Government time?</p><p>The report of the relatives of the 1916 leaders of their visit to the historic buildings on Moore Street made sad reading.  These buildings are some of the most important national monuments we have, which we were given to understand would be conserved.  The relatives, however, said they were shocked and horrified at the state of the buildings.  Water was running down the walls.  Plastic sheeting was being used in an effort to keep out the elements.  This is happening while we get closer to the centenary of the 1916 Rising.  Will the Leader bring this to the attention of the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, for whom I have great respect?  He needs to take a hands-on interest in this matter.  For example, if the Alamo site were treated like this, it would shock people internationally, especially those who want to respect the sacrifices of patriots of the past.</p></speech>

It was an horrendous attack on innocent life.  I know when one is coming close to the finishing line, there is very little gas in the tank.  To take people out at that point is as low as one can go.  I hope those responsible are brought to justice.</p><p>The abortion Bill is on the legislative programme to be taken before the summer recess.  Potentially, this Bill is society-changing legislation which will affect women and their unborn children.</p> <p>I hope the fullest amount of time possible is given to the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children for the fullest scrutiny of the Bill.  The Minister for Health gave a commitment here at the hearings that took place in this Chamber that the Bill would go to the committee and I urge the Leader to ensure adequate time is given for that.  Perhaps we could be generous and offer to host those hearings in this Chamber so that the maximum number of people can attend.  This Chamber was required to contain those interested the last time.  In my five and a half years in the Seanad, the Oireachtas health committee hearings were one of the finest pieces of work I attended and participated in here.  As such a potential life-changing issue for women and children here, the scrutiny of this Bill should be given the fullest amount of time possible and I would be grateful if the Leader could accede to that request.</p></speech>

This was mentioned on this day last month by the Taoiseach and President Obama.

For example, in my town of Carrick-on-Suir residents of one full housing estate have received no notification of their property tax liability yet.  Some people might think this is great, but many of those people have come into my office and asked me why they have not received their notifications.  There is also confusion among people with regard to how property tax can be paid and I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to provide some clarity on this matter.   At this stage, all properties liable for tax should have been notified and clarity should have been provided on the methods of payment.  In my county of Tipperary, I heard in the past couple of days the suggestion there would be kiosks installed in supermarkets where people could pay in instalments whenever suited them.  Many other ideas have been put out and we need clarity on all of these.  I ask the Leader to seek that clarity from the Minister.</p></speech>

An issue related to that is one on which I hope we can also have a debate.  I hope we can have a debate with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, on the Leader funding crisis that exists currently.  Leader funding has been frozen for local development companies over the past while and it is unclear why this has happened.  I would like to hear from the Minister whether there is a problem, because this is the final year of the programme and companies are trying to ensure their full allocation is used.</p><p>We also need to ensure we are drawing down all moneys available from Europe for this programme.  We do not wish to leave anything unused because we need every penny to be spent here.  Is there an issue regarding the matching funding and is there a spat going on between the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government regarding the matching funding we need to put on the table before we can draw down the final allocation?  This is very important, particularly in the context of where the Minister sees these companies going.  We are all receiving letters from people supported by these companies with regard to their concerns about the new model being proposed by the Minister for Leader funding.  They are concerned that the Leader companies will be sucked into the county councils and most of the funding will be used for county council works.  Will the Leader ask the Minister to come in for a debate on Leader funding and rural development in general? </p> <p>As this is the beginning of term, I reiterate my call on the Leader to contact the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister in the Six Counties to see if they have decided to take us up on our invitation to come down and speak to us in the House.</p></speech>

Many workers in the private sector have suffered pay reductions of more than 40%.  Many small business owners are putting whatever money they have saved in the last ten, 15, 20 or 30 years back into their businesses to try to preserve jobs.  Many are stuck in that position.  We should, therefore, have a balanced debate on the Croke Park agreement, as many figures have been thrown out.  The reality is that wage levels in the public sector are approximately 17% ahead of what they are in the private sector.  There is also the issue of job security.  There is, therefore, a need for a balanced debate.  </p><p>I wish to mention an issue I have been raising for the past eight or nine months.  It was raised last night on television by Mr. Liam Doran.  The cost of drugs in this country is a very valid issue.  We will pay more than &euro;2 billion for drugs and medication this year.  In 2000 the cost was &euro;574 million.  There have been minor reductions in the past three or four years, but the reductions we need have not happened.  When we debate the Croke Park agreement, we should refer to some of the other major cuts that really need to be introduced.  This is one of the areas in which substantial progress has to be made in 2013, 2014 and 2015.  This is the time to start that whole process.  I ask for this issue to be included in any debate on the Croke Park agreement.</p></speech>

Morale is at an all-time low.  As public representatives, on a daily basis we meet civil and public servants who work for and defend the State and our interests.  The manner in which they are being treated is totally unacceptable.  While I agree with most of what Senator Colm Burke had to say, I remind him that the Government is creating a divide between the public and private sectors by trying to play one off the other, which is wholly unfair.  Arguments to that effect are often presented by Ministers during debates.  The Senator was right to suggest alternative approaches are available.  He identified one of them and there are many others.</p></speech>

Those who bought properties during the boom cannot afford to take further pay cuts.  It would be disgraceful if the Government moved to legislate for a pay cut without entering into meaningful consultation, as opposed to consultation after the event.  There is a need for space and calm in order that there can be a total rethink.  The Government needs to step back and listen to the unions at this stage.</p> <p>It is an awful pity they did not listen to the unions six months ago, as we would not be where we are today.</p></speech>

However, I did not get up to speak on that issue.  Senator Moloney is, of course, right to remind people that it is very important that the consultative process be maximised.</p><p>  Was the Leader aware that RTE had planned to produce the programme on the Houses of the Oireachtas which was transmitted last Monday evening?  The Ceann Comhairle, as is his wont and his right, toured the D&aacute;il Chamber - and he did it exceptionally well - yet there was no office holder from the Seanad.  I do not mean in any way to disrespect the individual who toured with the cameras - that is not the point I am making and has nothing whatever to do with this.  However, it has everything to do with the status and dignity of this House and with all the House is supposed to portray.  I would like to know if the Leader was aware of this and to ask why no office holder was present when the cameras came into this House.</p><p>  That was followed yesterday morning by a screaming headline in the <i>Irish Independent</i> that Senators had taken an extra day off despite a vote on abolition.  This is yet another injurious and pejorative article that is only fuelling the poison already out there among people who have no empathy with this House, and is primarily fuelled by an apathetic and neglectful media who have not taken their own democratic responsibilities seriously enough to sit in this House and to listen to what we have to say.</p><p>  Then we heard today - again, I say this with all due respect to the people involved, and I am sure it is a very important issue and an important day for them - that we have been given two and half hours of time next week to discuss essays.  We are the national Parliament.  I do not want to get into an argument about it.  It was decided by the relevant committee and it has been processed, and I understand over 250 students were involved.  It is an important issue and I do not in any way want to denigrate that.  However, is that what we, as the second House of the Oireachtas, are supposed to be doing?  This is at a time when the country is staggering along on a daily basis and on a day when the major trade unions - all of the trade unions, in fact, if one considers the totality of membership - decided they were not going to accept the Government's agenda in regard to Croke Park II.  I understand the &#8364;300 million that must be saved has been included in the Estimates which were published this morning for the next year.</p></speech>

Where is the money going to come from?  Are the doctors, the nurses, the teachers and the front-line services, those on maternity benefits, single parent families and all of those who are vulnerable in society, who are struggling under the yoke of increased taxation, the ones who will have to find this money?  Where is the &euro;300 million going to come from?  The savings for each Department were already written into the last budget and are included in today's Estimates.  The day after the trade union movement rejected Croke Park II, the Government has gone ahead and published the Estimates.</p></speech>

It is appalling that a fabulous social and sporting event such as the Boston marathon could have been targeted by unscrupulous people.  I hope the London marathon, which takes place this coming weekend, passes off without incident.</p><p>I know the Leader will not be able to accede to the request from Senator Ned O'Sullivan to amend the Order of Business today, but I ask that time be made available in the near future for a discussion on the challenges facing the farming community in light of the appalling weather in recent months, the shortage of fodder and the loss of animals.</p> <p>It warrants a debate in this House and it would prove helpful to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  </p><p>It is disappointing but not totally unexpected that the Croke Park II agreement has been rejected, although narrowly.  The process highlighted the major challenges facing the country and gave the public a great insight into how various parts of the public service worked.  I would like to see all parties getting back around the table to iron out some of the difficulties that emerged during the negotiations.  We all agree that there were, possibly, some unfair elements that could be adjusted and that very high earners could take more of the pain.  We should not let the issue disappear from the agenda.  I would like to see all parties redouble their efforts to bring about a Croke Park II agreement.  I do not think there is a significant difference between the parties when the matter is analysed in its entirety.  There is still an opportunity and I urge the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to explore it.</p></speech>

Yesterday the US Senate published an 884 page immigration Bill which was brought before President Obama who is enthusiastic to have it passed.  As the Senate will pass the Bill in the space of eight weeks, I hope we will be able to organise our own debate on the topic because the 50,000 undocumented Irish want us to ensure their pathway to legalisation in the United States is accommodated within the 884 pages of the Bill.  Once it has passed through the Senate, it will go to the House of Representatives where some Republicans are promising to slow it down, to put it mildly.  The 11 million people who are undocumented in the United States require the assistance of their home countries to ensure their position will be legalised.  Therefore, I ask the Leader to organise a debate in the presence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade as soon as possible to ensure Irish people in the United States who find themselves living in the shadows will be looked after by us at home.</p></speech>

I join the Leader of the Opposition and many other Members who have expressed their deepest sympathy to the citizens of Boston on the three deaths and injuries to so many people at such an event.  I hope the perpetrators will be brought to justice.  Speaking personally, it brought back memories of the many atrocities we witnessed on this island for many years.  What happened must have resonated with the relatives of victims of bombings on this island.  I join Members in expressing sympathy to the citizens of Boston, with whom we have such good relations.</p><p>A number of Members raised the issue of the Croke Park II agreement on public sector pay.  I remind the House that the Government is determined to fix the national finances and get Ireland back working again.  In order to reach our necessary deficit reduction target, a further saving of &euro;1 billion was required in the pay and pensions bill for public servants.  The proposals were fair and equitable in their impact in that it was proposed to protect the salaries of 87% of public workers earning less than &euro;65,000.  However, it was difficult for trade union members to accept the proposals and it has been a difficult process for each and every one of them.  It is unprecedented to ask public servants to sign up to an agreement that would impact negatively on their pay and conditions.  As the Government has made clear on many occasions in recent weeks, a rejection of the proposals does not change the fact that in order to meet our budgetary targets and continue on the path to economic recovery, we need to make payroll savings of &euro;300 million this year and &euro;1 billion by 2015.  The Government will reflect on the outcome of the ballot and consider how the required savings can be achieved this year.  This is a time for calm reflection by all concerned.  A saving of &euro;300 million will have to be achieved and I am sure the method by which this will be done will be outlined in the coming weeks.</p> <p> Senator Ivana Bacik, among other Senators, referred to the issue of symphysiotomy and the fact the Government had accepted a Bill last evening.  Senator Mary Moran has raised this issue more than anyone else over a period of months.  It was a good day for Ireland that the all-party Bill was accepted by the Government.</p><p>Senator Ivana Bacik also complimented the Constitutional Convention on its ongoing work.  There were differences of opinion on the convention between Senators R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen and David Cullinane, with the former expressing a lack of confidence and the latter expressing confidence in it.  </p><p>Senator Jillian van Turnhout also welcomed acceptance of the Bill on symphysiotomy.  She also noted the question of thalidomide and said the Government should engage with survivors.  I think that issue is ongoing.  </p><p>The issue of human trafficking was raised by Senators Jillian van Turnhout and C&aacute;it Keane.  I inform the House that the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) (Amendment) Bill 2013 will be brought before the House next Tuesday or Wednesday.  There will, therefore, be ample opportunities for the House to discuss the many issues raised on the Order of Business, not only today but on previous occasions.  Senator Jillian van Turnhout also welcomed the members designate of the new Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  I am sure we would all like to congratulate them.  </p><p>We have heard Senator David Norris' views on austerity on a number of occasions and heard them again today.  With Senator Catherine Noone, among others, he also raised the important issue of judicial independence.  It is the firm view of the Government that the effective operation of the judicial system, of which an independent Judiciary is the cornerstone, is indispensable to the State and all citizens.  The Government also recognises that legitimate issues of concern can arise from time to time that will require constructive discussion between the Judiciary and the Executive.  Some issues have arisen from the significant programme of reform under way, including concerning the recent proposed amendments to the Constitution which are of relevance to the Judiciary.  Government policy on many of these issues is on the public record.  For example, the position on a reduction in judicial remuneration flows from the decision of the people in a referendum and is well known.  In some cases, the Government has yet to reach a final decision on the precise proposals to be made.  The proposed referendums on the abolition of the Seanad and the reform of the courts are two cases in point.  I think everybody acknowledges that these issues require some engagement between the Executive and the Judiciary and perhaps new thinking also.  There is ongoing and regular engagement, as appropriate, between the Government and the Judiciary.  The contact takes place within the relevant constitutional parameters and is both formal and informal in nature, as confirmed by the Minister for Justice and Equality recently.</p></speech>

That process of engagement will continue and address issues of legitimate concern.</p><p>Senator Denis O'Donovan, among others, referred to the fodder crisis in farming owing to the severe weather conditions we have witnessed.  I am trying to get the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to come to the House and hope to have him here within a couple of weeks to discuss this and other farming issues.  Therefore, I cannot accept the proposed amendment to the Order of Business.</p><p>Senator Aideen Hayden mentioned the lack of childhood obesity intervention programmes throughout the country.</p> <p>The matter was raised by the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute and should be debated further in the House.  </p><p>I have addressed the question raised by Senator Mullen on the Judiciary.  Senator Comiskey outlined the theft of heavy machinery in several Border counties.  The matter is one that Customs and Excise and other agencies of the State on both sides of the Border should be, and I am sure are, addressing.  I shall bring the matter to the attention of the relevant authorities.</p><p>Senator Whelan mentioned a need for proper infrastructure to harvest water and asked questions on water metering.  I understand that the water metering programme is to commence in the next couple of months.  </p><p>With regard to Senator Marc MacSharry, I was not aware of the death of former Senator, Mr. McGlinchey.  I wish to express my sympathy and that of the House to his family.  At a later stage we will bring his family into the House to hear tributes to him.  A number of other matters were raised by Senator MacSharry but I only heard some of them.  He raised the matter of access to the Department of Finance and allegations in that regard that are in the public domain in the form of newspaper cuttings.  I am sure the Secretary General of the Department will address those matters.  </p><p>I agree with Senator Paul Coghlan that consultation and dialogue is needed now in order to deal with the Croke Park II agreement and the Judiciary.</p><p>Senator Quinn mentioned a Pakistani lady who has been in jail for four years for blasphemy and awaits a death sentence.  I shall bring the matter to the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, as requested. </p><p>Senator Kelly referred to the cold case report that is due soon on the murder of Fr. Niall Molloy and called for a public inquiry.  I am sure that when the relevant Minister receives the report from the Garda Commissioner, the matter will be addressed.</p><p>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; referred to his genealogy Bill on the Order Paper regarding the publication of the 1926 census.  If he has insufficient time to address the matter during Private Members' time then I shall consider allocating Government time.  Normally those matters are addressed during Private Members' time.</p><p>Senator Healy Eames referred to the forthcoming Bill that will deal with legislation to address the X case.  We will consider any requests by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children to use the Chamber, as we did previously.  I am sure the Government will give ample time to discuss such a serious matter, as it has to date.</p><p>I can assure Senator Barrett that the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, during the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union, is working with his counterpart in the United States of America to conclude a trade deal between the two economic blocs.  It will be of great benefit to Ireland if agreement is reached.  </p><p>Senator Landy referred to a lack of notification by the Revenue Commissioners about the property tax and said that some people still had not received notification.  He also requested that the relevant Minister clarify the methods of payment.  I am not sure whether the information is contained in the note provided by the Revenue Commissioners.  I am sure clarity can be given to the Senator and the general public on the matter. </p><p>I have outlined to Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh on numerous occasions that I did issue an invite to the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, but I have not received a response as yet.  I gave him the same response the previous three or four times he raised the matter.      </p><p>Senator Burke mentioned the cost of drugs.  Significant reductions in the cost of drugs have been negotiated but I agree with him that significantly more reductions are required.</p> <p> Senator Marie Moloney advised Members of the closing date for submissions in respect of the mobility allowance.  I understand the transcripts of the debate were forwarded but, if not, I will ensure they are forwarded by 5 p.m.</p><p>Senator Paschal Mooney referred to an RTE programme.  Perhaps that matter can be addressed by the Cathaoirleach.  Certainly I did not have an input into the programme, nor was I asked.  A Member of the House suggested this would happen and I brought the matter to the attention of the Cathaoirleach's office.  Perhaps the Cathaoirleach will outline what happened in that regard.</p></speech>

It is an ideal opportunity for them.  It is only proper that the House would be utilised to give young people a voice and to listen.

I note the Minister of State has tabled 43 Report Stage amendments.  He also introduced 44 amendments on Committee Stage.  It is important that the Seanad has been of assistance to the Minister of State in progressing this Bill.</p> <p>That is the spirit in which we conduct our business and I welcome the Minister of State in that light.</p><p> Amendment No. 2 addresses one of my key concerns with this Bill.  Statutory instruments are crucial to this discussion, particularly SI No. 250 of 2010, which sets the industry on the wrong course.  The statutory instrument should not have been used to limit numbers because it contravened four decisions by the courts on the right of persons to enter the taxi sector and the public's right to the services of such persons.  I agree with the requirements that a statutory instrument or regulation should be published on the website when proposed and that representations should be considered.  Section 3(3) states: &quot;the Authority shall publish notice of their making and the regulations, rules or order or a description of them and reference to their statutory instrument numbers on its website.&quot;  However, subsection (4) appears to undo that by stating: &quot;The validity of any instruments made under this Act shall not be affected by any non-compliance with <i>subsection (2)</i>or <i>(3)</i>.&quot;  In view of the importance of statutory instruments in this area, non-compliance certainly undermines their validity.</p><p> We have to debate these issues in Parliament.  The section as it currently stands - I may have interpreted it wrong, and I welcome the Minister of State's judgment - appears to provide a get-out-of-jail-free clause for somebody who makes a mistake in drafting a statutory instrument.  He can say, &quot;That is okay, because anything I do here is not affected by non-compliance.&quot;  I acknowledge the Minister of State's interest in the deliberations of this House, but it is a strange request to make of us - to say that if someone makes a mistake or errs in some way, it does not matter.  All that was required under preceding subsections was that the proposed statutory instrument be published on the website with 21 days' notice, that representations be considered and that the regulations be made with or without modification.  Why would anybody need to resile from such a commitment?  I do not mean this in a partisan way, but the open government to which we all subscribe seems to be set at naught by this provision.  Let us ensure our statutory instruments are subject to scrutiny, particularly given their importance in this area and the impact of the decisions made in SI No. 250 of 2010.  We must be sure they are properly drafted.</p> <p>This get-out clause is wrong and I am putting this forward for the Minister of State to respond to it.</p></speech>

Section 3(4), which the Senators have proposed to delete, is a necessary safeguard to ensure any future prosecutions arising as a result of a breach of a regulation order will not fall foul of any legal challenge on the grounds that adequate consultation under sections 3(2) and 3(3) was not carried out.</p><p>  The Bill sets out clearly the scope the NTA has in making regulations concerning PSV, public service vehicles, licensing, assessment of applications for licences and PSV regulations.  However, were the NTA to make regulations <i>ultra vires</i> provided in the Bill, then this would be appropriate grounds for any legal challenge.  The amendment proposed by the Senators is not appropriate and does not serve any purpose and will, therefore, be not accepted.</p></speech>

The House has helped the Minister to make nearly 80 radical changes to the Bill as originally presented.  We support him on quality licensing.  However, the quantitative restrictions in SI 250/2010, Taxi Regulation Act 2003 (Grant of Taxi Licences) (Amendment) Regulations, should fall as the Minister is repealing the 2003 Act under which this statutory instrument was made.</p><p>  In its analysis, the ESRI has stated quantitative licensing has been the crucial point in limiting numbers entering the sector.  I have several reservations about it.  My legal advice is that the use of such an instrument to limit access to the deregulated sector is suspect as it involved overturning High Court decisions by means of statutory instrument.  If we are repealing the 2003 legislation, it should be understood that statutory instruments such as the 2010 quantitative licensing order that come under the Act should also fall.  This amendment wants to make sure there is no power to impose quantitative licensing on this sector again.</p><p>  I am most unhappy, as is Mr. Paul Gorecki, with how this was done in 2010.  Deregulation of the taxi sector was a major benefit to the economy with Goodbody estimating the overall benefit came to &#8364;780 million.  Indecon&#8217;s review never refers to this quantitative limit on entry into the sector which is crucial.  On Committee Stage, we worked hard to get the Minister away from quantitative licensing to quality licensing.</p> <p>I must press this amendment because it is the kernel of the issue.  The statutory instrument was wrongly used.  If the State disagreed with the High Court's decision, it should have appealed it to the Supreme Court.  Introducing a statutory instrument to limit the number of people who could operate taxis was wrong and did not make any sense in economic terms.  It was done on the basis of a misapprehension about policy which we can discuss.  We need to get rid of the statutory instrument.  It forms part of the 2003 Act that the Minister wants to repeal, on which we will support him.  However, we must dispense with the statutory instrument which imposed limits on quantities in the licensing of the sector.</p></speech>

The regulations concern the issuing of licences for wheelchair accessible vehicles only.  The restrictions in the grant of new licences for these vehicles seek to ensure the proportion of such vehicles in the overall fleet is increased.  The NTA is looking at further measures to promote the use of such vehicles.  However, for the present, it is appropriate to maintain the existing restrictions on new licences.  Therefore, I will not accept the amendments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-04-17a.202" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013041700024#Z00300"><p>With regret, I must press the amendment.  We have tried in all of our debates on this issue to move the Minister of State away from restrictions on quantities.  The policy was a major success, as is well documented.  The incumbent licence holders wanted to restore a scarcity value for licences and they did this through a statutory instrument, not by way of debate in this House or by appealing a court decision they had lost.  I recommend that the Minister of State read Paul Gorecki's ESRI papers on this issue.  He is right in saying this is the back door method through which the Government has reintroduced limits on quantities, about which there is no doubt.</p><p>  The Minister of State has imposed a barrier to entry, with the result that applicants must take the route of applying for a licence for a wheelchair accessible vehicle.  Paul Gorecki estimates that this adds 91% to the cost of a vehicle and 27% to running costs.  Whether the Minister of State likes it or whether he wants to admit it, it is obvious that this is what Statutory Instrument No. 250/2010 does.  Licences are already acquiring a scarcity value and are on sale in the <i>Evening Herald</i> every night.  This is what we are trying to prevent.  The Minister of State's predecessor was so good at restricting entry to the taxi business that the cost of licences increased to over &#8364;100,000, just for a piece of paper.  The Minister of State is restoring us to that position by confining entry.  He knows the cost disadvantage he is imposing and has deliberately set out to do this.  He has tried to say he is concerned about licensing to ensure quality, but this proves he is concerned with quantity in licensing because he will not allow new entrants in, unless they incur an additional capital cost of 91% and running costs of 27%.  He knows he is protecting incumbents safely and that this goes against the decision of the High Court, that people have a right to enter this sector and that the public has a right to avail of the services offered by such persons.</p><p>  I am pushing these amendments and the Bill falls.  A man pretending to be interested in licensing to ensure quality at the first fence has confirmed to us that he is really interested in quantities in licensing and seeking to restore us to the ridiculous state the industry was in before the courts intervened in 2000.  I commend the courts for their intervention, which was a splendid decision in economic terms.  However, the problem was that licence holders never accepted the decision and neither did many civil servants because the change was introduced by the courts before they had thought of it.  It is the tradition of the Department with responsibility for transport and the NTA to always obstruct competition, as is manifest in this instance, as we need new entrants. </p><p>  This decision affects the running of the taxi labour market, as pointed out by Dan O'Brien.  There is mass unemployment among those aged under 25 and 35 years, but the Minister is saying they cannot enter the taxi business with parity of conditions with incumbents.  This sector added about 20,000 jobs in the years after deregulation.  Shutting off a sector by placing a huge financial imposition on new entrants is unacceptable in economic terms.  Therefore, I strongly push the amendment.  The way proposed is the wrong way to go.  It is in the anti-competitive tradition of the Department with responsibility for transport which always takes the wrong option.  That tradition is followed in the Bill, as it was in Statutory Instrument No. 250/2010.  It reversed a policy which had been a huge success.  I do not know why it wrote out the Goodbody report or why it pretends this statutory instrument is not in place.  It is not referred to at all in the report of the taxi review group.</p> <p>The consequences of the banning of entrants would be extremely serious.  I strongly oppose it because it would involve a restoration of 1930s-style economics.</p></speech>

The entire sector was opened up to competition by a court decision.  However, the Minister is attempting to reintroduce quantity licensing.  Since 2003 local authorities have been removed from the sector.  Here the Minister seeks different regulatory regimes for different areas in the State.  It was a national regime when the Commission for Taxi Regulation was in charge.  Yet again the Minister is unwilling to allow the markets to operate in a sector which has operated successfully.  Yet again more restrictions are being imposed on competition within the industry.  I move that he does not seek powers to prevent the market operating.  The sector has operated successfully and increased in size.  It generated &#8364;780 million of benefits that Goodbody calculated and provided extra employment.  The sector did better without ministerial interference.  </p><p>  I endorse the recommendation made by the courts.  I know that the courts and the Government are not exactly the best of pals at present but the courts were right about this issue.  I see no reason to reintroduce a regime that did serious damage to the country until the courts opened up the sector.  To return to a system which palpably failed based on untrue allegations about the success or lack of a successful deregulation is not the way to go.  That is why I see the provision as needless regulatory creep and capture by incumbents rather than promoting an open market.  The troika and everybody else has said that we should tackle the cost of sheltered sector services.  The legislation seeks to protect the providers of sheltered services.  The Minister is going in the wrong direction and that is why I tabled my two amendments.  </p></speech>

I remember well how bad the sector was.  I have had experience in more recent years of travelling to Brussels quite a lot.  The Minister must travel to Brussels quite a lot but he may have somebody to meet him.  Let us say that a flight arrives at 9.30 a.m. at Brussels airport then one will have to queue for an hour for a taxi in order to arrive at a meeting at 10.30 a.m. in the city.  The delay is due to the airport being in a different district from the city.  Only people from the area are allowed to take passengers away from there.  I learned quickly what one must do.  One must go to the departures gate and as a car pulls up to let somebody out one must cheat by jumping into the car.  It is most frustrating to have areas in control of their own area unlike the Irish system.  As Senator Barrett has said, the courts decided to deregulate the sector.  The current proposal will introduce regulation on a geographical basis which is not in the best interests of the public or the taxi business.</p></speech>

Section 7(4) allows the National Transport Authority to make regulations setting different requirements and conditions in respect of different categories and classes of vehicles, SPSV driver and licences as well as under paragraph (b ) for different circumstances and under paragraph (c ) for different areas of the State.  These provisions restate similar provisions in section 34(8) of the Taxi Regulation Act 2003.  Paragraph (b ) will enable the National Transport Authority to make regulations, if needed, to deal with items such as drivers operating in different circumstances, for example, providing SPSV services in areas of social need where there is a lack of public transport.  I envisage a further amendment to the Bill on Committee Stage in the other House, dealing with this issue and I will return to this House for a further debate on that matter.  Paragraph (c) enables the National Transport Authority to make regulations currently concerning the county areas where a taxi driver can stand or ply for hire.  Such regulations include a requirement for taxi drivers to have knowledge of the area of SPSV operations.  This is critical.  It is important that the person picking one up in the taxi knows where he or she is going.  That is the reason for the requirement.  Under current National Transport Authority regulations there is no limit on the number of areas in which an SPSV driver can operate.  They can operate in all 26 counties if the driver passes the area knowledge test for each area in which he or she wishes to stand or ply for hire.  There is not a restriction provided they know where they are going.  As I have already stated on a number of occasions this is not to provide for any plan to return to the system of licensing which was in place prior to liberalisation whereby the number of licences available in any area depended on the local authority area.</p><p>Similarly, I cannot accept amendments Nos. 32, 33 and 36 which relate to section 19 of the Bill.  I am not persuaded by the Senators arguments in support of their proposed amendments.  These amendments provide for the National Transport Authority to make SPSV regulations also relating to different areas of operation of SPSV services or the operation of SPSV services in different circumstances.</p></speech>

We will oppose other amendments.  The spirit of what the Minister of State has said is to restore the industry to its pre-2002 position.  He is using statutory instruments, which is what we caught him on the last time on the last vote, to undermine High Court decisions.  Every time we try to see the liberal man who is opening up the market he always retreats.  I will withdraw this amendment but I will press others because this is the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport at its worst with Neanderthal economics overturning policies on the flimsiest of grounds which have proven to be a success and he is going to restore a draconian regime.  The worst part is that what is in the Bill is what the courts will be judging.  The liberal sentiments that the Minister of State sometimes expresses do not have any standing in a court.  This is restoring the old licensing system.  The licences are already on sale in the <i>Evening Herald</i> each night for &#8364;3,500 whereas they cost &#8364;100,000 on the last occasion.  The Minister of State is on a route on which I will not support him one inch of the way.  I will withdraw the amendment but I will have to press other amendments because the economic policy he is proposing is going seriously off the rails.</p></speech>

We said that perhaps people from the border areas of Kilkenny, Waterford and Limerick serve the area.  The Minister of State expressed concerns that those people do not know the routes and so on.  He said there was the possibility that a Limerick taxi driver going to Birdhill would have to go to Clonmel to do a knowledge test and this would happen for every county in the country.  When we asked about satellite navigation and global positioning systems the Minister of State said that it was not an adequate substitute.  I have asked people in the area if satellite navigation is a substitute for the written examination or if people need a PhD in taxi driving and geography lessons on each of the 32 counties to go anywhere.  One professor of electrical engineering asked if the Minister of State was for real.  He said that ambulances have satellite navigation, the Garda cars have global positioning systems and many of the commercial fleets use satellite navigation which are more than 90% reliable.</p><p>  When the Minister of State made the statement on the last day I do not think he had seen his colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Sherlock, who promotes technology.  People in the field cannot honestly believe the Minister of State's rejection of satellite navigation technology.  We are not convinced.  Ireland is a country which has engaged in modern technology and the technology is improving all the time.  People can get it on their telephones.  The system is better than requiring people to sit written examinations.  I see the written examinations in the context of this Bill as another device by the Department to keep new entrants out.  If the technology helps them to find houses on the tops of mountains and so on and is used by the ambulance service and the Irish Coast Guard, under the remit of his own Department, he should accept that satellite navigation is a substitute unless he wants to abolish pens and go back to the quill instead of abolishing calculators and examinations.   The technophobia shown in the attitude to satellite navigation does not serve the Bill except to confirm again that the Minister of State is seeking new ways to keep people out.  People in each county will lobby and succeed.  The satellite navigation used by the Garda, the ambulance service and the fire service and from various companies, Garmin and TomTom, work.  People find it incredible that the Minister of State insists on a written examination in this day and age.  I will push the amendment to allow global positioning systems to be used to take people on taxi journeys.  As it is used for everything else, I see no reason it cannot be used in this instance.  I was not convinced by the Minister of State's requirement that a Limerick taxi driver on entering Birdhill would have to take a written examination on the geography of Tipperary. </p></speech>

However, global positioning systems cannot provide a basis for lessening the standard of area knowledge required under the driver skills testing.  This may happen over time as GPS technology improves the standard of reliability and effectiveness.  In regard to amendment No. 16, I acknowledge that GPS might well play a role where SPSV drivers ask to provide a service to a destination outside of an area in respect of which he or she has passed an area knowledge test.  However, I am not convinced there is a case for statutory provision requiring knowledge of global positioning systems.  I am not technophobic.  In fact, I am probably the most pro technology person in government and a graduate who has a masters in technology.  One may wish to check that out before making such statements.</p><p>I am surprised at the attitude in relation to this issue.  I have had personal experience of taxis using satellite navigation who could not take me to my destination.  The systems may be 90% accurate but they are not foolproof.  Given that a service is being provided for which one must pay one's hard earned cash, the person behind the wheel of the vehicle should be able to take a person to his or her destination and should have an area knowledge that meets that requirement.  In some cases it can be supplemented by a piece of technology such as this.  Unfortunately it is a requirement and I stand over the need for it.  I am surprised at the way in which the amendment is being pressed because common sense would suggest that a driver behind the wheel of a vehicle who has to take a person to his or her destination as quickly and as cheaply as possible, which satellite navigation does not necessarily guarantee, would know that is not foolproof and one cannot use the system to get around everywhere.  If one used satellite navigation on a regular basis one would be aware of that.</p></speech>

I am sure that if the Senator used a satnav regularly, he would know that himself.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-04-17a.260" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="17:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013041700031#HH00400"><p>I move amendment No. 17:<blockquote><br />In page 12, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:&quot;(3) In making regulations under this section the Authority shall not take into consideration the short-term or long-term economic viability of the licence applicant or the short-term or long-term economic viability of any other licence holder.&quot;.</blockquote>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Alan Kelly, back to the House.  The purpose of amendment No. 17 is to allay fears that the legislation is going in the wrong direction and represents a case of regulatory capture by the licence holders over the Department.  I remember the Minister saying the industry was full of tax evaders and social welfare fraud.  The task force of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, found one person with a forged driving licence.  We were told the industry was the subject of serious consumer dissatisfaction.  In 2001, there were 601 consumer complaints, which number was down to 175 by 2010.  As we said to the Minister on Committee Stage, that are far fewer complaints by many factors than the number of complaints to the Ombudsman about governance in general in the State.  The number of offences was down from 117 to 33 over the same period, with the application of the Probation Act going from nine cases to zero.  Fines fell from &#8364;84,000 to &#8364;14,000.</p><p>  Listening to the evidence of the Minister of State, it appears that what is going on here is the reintroduction of quantity licences.  Nothing that has happened in the debate has reassured us on that.  The legislation is highly protectionist in nature.  It happens.  Producers in most sectors are far more powerful than consumers.  The consumer benefits have been ignored in any analysis which has taken place and the regulatory impact assessment appeared six weeks after the Bill was published.  The Department was making it up as it went along and never attempted seriously a regulatory impact assessment.  This as a sheltered sector of the economy which has achieved control over the Department, which is a situation that is not unique.</p><p>  The formula we propose for the amendment is taken from the IMF-troika agreement on opening up the market for general practitioners in the State as provided for in the Health (Provision of General Practitioner Services) Act 2012.  This will undoubtedly go to law and the assurances of the Minister will amount to nothing unless he changes the Bill to show the troika that this is not another sheltered sector which has the Government doing its bidding and that we will not take into account the long or short-term financial viability of the licence applicant or the impact on other people in the industry.  The proposed provision is taken straight from what the Government has already agreed under the 2012 Act.  I certainly require an assurance that we can have a quality-only market and that the Minister and National Transport Authority will not take into account the factors which we have listed, including short-term or long-term economic viability of the licence applicant, or short-term or long-term economic viability of any other licence holder.  One is entitled to enter a sector in which one does not eventually make money.</p><p>  The Government should not walk itself into an impasse whereby it guarantees the income of self-employed people during a recession.  It cannot be done.  That was the purpose of SI 250 of 2010 and it had that impact.  The thinking behind the statutory instrument permeates the Bill and requires us to move the amendment to show that this is about quality licensing, not quantity licensing or protectionism.  Protectionism is in every syllable of the Bill.</p> <p>That is why we had to table the amendment.  It brings a sheltered sector service, which has achieved regulatory capture, into the overall attempt to recover the economy.  We have too many sheltered sector activities and they damage national competitiveness.  The formula was used in previous occasions and we have adapted it to apply to this sector.  No sector should be able to have new entrants excluded on the basis that incumbents are not making enough money; it is called the market.  Even though there is a deep recession in the country, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and its agencies are encouraging new entrants and entrepreneurs.  We need the assurance there will be that facility in the sector, as there was when the number of vehicles doubled between 2000 and 2008 and the number of drivers increased in similar proportions.  It worked well and the allegations made against it are disproved in a paper presented by the regulator, Ms Kathleen Doyle, in Lisbon on 13 July 2010.</p><p>Everything in the Bill confirms it is an exercise in protectionism and we want that excluded.  The licence holders have had far too much power and the consumer interest and competitiveness interest have been neglected.  Consumers need reassurance and I am happy to propose the amendment.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 17 and 22 strengthen our ability to introduce competition in the area.  Since having taken an interest in this, I am amazed at any movement to go back to where we were in the past.  The Minister of State may shake his head but that seems to be what we are doing here.  When I was in the grocery business, I would have loved to see a grocery Bill applying the same measures.  It would have placed limits on those who could open grocery shops and would have taken into account whether one would be viable.  That was done in Holland, because of the influence of grocers, when one needed a licence to open a shop.  It ended up in the most outrageous situation where there was a limited number of grocery shops, with one in each town or area.  The cost of food increased and the service was outrageously bad.  The amendments tabled by Senator Barrett will protect the customer, the citizen and the Irish economy.  The amendment provides that, in making regulation under this section, the authority shall not take into consideration the short-term or long-term economic viability of the licence applicant or the short-term or long-term economic viability of any other licence holder.  It makes sense.  The measure in the Bill is exactly what the union or body representing the taxi drivers would love to see but it does not make sense for the citizens, the taxpayer and for our economy.  I urge the Minister of State to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

The comparison he made is not relevant to the industry we are discussing.  I will not accept amendments Nos. 17 and 22.  There is no justification for the proposed inclusions.  I am not clear on the intention of the Senator.  The regulatory framework provided for in the Bill is clearly oriented towards maintaining appropriate quality standards in the industry in terms of suitability and expertise of persons to become SPSV drivers and providing for appropriate vehicle standards.  There is no provision relating to assessment of economic viability.</p><p>I cannot accept the proposal with regard to non-discrimination.  In an industry such as this, the imposition of regulatory change may well require discriminatory treatment where there are new requirements of incumbents and where there is change.  This is a common feature of regulatory systems where incumbents retain grandfather rights while new entrants are required to meet the standards over time.  This is being done with new licences in respect of wheelchair accessible vehicles.  It also arises in the context of more demanding area knowledge requirements, where there has been change over time.</p><p>With regard to amendment No. 31 to section 15, the prohibition of transfers is precisely aimed at ensuring the SPSV licences relate to a person's suitability to hold the licence and do not have a monetary value.  This is in line with action No. 14 of the taxi regulation review report.  As such, the possibility that funding will be diverted into the purchase of licenses does not arise.</p></speech>

That is why we are trying to close it off.  It is in every line of the taxi review group report.  The taxi representatives won the debate that day but they did not win it with me.  People insisted that we must control new entrants because incumbents could not make any money, which was a factor in the framing of the Bill.  This approach succeeded, and it is how SI 250 of 2010 came into place.</p><p>The troika has commented on Ireland's tradition of interest groups controlling matters.  They certainly controlled this one through two blockades at the airports and occupation of the regulator's office.  These actions worked a treat because the Government caved in and gave them this Bill.  Everyone knows that.  For the sake of the country, we should include a section, such as the amendment proposes, for every sector that comes in here looking for special treatment.  I thank the IMF for giving us the formula we used.  That special pleading and special interest groups, not to mention the banks that walked out with &euro;64 billion, always get their way is part of what brought this country onto the rocks.  We are trying to give some legal protection to society at large and to say that moan-ins in Departments looking for special treatment, bans on new entrants and bans on satnavs must be balanced with the consumer interest.  Some of the responsibility when people are no longer economically viable rests with the people concerned.  Some new entrants will also make mistakes.  The State cannot guarantee any set of self-employed people a living.  The numbers in the Goodbody report show it did not happen but the taxi people have always resented new entrants.  Hence, the blockade of airports, the occupation of buildings and the High Court cases to have them removed.  That how is how the legislation came about but we must have measures to protect the consumer.</p></speech>

Barrett and provides for consultation by the National Transport Authority with the National Disability Authority on guidelines concerning the physical or mental capacity of a person to hold a licence to drive an SPSV under section 8(5).  Following review of the section, it is the case that the statutory power in respect of the medical fitness of drivers is with the Road Safety Authority under section 4 of the Road Safety Authority Act 2006.  The national programme office for traffic medicine was recently established by the RSA to take the lead in the development and implementation of the national framework on standards in traffic medicine.  The office recently published general guidance in this area and plans to develop sector specific guidance.  Hence, this change is being made.</p></speech>

Furthermore, targeting the provision wider than road vehicles gives rise to a level of complexity not required to address the core policy objective of passenger and road safety.</p><p>  I thank Senator Sean D. Barrett for his contribution on Committee Stage during which he raised concerns about the application of section 11, which I have considered.  I also thank other Senators for their contributions.  The amended section 11 will oblige a licence holder or an applicant to inform the licensing authority and give evidence of other employments, thereby putting the NTA on notice that a licence holder has another occupation.  The amended section will be limited to occupations which involve driving vehicles.  It will relate to the powers of the NTa under section 17(1)(<i>a</i>) to make SPSV regulations concerning the period of time a driver may drive an SPSV, which applies to both whole-time and part-time taxi drivers and the intervals of rest between driving an SPSV and another vehicle in the course of another occupation.</p></speech>

However, I am concerned that a problem remains.  Under the European Convention on Human Rights, every person has a right to respect for his or her private and family life, home and correspondence.  Does the requirement for the applicant to disclose information to his or her employer breach that right to privacy in a context which has no bearing on his or her employment as laid down in a contract?  It is a pity some of my legal colleagues are not in the House.  Do part-time drivers have protection under European Community law?  Does the problem which previously arose in the High Court with Mr. Justice Roderick Murphy arise in this instance, namely, that of anti-competitiveness where people who may be non-nationals have two part-time jobs?  Mr. Justice Murphy did not like that aspect.  Paragraph (<i>b)</i><b><i></i></b>states the applicant must inform any employer of his or hers in writing.  I appreciate that the Minister of State was keen to confine this provision to driving.  However, it is not unusual for people to have two part-time jobs.  Such persons enjoy protection under the convention on human rights.  They are also particularly valuable in this industry because as the research indicates, 85% of business is done between Thursday and Saturday.  It is for this reason that we need part-time workers.  I know they are disliked in the tenor of this legislation, but they are proof of efficiency.</p></speech>

I offer my personal thanks to him in this regard because I know he is very concerned about the issue and that he shares my frustration at the slow rate of progress, for want of a better word, in this area.  The motion notes that 94,000 residential mortgages are in arrears of 90 days of more, as are 28,000 buy-to-let mortgages.  These were not developer-led properties, as a large number of them were investments people made in their futures.  In respect of mounting arrears of between 30 and 90 days, close to one in four principle private residences and up to 40% of buy-to-let mortgages are in arrears.</p><p>  We are particularly concerned that the problem is getting worse.  Householders are now facing the additional burden of the residential property tax, which we have debated at length.  That tax does not take into account ability to pay or the possibility that somebody could be paying the tax on a property that is already in mortgage arrears.  All of us meet people in our areas who are either already in arrears or are just about able to pay their bills.  The Irish League of Credit Unions and others have independently reported on the amount of disposable income that remains available to people. </p><p>  I propose to offer solutions rather than simply lambast the Government for the slow rate of progress.  I think we can all agree on certain matters.  Nearly one year ago the Minister of State suggested to this House that the Personal Insolvency Bill would be a game changer.  I am sorry to say that I do not agree.  I do not mean that in any disrespectful way but because I am particularly concerned with the veto allowed to the banks.  For this reason, the motion proposes that the Government should consider the legislation that my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, has introduced to establish an independent debt settlement office.  If we leave the resolution of the mortgage arrears crisis to the lender without protecting the mortgagee, we will still be dealing with this issue in four or five years' time.  The fairest approach is an independent office with full arbiter powers to adjudicate on specific cases.</p><p>  Furthermore, the Government needs to establish a view on how to define a sustainable mortgage.  It is not acceptable to me, my colleagues or the vast majority of citizens that the definition of &quot;sustainable&quot; is left to the bank to decide.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the provision suggested by New Beginnings and FLAC that no more than 35% of net take home pay after tax should be used to service a mortgage.  If that can be set as the benchmark we can begin to consider solutions such as split mortgages, which are happening sporadically, and extensions to mortgage terms.  This House had a late night debate on the wind down of IBRC and the new terms for the promissory notes.  Ireland in effect received an extension of a mortgage term and a reduction in interest rates.  The general public, who are doing their best to pay their mortgages, are asking for the same thing.  I am not sure that debt write-downs are the way forward but many of the people who are in arrears have 20 or 25 year mortgages and have the capacity to extend their mortgage terms.  However, when they request extensions the banks revalue their properties at the current market rates and, even if they agree, allow a maximum loan-to-value of 80% on the new valuation.  That is no use to the applicants because their mortgages are higher than the new valuation.  The Government needs to set out clearly what sustainability means.  We cannot leave it to the banks or the Central Bank to define this.  We need to state what is fair because people need hope in this area.  There is no hope as matters stand.</p><p>  Last year the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government with responsibility for housing, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, addressed this House at length about the mortgage-to-let solution, whereby and individual would hand the property to a local authority and pay rent on it.  I described this proposal as an abomination but in any case most local authorities refuse to even operate the scheme.</p> <p>When we leave it up to lenders or local authorities to actually come up with good faith solutions, it simply does not happen.  The domestic economy will not move unless we work towards resolving the mortgage crisis.  It cannot be done by simply setting a target for our pillar banks to talk to X thousand people a month on a case-by-case basis.  As we wait for solutions, the problem is getting worse.  Will the Government review its proposals to get rid of the statutory code of conduct on mortgage arrears and its plan to reverse the Dunne judgment?</p><p>I disagree with the Secretary General of the Department of Finance, Mr. Moran, that the level of repossessions is unnaturally low.  I do not agree with letting the market decide as there is no society but an economy, as advocated by a former Prime Minister in our nearest neighbouring country.  This should not be the policy that Fine Gael or Labour follows.  If the statutory code of conduct on mortgage arrears is removed, the levels of distress among borrowers will increase exponentially.  Furthermore, if the Dunne judgment is reversed, it will tell the banks to carry out wholesale repossessions of homes and not just on principal private residences.</p><p>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, has spoken at length about second properties and the buy-to-let sector.  I do not believe this area should be fair game either.  Up to 40,000 families invested in buy-to-let for their future because they may not have a pension scheme.  They are not necessarily speculators or developers.  They also need some protection.  Nobody should take the legs from under these people who have put tens of thousands of euro into these properties.</p><p>We have raised several matters in this motion.  It will be seen from it too that it is not a political motion.  We are not lambasting the Government but are trying to put forward genuine solutions to this problem, solutions which my colleague Senator MacSharry brought forward over a year ago in his Family Home Bill which was defeated in this House by only three votes.  We are trying to come forward as a party with solutions to assist.  We are imploring the Government not to leave the personal insolvency legislation as it stands with a full veto for the banks and without recourse to an appeals process, as well as reversing the Dunne judgment and tearing up the statutory code of conduct on mortgage arrears.</p></speech>

However, it is not talk we need but action on the various recommendations to solve the problem of mortgage arrears.  I do not hold the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, responsible for this matter.  In fact, he is a brilliant performer and I am great fan of his.  However, we are only as good as the briefing material we are supplied with and the information at hand.  Whoever wrote the Government&#8217;s amendment to our motion has not been listening to the debate on mortgage arrears.  It states, Seanad &Eacute;ireann &#8220;acknowledges that this Government inherited a severe mortgage arrears crisis from the previous Government&#8221;.  What does that mean?  We have the Taoiseach on the front of <i>Time</i> magazine accepting accolades that were for the late Brian Lenihan for the actions he had taken and yet this Government claims all the problems were created by the previous Government.  There were some governments that managed to do the same in Spain, Portugal, Greece, Japan, Italy, Cyprus, America, France, Germany and many other countries.  Fianna F&aacute;il is a lot better than the GAA and the Catholic church.  I accept there were some mistakes made and they have been acknowledged and apologised for but still we have some muppet in the Fine Gael press office writing that Seanad &Eacute;ireann &#8220;acknowledges that this Government inherited a severe mortgage arrears crisis from the previous Government&#8221;.  The motion might as well state it also acknowledges the brilliant fiscal management as announced on the radio by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, when sympathising with the nation and supported by the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, and many others.</p><p>  One reason the opinion polls are not favourable to the Government is that people are a bit sick of being told this is all Fianna F&aacute;il&#8217;s fault.</p></speech>

We brought forward the Family Home Bill in 2011 to put up tangible solutions to the problem yet at the time the Government claimed it was not necessary and was unconstitutional.  It even claimed the code on mortgage arrears was working exceptionally well when the Central Bank&rsquo;s own analysis of it stated 60% of the banks were not even following it.</p><p>I, like many other Members, have had to mediate on behalf of vulnerable families in mortgage arrears who do not feel capable of taking on the banks.  I had a case of someone who wanted to avail of the mortgage-to-rent scheme which the Government announced recently with much fanfare.  However, the bank would not allow them to avail of the scheme.  Instead, it reduced the mortgage repayment to &euro;250 for three months so the individual could pay down some secondary debt.  That is superficial and does not deal with the problem.</p><p>One of the contributing factors behind the rejection of Croke Park II is because people see the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, celebrating the benefits of lengthening out our term of debt and the promissory note deal but see nothing for them in return.  The Minister of State stated it was great for exiting the programme and getting us back into the markets.  The phrase used was &ldquo;re-profiling our debt&rdquo;.  While these developments are welcome, people are asking what is in it for the people.  What about the couple in an estate in Sligo town whose value of their home is down 25% and who want to avail of the mortgage-to-rent scheme so as not to throw equity down the drain but are told they cannot?  Instead, they are told their mortgage repayments will be reduced to &euro;250 for three months.  That is like Brussels telling the Minister for Finance that our repayments on the promissory note will be reduced for a while but then it will shoot back up again afterwards.  It would not be worth anything.</p><p>The people have not entered this debate.  The banks are superficially engaging with people in mortgage arrears.  I accept the chief executive of AIB is briefing Members now about the bank&rsquo;s approach to mortgage arrears.  One can show lots of statistics but on the ground no one is getting real solutions.  Have the banks told those people at my age, 39 years of age, who have a 25-year mortgage and have paid off 15 years of it but lost their job, that it will freeze their mortgage until the economy bounces back and they find employment again?  Has this happened to anyone?  No it has not.</p> <p>Now we are tearing that up and I am flabbergasted by that.  The Personal Insolvency Bill was described aptly by Deputy Higgins in the D&aacute;il; it is like putting the foxes in charge of the henhouse.  The banks are all-powerful and we have torn up the code of conduct on mortgage arrears by telling the banks to forget it and do whatever they want and get on with it.  This is ridiculous in the extreme.  As Senator Barrett has said here many times, there seems to be a private stairway, metaphorically speaking, for bankers into the Department of Finance.  Sadly, this has been borne out.  I look forward to an explanation for this in another debate, as well as an explanation for the contact between the Secretary General, Mr. Moran, and the Barclay brothers to try to facilitate the sale of assets that belong to the people.  This is very worrying.</p><p>To return to the current issue, how many times must we have this same debate?  How many times must we acknowledge that we need tangible solutions rather than woolly stuff that looks good on the surface but does nothing on the ground?  With regard to the mortgage-to-let option, we are taking no cognisance of the fact that families live in these homes.  Banks and receivers will not give tuppence for those people.  They want vacant possession and will sell homes out from under people.  We need to consider this seriously.</p></speech>

Discounting the political rhetoric, both contributions put forward some positive suggestions.  This is an important amendment that will add flavour and texture to the motion.</p></speech>

I see this as very much a micro approach.  The macro approach is being dealt with by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, with their various initiatives in Brussels, from the promissory notes to what happened at the ECOFIN meeting the other day and through the many other segments we do not hear about that are happening in the background.  The choreography and myriad of small things happening facilitate a bigger wheel and will bring results in due course.</p><p>The micro side of the issue concerns the individuals in this country who are on their knees trying to survive.  This morning I had the experience of meeting a client who got a good deal from Permanent TSB.  I am aware Senator MacSharry has an interest in that institution, and his father is doing great work there.  The deal achieved by this individual was acceptable.  It was not 100% what she wanted, but it was not far from it.  Certainly, it will allow her to sleep at night, which she has not been able to do for a long time.  This was my first positive experience of dealing with a bank in a long time.  Perhaps we are now seeing a situation in which the banks are beginning to respond.</p><p>The Government has set ambitious targets to be met by the end of the year.  While I like the idea of a report card on the Government, this issue is very much a report card for the banks as each arrangement made will help a family in trouble.  I am confident the targets will be met because the banks are finally realising they have a significant responsibility here.  When people are prepared to meet the banks some of the way, they have a moral responsibility and a responsibility to the country to go a long way towards meeting them.  Obviously, there will be situations in which people bury their heads in the sand.  When this happens, it is very difficult to know what to do.  People are given every opportunity and I hope that those people who are in trouble will engage with the system.  They may find, like the person with whom I dealt this morning, that things are not as bad as they seem.  The banking industry is finally realising it has a responsibility in this area.</p><p>I wish to comment on the issue of buy-to-let properties.  I received a letter two weeks ago from a couple who had bought three houses with money earned during more buoyant times.  Now they are in a situation in which they cannot meet the mortgage repayments.  The rent being received for the properties is only a fraction of what they were receiving and they are now facing financial ruin.  Potentially, they could be taxed on losses.  I have not come across a situation before in which a person could be taxed on losses, but it is possible this couple face that.  There is an issue with regard to buy-to-let properties.  During the boom, people received advice from so-called financial advisers to buy property, but they now find themselves in a situation in which these properties are a noose around their necks.  This is an issue that needs to be addressed.</p><p>I believe the Government has taken this issue by the scruff of the neck.  The situation has been that the banks and bankers have been slow to react and they have not played ball in the manner expected by the citizens of this country who bailed them out.  Some institutions are better than others.  I did not realise the CEO of AIB is in the Oireachtas today.  This is good.  It is important that the CEOs of AIB and all the other banks engage with the representatives of the people who hear daily what people are going through.  The CEO of Permanent TSB will be in the Oireachtas tomorrow.  This type of collaboration, discussion and accountability is important.  However, the manner in which the CEO of another bank treated the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform a couple of months ago was regrettable.  That aggressive type of personality and behaviour is not what is required in a time of crisis.</p><p>We are in a war.  The people are in an economic war for survival.  The Government is at the helm of the ship, trying to steer us through the most turbulent and aggressive waters the country has ever seen.  Our mere survival was at risk a couple of years ago.  Now, we can see some sort of light at the end of the tunnel and some hope of plain sailing ahead.  Make no mistake, however; there are turbulent and troubled waters ahead.  These will be a challenge and the situation will be difficult.  There has never been a better time to be in Government, because this is a time when political leadership is required, not just from the Government, but from all sides of the House.  There has been significant political leadership from all sides and I hope to see that continue.  That is what the people expect of all of us.  I commend the amendment to the House.</p></speech>

Unemployment is approximately 14% and some 1.8 million people have only &euro;50 left at the end of the month.  More than 180,000 mortgages are in serious distress and approximately 115 fall into distress each day.  For many people, paying their mortgage is not an option.  Families throughout the country are suffering.  They are distraught and people wonder whether they will be able to pay their mortgages or feed their children.  Many people can only pay their mortgages by making impossible choices at the end of the month on what bills to pay.  They must choose whether to pay for their home or pay other essential bills.</p><p>The alarm bells for the mortgage crisis began ringing in December 2009.  The exponential rise in mortgage arrears in the subsequent three and a half years reflects the absolute and abject failure of successive governments to deal with the situation.  I must agree with the first part of the Government amendment, which acknowledges that the current Government inherited a severe mortgage arrears crisis from the previous Government and notes the responsibility of the previous Government for the creation of that crisis and its abject failure to address it properly.</p> <p>The property bubble was fuelled by the cosy relationship with developers, lax regulation of the banks and reckless tax policies.  The number of families in mortgage distress increased dramatically - to almost 50,000 - between 2009 and 2011.  The 180,000 families that are currently in mortgage distress are rightly asking why Fianna F&aacute;il did not introduce the proposals we are discussing today when it was in government.  Why did Fianna F&aacute;il not legislate to protect the family home when it had a chance to do so?</p></speech>

My party has expressed concern about the power of veto that is given to the banks in the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.  Our fear is that the Act will be of little use to the majority of people who are currently in distress.  We believe we need to stop treating the banks with kid gloves.  We have allowed the threat of repossession to loom large.  We need to start taking better and more decisive action in this regard.  My colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, has expressed concern that the code of conduct on mortgage arrears leaves the power of final say in cases of mortgage restructuring in the hands of the same banks that allowed the crisis to escalate.  We are also concerned that residential and buy-to-let mortgages are being put in the same category.</p><p>Matthew Elderfield has said there will be an increase in repossessions if banks consider it more beneficial to sell a house at its current value than to restructure the loan.  There was a fear that banks would be allowed to repossess after 30 days when the 12-month moratorium was lifted.  There were also concerns that as part of the suite of new measures, banks would be given the power under the revised code of conduct on mortgage arrears to move borrowers from tracker mortgages as part of any restructuring.  We believe there needs to a fair approach to mortgages that involves putting the family home first, with independent adjudication leading to resolutions.</p><p>I will go through some of the proposals we have detailed in our amendment.  We believe an independent statutory distressed mortgage resolution process needs to be established.  As part of that process, it should be possible to establish legally binding mortgage distress resolutions on a case-by-case basis.  It would protect the family home by means of a variety of measures, including write-downs, shared equity and transfer-of-tenure-type social renting.</p><p>One of the benefits of our proposals is that money can be saved by reducing an at-risk mortgage to a payable amount.  As we all know, unmanageable mortgages cost the State money.  If the banks do not deal with distressed mortgages, they will be required to raise more capital.  We feel that if this is not dealt with in a concrete way that helps home owners, further economic problems will be created.  In other words, the domestic economy will be further depressed if a large section of the population is taken out of the spending economy.  That, in turn, will exacerbate the problems we face down the line.</p><p>We need to direct the banks to deal with this issue in a proactive manner.  We should make sure the banks do not have the power of final say on mortgage restructuring.  We have to ensure this is done in an independently adjudicated way.  If we require the banks to pass on the interest rate reductions agreed by the European Central Bank, that will ensure people get the best value.  We have detailed some solutions and suggestions in our amendment, which I appreciate will not be taken.  I am sure the Minister of State will comment on them when he contributes to this debate.</p></speech>

I do not question the bone fides of those who have proposed this motion.  They have shown their concern for this issue on a number of occasions in this House.  I refer particularly to Senator MacSharry.  When he proposed his Private Members' Bill, we said that while we supported the theory of his proposal, unfortunately we could not support the legislation itself because it placed too much emphasis on the role of the courts in resolving these issues.  Our view was that out-of-court settlements were preferable for most people.</p><p>It is important for us to acknowledge that progress has been made.  The Government has been in office for just over two years.  While it might not be all-singing and all-dancing, the Personal Insolvency Act 2012, which this Government introduced, is very comprehensive.  It remains to be seen how the legislation, when it is rolled out, will link with the existing code of conduct on mortgage arrears provisions.  Much of what is coming down the track is presenting us with challenges.  The rules and procedures contained in the code of conduct on mortgage arrears and the mortgage arrears resolution process are being fundamentally overhauled.  The mortgage arrears resolution targets, which require lenders to propose targets that we hope are viable, are being rolled out.  The Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill 2013 will be passed.  As I mentioned, the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 is being rolled out.</p><p>At this point, I would like to formally second the amendment, as I believe I am required to do.</p><p>Up to now, we have experienced what I would loosely call a phoney war.  We could sit here all day and debate the reasons for the phoney war.  Clearly, the Dunne judgment is one of those reasons.  In effect, it tied the hands of lenders in seeking summary judgment for possession.  There are other reasons for the phoney war.  Principally, bankers and financial institutions have not been willing to face this country's serious and significant problem with mortgage debt.  It is probably the greatest crisis faced by this Government and this country at the moment.  I will not revisit the numbers that demonstrate the extent of that distress.  There is an issue in this regard.  There are reasons targets have to be set for financial institutions.  It is important to bear in mind that for every borrower in this country, there is a lender.  I do not believe lenders have faced up to their responsibilities with regard to the mortgage crisis.  I await the day when they face up to them.</p><p>I would like to take this opportunity to raise a couple of issues, set out where some of the proposals that have been made to date stand and elaborate on what needs to be done to make progress.  A debate of this nature gives us an opportunity to make positive suggestions as well as rehashing recent history.  This House has considered a number of motions on mortgage arrears over the last two years.  I am disappointed that the mortgage-to-rent scheme is being rolled out so slowly.  I accept that conveyancing issues and other legal difficulties have arisen.  I have been assured that faster progress has started to be made.</p><p>The original Cooney report proposed that a mortgage-to-lease scheme be considered as a possible solution.  If such a scheme were available to banks and - potentially - the State, it would be much more cost-effective than the mortgage-to-rent scheme.  I put it to the Minister of State that it should be considered.  It would involve the relevant lending institution offering the State a long-term option over a property for ten or 20 years, similar to what happens under the rental accommodation scheme or the long-term leasing scheme.  It would ensure the property would not have to be acquired by a housing association.  I ask all parties to consider this proposal.</p><p>Much of the debate on this issue to date has focused on residential mortgages.  Members know I feel very strongly about this.  Some of the comments made by people such as Patrick Honohan and Matthew Elderfield have treated those who live in buy-to-let properties like second-class citizens.</p></speech>

One in four families in this country lives in a rented property.  In the Dublin area, the figure is one in three.  Some 40% of people in Galway live in rented properties.  They are families too and deserve to be recognised as such.  We have not yet had a process in this area.  We have had a process for people in residential mortgage distress, but we have not recognised the importance of assisting families that live in buy-to-let properties.  The ill-thought-out comments that have been made in this regard have suggested it is appropriate to let rip in the buy-to-let mortgage sector.  We need to recognise those family homes and consider carefully how the lives of those families are to be taken into account.</p><p>I wish to speak briefly about social housing.  I am conscious of the level of arrears in local authorities.  They have been able to put a mortgage arrears resolution process in place, but they do not have the resources to offer the options that banks and financial institutions have been able to offer.  They need to be capitalised to the point at which they will be able to offer such solutions.</p><p>I would like to refer to the review of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  I have sincere difficulty with the case-by-case approach that is being taken.</p></speech>

A person on a certain income can receive a proposal from one lending institution, but somebody else on the same income might be given a totally different option from another institution.  If we do nothing else, we should recognise the importance of free and independent expert legal advice.  There needs to be a level playing field in this regard.  We do not have it at the moment.  People are getting offers from lending institutions.  We are setting targets for lending institutions.</p> <p>Those proposals that are being made have to be proposals people can live with.  I am meeting people every day who say they do not know if it is a good deal.  They need to have the ability to go to a fully-formed independent body that can give them the expert legal advice that puts them on the same level playing field as the financial institution they are dealing with.  While we, of course, have expert groups like MABS and so forth, I do not accept we have in place a fully-fledged expert resource for people who find themselves in these situations.  I ask that this be considered.</p></speech>

That is a phrase that should be struck from political and economic language in this country.  I heard Sinn F&eacute;in also brought this up in the past couple of months as it favoured a case-by-case approach.  What it means in practice is a person going in before the bank official and talking about his or her case on a case-by-case basis and being hard done by, instead of having a generalist approach that applies to everybody, which the person can slot into based on his or her own particular circumstances.  People would then know exactly what is going on.</p></speech>

It is about time the Government took this issue seriously because it has not dealt with it at all.</p><p>While Senator Hayden&rsquo;s comments were very well thought out and based on her experience, I was disappointed to hear her look forward to the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill 2013.  In my view, that Bill is an abomination and it is an abomination that the Labour Party would be introducing legislation to reintroduce repossessions into this country when nothing has been done in regard to unemployment or to protect the family home.  That legislation is shocking in its brevity and cruelty.  Repossessions will start as soon as that legislation comes into place and there is nothing for the family homeowner, for families or, indeed, for the buy-to-let sector, about which Senator Hayden made points with which I agree.</p><p>That legislation must be opposed and shot down. The Labour Party must look at what it is bringing in.  What is happening in that legislation is that the Government wants to revert to how the law stood before the Dunne judgment.  However, it does not seem to be aware of the fact the conveyancing textbooks are critical of the law that applied before the Dunne judgment in that there is no discretion in court as to whether or not to grant a repossession or what options should be offered to people.  The only discretion in that Bill is the discretion to go through the personal insolvency legislation.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, was in this House in July 2011 when I and Senator MacSharry brought forward the Family Home Bill, which was intended to give judges options and discretion in repossession cases.  That Family Home Bill 2011 was designed to address a defect in the law that existed at that time, before the Dunne judgment, which the Government now proposes to go back to.  It is madness.  Nothing is being done for the family homeowner and families in arrears.</p><p>The mortgage-to-rent scheme is a total sham.  I believe 13 cases have happened throughout the country or are in progress.  A Louth county councillor whom I spoke to yesterday raised the issue of how many cases were in process in Louth and was told there was one but nothing has happened in regard to it.  This is a sham and it is about time we stopped talking about it.  People have come to my clinics in recent weeks wondering how they get onto this mortgage-to-rent scheme.  The truth is, and Senator Hayden alluded to this in some sense, that one cannot get onto the mortgage-to-rent scheme.  It is not possible to do so because, even if the banks want to do it, the local authorities do not want to do it, or, if the local authorities want to do it, the banks do not want to do it.  The borrower, or the person in the family home facing repossession, cannot do anything about it and does not have any choice in the matter, but they are given this hope that turns out to a sham - this hope that turns to despair.</p><p>I have a serious difficulty with the row-back on the code of conduct for the financial institutions in regard to mortgage arrears.  The fact is this is the only protection from the banks available to borrowers in arrears.  Despite the amendment's criticism of the previous Government, that code of conduct dates back to the previous Government.  In point of fact, apart from the Personal Insolvency Act, which is not even in force yet, that is the only protection for people in arrears and nothing whatsoever has happened under this Government.  That is a matter of recorded fact.  What the Government is proposing to do is to row back on that and to give the banks more powers.  That is wrong.</p><p>Why does the code of conduct only apply to regulated banks while the much heralded Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill 2013 that is being brought in will apply to any bank, financial institution or local authority which holds a mortgage?  They will all be given the power to repossess a property, absolutely full square under statute of this Oireachtas, but the only protections that apply for anybody else only apply in terms of the Central Bank supervisory function for the banks the Central Bank supervises.  There is no legal protection in this country if the person is with a bank that is not regulated by the Central Bank.  Moreover, if the person is with a bank that is regulated by the Central Bank, his or her only recourse is to complain to the Central Bank because the person has no course of action in a court against the bank, and no test case can be brought by a voluntary organisation like Threshold or FLAC because there is no protection under statute.</p><p>We have put forward protections and put forward many pieces of legislation, the latest being the Mortgage Resolution Bill.  We had put forward the Family Home Bill in the Seanad which was designed to give the courts the power to protect families and to provide options, but the Government rejected this and told us it would be all sorted out in six months.  Nothing has happened.  It is about time the penny dropped with the Members opposite, who must realise that nothing has happened and tell the Government this.  We need to do something about this because it is a major drag on the economy, people cannot afford to spend money because of their mortgage situation and the banks are still in a state of limbo, despite the fact they have been given billions or euro to deal with the issue.  However, the Government seems quite happy to let the banks do what they want, whether it is in regard to interest rate reductions, branch closures or dealing with people on a case-by-case basis, which is the Government's preference.</p><p>I ask the Government, if it is bringing in the repossession law to give all of the financial institutions, including banks and other lenders, that power, to please bring in a law to protect people and not just a Central Bank code of conduct.  I am pleading with the Government to finally understand the scale of this problem because, in my view, the Government does not understand it.</p></speech>

Much of this has already been dealt with by the Government and, while I do not necessarily agree with the idea of having a motion on the topic, it does allow us to discuss the matter.  We all acknowledge there is a way to go on this issue and that it is very much an area in flux.</p><p>On mortgage arrears, the Government policy has four strands, namely, the resolution strategy, the Personal Insolvency Act, advice services and the mortgage-to-rent scheme.  In reference to the first point, it is worth noting that the rate at which mortgages are falling into arrears by more than 90 days and the number of early arrears cases under 90 days have both reduced, although I accept this is only a small sign of positivity in a very negative space.  There is no question the numbers are stark and there is no taking from everything that has been said about it already in the House.  Some 94,500 are in mortgage arrears for more than 90 days, with over 23,000 in arrears of more than 720 days.  The gravity of the situation is certainly acknowledged by all sides of the debate.</p><p>I have concerns with regard to the banks and would echo some of the concerns expressed on both sides of the House when it comes to how the banks are actually handling people who are in arrears.  People spoke of advice and expertise.  It strikes me that not only is the advice at the level required by borrowers not available but, while the banks might be coming up to speed with their internal expertise, it simply has not been available in the recent past.  There is an onus on the banks to improve their own situation in this regard.</p> <p>We must do more than hope if there are no signs of some improvement on this front.  We must hope there will be a vast improvement in this area.  I agree with Senator Hayden's point when it comes to resources and expertise.  The case-by-case basis is very unsatisfactory.  The fact that banks can keep the decision makers away from the person dealing with the individual client is very frustrating for people in mortgage arrears.  They are listening to somebody who has no say in the matter tell them that they will talk to a particular head office and various people in the bank who have no face as far as the borrower is concerned.  </p><p>The Central Bank recently published a series of measurable, timed goals for the six main banks which will ensure specific, measured progress towards the objective of increasing engagement with borrowers in arrears.  I welcome the targets outlined and the fact that targets exist.  The target that by the end of June 2013, banks should have proposed sustainable mortgage solutions for 20% of distressed borrowers is a tangible target that we must welcome.  We must ensure these targets are met by the banks.  It is important that we work to ensure that there is a framework within which banks must work.  Citizens going bankrupt is not a useful solution for banks, the country or citizens.  From the Central Bank's perspective, the main point is to ensure that banks are actively in dialogue with their customers who are in trouble and to come to an acceptable solution.  </p><p>It is with that same rationale in mind that the Government put together the Personal Insolvency Act.  While some may criticise it and it has been criticised here today, it will be legislation over the banks' ability to veto any proposed solution.  Ultimately, the banks are incentivised to properly engage in the process because the Act makes bankruptcy a feasible alternative by reducing the period of bankruptcy from 12 years to three.  If the banks do not make an agreement under the Act, a mortgage holder could end up in bankruptcy, which would worsen the financial position of the bank overall.  </p><p>The third strand of the Government's mortgage arrears policy is advice.  I agree that more needs to be done in this area.  I have already alluded to this but distressed mortgage holders offered long-term restructuring by their lenders can avail of free independent financial advice.  I am hearing in dispatches and from people with whom I have spoken that the quality of this advice is not of the level that it should be.  The Government acknowledges the great difficulty that mortgage arrears pose for families across the country.  This situation is in flux and the Government is introducing targets and various measures.  I hope the Government will not take any nonsense from the banks when it comes to the targets that have been implemented.  We have taken enough nonsense from the banks.  &quot;Targets&quot; is my favourite word this evening but I hope that while the expertise was not in banks and there was not as much of a structure as has been introduced now, we will not take any further nonsense from the banks when it comes to mortgage arrears.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-04-17a.312" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1133" speakername="David Cullinane" time="19:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013041700039#RR00200"><p>I do not get my information from the dispatches.  I get it from ordinary families who arrive in my constituency office every week in ever-growing numbers.  These are people who cannot afford to pay their mortgages and are in mortgage distress.  It is very clear to those families that this Government does not fully understand the depth of the mortgage distress crisis in this State.  The numbers speak for themselves.  A total of 180,000 families are in mortgage distress.  This is twice the amount in mortgage distress since this Government came into office.  Of this figure of 180,000, 140,000 cannot pay their mortgage now or in the future.  We know that 1,000 families fall into mortgage distress every month.  Many of them cannot pay their mortgages for long periods of time.</p><p>Going hand in hand with that is the lack of any cohesive intervention, measures or policies from this Government to support people in mortgage distress.  This is despite the fact that the taxpayers of this country put billions of euro into the banks, particularly the pillar banks.  Over &euro;90 billion of taxpayers' money in some form has been put into the banks - &euro;30 billion for write-down on the NAMA loans, &euro;30 billion to recapitalise the banks and &euro;30 billion in respect of the Anglo promissory note.  Of the &euro;30 billion that was put into the pillar banks, the Government put &euro;18 billion into those banks.  A total of &euro;10 billion of the overall money that was put into pillar banks was to be used to offset losses in the domestic mortgage sector.  As the Minister knows, rigorous stress testing was carried out and the banks came back and told the Government how much money they needed to have strong capital ratios and to be able to deal with the losses in both the commercial and domestic markets.  A total of &euro;10 billion was provided for to deal with losses in the domestic mortgage situation. </p><p>However, the banks are doing nothing to help people in mortgage distress.  This Government is doing next to nothing either.  It is allowing the banks to have a veto and full control.  Every week, I and I am sure other Senators get copies of correspondence from banks saying that they will not engage with mortgage-to-rent arrangements, split mortgages or any of the so-called interventions that are there.  I can provide the Minister with any number of letters from banks which advise people to sell.  That is what the banks are saying.  They are telling people to sell their houses and pay back the balance.  The Government does not seem to realise that there will be some level of write-down.  It is inevitable because if the banks force people to sell or repossess those homes, and we are talking about family homes, the banks must sell those properties at a reduced price, probably a fire sale.  If this happens the banks will only get a fraction of what they are worth, will not get all their money, will land those families in debt and leave them without a house, and will still have taken a loss.  There needs to be an imaginative response.</p><p>We have proposed an independent mortgage resolution body.  We want to see a fair solution and a mortgage restructuring panel set up independently to look at each mortgage situation on a case-by-case basis.  To respond to criticisms of our position that it should be done on a case-by-case basis, every case is different.  Everyone's family and income circumstances are different.  The size and location of people's homes and the opportunities they may have in the future differ.  We want to allow the independent body to impose a fair solution that would look at the suite of interventions that are there, be they split mortgages or mortgage-to-rent.  It may involve some level of write-down but the panel could look at what is the best fix for everybody - the taxpayer and the family - and impose that solution rather than allowing the banks to have the veto they have at the moment.  That is all we are trying to achieve.</p><p>It is quite obvious that if the Minister and Government do not act, the situation will get worse.  Aside from the impact that will have on all those families in mortgage distress, the simple reality is that as long as families are trying to pay a mortgage they simply cannot pay and their debt is unsustainable, people will not have money to spend in the domestic economy.  If the vast majority of families are servicing debt, they do not have money to spend and it exacerbates the problem we have in our domestic economy.  The Minister needs to act, put an independent body in place and impose fair solutions.  Keeping the family home must be at the heart of that.  </p> <p>There must be some level of write down, but it is crucial to remove the veto from the banks and enable an independent body to impose fair solutions to ensure people remain in the family home.</p></speech>

If one strips away the rhetoric of concern, the Sinn F&eacute;in contribution is pure political point scoring and does not merit another mention.</p><p>What is a sustainable mortgage?  It has been said that a sustainable mortgage is one that requires no more than 35% of income to service it, but even FLAC and New Beginnings have pointed out that this may not be applicable in every case.  People with higher incomes may be able to afford to service a mortgage with 35% of their income, but people with lower incomes or no income at all will not be able to do that.  That points to the complexity of the issue we are grappling with and trying to sort out.  I am depressed about the willingness of the banks to see this problem in all aspects of its complexity.  I think the banks have been mean-spirited and very narrow in their interpretation.  We have seen this at our clinics.  The Sinn F&eacute;in Party does not have a monopoly, but all parties see distressed people at their clinics.  Yesterday, on one of the more popular RTE radio shows, a caller rang in to say that one of the banks, which was not named, had insisted on the couple selling their house because the price would cover the loan.  They sold their house and paid back the loan but the bank then charged them &euro;12,000 for early settlement of the mortgage.  That points to mean-spiritedness and we need to take cognisance of it.</p><p>There are four elements to our approach in attempting to resolve debt, but I wish to dwell on one element.  The guidelines for the personal insolvency legislation were leaked in reports in the public domain.  I do not know whose interest is being served by giving such detailed information about the proposed guidelines because we know they have not been discussed by Cabinet yet.  By publishing these type of guidelines stating exactly the level of income lenders will allow people to have and what lifestyle that will allow people seems to suggest that the banks are in a position to state the guidelines have been leaked from the Government and this is what the Government is prepared to tolerate.  I think we need to go back and state clearly that this Government will not tolerate the meanness, narrow-minded and mean-spirited interpretation of some of these rules that will allow the banks to take half of people's income over &euro;250 per week.  What incentive will anybody have to do something for themselves if that is the case?  We need to take this back to Government.  I spoke about this issue at our parliamentary party meeting this morning.  I think it is absolutely shocking that such information is being leaked.  Whose interests are being served by leaking this information?  These leaks are not in the interests of the people of Ireland. </p><p>One would think intuitively that those in the age cohort of 30 to 40 years would be most affected by the mortgage crisis.  However, I read a report recently that shows that the age group who are mostly affected are those aged between 30 years and 50 years.  This age group are conventionally considered to be the most productive.  I am not going to ignore the personal plight of people who are in debt, but from the societal point of view, those in the 30 to 50 years age cohort are most productive and consequently the highest spenders in any economy.  These people are now over burdened by household and personal debt.  </p><p>We are making a good start but we need to get on with this work.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Joe Costello.  In the greater Dublin area, which the Minister knows well, a house that cost the equivalent of &euro;100,000 in 1997 rose to &euro;500,000 and nobody's income kept up with that bubble in property prices.  We are now trying to address this now.</p><p>The leaking of the guidelines was designed to annoy people.  We need to get the legislation up and running as quickly as we can.  It might be that somebody might watch Sky Sports and do nothing else.  He is doing much better than the banks, as he is living within his budget and to say that he cannot watch Sky Sports is absurd.  Senator Bacik has made a very good point on child care.  The leaked guidelines would require a woman working outside the home and earning less than the cost of child care to give up her career and pension prospects and as Senator Bacik pointed out that child care might last for two or three years.  If that is in the guidelines, I hope the Minister will get to work on them.</p><p>I acknowledge that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter moved and accepted many amendments and was in the Seanad until 10 p.m. on occasion.  Credit is due to him, but we need more action now.  The MABS report is quite shocking and shows that many of the people in debt were older than we had thought because they had bought products from equity release, as they were encouraged to borrow more.  It would have been expected, and MABS referred to this, they would have paid off the mortgage.  There must be a general warning to beware of banks bearing false gifts.  We need to reform the banking system significantly.  I do not think it has changed at all in recent times.  I recall banks boards comprising people such as James Minahan, Patrick Lynch, Louden Ryan who were eminent people in Irish economics and the banks moved away from choosing such people in their era of madness.</p><p>No. 25 on the Order Paper is Mortgage Credit (Loans and Bonds) Bill 2012.  I mentioned to the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Hayes that the banking crisis did not happen in Denmark.  The Danish people would want to route the money through the existing banks, which are the banks that got us into trouble in the first instance.  If Danske Bank would set up a different way of financing housing that would be useful.  The destruction of the building society movement is very capably covered in the book about Michael Fingleton.  The Educational Building Society was meant to be a co-operative and its principle was almost philanthropic, that is teachers with houses would give money to younger teachers to buy houses.</p> <p>The corruption of the system into the worst form of banking is an episode which must not be allowed to be repeated.</p></speech>

The landlord can sell on the property to someone else, but the tenants should be allowed to stay and pay rent to the new landlord.  Let the landlord take the capital loss.  That is happening in the case of hotels up and down the country, some in County Kerry and others in County Mayo.  Hotels have dropped in value, from &euro;40 million down to &euro;10 million and &euro;3 million.  The people living in these houses must be protected, a point on which I completely support Senator Aideen Hayden.  We need further action by the banks and the public interest directors.  The finance committee was not able to find out what they were supposed to be doing.</p><p>I am delighted to share time with Senator David Norris.</p></speech>

As Sky Sports is owned by Rupert Murdoch, how could anyone have it in the house?  </p><p>I was not in the House to hear the discussion, as I was attending the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Therefore, if the point I want to make has been raised, I apologise.</p><p>When I was listening to the radio the other day, I heard a man who had a mortgage of &euro;110,000 speak.  He had negotiated with the bank which to give him time had agreed to an interest-only arrangement for six months.  However, it had not told him that he would be charged a penalty of &euro;11,000.  That is appalling and fraud.  The banks are still swindling the people and it must stop.  I ask the Minister of State to force the banks to stop it, as they are crucifying people, which is outrageous.  How many mortgages were sold on to hedge funds, these other capitalist cannibals?  These are appalling instances.</p><p>The code gives very limited protection and the proposed changes will make it even more difficult for mortgage holders to be considered as co-operating.  Who is in charge of all this stuff?  Who will act as judge and jury?  &ldquo;'I'll be judge, I'll be jury,' said cunning old Fury: 'I'll try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.'&rdquo;  It will be the bloody banks once more; they are in charge of this whole process.  Therefore, it is neither equal nor fair, nor independent.</p><p>I refer to the business of the banks having the restrictions on making unsolicited telephone calls lifted from them.  When one is in financial distress, this is one of the worst things to happen for one's mental health.  I have spoken about this issue for many years.  As they are driving people to take their own lives, this practice should be stamped out at once.  Making unsolicited telephone calls should be made a criminal offence.  I should not need to say this to the Government because, tragically, in my lifetime a Minister, under pressure, took his own life.  I am not saying it was the same pressure, but it just shows what pressure can do to people in the most responsible of positions.  What about the vulnerable or half-educated person?  I find it shocking.</p><p>People should not have to give up their tracker mortgages as part of the deal.  There should be an independent body and an independent appeals body because the definition of what is fair and reasonable should not be left to the banks.  What the hell do they know?  They traded recklessly for years.  They traded disgracefully and most certainly were not fair and reasonable.  Things are still coming to light about the way they dishonestly and fraudulently took money out of people's bank accounts in terms of foreign exchange transactions and God knows what else.  Is the Minister of State satisfied that they should have in their control the definition of what is fair and reasonable?</p><p>There is far too much control vested in the banks.  The wonderful people involved in the anti-eviction group stood in solidarity with the cancer victim of a certain age who had been living in her house for 60 years in an area in the north inner city that the Minister of State knows, near the place of which we both have such happy memories.  The sheriff was called to put her out.  However, her neighbours and those involved in the anti-eviction group stood in solidarity with her.  I was ashamed to be Irish on that day.</p><p>There should be an independent group comprising people from the voluntary sector - people who have done wonderful work - MABS and FLAC, insolvency practitioners and mortgage holders.  These individuals should be involved because they are the ones who know what the problems are, who know it is not just a horrible thing on a bank balance sheet.  </p><p>I spoke this morning about the financial situation.  I said the people were the victims of an international financial swindle.  I ask the Minister of State if he would be kind enough to pass on my remarks because he, even more than me, is a good friend of President Higgins.  Thank God for him.  What he said to the European Parliament today about human morals was brilliant and marvellous.  I heard the synopsis.  He spoke about human values, not swindling techniques and the idea that imposing rigid financial tiers on a subservient people-----</p></speech>

I have just returned from Cyprus and what is happening there is a thundering disgrace.  The people concerned came here and told us that we could not and must not burn the senior bondholders because it was a matter of principle, legality and morality.  They then went to Cyprus and forced the Cypriots to do so.  They are picking us off, one at a time.  We are little experiments for them.  They should be told to go to Hell.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-04-17a.331" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1150" speakername="Colm Burke" time="19:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013041700041#TT00800"><p>I welcome the Minister of State.  We need to deal with other issues as well as that of mortgage arrears.  For the past two years the Government has been working to encourage job creation, as jobs generate income and borrowings can be serviced.  The Government has made significant progress in the past six months on the issue of financial stability, which will assist many families in dealing with the difficulties they face.  Once there is financial stability, it will be possible to move forward on the issue of job creation for unemployed mortgage holders.  Much has been done in this regard in the past two years.  The third element is how to deal with the issue of mortgage arrears.  A large number of mortgage holders are in arrears and in many cases it will be very difficult for them to service their loans.  The Government introduced the personal insolvency legislation which will work to give people an avenue to deal with their mortgage difficulties.</p><p>It is interesting to reflect on the progress made by the country.  As a practising solicitor, I remember the case of a man with four young children who wished to buy a three bedroom semi-detached house, on which the deposit was &pound;100 which he did not have.  I was able to send him to a bank to borrow the &pound;100 in order that he could pay it and buy the house.  What happened to the property market then given that the most expensive item anyone will buy is a house?  We allowed the speculators and the developers to make huge profits without any restriction.  </p><p>In 2002 Peter Bacon gave us plenty of warning.  In 1997 property in Hong Kong had decreased in value by 70%.  We were doing exactly the same in Ireland, but we did not heed the consequences in Hong Kong.  When house prices are allowed to rise, the cost of a mortgage also rises.  When mortgage costs increase, wages must also increase.  When wage costs increased, the country became uncompetitive.  All of this happened, not during the lifetime of the Government but during previous the 14 years under other Governments.  This should not be forgotten when solutions are being proposed.</p><p>I agree that the banks made very significant mistakes.  I refer to an example in which people were forced to sign documents and they did not know what they were signing.  A gentleman who came to my office understood he was signing a guarantee on a &euro;40,000 top-up loan for his daughter</p> <p>She had already borrowed &euro;220,000.  I asked him if he was sure he only signed a guarantee for &euro;40,000 and he said he was absolutely definite about it.  I pulled a copy of the title to his daughter's houses from the Land Registry folio to find he had signed a mortgage for &euro;260,000 on a house now worth &euro;140,000.  </p><p>We need to examine many things which happened over the past number of year to ensure they never happen again.  We must deal with people who are in financial difficulty and we need to be innovative in how we do so.  Going back to the 1980s, there was a huge slump in the property market and we introduced particular grants to allow people surrender local authorities houses so they could buy their own houses but we now need to be far more innovative in dealing with this issue.  </p><p>The personal insolvency legislation has been enacted but we need to look at new ideas.  In Germany, the developer builds the house but does not furnish it.  The person who buys it rents it out for 20 years and the person who occupies it must pay the cost of furnishing it but he or she has a guarantee of being able to live in it for 20 years.  We need to look at new ideas in regard to how we provide housing in that it is not just in two distinct ways, namely, owning a home and having a mortgage or living in a local authority house.  We need to look at that third idea rather than having the short term 12 month or two year letting agreement.  We need to do something more than what we are doing already.  It has worked very well throughout Europe over the past half a century.  We need to look at that system so we can keep rents down and get better value for our money in terms of how those properties are managed.  We need to move forward in that area and not just look at this area alone.  There are many other areas at which we need to look and we need to be very innovative in how we do so.  </p><p>This debate is welcome.  It is important we do everything possible to support people who want to stay in their own homes but who are in financial difficulty.  We must do everything possible to ensure the maximum number of people and families can do so.  That is the constructive way this Government is approaching it.</p></speech>

Is ceist f&iacute;or th&aacute;bhachtach &iacute; seo do phobal na t&iacute;re, go h&aacute;irithe do na daoine a bhfuil morg&aacute;ist&iacute; acu agus iad anois i droch &aacute;it de bhr&iacute; nach bhfuil siad in ann na bill&iacute; at&aacute; orthu a &iacute;oc.  I was looking at a couple of figures when Senator Colm Burke was speaking and at the time of the last general election, approximately 6% of all household mortgages were in arrears of 90 days or more.  Today 12% of all household mortgages are in arrears of 90 days or more which is a 100% increase in arrears.  What has been done since?  Promises made before the election seem to have dissipated since then.  Nothing has been done to force the banks to write-down some of the debts.  Some of the banks are actually restructuring because it makes economic sense for them to do so.  However, there has been a lack of decisive measures taken by the Government to deal with this issue.</p><p>  Just over 90,000 people are in mortgage arrears - people who are struggling and to whom Senator Norris, among other Senators, referred.  These people are suicidal.  There was a debate on the national airwaves last week in which Mr. Ben Dunne, someone with whom I have not always agreed, spoke passionately and on behalf of the people.  Some banks are putting pressure on people.  I spoke to someone at a clinic last evening who the banks were telephoning at 8.30 p.m. and 9 p.m.  It is time the Government brought in guidelines so that banks must act responsibly and must assist rather than frighten customers.  Some people are on the brink of suicide as a result of this issue.  </p><p>  I am not trying to play any political games because we are all in this together, whether in opposition or not.  The fact is that it is two years since the last general election and there has been a 100% increase mortgage arrears.  They have not been dealt with.  Senator Colm Burke was right that the mortgage arrears issue is linked to the economy.  Let us look at the economy and at what was inherited.  Davy Stockbrokers outlined that in the last quarter of 2012, 50% of Irish mortgages were in negative equity while many owner occupier loans were in arrears of 90 days or more.  It outlined in that report that negative equity was not the driving factor in regard to mortgage arrears and that the key factor was labour market developments, in particular unemployment and long-term unemployment.  </p><p>  The unemployment crisis has not been addressed.  A promise was made before the last general election that 100,000 jobs would be created by 2015 but we are losing approximately 1,000 jobs per week.  The economy is broken down into three areas, namely, foreign direct investment, the agrifood sector and the domestic economy.  Let no one make a charge that when in government, Fianna F&aacute;il did not establish the foreign direct investment economy.  Who developed Food Harvest 2020, a template document which is driving the economic resurgence in the agrifood sector?  It certainly was not the current Government.  It inherited and supported it but it did not produce it.  In fact, the Minister for Agriculture in the North is going to use it as a template to develop the agrifood sector there.  The third area that is causing all the problems in regard to mortgage arrears is the domestic economy, which is dead.  People are not spending; they are trying to pay their bills.  There is no money moving in the domestic economy.  If one speaks to any retailers, small or large, they will say that.  It is only the Government that can boost or bolster the domestic economy but it has not done so.  That is why we have the difficulty of job losses, in particular in the retail sector, and of mortgage arrears.  The domestic element of the economy is not being dealt with.  </p><p>  I refer to the proposals in the insolvency legislation.  We heard about the fracas in the Judiciary over the past 24 or 48 hours.  One of the reasons it is showing a lack of confidence in the current Government is the manner in which proposals are being brought forward under the insolvency legislation, which has been agreed by the banks.  The Government sat down with the banks before talking to the national Parliament about this legislation.  The judges have been side-tracked in this process while others, including county registrars, have been included and part of their salaries will be paid by the banks so that the desired outcome - that is, home repossessions - is achieved.  That is exactly what is happening.  The Government is facilitating the banks by ensuring the people making the decisions are on the side of the banks.  It is absolutely disgraceful.</p></speech>

I did not hear the early part of the debate as I arrived when Senator Thomas Byrne was speaking.</p><p>I am speaking on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, who is unable to attend this evening.  I have listened to many constructive proposals, which are welcome.  Senator Byrne's comments can only be categorised as a rant, because he said nothing constructive.  He ranted and attacked the Government in the strongest language possible.  The Government inherited a problem which was created by its predecessor, which the Senator was part of as a Deputy.  The problem was created largely by the property bubble.  While the construction sector was out of control there was still fuel being thrown on the fire, with further tax incentives of up to 100% being offered.  By the time the market reached its crescendo in 2006 we were building more than 90,000 houses or units of accommodation here while less than 100,000 were being built in England.  A country with a population of 65 million built roughly the same number of units of accommodation as a country with a population of 4.5 million.  What did the Taoiseach of the day say when he was criticised for it?  He said that those who criticised him about construction policy should go away and commit suicide.  Clearly, Fianna F&aacute;il should recognise that inheritance and apologise to the people for what happened.</p><p>This Government, in stark contrast with its predecessor, has made considerable progress across a number of sectors in addressing the significant and severe mortgage arrears crisis that it inherited.  The crisis is directly linked to the economic situation presided over by members of the previous Government.  There was a failure on the part of the previous Government, though it was in office for a considerable period, to propose or introduce relevant insolvency or bankruptcy reform legislation.</p><p>Each motion on financial and economic matters that Fianna F&aacute;il brings before the House or the D&aacute;il appears to be informed by the same amnesia.  There is little or no recollection of its failed policies that resulted in an economic, fiscal and banking collapse.  Thousands of people have lost their jobs, living standards were substantially reduced for families and, ultimately, the country lost its economic sovereignty.  That was a result of the actions and inaction of the previous Government.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-04-17a.348" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="19:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013041700043#VV00900"><p>The Government has two overall key strategic objectives in this area.  First, there is a need to ensure that mortgage holders who are experiencing real difficulty should, where appropriate, be assisted in remaining in their homes.  Second, any framework and range of supports for mortgage holders must be able to distinguish between those who cannot afford to pay their mortgages on their primary homes and those who choose not to pay.  The principle of a fresh start for people facing genuine difficulty in dealing with their mortgage commitments is a key priority.</p><p>  The Government, on assuming office in 2011, established the interdepartmental mortgage arrears working group, which issued the Keane report.  That was one of the first acts done by the Government.  The action had not been taken by the previous Government, but it should have been.  The Government is now implementing the key recommendations of the report, which was published in October 2011.  Based on its recommendations, the Government established the mortgage arrears steering group to co-ordinate the responses of the Departments and agencies that are centrally involved.  Since March 2012, the steering group has reported to the Cabinet committee on mortgage arrears.</p><p>  In contrast with the inactivity of our predecessors, let us consider some of the important initiatives that have been taken by the Government.  For example, the mortgage-to-rent scheme, available since June 2012, is a mainstream social housing solution for the most acute cases of mortgage arrears.  Lenders are now engaging with the process and substantial progress has been made.  More than 800 cases have been put forward for the scheme.  Development of a mortgage-to-lease scheme is also progressing.  Under the scheme, the lender would become the long-term owner of the property after voluntary repossession has taken place.  The household would become a social housing tenant of the relevant local authority and the local authority would, in turn, lease the property from the financial institution for the period of the lease.  An information and advice service has also been established to help people in mortgage arrears through the website <i>keepingyourhome.ie</i>, an information helpline and the availability of independent financial advice for people being offered long-term restructuring proposals by the banks.</p><p>  The most significant development in addressing the area of personal over-indebtedness, including mortgage arrears, has been the development and enactment of our new personal insolvency legislation.  The Personal Insolvency Bill was published in June 2012, passed by both Houses in December and signed into law in December.  The development of modern insolvency law was a key commitment in the programme for Government.  It was also required under the EU-IMF-ECB programme of financial support for Ireland.  It was inspired by the Law Reform Commission's significant contribution in its 2010 report on personal debt management and debt enforcement and by the recommendations of the Keane report.</p><p>  The Personal Insolvency Act 2012 provides for three new debt resolution processes which, though requiring approval by the court, are essentially non-judicial in nature.  The debt relief notice, DRN, will allow for the write-off of qualifying debt up to &#8364;20,000, subject to a three-year supervision period; the debt settlement arrangement, DSA, provides for the agreed settlement of unsecured debt, with no limit involved, normally over five years; and the personal insolvency arrangement, PIA, will enable the agreed settlement of secured debt of up to &#8364;3 million - although the cap may be increased with the consent of all secured creditors - and unsecured debt without limit, normally over six years.  The Act also provides for automatic discharge from bankruptcy after three years, subject to certain conditions.</p><p>  The Act introduces new insolvency resolution concepts to Irish law.  The new PIA is a process that is unique in insolvency law anywhere in providing for the negotiated resolution of secured debt in a court-sanctioned process that provides certainty for creditors and, if I may say so, hope and relief for debtors.  The personal examinership approach in the PIA is designed to be sufficiently flexible and robust to address complex personal insolvency cases which may include combinations of trade, consumer and mortgage debt.  It offers a second chance mechanism for talented and capable individuals and entrepreneurs not only to return to solvency but to make a contribution to the economic development of our society.</p><p>  To protect the constitutional rights of all concerned and to prevent potential actions for judicial review, the Act makes provision for enhanced oversight by the court of the three new debt resolution procedures.  The enhancement of court involvement gives a significant benefit to the debtor by providing protection from enforcement actions by creditors, either during the negotiation period or during the lifetime of the arrangement.  In order to deal with this anticipated volume of work and to facilitate the speedy consideration of insolvency applications, a new cadre of specialist judges of the Circuit Court is being recruited.</p><p>  The Insolvency Service of Ireland was established on 1 March 2013 by ministerial order.  It will be formally launched tomorrow and will commence its information campaign, which will include its website, the issuing of publications designed to assist those interested in the new debt resolution processes and the opening of a public information line.  The announcement of the regulatory framework for personal insolvency practitioners will follow shortly.  The director of the Insolvency Service of Ireland, Mr. Lorcan O'Connor, is working with all speed to complete the administrative and technical preparations to ensure that the full operation of the provisions of the Personal Insolvency Act can begin as soon as possible.</p> <p>The Personal Insolvency Act makes provision for the Insolvency Service to draw up guidelines on reasonable living expenses which will apply in respect of a debtor in one of the new insolvency processes.  In developing these guidelines the Act requires the Insolvency Service to have regard to a number of criteria.  The Insolvency Service has engaged in extensive consultation with relevant Departments, agencies and organisations and the guidelines should be ready for publication very soon.</p><p>It may be expected that a significant number of persons are likely to avail of the new or reformed insolvency processes.  For broad planning purposes, the tentative estimate for the number of applications in the first full year of operation of both the law and the Insolvency Service is approximately 15,000 for the debt settlement arrangement and personal insolvency arrangement; 3,000 to 4,000 for debt relief notices and 3,000 for bankruptcy petitions.  The critical message which I reiterate to all those experiencing debt problems is to engage with lenders and other creditors to negotiate an appropriate settlement.  That requires lenders to engage properly with customers.  Now that the architecture of the new insolvency legislation is settled, financial institutions must improve engagement with debtors.</p><p>Mortgage lenders have the primary responsibility to deal with customers experiencing difficulties with their mortgage repayments.  These institutions extended credit in the first instance, often without much in the way of expected oversight or due diligence.  Urgent action is required by banks to address the problems their customers in genuine difficulty are experiencing.  However, each case of mortgage arrears is different and will have to be looked at on its merits.  If financial institutions refuse to engage constructively and realistically, the Government has made it very clear that it will take any necessary measure to refine its approach to ensure the new debt resolution processes work.  This commitment has been made by the Minister on more than one occasion.  While banks must have regard to commercial considerations, they must also behave with greater flexibility and insight and apply a broader range of common-sense options based on financial reality.</p><p>The new debt settlement and personal insolvency arrangements are designed to facilitate a workable, sustainable, voluntary resolution between a debtor and his or her creditors.  A common-sense rather than a coercive approach is taken, as can be seen in the creditor voting process provided for in the Act.  It is an approach designed to avoid, in so far as possible within constitutional constraints, the necessity for contentious court hearings and adjudications, together with the substantial delay and inevitable legal costs inherent in such process.  The Government has very much engaged with the financial institutions in the lead-in to the enactment of the legislation.  They understand exactly what our concerns are and what they should do in operating the legislation constructively and sensibly.  Justifiable concerns have been raised by Senators and others about the balance of power between banks and debtors.  There is talk of what has been commonly referred to as a &quot;bank veto&quot;.  In reality, it is in the best interests of both debtors and creditors to seek to conclude an acceptable and workable arrangement under the Act.</p><p>The Central Bank has had ongoing and detailed engagement with lenders on the issue of mortgage arrears and explored possible options for cases where more than a temporary forbearance response would be required.  These are well known at this stage and include split mortgages, trade-down mortgages and sale-by-agreement options which would allow families to move to homes more suited to their current needs, including employment and appropriate accommodation needs.  There will also be cases in which debt forgiveness is not only a practical solution but will also, in the medium to long term, benefit both debtors and creditors.  The write-off of a portion of the capital debt outstanding on a family home is a further option.  Where appropriate, the mortgage-to-rent scheme will also be available for consideration.  </p><p>The Central Bank is satisfied that the tools are in place to accelerate the work-out of the mortgage crisis.  Banks and borrowers must use these tools to reach fair and sustainable solutions to mortgage arrears on a case by case basis.  Of course, progress by the banks in providing durable solutions has not been sufficient.  Thus, the Central Bank has set targets for the conclusion of sustainable agreements and the durability of such solutions and will audit each bank's performance against the targets and, where necessary, apply sanctions.  It has also commenced a review of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears to ensure it can facilitate better engagement between borrowers and lenders on a mortgage problem, while maintaining important protections for those borrowers who do engage with their lender.  A consultation process on the review of the code ended on 12 April and the bank is reviewing the submissions received.  I understand the aim of the bank is to publish the revised code of conduct in the first half of this year.</p><p>In addressing the mortgage arrears problem we cannot ignore the fact that the issue of repossession must be addressed in some cases.  Ireland, for a number of reasons, has had a very low level of repossessions.  The vast majority of repossessions occur on a voluntary basis.  Nobody can be unaware of the issues that arise where repossession proceedings relate to family homes.  It is an emotive and sensitive topic.  The Minister for Justice and Equality has recently published the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill 2013 which is designed to address issues arising from case law in various repossession proceedings which have created uncertainty relating to the exercise by lending institutions of their repossession rights.  The consequences of the case law were unintended at the time of enactment of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill 2009 and the purpose of the Bill mentioned is to restore the intended position.  The new legislation fulfils a commitment to remedy these issues in the context of the third quarter of 2012 review of the EU-IMF programme of financial support for Ireland.  The Bill is designed to restore the law which has been in place over the centuries to enable lending institutions to rely on security in relation to a mortgage, as intended by the Oireachtas when enacting the 2009 Bill.  The Bill mentioned also provides for the adjournment of actions for repossession in certain cases relating to the principal private residence of the borrower where it is the opinion of the court that the matter could be resolved by recourse to the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 and aims to examine whether a personal insolvency arrangement would be a more appropriate course of action.  It is an important new caveat and protection.  Where the court is of such an opinion, it may adjourn a hearing for no more than two months.  The Minister is seeking to provide, by way of this provision, a transparent, final, time-limited safety net for a home owner where repossession is being pursued without the possibility of a personal insolvency arrangement having been fully explored by the parties.</p><p>It may be the case that, as a last resort, the best interests of the borrower may be served by repossession. This could arise, for example, if there were substantial arrears and no prospect that the borrower would be in a position to address these arrears or restore some stability to the mortgage arrangement.  This is recognised in some cases where repossession arises on a voluntary basis and where there is some other voluntary arrangement to address an unsustainable mortgage.  In circumstances in which individuals borrow money to acquire a home and that home is security for borrowing it has been the law for centuries that, ultimately, the financial institution that provides the loan can apply to the courts for possession of the property where the borrower fails to discharge mortgage repayments.  In the absence of such a law, no financial institution would lend money for house purchases as the security would be meaningless.  Modern insolvency legislation is a required feature of any properly functioning market economy.  It will assist not only debtors and financial institutions but also business of all types and sizes, including tradespersons and local co-operatives.  All debtors and creditors are concerned about this reform and all must be treated fairly.  Many persons and companies may be both debtors and creditors.</p><p>While I understand and share some of the very negative feelings towards financial institutions and their contribution to our current economic difficulties, we must not lose sight of our objective, which is to introduce reformed, workable and balanced insolvency legislation.  This approach which seeks balance and fairness has been criticised as suggesting creditors, particularly mortgage creditors, will exercise a veto.  That criticism is reflected in the ill-thought-out motion before the House.  The contention is based on an incorrect view of how normal commercial contractual issues may be resolved.  If one borrows, one must repay where one can.  If one receives a good or service, the provider is entitled to be paid.</p> <p>If the debtor is genuinely unable to pay, negotiation with creditors may resolve the difficulty and the Act provides the new framework for sensible negotiation.</p><p>The approach in the proposed debt settlement arrangement and the personal insolvency arrangement is that the insolvent debtor will, with the assistance of a personal insolvency practitioner, put forward what the debtor considers to be a realistic offer to his or her creditors, one that will restore the debtor to solvency within a reasonable period while at the same time giving creditors a better financial outcome than the alternatives of debt enforcement or bankruptcy.  The creditors will seek to consider carefully the debtor's offer, conscious that if they refuse, the debtor has another option, namely, the standard debt discharge procedure available under the reformed bankruptcy laws.</p><p>The motion from the Opposition Senators also makes reference to developing some form of non-judicial independent agency or process to arbitrate and impose solutions on creditors and debtors.  This point was mentioned by a number of Members.  However, the new debt resolution processes which this Government has introduced, and in particular the personal insolvency arrangement, are designed to operate on a voluntary basis with common sense and enlightened self-interest rather than coercion of any of the parties.  There is no example of the type of body that appears to be demanded by the Senators in their motion existing in any jurisdiction.  During the debate on the Personal Insolvency Bill last year, no Senator or Member of the Lower House could give an example of such a body. </p></speech>

There are enough lawyers in the House who know it quite well.</p><p>The Personal Insolvency Act is one of the key elements of the Government's strategy to return this country to stability and economic growth.  Its success depends on the goodwill and determination of debtors and creditors to agree workable arrangements that can be sustained over a number of years to a successful outcome.  We cannot allow the emerging economic recovery to bypass families in mortgage arrears or leave a significant number of families in limbo because they have no certainty about their future financial situation.  However, neither can we allow situations to arise where people who have the capacity to repay their debts renege on their commitments or, where there is a problem, do not meaningfully engage with the lender.  The Government, unlike its predecessor, is delivering the reform process and the real solutions needed by our citizens so that they can engage constructively with financial institutions and creditors to bring about certainty, hope and relief in respect of their homes and mortgage affairs.  I thank the Senators for giving me a longer hearing than I was entitled to.</p></speech>

This was positive and indicates the lustre of going back.  The point being made to me was that the parties in government should deal with the issues.  They knew what was in store when coming into office and made loads of promises.</p><p>The banks really control the show.  The Personal Insolvency Act is a dream.  I hope it works but it will not resolve the major issues we are dealing with on a daily basis.  We think of people in Dublin who purchased apartments and houses and who are now in negative equity but the situation applies across rural Ireland.  I recently came across a young man whose planning permission was delayed for three years.  He eventually started building and, by the time the recession bit and he lost his job, he had the structure of a house in place.  There was no plumbing and no kitchen installed.  It was uninhabitable but when he looked for a few euro from the social welfare office, they pointed out that he had a house.  They put a notional value on his house, which was uninhabitable, and he was denied any assistance from the Department of Social Protection.  There is a lack of joined-up thinking.  The banks would not give him the money to complete his house and it is probably not the right way to go because he does not have a job.  It is wrong for the Minister and the Government to dismiss out of hand the Mortgage Resolution Bill proposed by Fianna F&aacute;il.  There are interesting points in the Bill.  Some 180,000 loans are in serious arrears, with 80% of them concerning family homes.  There is a worry that, despite commitments given, family homes will be repossessed.  It is a real fear.</p><p>I urge the Minister of State to speak to the senior Ministers in his party and to put a gun to the heads of the banks.  It happened in our Government last time.  The banks called the shots and told a ball of lies to the former Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan, and others.  Brian Lenihan, who is now deceased, sat in that chair and said the total bank problem was in the region of &euro;5 billion to &euro;7 billion.  That was the information he had been given and he provided it to us in good faith.  Some four years later, the banks have received substantial funding but have not dealt with the problem.  Time will tell whether the proposals are of some benefit to the beleaguered borrowers and whether the banks are still calling the shots.  The Personal Insolvency Act, even though the Minister of State may not agree, contains a veto for the banks.  The banks are the final arbiters.</p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il proposed splitting mortgages, a procedure under which part of the loan is parked for ten years.  In some cases, that may be necessary.  Another proposal is for interest-only payments for up to four years.  I know a businessman who, unfortunately, had three properties.  He was able to pay the mortgage on his family home and he had a commercial building and a buy-to-let property.  The banks refused to accept an interest-only arrangement.  For the past two years, nothing has been paid.  If he was allowed, with a struggle he could have paid the interest portion on the other two properties.  I remain to be convinced that the banks are really in this game to assist beleaguered borrowers.  The banks have too much power and control and owe it to the taxpayers to treat fairly those in serious mortgage arrears, particularly in respect of family homes.  People ask why debt forgiveness should happen but in some cases there is no alternative.  The banks should look at this and take the bull by the horns.  Banks have been recapitalised and the outcome on the ground does not reflect the money that has been put in.  The banks are doing little or nothing for the ordinary Joe Soap and the beleaguered mortgage holders in desperate situations.  The message for the Minister of State to take back is that I do not trust the banks.  The previous Government and the current Government are being led a merry dance by the banks.</p></speech>

Either the official knows me very well or what was provided was a standard script.  </p><p>We will always disagree on particular political points.  We can also talk all we like about history, although it is important in the context of learning from the mistakes of the past.  I have probably used 30% of Fianna F&aacute;il's Private Members' time in the lifetime of this Seanad to try to address the issues of mortgage distress, arrears and debt.  Fianna F&aacute;il has brought forward realistic options and alternatives that should be looked at.</p><p>I hope that when we come to debate the personal insolvency legislation in a year's time, I will have been proved wrong.  However, I do not believe it will work because of the bank veto, the lack of independent arbitration and the proposal that half the salaries of personal insolvency experts be met by banks.  In this regard, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, is only providing a new layer of the Judiciary to deal with this specific item.  As I said to the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, the Government must define what is meant by &quot;sustainable&quot;.  I firmly believe it should not leave it to the banks to decide what will be a sustainable solution.  I say this as someone who, prior to being elected to the Houses, worked in the financial services sector for 15 years.  I hope the Minister of State will relay my request to the Minister and I am sure he will do so.  </p><p>I accept the argument that every case is different.  However, we need to deal with this issue within the parameter that 40% of a person's take home pay, after tax, is the maximum a bank can insist on taking.  The bank could then move towards other solutions such as split mortgages, an extension of mortgage terms, etc., which should be looked at in more detail.  It should not be left to the banks to determine, in respect of all of the issues we have discussed time and again, what the fix will be.  I am sure that, like me, the Minister of State and other Senators have acted on behalf of constituents in their dealings with banks.  It should not be forgotten that it is the bank official's job to know the ins and outs of the banking process.  At a time when people's homes are up for grabs, they are being asked, despite not necessarily being well versed in financial matters, to fill in financial statements, back them up with all necessary information and then meet a senior official in a bank.  </p><p>The motion was tabled in good faith and this has been a useful debate.  I agree with much of what has been said by Senators across the House, although I do not agree with much of what was contained in the Minister of State's speech, which he edited well.  The current statutory code of conduct should not be ripped up, as it provides the only protection in this area.  Like I am sure most Senators present, I know what the response of the banks will be to the introduction of the land and conveyancing Bill to set aside the Dunne judgment.  It will be a repossession charter for the banks.  Like Senator John Gilroy, I have seen a lot of requests from banks for voluntary sales, particularly in the past two months.  Some of them have been based specifically on value in cases in which the mortgage amount is low.  Banks know what they are at and should not be trusted.  The Government should set the bar and parameters for them.  I hope some of the suggestions we have made in this debate will feed into that process.  The Government should not trust the banks, as they will not do what it wants them to do.</p><p>I again thank all colleagues for their contributions to the debate.</p></speech>

T&aacute;im anseo anocht le ceist agus c&uacute;is an-tromch&uacute;iseach a ard&uacute;, maidir le sc&eacute;al at&aacute; sna me&aacute;in le c&uacute;pla seachtain anuas maidir leis an iar ceannasa&iacute; ar Chumann na bhFiann agus Col&aacute;iste na bhFiann, D&oacute;mhnall &Oacute; L&uacute;bhla&iacute;, nach maireann.  Bh&iacute; cl&aacute;racha ar TG4 agus ar Raid&iacute;o na Gaeltachta agus ar RTE le seachtain anuas a l&eacute;irigh go raibh daoine ag d&eacute;anamh l&iacute;omhaint&iacute; go ndearnadh ionsaithe gn&eacute;is orthu fad agus a bh&iacute; siad faoi ch&uacute;ram Domhnall &Oacute; L&uacute;bhla&iacute;.</p><p>I raise a very serious issue involving D&oacute;mhnall &Oacute; L&uacute;bhla&iacute;, who is deceased and who was previously involved with Cumann na bhFiann and Col&aacute;iste na bhFiann.  Allegations have been made that individuals were sexually abused by D&oacute;mhnall &Oacute; Lubhla&iacute;.  These allegations date as far back as 1955.  A number of questions need to be answered on this issue.  The matter was brought before the courts on two occasions but in 1992 the case fell apart, reportedly because some of the evidence to be heard in court was not available at the time.  The case fell apart on that technicality.  At least four or five individuals have come forward and the 1992 case cited 53 occasions of abuse.  This is a serious matter because the organisations concerned promoted the Irish language and gave access to large numbers of young males and females.  I note that it was announced today that the Garda Commissioner intends to launch a full investigation but I am not satisfied that it will cover all issues arising.</p> <p>It is important the Garda Commissioner has an internal investigation as to what happened in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regarding this case.  It is also important any other allegations made against this man are brought into the public domain so as to see the extent of the abuse.</p><p>The State itself has questions to answer.  Last night a former Minister for the Gaeltacht said he was told of an allegation concerning the man in the 1990s but did not go to the Garda.  Instead he made civil servants in his Department aware of it.  It is not clear what happened to these allegations.  Civil servants in the then Department of Education were also made aware of other abuse allegations.  Did any Department or other State body act on these allegations or fail to act?</p><p>Any investigation into this matter will have to be much broader than just the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na looking at its response to the allegations.  How independent can such an investigation be?  An independent outside review would be much more suitable in this case.</p><p>If this abuse had been happening since 1955, how was it allowed to continue and how were so many people allowed to be abused?  An investigation is the only way to resolve these questions.  It is important to ascertain what role different civil servants, garda&iacute; and the then Attorney General played in all of this.  I was informed the court case fell apart around the time there were difficulties in the Attorney General&rsquo;s office which led to the fall of a Government and we were without an Attorney General for a year.  Did this have any bearing on how long it took to bring these cases to court?</p></speech>

On behalf of the Minister, I thank the Senator for raising this important matter.</p><p>The reports in recent days and weeks concerning allegations against the person in question are of great concern.  They echo in many ways those which have come to light in other situations where persons have abused their positions of authority and trust to harm children.  We have learned from those instances and transformed our child protection arrangements.  However, this is not to say that we can simply draw a line under the past.  Where there continue to be further lessons to be learned, we should endeavour to do so, so as to give further assurance that our children can safely and happily engage in educational, sport and recreational activities in the wider community.</p><p>The Minister's first concern is, of course, with victims of abuse.  He encourages anyone in any situation who has been abused to come forward to report their concerns and to avail of the counselling which is available from the Health Service Executive, HSE, or one of the voluntary groups working in this field.  He would like to express his sincere sympathy with all those who have come forward concerning the allegations in this particular case.  He hopes they will be able to benefit from the assistance which is available.  The HSE national counselling service can be accessed free of charge in all regions and is staffed by highly qualified counsellors.</p><p>The Minister has received a preliminary report from the Garda authorities concerning the criminal investigations which took place.  As has been widely reported, in 1997 a criminal investigation was instigated into allegations of instances of sexual abuse committed against various children and young persons.  The person in question was arrested in connection with the offences in February 1999.  A file on the allegations made was submitted to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, who directed that the accused be prosecuted for numerous counts of sexual offences.  A prosecution was initiated in March 2000 when the accused was arrested and charged before Mullingar District Court with 56 counts of buggery and indecent assault.  The case was subsequently listed for trial in Mullingar Circuit Criminal Court for February 2002.</p><p>The Minister is advised, however, that judicial review proceedings were taken before the High Court by the accused for reasons related to delay in the bringing of complaints.  He understands that arising from these proceedings, the prosecution fell.  The Senator will appreciate that the bringing of prosecutions and their management is a matter for the direction of the DPP, who makes independent decisions having regard to the circumstances of the case in question.  The Minister has no role in this process and, quite properly, is not in a position to explain decisions of the DPP.</p><p>More recently, arrangements had been made by the Garda with a further injured party to take a statement but this had not taken place prior to the person in question's death.  Garda&iacute; are continuing to liaise with this injured party.  Concerns expressed by another person were also under consideration at the time of the death.</p><p>The course which these investigations could have been expected to take is, of course, no longer available.  However the Garda Commissioner has informed the Minister that he has directed that a review be carried out of the procedures surrounding the handling of the complaints against this person, and subsequent investigations, to see if any lessons can be learned in that context.  The HSE is also to review any contact made with it.  The Department of Education and Skills is reviewing its records to establish if child protection concerns were raised with the Department concerning the person in question and if so what steps were taken on foot of this contact.</p><p>We know only too well how, in the past, such arrangements as were in place to protect children often, in fact, failed miserably.  The Minister would like to emphasise the fundamental changes which have taken place in recent years to the way we approach the issue of child protection.  We now have revised the Children First guidelines which are to be put on a statutory footing by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  These set out excellent standards and procedures involving vetting of staff, reporting of allegations to the authorities and training to support this process.  These guidelines are complemented by the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 and the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012, both introduced by the Minister, Deputy Shatter.  Moreover, the arrangements for interagency working at all levels have been strengthened, supported by the ongoing reform of children and family services in the HSE and the work to establish a child and family support agency.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also has in place a new and comprehensive policy on the investigation of sexual crime, crimes against children and child welfare.</p><p>It would be unrealistic to think that abuse will never occur but these new arrangements mean that we can have far greater confidence in the systems in place to prevent it, to make sure that it is effectively investigated where it is discovered and, ultimately, that offenders are held to account and the rights of victims vindicated.</p><p>On behalf of the Minister, I thank again the Senator for raising this important issue and will certainly share the points he has made with the relevant Ministers.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, again expresses his sympathy with all those who have been affected.  We all regret greatly the dreadful experiences they endured.  It is the Minister's view that it is incumbent on any organisation which may have been used by a person to facilitate their evil deeds to examine carefully how this may have occurred to ensure its procedures will not allow it to recur.  For the present, the Minister believes that the reviews which are under way should be allowed to proceed and their results considered carefully, so that we may see what lessons can be learned to further strengthen child protection arrangements.</p></speech>

Will other Departments also be involved, in light of the statement by a former Minister with responsibility for the Gaeltacht last night that he was approached on this and spoke to officials in his Department about allegations of abuse?  This issue might extend further.  The HSE, the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and any other Department or State agency which funded any of the organisations for whom the person involved worked should also conduct investigations and the Minister should bring all this information back to the Houses so that we can examine it.  I thank the Minister of State for his response on this issue.  It is important that this be fully and frankly investigated and that the victims be supported at this difficult time.</p></speech>

I will share the Senator's views with the Minister and he will share them with other relevant Ministers and the points raised will be addressed.  Everyone has a deep appreciation of the harm that has been caused by the abuse of children and there is enormous popular support for the steps that have been taken to put comprehensive and robust protection arrangements in place.  If there are lessons to be learned in this case by the agencies of the State and any private bodies involved, it is imperative that they be learned.  The Minister and his colleagues are determined this will be the case and that is the reason the reviews mentioned are taking place.  I reiterate the Minister's expressions of sympathy for all of those affected.  He hopes they will be able to avail of the counselling services on offer.</p></speech>

The people of County Meath deeply appreciate the fact that I can raise these issues in the Seanad.</p><p>  I am concerned about the state of the roads in the county.  The Minister of State will probably argue that the state of the roads is the responsibility of the county council and that the Minister only has a limited function in that regard.  However, I contend that the appalling state of our roads, particularly rural roads and regional and third class roads, is due to the cuts to capital expenditure that the Government has introduced since coming into office.  The Minister of State will probably respond that we agreed these cuts with the IMF, that they must be done and that they are only following an agreement reached by Fianna F&aacute;il.  Before he makes that point, I will counteract it.  It is an incorrect contention that is repeated time and again.  Under the IMF agreement, in 2012 the Department of Transport was to spend &#8364;1.329 billion on capital expenditure.  Under the Government's capital framework, that amount was reduced to &#8364;1.231 billion, a reduction of approximately &#8364;100 million in 2012.  Therefore, the Government agreed with the IMF to spend &#8364;100 million less than what was agreed by Fianna F&aacute;il in 2010.  In 2013, the Government proposes to spend &#8364;900 million on capital expenditure in the Department of Transport.  Under the four-year national recovery plan, Fianna F&aacute;il proposed to spend &#8364;1.075 billion.  Therefore, there is a difference of approximately &#8364;175 million this year in capital expenditure in the Department of Transport compared with the IMF agreement.  In 2014, the difference will be about &#8364;120 million.  Cumulatively, in 2012, 2013 and 2014, approximately &#8364;400 million less will be spent on capital expenditure by the Department of Transport than was agreed with the IMF in November 2010.  Therefore, on top of the cuts for which the Government has blamed Fianna F&aacute;il, it has cut the roads budget by &#8364;400 million.  This is deeply unfair and wrong.</p><p>  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, boasted in <i>The Irish Times</i> before Christmas that he had cut &#8364;300 million or &#8364;400 million off the roads budget and nobody had noticed.  People have noticed, because the roads are in an appalling state.  It is incumbent on the Government to accept responsibility for this and to spend the money agreed on capital expenditure.  It was part of the agreement the Government keeps citing to justify its actions.  That argument is wrong.  The &#8364;400 million being cut from 2011 to 2014 is having a massively detrimental effect on rural roads throughout the country.  While the Government is still prepared to go ahead with some bypasses, I question the spend on the Gort to Tuam motorway and the Ballaghadereen bypass.  I am familiar with the area of Ballaghadereen and I wonder why that bypass has got the go-ahead.  Frankly, if a bypass is needed on the N5, it is needed somewhere else.  I wonder at the priorities in place.  We are able to build motorways, but we cannot maintain rural roads.  For example, in the Kells electoral area of County Meath, at least &#8364;15 million is required to repair class 3 roads alone.  This is a massive amount of money.  In the meantime, people are afraid to drive and those who are driving to work find their cars are being severely damaged from driving on these roads.  Recently, it took me approximately 50% longer to return from a public meeting in Cormeen, in the Moynalty area, than it would have taken me a few years ago because of the state of the roads in the area and the need to avoid potholes.  A meeting took place with the Kells area county councillors about one month ago, but there has been no follow-up from the Minister.  At the time, he met the county councillors and the county manager, and the case was made for more money for Meath County Council to repair roads in need of repair.</p><p>  The problem is that the Government has cut &#8364;400 million above and beyond what was in the IMF agreement.  That &#8364;400 million would go a long way, over a three-year period, towards repairing rural roads, not just in Meath, but throughout the country.  The state of the roads is costing the economy massively.  Damage is being done to cars and this results in huge administration costs for councils, which must deal with constant complaints.  I urge the Minister and the Government to reconsider the capital transport budget and to send the money out to fix the roads and to create jobs in local areas.</p></speech>

During the Meath East by-election I was in the area and have some idea of the condition of the roads.  However, in the case of roads we must consider the time of the year.  I know that in Sligo, much of the maintenance work does not commence until this time of year because of weather conditions.  Engineering staff in Sligo County Council tell me that any remedial work done up to this time of year is often a waste of money due to heavy rain and bad weather.  Therefore, I am sure the Senator will be pleasantly surprised when the road crews get working in Meath on the class 3 roads.</p><p>I am taking this Adjournment debate on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Varadkar, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, and I thank the Senator for raising this issue in the House this evening.  The Minister has responsibility for overall policy and funding for the national roads programme.  The planning, design and implementation of individual road projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority, NRA, under the Roads Acts of 1993 to 2007, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual projects is a matter in the first instance for the NRA in accordance with section 19 of the Roads Act.  The NRA has a budget of &euro;318 million for improvement and maintenance works on the national roads network in 2013.</p><p>The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  Works on these roads are funded from local authorities' own resources, supplemented by State road grants paid by the Department.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.  The Minister announced the 2013 regional and local road grant allocations on 25 January.  A total of &euro;349 million is being provided under the regional and local roads investment programme this year.  From that allocation, Meath County Council is being provided with an allocation of over &euro;10.7 million.</p><p>The level of grants allocated to individual local authorities is determined having regard to a number of factors, which include the total funds available in a particular year, the eligibility criteria for the different road grant schemes, road pavement conditions, the length of the road network, the need to prioritise projects and competing demands from other local authorities.  In determining the annual grant allocations, the overall objective remains to supplement the resources provided by each local authority in a fair and appropriate manner.  Ireland has a uniquely extensive road network.  There are approximately 98,000 kilometres of road in the network, which represents two and a half times the EU average in terms of kilometres per head of population.  The maintenance and improvement of this extensive network of roads places a substantial financial burden on local authorities and on the Exchequer.</p> <p>In light of this country's current financial position, which the Senator is well aware of, our main focus must be on the maintenance and repair of roads.  This will remain the position in the years to come.  There have been large reductions in roads expenditure over recent years.  There will be further reductions in the future.  In 2007, grants worth &euro;2.375 billion were made available for national and local roads.  These grants have fallen to &euro;665 million in 2013 and will fall further to &euro;629 million in 2014.  The reality of the funding position means that priorities have to be set in all areas of activity.</p><p>It is important to reiterate that the role of Exchequer grants for regional and local roads is to supplement the spending of councils like Meath County Council in this area.  The contribution made by Meath County Council, which is the road authority for the area mentioned by Senator Byrne, has fallen in recent years in real and percentage terms.  In 2008, Meath County Council spent over &euro;18 million from its own resources on works on regional and local roads.  This represented 40% of the total spending on these roads, including State grants, in 2008.  This own-resources expenditure decreased to &euro;4 million, or 26% of the total expenditure on roads in the county, in 2012.</p><p>It is appreciated that many local authorities are trying to implement savings.  The Minister believes that some local authorities are missing the point when they complain about reductions in Government grants and seek additional funding, given that they have reduced their own contributions by a far greater proportion.  The reality is that the available funds do not match the amount of work required.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and local authorities are working closely to develop new and more efficient ways of delivering the best possible outputs from the funding available to them.  Given that the squeeze on Exchequer funding is likely to continue, this concentration on efficiency is essential if the best outturns are to be achieved from the limited money available.</p><p>In this regard, the Minister recently wrote to local authorities to offer them more flexibility in their regional and local road grants.  Councils have an opportunity to reallocate up to 30% of their restoration improvement grants to their discretionary grants.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has invited applications for funding under a pilot community involvement scheme, whereby problems affecting a given stretch of road can be remedied sooner than would otherwise be the case if the local community is willing to assist the local authority, in money or in kind, with the necessary works.  The scheme recognises local community involvement in this regard without taking from the statutory responsibilities of county councils in any way.</p></speech>

If it was twice the size, it would have fitted on two pages.</p><p>I would like to make a couple of points on this issue.  It is unfair to blame the county council in the manner the Minister of State has tried to do.  It is trying to do the best it can from within its own resources.  Its income has decreased.  It is not allowed to keep the property tax.  Certainly, some of it is going around the country.  Anyone who tries to blame local authorities for not contributing money is missing the point completely.</p><p>The Government should reconsider the Smarter Travel fund.  Fine Gael should be aware that it has become a slush fund for the Labour Party.  It seems to me that the Labour Party makes all the announcements about the Smarter Travel fund.  Some of the projects that have been announced under the fund are not necessary.  They are being pursued at a time when roads are falling apart because of potholes.  I urge the Government parties, particularly Fine Gael, to examine the matter.  The fund is not doing what it should be doing.</p><p>We have got to look at spending.  I repeat the point that there seems to be a difference of &euro;400 million between what was in the IMF agreement and what the Government is committed to spending on capital expenditure in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  That is the nub of the problem.  If we do not solve this problem, the standard of roads in Moynalty will become the norm throughout the country.  If we do not get to grips with this problem, roads throughout the country will start to collapse.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-04-17a.388" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1081" speakername="John Perry" time="20:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013041700051#DDD00900"><p>The Minister has made it clear that local communities have an opportunity to get involved.  Many people on back to work schemes are anxious to get involved in generic schemes in their localities.  The proportion of funding that is being made available by county councils is much less than the proportion of funding being allocated by the Government.  I am not fully certain where Senator Byrne got the &euro;400 million figure that he mentioned when he spoke about the IMF agreement.  The information available to me suggests that those figures are incorrect.</p><p>I do not doubt that the local government reform process will create opportunities for autonomy at local level.  Elected councillors will be able to make funding allocations from moneys collected in their local areas.  Up to 65% of those moneys will be maintained in the areas where they are collected.  That is the intention of the Minister, Deputy Hogan, as he devolves responsibility to elected members.</p><p>It is easy to whinge and ask the Government for more money.  It is up to elected councillors, county managers and the local executive to deal with their business locally.  If they cannot match the funds that are provided by the State, it is very hard for the Government to keep supplementing them.  As we reform local government over the next 12 months, we will give every local authority a unique opportunity to manage its own business, which is as it should be.</p></speech>

The issue I am raising relates to what happens when people purchase drugs or medications from their local pharmacies.  I understand that after they have made the maximum monthly payment of &euro;144, they are not given a detailed breakdown of the total cost of the rest of the medication from which they are benefitting.  I am open to correction in this regard.  I have spoken to a number of people on this issue.  One receives a receipt for the first &euro;144 of one's medication, but one does not get the full details of what one receives thereafter.  A person who uses medication costing &euro;300 or &euro;400 does not get a breakdown of what the full amount of money is spent on.</p><p>I believe this is one of the issues we need to tackle, particularly given that the cost of drugs in this country increased from &euro;574 million in 2000 to &euro;1.894 billion in 2010.  I have raised this matter already in this House today.  It is estimated that this country's drugs bill will reach approximately &euro;2 billion this year.  A number of recent reports have indicated that there are substantial variations in the cost of medication.  An item that cost &euro;16 in one pharmacy was found to cost &euro;46 in another pharmacy in the same town or city.  There are significant price variations between pharmacies.</p><p>I would like to mention a second aspect of this issue.  In Ireland, some medication costs up to 25 times more than a similar item would cost in the UK.  Nobody seems to be in control.  I am giving a simple example of the urgent need to make people aware of how much their medication is costing.  People should take a proactive approach to helping to reduce the cost of medication in this country.  I reckon we are spending between 25% and 30% more than we should be spending at present.  I appreciate that the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012, which is being considered at present, advocates the use of generic drugs.  However, generic drugs are between ten and 20 times more expensive in this country than in other jurisdictions.  This issue needs to be tackled urgently.</p></speech>

He has asked me to convey his apologies in that regard.  The Minister is in favour of pharmacists publishing details of dispensing and other fees.  Under the code of conduct of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, pharmacists are required to provide honest, relevant, accurate, current and appropriate information to patients regarding the nature, cost, value and benefit of medicines provided by them.  Every pharmacist has an obligation to comply in full with the statutory code of conduct.  Perhaps they do not always do so.</p> <p>The PSI advises patients that their pharmacist should be in a position to provide them with whatever information or clarification they require about prescribed medicines, although, as Senator Burke has just said, they often do not ask for this information.  Each pharmacy has a professional management structure comprising of a superintendent and supervising pharmacist, and it may be appropriate to seek further information or clarification from them.</p><p>The price charged by a pharmacy for dispensing a prescribed medicine typically consists of a dispensing fee, the ingredient cost and a retail mark-up.  The HSE reimburses pharmacists for products dispensed under the general medical services scheme and other community drug schemes in accordance with rates set out in its list of reimbursable items.  Under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009, the fees and allowances paid by the HSE to pharmacists were reduced in 2009 and again in 2011.  These measures included a reduction in the wholesale mark-up on drugs from 17.66% to 8%.  In addition, the retail mark-up payable under the drug payment scheme and the long-term illness scheme was reduced from 50% to 20%.  The reduction in the cost of medicines should be of benefit to all patients who hold a drug payment scheme card, whether or not they reach the &euro;144 threshold per month.</p><p>It is open to patients to move their custom to a different pharmacy if they are dissatisfied with the prices being charged.  However, as we all know, it is often difficult for customers, particularly those in rural areas, to move their custom because they have built up a relationship and they have a traditional outlet.</p><p>I wish to advise that the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012, which was passed on Committee Stage in the Dail on 19 March, provides for the introduction of a system of generic substitution and reference pricing.  This legislation is expected to complete its passage shortly.  This will provide an opportunity to highlight the issue the Senator has raised in the House today and is perhaps an opportunity for the Minister for Health to do something along the lines advocated by the Senator.</p></speech>

My principal issue is that people should get a detailed statement at the end of the month regarding the total cost of the medication, including what refund is coming from the Department.  There is a huge lack of knowledge as to what medication is now costing.  If one is under the &euro;144 threshold, one knows exactly what it is costing, but if it is over &euro;144, one is not given the information and the pharmacy is not required to give a full detailed statement on the total amount being paid to the pharmacy for the medication.  That needs to be changed.  I certainly intend to raise this with the Minister when we are discussing the Bill and also at the Committee on Health and Children.  I thank the Minister, Deputy Hogan, for his response.  It is a matter that needs to be sorted out.</p></speech>

On 19 March 2013, only four weeks ago, the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change in the UK, Mr. Edward Davey, MP, granted development consent in respect of a 3,260 MW nuclear power plant development at Hinkley Point, Somerset, in the UK.  This is approximately 150 miles from Ireland and our most densely populated east coast.  This facility will be as close to many Irish people as it will be to many UK residents.  For many Irish citizens, nuclear power facilities cause serious concern regarding risks for health, the environment and the economy, and in particular for the fishing, agriculture, food and tourism industries, which are essential indigenous industries on which Ireland relies.</p><p>The Seanad need not be reminded of the long-standing concerns and issues and the documented record of accidents and discharges into the Irish Sea from the UK's nuclear facility at Sellafield, as well as the recent disasters at Fukushima, Chernobyl and Three Mile Island.  Despite these legitimate concerns and the proactive stance taken by previous Irish Governments in regard to securing access to Sellafield by Irish nuclear specialists, there appears to have been a fundamental failure in consultation between the UK and Ireland on the transboundary effects of this development, and a failure to involve Ireland and the Irish public in the consultation process essential to the decision-making process.</p><p>The documents publicly available make it clear that both the applicant energy company and the UK Government believe that nothing will go wrong and, consequently, there will be no transboundary effects on Ireland.  This five-page document, known as a regulation 24 screening document, outlines some of the concerns I am bringing to the Minister's attention.  For example, the document deals only with geographical area concerned; the distance to any other EEA member state is not specified and there has no been no scoping exercise outside of the UK.  Any assessment of magnitude is not included in this document and neither are questions of frequency and duration.  This screening document appears to be the basis on which the UK Government decided not to consult with the Irish Government or, more importantly, the Irish public.  Glasgow was consulted about its geographical relationship with Hinkley Point but not Dublin, Wexford or the Minister's constituency.  As I said, the distance to the east coast of Ireland is 150-odd miles, so I consider this to be a serious matter.</p><p>I would like to know whether the Irish Government was consulted on this decision.  It is my contention that the Oireachtas and the Irish public should have been consulted according to the Aarhus convention.  If the Irish Government knew about this development, why was the Irish public not consulted?</p><p>The second issue is more important and urgent.  Does the Minister not consider we should do something about this?  What is the intention of the Government and what is its responsibility to consult and inform the Irish public about the terrible and worrying situation regarding the development of the Hinkley Point nuclear power plant?  Will the Government seek a judicial review, which has to be submitted by 29 April?  It is four weeks since we found out about this and it is a very tight deadline.  Perhaps the Minister can suggest other channels by which the Government can communicate its view on this issue, particularly with regard to representing the Irish public's view.  How can the Oireachtas and the people of Ireland assist the Government in perhaps making a complaint to the European Commission or making an application for interim measures or other actions with the European Court of Justice?</p><p>All of us - those in the Oireachtas and all other Irish citizens - need to be fully briefed and informed and do everything we can to stop this development, which will take place over approximately 65 hectares.  The fact that the Irish public has not been consulted is deeply worrying and possibly illegal.  We now have an opportunity to examine the decision and to prevent the nuclear development from proceeding, but we have very little time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-04-17a.398" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/967" speakername="Phil Hogan" time="21:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013041700052#EEE00600"><p>The Government of Ireland and its people have long been concerned about the potential impacts on Ireland, including the Irish Sea, from nuclear activities in the United Kingdom.  Although Ireland does not have a nuclear power industry, it is Ireland's position that where a State chooses either to develop a nuclear power industry or, in this case, to consider expanding its existing nuclear power industry, this must always be done in accordance with the highest international standards with respect to safety and environmental protection.  Ireland's priority is the safety of the Irish people and the protection of our environment, including the shared marine environment of the Irish Sea.</p><p>The UK announced and published its draft energy national policy statement in November 2009, which signalled the UK's intention to construct ten new nuclear power stations at sites judged as potentially suitable.  This was subsequently revised in October 2010, when the number of planned stations was reduced to eight, following the dropping of two sites originally proposed for Cumbria, near the existing Sellafield facility.</p><p>It is incorrect to state there was no consultation with the Irish Government, and I will set out why this is the case.  Since the original announcement by the UK, we have written twice at ministerial level to the UK Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change outlining concerns about the potential environmental impacts on Ireland and on the Irish Sea.  The key issues of concern raised in those letters include the assessments by the UK of effects on the environment, management of radioactive waste and the rationale underpinning the proposed justification decision for new nuclear facilities.  The engagement with the UK at ministerial level has also been supported and informed by a continuing dialogue at official level under which Irish officials engage and raise concerns, where appropriate, with UK officials involved in the development and implementation of the plans.  In parallel, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, given its statutory advisory role to the Government, was asked to carry out an assessment of the potential radiological impacts on Ireland from the programme of new nuclear power plants in the UK, including the plant at Hinkley Point.  Therefore, I am doing something at expert and agency level to ensure the safety of the Irish people in this respect.</p><p>The RPII assessment considers both routine operations and a range of postulated accident scenarios at the plants.  The assessment is being finalised and I expect to receive it very shortly.  It will then be published and the RPII will provide briefings for interested parties, so the Senator may wish to receive a briefing.  This assessment will be of considerable assistance to Ireland in quantifying scientifically the risk profile to Ireland arising from each of the UK nuclear new-build facilities, including the facility at Hinkley Point.  This will enable Ireland to engage constructively with UK authorities to continue to ensure that the interests of Ireland are strongly represented.</p><p>As well as regular engagement as official level, the RPII has been heavily involved in monitoring UK nuclear activities and advising my Department, and will also be responsible for monitoring the effects of day-to-day operations of any new facilities on Ireland, particularly on the Irish Sea.</p> <p> It should be noted that under the EURATOM treaty, the United Kingdom was required to satisfy the European Commission that the development at Hinkley Point would not result in the radioactive contamination of the water, soil or airspace of another member state.  In that context, a Commission opinion, issued in February 2012, considered that in normal operating conditions discharges of liquid and gaseous radioactive effluents were not likely to result in exposure of the population of another member state, which is significant from the point of view of health.</p><p>It is my intention that the improved engagement between Ireland and the United Kingdom on nuclear matters will continue.  This will ensure the Government and the people will be in a position to be properly informed of radiation developments in the United Kingdom of interest to them, as well as conveying concerns or issues arising directly to the relevant UK authorities.</p></speech>

I am not clear on whether the Government was briefed about the particular decision of 19 March to develop at Hinkley Point.  The Minister has mentioned the RPII's assessment, but at what point was this made public?  There seems to be an onus under the Aarhus Convention and the Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context to also consult the public.  We have very little time in concluding this issue because 29 March is the deadline set for that decision.  I want to be precise about this.</p></speech>

There is no point in coming to conclusions without first doing the homework on the science or making an assessment of the facility to establish if there is a danger.  If there is, the Government will be proactive in bringing these matters to the attention of the UK authorities.</p></speech>
