I have put down a Commencement matter calling on the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to indicate his intentions to authorise the transfer of D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company from the State to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, as provided for under the Harbours Act 2015.</p> <p>I realise the Minister is aware and knowledgeable about what is going on in D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour but I will set out some key points.  There is considerable uncertainty about the future governance and management of D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour given the possible transfer of D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company from the State to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  The suggestion that ports of local or regional significance would transfer to local authorities has been flagged for approximately two years, since 2015.  We have seen some cases of where that has happened.</p> <p>I wish to flag several issues.  I wish to declare that I was a director of the company for two terms so I understand the intricacies of company law and especially issues around the governance of D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company.  I live in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and I am a former local elected representative for the area.  I know and understand the workings of the company and of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.</p> <p>I have several concerns.  Outstanding issues remain in respect of a due diligence report commissioned for the harbour.  There are protracted legal issues.  There are human resources issues and disputes.  There is a depleted workforce at the company.  There are suggestions of a major deficit in the pension fund for the company.  There are issues relating to corporate governance and funding sources.</p> <p>I understand this State company has never issued a dividend to the State.  I call on the Minister to check this out at some future date.  It would raise serious concern if a State company did not give a dividend to the shareholder.  In this case, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister for Finance are shareholders on behalf of the State.  Every company has to wash its face.  A State company, like this one, needs to be able to issue some dividend, if not to the shareholders, then ultimately for spending on the company and the assets of the company.</p> <p>I have looked at the company's registration and directorships.  I understand two of the directors are to cease being in office within months.  That will leave only two other directors.  This is something I am keen for the Minister to look at.  Given the transitional period under discussion, perhaps the Minister can use his powers and office &ndash; which is his entitlement in this case &ndash; to appoint one or two directors for another transitional period of one year or two.  Ultimately, that is a matter for the Minister but it is important to note that there are four directors in place in the company today and two are due to go in a matter of months.</p> <p>A person who retired from the company some years ago is now acting harbour master.  There is a legal obligation to have a harbour master in any harbour.  That is an important issue.</p> <p>What am I asking of the Minister today?  I am asking for a decision to be made on the transfer at some point soon rather than for us to be left in limbo.  The physical structure of the harbour is in a bad way in parts.  There is no coherent masterplan or vision for the harbour.  We need a new governance and management structure.  We need a new vision and direction for D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  This is an amazing port.  It is an asset to the country, the local economy and the community of D&uacute;n Laoghaire.</p> <p>We need certainty about the Minister's intentions in the short to medium term.  We need certainty on how this is progressing.  It is important for the community, the sailing fraternity, businesses in the town and the county council and its chief executive.  If they have to take over, they need to understand the ramifications and whether there is a shortfall and a need for investment.  I have touched on a range of issues.  At this stage people are crying out for some direction and certainty about a future transfer of this company.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-02-06a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018020600002#C00200"><p>I thank the Senator for bringing up this issue, which is one which has been going on for far longer than would be preferable.  The issue of transfer is thorny and has now become a political football.  It is a matter of conflict between various parties.  I will not and do not have to duck out of anything, but the real problem, as the Senator is aware, is that there are two court cases which constrains me enormously in terms of what I can say about some of the issues he has raised.  They are very delicate issues and I do not want to say anything which would prejudice the case.</p> <p>The Senator will find my reply useful, but before I refer to it I will answer some of the questions he asked.  He is right on the issue of directors.  It might be helpful to appoint a couple of new directors.  If I felt they would hasten the process it would be a very good idea.  There is room for that.  I note from a table I have here that one director will retire on 1 July this year and another on 23 September.  I would not leave the board inquorate, but the case for appointing new directors is probably compelling.  This long saga needs a direction which stops the stalemate that appears to have been reached and which is frustrating Government policy and leaving the future of the harbour in a great deal of doubt.</p> <p>The only real role that the Minister has to play directly in the matter to which the Sensor referred is if there is a dispute about the model of transfer which is adopted when the harbour is taken in by the local authority.  That can be done by a direct share transfer or integrating the assets into the local authority.  That has not been decided.  A risk assessment is currently taking place which is postponing any decision.  If there is a dispute, I will be in a position to make a decision but I have not got to that stage yet.</p> <p>On the issue of the dividend, it is sometimes very frustrating for a Minister to see profitable companies not paying dividends to the State because obviously we feel we could make good use of them.  I am not sure whether dividends have never been paid, but I will take the Senator's word on that.  They have not been paid recently.  The Senator made a case for dividends.  Some State companies maintain that there are other reasons they do not want to pay dividends.  They include boosting their reserves for specific reasons.  The IAA is one of the most profitable companies in my portfolio and does not pay a dividend.  We asked it about that.  I agree with the Senator that it certainly should pay one.  There are sometimes good reasons dividends are not paid or are not as big as they might be.  Public companies which make profits sometimes do not pay dividends for the same reasons.</p> <p>I wish to advise that the transfer of D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council is progressing.  The national ports policy, published in March 2013, provides that the five designated ports of regional significance, that is, Drogheda, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Galway, New Ross and Wicklow, will be transferred to more appropriate local authority-led governance structures.  The five ports retain important roles as facilitators of their regional economies and, in some instances, as centres of marine-related amenities and tourism activities.  However, the scale and nature of these activities are not such as to warrant continued central government involvement.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company is designated for transfer to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.</p> <p>The Harbours Act 2015 provides the necessary legislative framework to allow for the transfer of ports of regional significance to local authority control.  The relevant legislation was enacted in 2015.  The Act is not prescriptive in regard to the model for transport for each port.  Rather, it is designed to provide the maximum legislative flexibility by providing for the two possible models of transfer to which I have referred, namely, the retention of the existing company structure and transfer of ministerial shareholding in the company to the local authority or dissolution of the existing company structure and transfer of all assets, liabilities and employees into local authority structures.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Shane Ross:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1974"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1974&amp;amp;pid=ShaneRoss&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The intention is that in the case of each port, the local authority and port will agree the most appropriate model of transfer.  The optimum model will be the one which finds broad consensus and agreement between parties.  If there is disagreement between the port company and the local authority on the model of transfer, then the final decision will be taken by the Minister.</p><p>The process of transferring governance of the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company to the council is well advanced and, as I have said, the future governance and operational structures of the port are primarily matters for agreement between the council and the port company.  In the case of each port transfer to a local authority, the decision on the model of transfer is informed by due diligence carried out by the local authority with funding support from my Department.</p><p>D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has procured consultants to conduct due diligence, and the council chief executive presented the due diligence report to councillors at the council meeting held on 9 January 2017.  As the report raised a number of issues for further clarification, the chief executive decided to engage a risk and finance consultant to carry out a risk assessment.  This assessment will enable the council to fully understand the implications of each model of transfer and the responsibility that will transfer, in financial and other terms.  Officials from my Department met with the risk assessor on 31 January 2017 to give the shareholder's perspective on national ports policy and to explain different models of transfer. </p><p>Since then, I understand that both the council and the port have engaged in a process.  In April 2017, clarification was sought from my officials on whether it was necessary to sign a non-disclosure agreement regarding commercially sensitive information held by the port.  My officials met with the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company's chief executive officer and company secretary on 11 April 2017 to progress matters, and a way forward was agreed in order to enable the exchange of information required, and to clarify any outstanding issues so that the risk assessment could be completed.</p><p>I understand the port company has engaged with the risk assessor, who is now in the process of preparing the final report for presentation to the council at a meeting scheduled to take place on 26 February.  I expect matters to then progress towards the agreement of a model and a transfer date.  Finally, I can confirm that Wicklow Port Company transferred to Wicklow County Council in August 2016 by a ministerial order made under the Harbours Act 2015.  Drogheda Port Company transferred to Louth County Council in October 2017.  The transfer of the other ports of regional significance to local authority control is progressing. </p></speech>

It is clear that it is intended to transfer the  D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company and the governance of the harbour to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  I appreciate that the Minister has outlined that he has a role only in the event of a dispute.  Would the Minister consider appointing one or two people to the board early on to help push things along?  He has identified that as a possibility.  I also appeal to the Minister to consider some engagement with Ms Philomena Poole, the chief executive of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, in regard to those appointments.  Clearly, if this company is going to transfer to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, there is a strong case to be made for dialogue and consultation between the Minister and the chief executive beforehand.  Suitable people to fill the skills shortage that may affect the company may come forward.  I would appreciate it if the Minister would consider that.</p></speech>

I will respond by saying unless something occurs to me in the next couple of days, I will seriously consider appointing two directors.  I will do that through the Public Appointments Service, PAS, process.  I would not have any direct involvement in it.  It will take place through the process set up by my Department.  This will mean that the appointees are independently nominated and are not political cronies or anything of that sort.  With that reservation, I accept the Senator's point.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-02-06a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1376" speakername="Lorraine Clifford Lee" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018020600002#E00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for attending the House today to respond to the issue I have raised on third level fees, specifically those charged to students undertaking a year's internship as part of their course of study.  The issue was highlighted to me by a student in north County Dublin who is in her third year in Maynooth.  She is on work placement for the full year.  She also has a friend who is in DCU who is on a full-year's work placement.  They both have to pay their full fees to their particular universities amounting to more than &euro;3,000 each.  They do not have any access to the library and they are not undertaking tutorials, lectures or examinations.  Their only interaction is submitting a report at the end of their internship in June.</p> <p>The Citizens' Information service says that student contribution fees cover student services and examinations in college.  That is disproportionate to the level of service these girls and many thousands like them are getting when they undertake their internship year.  Perhaps the Minister of State will consider directing that the colleges reduce their fees significantly for students who undertake a full academic year out of the college setting, who do not access the services and have limited interaction with college staff.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-02-06a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1247" speakername="Mary Mitchell O'Connor" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018020600002#E00300"><p>I thank Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee for raising this matter.  Internships are an increasingly important element of higher education programmes and are a means of strengthening the link between higher education and the workplace.  They afford students the opportunity to apply their learning to a work environment, thereby enriching both the student and the workplace.  In particular, academic programmes that include an internship module provide students with an opportunity to put theory into practice, to acquire new skills and knowledge - personal and work related - and to enhance their employment potential on graduation.</p> <p>The importance of work based learning in higher education is reflected in the new systems performance framework that was published in December 2017.  The new framework that provides the strategic objectives for the higher education sector up to 2020 includes a high level target that all students will have the opportunity to undertake a work placement or a work-based project as part of their course by 2025.  The Higher Education Authority will work with the higher education institutions to ensure that this target is achieved.</p> <p>It is important to acknowledge that there is a cost to individual higher education institutions arising from the establishment of internship programmes, for example, students undertaking the internship element of their programme continue to have access to all institutional facilities.  Institutions are also expected to support their students during the internship element of their programme through formative and summative evaluation.  There are also costs associated with developing and sustaining links with employers.</p> <p>It is also important to recognise that higher education institutions are autonomous bodies and my Department has a limited role in the day-to-day running of the operational affairs of the institutions.  In particular, it is an issue for higher education institutions in the first instance to determine the level of fee applicable to particular programmes or to particular elements of academic programmes.  The student contribution, which currently stands at &euro;3,000, applies to all students who benefit from the Department's free fees initiative.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2284"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2284&amp;amp;pid=MaryMitchellOConnor&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The student contribution, which currently stands at &euro;3,000, applies to all students who benefit from the Department's free fees initiative.  The student contribution is paid by the Exchequer in respect of students who qualify under the Department's third level grant schemes.  Tax relief is also available for second and subsequent siblings to alleviate the cost for families for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education.</p><p>The Senator will be aware that we are reinvesting in higher education for the first time in a decade.  Ensuring a sustainable funding model for higher education is a key priority for me.  To this end, I secured funding of &euro;36.5 million in budget 2017.  This was complemented by additional funding of &euro;60 million for higher education in budget 2018.  This additional funding will allow for targeted initiatives in higher education, including in respect of skills programmes, performance and innovation funding, technological university development, and apprenticeship costs in the sector.  It will also allow for places to be provided for 2,100 and additional students in 2018.  This means we are investing approximately &euro;100 million more in higher education in 2018 by comparison with 2016.</p><p>To complement this work, I recently published an independent expert review of the current allocation model for funding higher education.  It provides a roadmap for transitioning towards a reformed funding model that is more transparent, that is consistent across higher education institutions, that incentivises actions in key strategic areas, such as research and STEM provision, and that supports improved accountability while also respecting international autonomy.  I will continue to work to provide a more sustainable funding model for the higher education sector in the years ahead while also recognising and respecting the autonomy of higher education institutions over key operational decisions.  Again, I thank the Senator for affording me the opportunity to respond on this matter.</p></speech>

They are also becoming increasingly more common.  When I was in third level, it was very rare for an internship year to be part of the normal course of study.  It is far more prevalent in today's society.</p> <p>The Minister mentioned that students have access to the facilities in the third level institution, such as the library, during their internship year.  While this is true, most of the students work for approximately 40 hours per week and will not be going back into the university to use the library.  They are very busy during their working week.  In reality, therefore, they do not access the services of the third level institution.  While I accept that the Minister has limited scope in regard to the fees charged by third level institutions, perhaps there is scope for her to encourage them to reflect on the fees they charge to the increasing number of students who are taking the internship option as part of their courses and perhaps reduce the fees nominally to reflect the fact that the students are not using the college facilities.</p></speech>

Internship is becoming increasingly important.  We will be seeing more of it and we will be encouraging it.  I would like the students to be able to use the library.  Certainly, I am not someone who would say that if one does not pay fees, one may not use the library.  Given the very nature of third level education, library facilities must be available to students.  Whether they use them is an issue for themselves.</p> <p>Higher education institutions are autonomous.  I will reflect on what the Senator said, however.  At present, I am making sure there is increased funding for higher education institutions so each student will have a better experience right through the continuum of higher education.</p></speech>

I believe it is his first time addressing a Commencement matter for me in this Chamber.  I want him to be generous and to act boldly with regard to the matter I raise.</p> <p>Like the majority of parents, I wanted a more progressive education for my children.  Accordingly, I was part of the parents group which established the successful Educate Together school at Griffith Barracks on South Circular Road, Dublin 8.  Obtaining the premises for the school was quite a battle.  That is why I am particularly passionate about the Canal Way Educate Together project.  I hope the Department will be more proactive than it was 18 years ago.</p> <p>When I was segregated across the road at the Mater Dei national school, now St. James's primary school, my brothers attended CBS James Street, which is now where the Canal Way Educate Together school is located.  I welcome the students, parents and the teachers from Canal Way school to the Visitors Gallery.  When I visited the school last week, I noted the atmosphere was about creativity, spontaneity, respect, co-operation and fun which was evident in every classroom.  It is the opposite to what my brothers put up with in the CBS.  However, this creativity and modern schooling is confined and constricted by the lack of space for expansion, the dire conditions of the building with poor heating, toilet facilities and opaque windows which the kids cannot see through and the lease.  The school was the first to be divested from Catholic patronage of religious orders under a previous Minister.  However, it was given a paltry ten-year lease in 2014.  The school's board of management was not consulted and had no input regarding its terms and conditions.  It is at the mercy of the Edmund Rice Schools Trust to do any building works, upgrading or expansion.  This is untenable.</p> <p>There are six years remaining on the lease.  How can the children, teachers, principal, parents and community function securely with such a short-term miserable lease?  This is causing chaos and anxiety for parents.  There is nowhere else to enrol their children.  Why should they have to go anywhere else?  My neighbour, for example, put her son's name on the school's waiting list four years ago when he was one month old.  However, he cannot be accommodated at the school this September.  I have been stopped on the streets and in shops and have received emails and phone calls on the subject.  It is a massive issue for Dublin 8, but one that is repeated across the country.</p> <p>The school is unique, offering a modern education system to nurture our children and our communities.  Will the Minister get the lease and security of tenure for this school?  In turn, this will allow growth and expansion of the school, which is in such high demand.  Will the Minister please just do it?</p></speech>

I know this is a valuable school, treasured within its community.  Canal Way Educate Together school is a co-educational school which opened in September 2013 in Harcourt Terrace.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Richard Bruton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=119"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=119&amp;amp;pid=RichardBruton&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Subsequently, in 2014, the school moved to a former primary school building in Basin Lane that was secured as part of Government policy on school divesting.  The school had 240 pupils enrolled at September 2017 and staffing of a principal, nine mainstream teachers and three resource posts.  The existing accommodation at Basin Lane consists of ten mainstream classrooms, which are sufficient to meet the school's current enrolment numbers.  To facilitate its development, the school has submitted an application to my Department for additional accommodation.</p><p>The Basin Lane building is subject to a ten-year and nine-month lease between the Edmund Rice Schools Trust and the Minister for Education and Skills, which, in turn, has been subleased by the Department to Educate Together, which is the patron body.  Any building works require consent of the Edmund Rice Schools Trust under the lease.  In that connection, my Department has been liaising with the Edmund Rice Schools Trust to secure its consent to the placement of temporary accommodation on the school site.  I am pleased to confirm that the Edmund Rice Schools Trust has agreed a licence agreement that will allow for the provision of an additional six mainstream classrooms and three resource rooms to the school.  An approval letter devolving authority for the delivery of the classrooms concerned has been issued by my Department to the school.  My Department will be in ongoing contact with the school to provide relevant assistance with this project.  I thank the Senator for raising the matter.  I can assure her that my Department will continue to liaise with the school regarding its accommodation needs.</p></speech>

It is not going to solve the problem.  Will the Minister visit the school?  I know he cannot visit every school in the country.  I understand his workload but this is the first one to be divested and I think it would send out a great message and follow on from Government policy to divest schools to communities and let communities run and have ownership of them.  I would like the Minister to visit the school and I invite him, as do the principal, parents and children.  Will he negotiate with the Edmund Rice Schools Trust to buy this school?  Is he in that negotiation space or are we just still talking about temporary accommodation?  I appreciate the nuances in divestment but the Minister needs to be bold.  We need to grab this and ensure that our children have the modern schooling they deserve so this country and the culture changes.  Again, it is all well and good but please omit the word "temporary".  It needs to be permanent security.</p></speech>

We try to avoid purchasing sites in many cases where we can secure leases on good terms.  Most of the properties we have are owned by patrons rather than the Department.  The Department builds or provides facilities with a lien to ensure those properties are put to educational use.  From an Exchequer point of view, that has been a satisfactory way to interact with patrons.  What the Senator is suggesting would require some reflection by the Department as to whether it ought to move from such arrangements to a different arrangement.  I do not have a fixed view on this.  I would say that in the short term, the Department is fully committed in terms of capital to meet what is now an estimated 20,000 additional places we must provide every year.  That does mean that we must be fairly careful with the use of capital.  Site acquisition is pretty much confined to areas where we must acquire a site for a new school where we have those commitments.  Site acquisition is adopted when it is necessary, not as a routine approach.  I am not closing my mind to that but what is important is that under the existing arrangement, we have permission to allow the school develop.  My Department will obviously be working with the school to ensure that its longer-term plans can be delivered in this way.  I cannot commit today to visiting any particular school but I will bear in mind the kind invitation issued by the principal.  When I get an opportunity to go out and about, as I try to do, I will certainly consider a visit to this school.</p></speech>

I am seeking an update on funding and plans for assisting organisations and lobby groups which support the Irish diaspora, along with a similar update about foreign aid programmes.  It is great to see the Minister of State back in the House.  I acknowledge his work and the work of the Government in this area and his deep personal interest in and commitment to the global Irish.  Brexit is posing many challenges for Ireland but I also believe it will present many opportunities for Ireland.  Until recently, as I have stated many times, an average of 26 daily meetings took place between Irish and UK officials in Europe.  This provided politicians and officials with a platform to nurture and develop friendships and trust.  We need to do more to ensure that this trust and these friendships can be protected and enhanced.  It is evident that the Government is committed to growing our global footprint for overseas staff.  I was very pleased to hear the Taoiseach's commitment at the end of last year to double Ireland's representation around the world, through its network of embassies and agencies, focusing on investment, tourism, culture and food.  As the Minister of State knows, Ireland has always punched well above its weight and Irish people have made huge contributions wherever they have travelled.  I believe that, as a country, we do not have a colonial or imperialist past.  Ireland is in a great place now, as an independent nation, to step up and take its place among the nations of the world and do what is good and lead by example.  I look forward to hearing what exactly the plans are for our diaspora, for our foreign NGOs, etc.</p></speech>

Through this important programme, the Government supports culturally sensitive front-line welfare services, targeted at the most vulnerable members of our overseas communities.  It also supports cultural, heritage, business and capital investment projects which benefit Irish communities abroad.  The current round of that particular emigrant support programme grant scheme is open for online applications until 16 February 2018.  We are also continuing our work to reduce the barriers faced by citizens returning to Ireland from abroad.  I commissioned an economic report on difficulties experienced by Irish people returning home which will soon be finalised and published.  This will be considered by the interdepartmental committee on the Irish abroad, which works to facilitate a whole-of-Government response to issues affecting Irish people abroad.  In addition, my Department has established an innovative new project to assist returning emigrant entrepreneurs, the back for business pilot programme, which is also successfully under way.</p> <p>The Government is demonstrating its continued commitment to achieving a solution for our undocumented citizens in the US by proactively engaging with the Irish immigration centres and continuing our political engagement through high-level visits which will continue up to and including the St. Patrick's Day visits and onwards after that.  The Coalition of Irish Immigration Centers, with the support of legal advice funded by the Department's emigrant support programme, has produced straightforward and accessible interpretation and guidance about the executive orders which has been made available through its own website and those of the embassy and consulates.  Our priority continues to be to support the most vulnerable members of our community abroad, with 70% of that emigrant support programme funding going to organisations which provide front-line welfare services.  Based on key themes discussed at the global Irish civic forum in May 2017, we are also seeking to encourage greater collaboration within Irish communities overseas.  We are committed to supporting diversity in the diaspora to best represent the range of Irish groups and organisations that exist at home and abroad, including those that have been under-represented historically.  The focus of this year's funding round is on collaborative projects which support intergenerational links and which reflect diversity and support new emigrants.</p> <p>The Government is strongly committed to Ireland's overseas development co-operation programme and its place at the heart of our foreign policy.  A Programme for a Partnership Government clearly articulates our commitment to the UN target of providing 0.7% of gross national income in official development assistance as economic conditions allow.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2253"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2253&amp;amp;pid=CiaranCannon&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The manifestation of that commitment has been the steady increase over each of the last three budgets in the funds allocated to official development assistance with just over &euro;770 million allocated in budget 2018.  Around 70% of official development assistance is channelled through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as Irish Aid with the remainder channelled through other Government Departments.  Our citizens can take pride in the achievement of Irish Aid which is helping to transform lives.  Ireland's response to humanitarian crises allows those in refugee circumstances to meet basic needs such as food and education.  Working with such organisations as Concern and Tr&oacute;caire, the EU, the UN and key partner countries in Africa, Ireland is helping to build resilient communities and societies and also helping to ensure other potential humanitarian crises are avoided.  Irish civil servants, drawing on the knowledge, contacts and expertise generated by the Irish Aid programme, were instrumental in brokering agreement of the sustainable development goals at the UN, a set of targets which are intended to improve the lives of everyone on our planet by 2030.  </p><p>In building and maintaining an effective development co-operation programme, my Department has developed a series of transparent criteria for funding.  There are two main civil society funding streams currently operating.  The first is a civil society programme grant, which is a performance-based multi-annual grant for organisations of a certain size.  It allows for flexibility and predictability in addressing the needs of poorer and marginalised people.  The second such funding stream is the annual civil society project fund, which allows Irish and selected international NGOs to apply for funding for projects up to three years in duration.  The 2018 funding round, which saw an increase in the potential size of grants awarded closed last month and applications are being assessed.</p><p>Looking forward, the improving economic circumstances open the prospect of increases in Irish official development assistance in future budgets.  To prepare for this, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, has indicated that Ireland's development co-operation policy should be revisited to take account of the current global context and to ensure Ireland's policies are ready for the development challenges of the decade ahead.  Development of this new policy will include a public consultation phase.  It will also reflect the work undertaken by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade and Defence which is currently reviewing the Irish Aid programme.  The new official development assistance policy should inform very ambitious but sustainable progress towards meeting that UN target for official development assistance.  </p></speech>

Everything should be put in place to provide the best possible assistance for returned emigrant entrepreneurs such as a back to business pilot programme.  Much funding has been spent.  We have gone up to 0.7% of gross national income in official development assistance.  We could work more closely with a lot of other organisations in a lot of other areas.  We have applied for observer status at the group of francophone nations.   They also work closely with countries in Africa.  Through the francophone group and the EU, we can make our money go further.  I know the Minister of State is looking at various opportunities and I appreciate the work being done.  I appreciate that sometimes Irish Aid can be forgotten about.  I want to highlight the great work the Minister of State, the Department and all the other Departments involved in Irish Aid are doing but the Irish overseas should be helped as well.  We need to take our place among the nations of the world.  We are an independent nation without any baggage and we can now be independent arbiters around the world.  We should not be afraid to take those steps.</p></speech>

The theme of Safer Internet Day 2018 is "Create, connect and share respect: a better Internet starts with you".  Not only do Internet platforms have a role in cultivating a safer space for users, but as individuals, politicians, teachers and parents, we have a role to play in raising awareness of the need for safety when using the Internet.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Catherine Ardagh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2473"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2473&amp;amp;pid=CatherineArdagh&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is a great campaign and encourages all of us to highlight the motto in an effort to create awareness and safety online, especially for our young people.

To date, 31 homes have been raided as part of an operation to crack down on child pornography and the raids have been carried out across 12 counties.  I hope that with the correct resources the Garda will be able to successfully prosecute many of these awful crimes and, in turn, these successful prosecutions will act as a serious deterrent for other perpetrators.  These, as we know, are not victimless crimes.</p><p>The third item I would like to raise is the community employment service for people aged 62 and over.  A review scheme was promised to be delivered this autumn on the support stream for participants aged 62 and over but the findings have yet to be published.

The Taoiseach was in this House last week.  I was delighted that he mentioned that the convention would be ratified by March and that there would be resolutions in both Houses in that regard.  I thank the Taoiseach for that.  The Taoiseach - the leader of our country - must ensure that the implementation of this convention is driven.  It is a matter for every Department, but it needs a ward boss.  It needs the leader of the State to make sure that its implementation is co-ordinated, efficient and effective and that we do not have the age-old problem of one part of Government not knowing what another part is doing.  That is the key to really clocking on with this.</p> <p>The Taoiseach made a statement on the future of Europe in the European Parliament a week or two before his visit to this House.  He underlined the historic and hopeful context of its creation after the Second World War.  He set out the issues and grave challenges of today as well as the importance of the EU to Ireland and of Ireland's commitment to the EU.  These are very significant statements.  He referred to the Balkans and central and eastern Europe.  He mentioned the role of the EU in supporting these areas and the importance of the Structural Funds specifically.  He also mentioned the great African continent and the support which it needs in this century.</p> <p>As we ratify, let us not forget to have solidarity with and to support these states and other eastern states such as Moldova that are on the edge of Russia.  We should not forget what I will describe as the concerns that Russia has about the states which border it and their interest in being part of the European democratic movement.  Let us keep what I will describe as our missionary instinct in our international concern.  Perhaps "missionary" is an awkward word these days.  As we plough on with the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, let us be awake to the people with disabilities in these states and their families.</p> <p>We are committed to the implementation of the sustainable development goals in respect of economic, environmental and social issues across the world.  That feeds into this agenda as well.  Ireland can get out and in front in respect of implementation of the convention for more than 600,000 people here and it can also be a shining light for people with disabilities and their families who are in much more unfortunate situations than we are.  I am often regarded as someone who is always giving out that not enough is done here, but I will put the following on the record.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Dolan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2479"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2479&amp;amp;pid=JohnDolan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I have been to other places and know what people experience daily.

Last week when he came to the House, the Taoiseach boasted about how efficient the Government was in publishing legislation.  He said we should have sight of a Bill at least two weeks before it was debated and that we should not accept a lower standard.  The Data Protection Bill will be debated on Thursday less than one week after it was published.  As per the high standards set by the Taoiseach, I ask that more time be given to consider the Bill, the consequences of which are deep and will be felt far and wide.  As a consequence, we need more time to examine it.  Will the Leader consider giving us more time to examine it in a meaningful way?</p> <p>Thousands of patients in chronic pain found have out in recent months that the Versatis patch is no longer available to them under the medical card or the drug refund scheme.  The decision by the HSE to withdraw the pain-killing patch is having a huge effect on chronic pain sufferers.  It means that a person who has money does not suffer pain, whereas the person who does not have it must use morphine patches, consider taking a drug that is not effective or remain in pain.  Patient-centred health care must include empathy and respect.  One man who is only off the patch for one week has seen a significant reduction in his quality of life.  Many users of the patch have been through serious illnesses and medical procedures.  Will those who no longer have access to the patch have to go back to pain management clinics?  Last week I referred to the confusion surrounding waiting list times at the pain management clinic in University Hospital Galway.  This is an example of the HSE attempting to save money, but it may end up clogging up services that are already under pressure.  I know of another patient in her early 30s who cannot move and is absolutely dependent on the patch.  She has been waiting since July 2016 for an appointment to attend the pain management clinic in Galway, but has been told that she will have to wait at least another 15 months.  On behalf of those patients who are receiving other similar long-term products from the HSE, I ask that they not be treated in such a disgraceful manner.  We need to have a full debate in the House on the patch and its impact on those in chronic pain.  The Leader might say the HSE is responsible, but the Minister for Health needs to intervene on humanitarian grounds.  There are thousands of such patients throughout the country who are in chronic pain caused by arthritis and other conditions.</p></speech>

As he will be with us for another month, it is a little premature to pay tribute to him.  It has been a pleasure to work with him in recent months, in particular, as a member of the Technical Group.  On my own behalf and that of my Labour Party colleagues, I thank him for working with us and look forward to continuing to work with him in the next few weeks.</p> <p>I agree with Senator Michael McDowell on the report on the Israeli Prime Minister which I, too, was concerned to see.  I thought it was an important debate last week and was delighted to take part in it.  I commend Senators Frances Black and David Norris and their colleagues for proposing the Bill and the way in which the debate was conducted.  It was sensible to withdraw the Bill in order to engage in further consultation on it.</p> <p>I thank the Leader for continuing today the debate on foreign affairs which we had to postpone from last week.  I am sorry to hear that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney, will not be present, but I look forward to participating in the debate.  I thank all those who attended the screening of "Syria - The Impossible Revolution" which I was happy to host earlier today.  The film which is supported by the Irish Syria Solidarity Movement was made by Ms Anne Daly and Mr. Ronan Tynan.  It is a powerful documentary about the origins of the Syrian revolution and the terrible tragedies that have befallen the Syrian people in recent years.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->For anyone who would like to see it, I will be sending a link.</p><p>Finally, I wish to note that today marks an important anniversary.  It is the 100th anniversary of the passage of the Representation of the People Act 1918, which gave women the right to vote, albeit a somewhat limited right to vote.  For the first time, it allowed women over 30 to vote in Ireland and Britain.  It paved the way for the 1918 general election in which Constance Markievicz was elected as the first woman Member of Parliament and Teachta D&aacute;la.  Today, we remember all of the many women and men who campaigned on women's suffrage over many years, including women like Isabella Tod, the Haslams, Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington and, of course, Constance Markievicz.</p><p>I am delighted to be chairing the V&oacute;t&aacute;il 100 programme and to be wearing the badge.  The Taoiseach is wearing the same badge in the other Chamber today.  The badge is a replica of the Irish Women&rsquo;s Franchise League badge and all Members of the Oireachtas have received one to mark this important centenary.  Over 2018 we will have many different events.  Our committee is made up of Deputies and Senators on a cross-party basis.  Senators Conway-Walsh, Higgins and McFadden are committee members from this House.  We will have a series of events in the Seanad Chamber in particular.  It is very much a Seanad-led series of events.  I thank the Leader for agreeing to have a debate on the centenary in the House on the week of International Women's Day.  There will be a debate in the D&aacute;il this evening at 6 p.m. on the anniversary on the Representation of the People Act.  We look forward to welcoming young people into the Chamber from transition year on 17 April for the D&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht na n&Oacute;g public speaking competition to mark the centenary.  We look forward to many other events over the year as well.  I thank colleagues for their support.  I wish to mark how much has been done 100 years on but how much still remains to be done too, with women comprising only 22% of the D&aacute;il and only 30% of the Seanad.</p></speech>

The number of people using one drug, Lyrica, has gone up from 54,981 to 652,013.  That is more than a 1,086% increase.  Use of another drug, OxyContin, an opiate, has gone up from 47,262 to 122,000.  That is a 159% increase.  Use of Lexapro has gone up by 232% from 198,000 to 631,000 people.</p><p>It seems there has been an extraordinary increase in the prescribing of drugs across the board during the past ten years.  This raises serious issues.  Is it causing, and will it cause, problems in our health care service?  What can we do to work with our general practitioners and medical care professionals in order that people are aware of the consequences of over-use of drugs and medication?  That is something we need to have a serious debate on.  It is a costly issue.</p><p>Tomorrow, the Joint Committee on Health will deal with a report on the availability of orphan drugs.  As people are aware, orphan drugs are extremely expensive because they are used only by a small group of people.  Here, many drugs are being used up at an extraordinary cost to the State.  Simultaneously, we cannot afford to buy drugs for people who really need them.  I am not saying that people who are using these drugs do not require them, but there must be a question mark over the extent of the usage and of the prescribing.  The matter is worthy of a debate on what is the best way forward to deal with this issue from a health care point of view.  It would be appropriate for the Minister to come before the House to discuss the matter.  I appeal to the Leader to give serious consideration to my request.</p></speech>

At the end of last year, 2017, some 40,000 people were on outpatient lists for eye care procedures.  That figure was up from 38,823 in 2016.  More than 20% of cases on the waiting list relate to cataract surgery appointments.  In some cases people are waiting up to four years in different parts of the country to have this addressed.  I imagine Senators will agree that this is both cruel and heartless and that something needs to be done about it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Robbie Gallagher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2471"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I would like to commend and compliment the people in Sligo on the initiative they have undertaken.  It is something we could roll out throughout the country.  There was a joint approach by the public and private sectors to try to address the issue of waiting lists.  It is called the Sligo post-cataract scheme.  It is a joint venture between the ophthalmologist in the community and the ophthalmologist in the hospital setting.  It has been very successful and has treated up to 20,000 people a year in the north-west region.  We can learn from it and it is something we should roll out throughout the country, as I said.</p><p>Not only is it a good idea, it also saves the taxpayer money.  It is estimated that &euro;32 million a year can be saved, as well as a 50% reduction in the number of people waiting for appointments and the time involved.  It has proven to be very successful at getting people off waiting lists.  I would be surprised if the Minister for Health is not already aware of this system, but I ask the Leader to bring it to his to attention so it can be rolled out throughout the country and people will not have to wait years for cataract operation and will instead be dealt with in a much speedier fashion.</p></speech>

There is a statue of Henry Grattan in Westminster.  If we change the <i>status quo</i>, we will remove something of a history with which we are not comfortable.

I hope the Leader will ensure that we have a debate with the Minister in the near future, as it has been promised for many months.</p> <p>I welcome the comments on the Control of Economic Activities (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018 that we put forward last week.  The urgent need for action was underscored by the fact that just this weekend, a children's school in East Jerusalem funded by Irish Aid was demolished by the Israel Defence Forces.  This demonstrates why we need to move forward and act on this.</p> <p>I was sorry not to be present for the full debate last Thursday, as I was a part of the V&oacute;t&aacute;il 100 symposium.  However, I was here for the conclusion and I read the proceedings with interest.  In that debate, my colleague, Senator Lynn Ruane, spoke about personal and collective responsibility, and how we, as legislators, need to address the reinforcing of inequality by society.  The links between low education and imprisonment reported on in today's newspapers underscores that point.  Senator Ruane asked the Taoiseach to deliver a republic of equal outcomes with far greater equality of wealth and income, reducing the material, social and cultural inequalities that exist between us in society.</p> <p>The Taoiseach responded by saying he believed that equality of outcome meant that everyone was the same with no ambition; it meant levelling downwards, the model of the Soviet Union or Cambodia.  In fairness to the Taoiseach, he also acknowledged that perhaps he misunderstood.  He did indeed fail to understand.  That is both disappointing and worrying.  Greater equality of incomes and outcomes is not some abstract communist notion.  It is what is advocated by best international research, including that of the International Monetary Fund, IMF, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD.  It is what we have signed up to deliver under the detailed targets of the sustainable development goals, which Ireland helped to negotiate.  For example, goal 10.3 is a commitment to ensure equal opportunity and reduce inequalities of outcome.  It will be outcomes that will be the test of Ireland's implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</p> <p>Ireland's public service duty and commitment to equality budgeting, measures I have praised in the past, require the delivery of more equal outcomes.  I believe that some members of Government understand that.  It is important that the Taoiseach does too.  His job does not ribbon-cutting at the starting blocks on some individualised race for success or survival.  It is bringing society forward together, and bringing society together in deeper dialogue.  That is something we value in the Seanad-----</p></speech>

This is a report that was published in November 2016, which dumbs down the economic need for vital transport infrastructure, particularly rail, in the west and north-west regions.  It is very telling that this report should suddenly resurrect itself and become of interest at a very critical time, when we are putting together a ten-year national capital plan, when we will single out infrastructure projects, such as rail lines and roads, that need investment.  It is a red herring.  The Department I see benefitting most from report being publicised, and thereby deflecting attention from the need in the west and north-west, is the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michelle Mulherin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If we were relying on the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, we would not have a train, a bus or an aeroplane entering the west or the north west.

He has been the most hard-working, decent, committed Member of the Seanad and we will certainly miss him.</p> <p>I support very much what Senator Michelle Mulherin said.  This morning I listened on the wireless to the reports.  In the worst case scenario we are presented with the situation where there would only be rail connections between Dublin and Limerick, Dublin and Cork and Dublin and Belfast - three railway lines for the whole of Ireland.  That is dreadful.  I call for a debate not just on transport services in the west but also on the planning and development ideas the Government has because it looks as if Sligo is to be left out.  That means there would be no town included north of the Dublin-Galway axis.  Sligo was originally nominated as a gateway town, but there has been no investment in it.  It is all very well to nominate a place as a gateway town and then do nothing at all about it.  Sligo may only have a population of 20,000, but it has an enormous hinterland which includes counties Roscommon, Leitrim and others.  It is extremely important, if we are committed to keeping people in rural Ireland and the provinces and not having just one enormous conurbation on the east coast, that we do something.  This House should have a debate to urge the Government to live up to its commitment to the west.</p></speech>

To say the least, that is an horrific headline.  The railway line is the lifeblood of tourism in towns such as Roscommon, Boyle, Carrick-on-Shannon, Westport, Ballina, Sligo, Longford and Mullingar.  There is no doubt that they would love to cut out all of those towns.  We must ensure the required investment is made.  I remind the House that in 1997 there was a very serious rail accident outside the village of Knockcroghery.  The Minister at the time was Mary O'Rourke.  The advice from the safety board was that the line to Westport and possibly the one to Galway be closed, but she resisted and, with the help of her ministerial colleagues, Charlie McCreevy and Bertie Ahern, an investment of &euro;1 billion was made over a three-year period which secured those lines which are the lifeblood of towns such as Roscommon and Westport, to which tourists flock.  The standard of the railway lines is now very high and free WiFi is available on trains.  It is a luxurious way to travel.  It takes only two hours to travel by train from Roscommon to Dublin.  I compliment all of the staff, including train drivers, who are making the service work well.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Terry Leyden:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=636"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=636&amp;amp;pid=TerryLeyden&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->History nearly repeats itself.  In the period 1997 to 2002, Ms Mary O'Rourke was the Minister.  Coming from Athlone, in the heart of the midlands, she had the determination and commitment to ensure sufficient investment.  That was the crucial point.  Now the service is running very well indeed.  The service is excellent, including in towns such as Roscommon.  There is a train at 6.30 a.m., 8.30 a.m. and 11.05 a.m. and they return three times during the day.  Whatever about national planning frameworks, if a railway system is not maintained there will be no national framework.

Such was the scare that I felt the need to call an ambulance.  The ambulance came, collected me and brought me to the local accident and emergency unit within 25 minutes.  Within two hours, I was seen by a cardiac specialist.  Within eight hours I was seen by a consultant cardiologist, and within a couple of hours thereafter I had an angiogram and was back in my bed.  While I lay in my bed I was considering trauma centres.</p> <p>This brings me on to Senator Mulherin's point on the forgotten west.  If I were in Belmullet or some other such place and had a similar scare, how long would it be before an ambulance would get to me?  How long would it be before I would get to see a consultant?  How long would it be before I would have the confidence, on having an angiogram, to know all was well?  It certainly would not happen in a short space of time.</p> <p>That led me to think about two trauma centres, in Dublin and Cork.  I do not want a debate on trauma centres because there is nobody here qualified to debate the clinicians' view of trauma centres but I do want a debate on how we will support the trauma centres with helicopters to get patients to them within a specific period.  They say an hour is the magic time.  Therefore, we need to hear that there will be four regional helicopters to service the needs of people who find themselves in traumatic circumstances.  I would like the Minister to come to the House at his leisure to discuss how we will do that.  God knows where we will get the money to do it.</p></speech>

Some 25,000 people are using the patch.  Owing to the cost, it is no longer available under the medical card and drug refund schemes.  A lady I know went into a pharmacy to buy a packet of the patches because they were no longer available on the medical card and they cost &euro;390 for a supply for one month.  That is unreal, yet if one goes to Spain one can buy the same patches for &euro;120.  Therefore, there needs to be accountability.</p></speech>

Unregulated sulky racing is dangerous and has already led to loss of life.  It is a traditional sport which should have a traditional home and be banned from our highways and byways.  There is no appetite for sulky racing on public roads.  Accordingly, it needs to be regulated.  I received hundreds of calls over the past several weeks on this issue.  When I rang the local authority and the Garda, I was informed it is not regulated.  The Minister needs to introduce regulations.  We cannot afford to lose another life on the roads because of sulky car racing.</p></speech>

The HSE seems to be proceeding with a policy approach to this area without listening to the key stakeholders, namely, the parents of the children with complex medical care needs.  It is a sensible motion and I hope the Government will accept it.  Otherwise, we will end up with bureaucrats in the HSE dictating policy without listening to the key stakeholders.  That is wrong.  A great lady in Donegal, Ms Gina Grant, heads up the Our Children's Voice organisation which gives a voice to helpless children.  They are not being listened to at a national level by the HSE.  This has to change, which is the objective of the motion in question.  I am glad to second the amendment to the Order of Business to have the motion taken today.  I commend Senator Devine on proposing it.  Those kids cannot speak but their parents deserve to be heard by the policymakers in the HSE.</p></speech>

We have had an awful lot of debate about the national planning framework in terms of equal distribution across the country.  I would particularly like to see an emphasis on the national maritime spatial plan, which is being worked on by the Department.  I am particularly interested in hearing about an all-island dimension to this particular spatial strategy that would cover the environment, fisheries, tourism, transport, offshore renewable energy and oil and gas.  There is much controversy about oil and gas offshore but we need to address these issues in terms of a particular policy so we know where we are going.  Climate change and related impacts are really important parts of this strategy.  Our marine heritage and our marine biodiversity and environment are other issues.</p><p>I am conscious that this document is well advanced within the Department.  There has been very little public discussion of it considering we are an island.  I am particularly keen that we have an all-island dimension.  What I would suggest is that at some time, the appropriate Minister with responsibility for marine affairs would come to the House for a debate on this really important legislation that will come before the Houses.</p></speech>

The Deputy is very welcome.  It is good to see him here with a group.</p> <p>Mar a d&uacute;irt an Seanad&oacute;ir McDowell, beidh an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Clochartaigh ag &eacute;ir&iacute; as a phost mar Sheanad&oacute;ir i gceann c&uacute;pla seachtain.

Go n-&eacute;ir&iacute; leis sa phost nua i TG4.</p> <p>I join with all Members of the House who have spoken and all who have not.  We will probably pay tribute in time to Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh on his impending departure from the House.  As Senator McDowell rightly said, he was a very courageous man but also a very pleasant and courteous man with whom one could do business.  He had a different point of view to many of us in the House on many occasions but at all times, he rose above that.  I thank him for his service to the people of Connemara and the people he represented in this House but also for his friendly banter.  I wish him well in his new position with TG4.  I am sure that in time, we will be able to pay tribute to Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh but he is not dead.  He is very much alive.  He has a new career ahead of him and I wish him well.</p> <p>Senator Ardagh began by raising the issue of Safer Internet Day.  I would be happy to have a debate on that in the coming weeks.  All of us in the House share the Senator's views regarding the issue of a digital strategy around the age of usage of a mobile phone, the appointment of a digital safety commissioner and the age of consent.  It is important that as part of Internet Safety Day, the Minister for Education and Skills today announced the allocation of an investment of &euro;30 million in ICT equipment for schools but, significantly, he also launched a very important programme about being in control, which is a resource for schools and parents.  The grant will allow for the integration of digital technology in teaching.  International research has shown that it is through qualified professional teachers, in addition to the knowledge of parents, that we influence and help shape minds.  As Senator Ardagh rightly said, it is about ensuring our children are safe and are kept safe online.  We must all address this issue and keep it to the forefront of everything we do.  </p> <p>I also join with Senator Ardagh in congratulating An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for Operation Ketch on Monday morning.  It sent a very powerful signal and, hopefully, it will lead to arrests.  I had better be careful about what I say because I do not want to put anything in the case but it is certainly is an operation we should all support and it is certainly one that I know has international co-operation.  I commend An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for that.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Senator Ardagh spoke about the community employment scheme for people over the age of 62.  I agree with her that the matter has been raised in the House before.  It is important to allow people of an age group to be able to continue to make a contribution and to be involved in this case in community employment in our communities.  I would be happy to have that debate.</p><p>Senator McDowell raised the issue of the two impending by-elections.  They are independent of each other in my opinion too.  I am not a learned expert like Senator McDowell but I have read the article and one is an inside and the other is an outside nomination.  I look forward to having the by-elections held whenever the writs are moved and the groups have sent their documentation to the appropriate personnel.</p><p>I join with Senators McDowell, Higgins, Craughwell and Bacik on the issue of the Israeli Prime Minister calling in our ambassador last week.  I am very much of the view that we, as Members of a Parliament, the Houses of the Oireachtas in this case, are quite able to do our own business, to have freedom of mind, opinion, thought and how we exercise our democratic decisions here.</p></speech>

Lobbying happens every day of the week.  Lobbying happens with amendments to Bills, including lobbyists writing amendments to Bills, writing Bills for people, coming in and using the audiovisual room under the guise of different categories of making statements on various issues.  There were lobbyists with Senator Gavan last week who spoke about the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill, masquerading around the House here as if they knew everything about certain issues.  Lobbying is happening.  That is why we have registered lobbying.</p></speech>

I have spoken with the Department of the Taoiseach about the matter.  I think it has to be taken and led by Government.  The Senator knows my views on that.  I have never recoiled from those views here.  It is an important challenge, as the Senator said, with regard to the sustainable development goals and I would be happy to have that debate in the House on the different countries the Senator named.

I know where the Senator is coming from.  We will have that debate in the coming weeks.</p> <p>Senator Conway-Walsh raised the issue of the schedule.  I thought we might have agreed the schedule at the group meeting on Wednesday.  I will not adjourn the Bill this week.  I propose that we will not adjourn it on Thursday when it comes in but allow it to roll over to give time to people who feel they need more time to analyse it and study it.  It is only Second Stage so I would be happy to do that with the House's permission.</p> <p>Senators Murnane O'Connor and Conway-Walsh raised the issue of the chronic pain drug, Versatis.  I have not got the information about it but, to be helpful to Members, they may get an answer more quickly if they submit a Commencement matter for the Minister to address.  I am not familiar with the issue which has not been raised with me but I would be happy to meet the Senators about the matter.</p> <p>I commend Senator Bacik for her work on V&oacute;t&aacute;il 100.  I know that she participated in a commemorative event last Sunday, which I think was in Glasnevin Cemetery.  I am sorry to have missed her briefing on Syria this morning.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is important that we recognise and remember not only the journey but its beginning in 1918, what it meant, the gargantuan challenge it was then and how it was overcome.  We must also remember the women and gentlemen the Senator mentioned, in particular Countess Markievicz, Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington and others who come to mind.  It was a huge struggle then.  The sacrifice and courage of those women deserves to be remembered today.  V&oacute;t&aacute;il100 is not about a badge.  It is important we remember and commemorate.  I look forward to having that debate on International Women's Day.  It is about ensuring the voices of all people are heard as part of democracy around the world and in our country.  Looking at the statistics on the role of women in politics - the IPU is meeting this week - the figure is quite low, which poses a question.  We are lucky, despite what some people might think, to have very formidable and strong women in this House.  We may disagree on ideological grounds but it is important that we contribute to the development of democracy.  I salute the work that has been done and commend all Members, in particular Senator Bacik, who is leading V&oacute;t&aacute;il100.  We will have that debate.  It was our intention to have the debate but the D&aacute;il jumped ahead of us.  We agreed at the leaders' meeting to have it as part of International Women's Day.  That is why we are behind the D&aacute;il.</p><p>Senator Burke raised the issue of the overprescribing of a number of drugs.  The Senator, in his very pertinent contribution, spoke about the issue of the extent of usage and prescribing.  That is what we need the debate to be centred on.  It is a very important debate to have.</p><p>Senator Gallagher raised the very important issue of the waiting times for cataract operations.  We opened a new theatre in the east and the national eye strategy has been unveiled by the Minister.  There is an issue around waiting times and I would be happy to have a debate with the Minister on that.</p><p>I join Senator Lawless in paying tribute to the late John Mahoney, with whom we all became familiar through "Frasier".  There is a wonderful clip of the father and son in "Frasier", which I heard this morning, where they were both in a bit of a quandary.  It is worth playing back again to show the depth of the character and the role he played in "Frasier".  As Senator Lawless said, he was a person who loved Ireland and was very proud of Ireland.  Senator Lawless referred to Chicago and Galway.</p><p>Senator Feighan raised the issue of the statue of Prince Albert.  The issue is before the Committee on Public Petitions tomorrow.  I do not want to pre-empt the committee's decision but it is fair to say Prince Albert will not be going too far, if anywhere at all.</p><p>Senator Devine raised the very important issue of children's complex needs.  The Minister spoke to the Senator in the House last week.  I had emailed him on the Senator's behalf after the Senator raised the issue last week.  The Minister has offered to meet the Senator and other Members of the House and I hope the Senator will take him up on that offer.  It is important the Senator does not use it as a political football, and I am not saying she is.  It is about ensuring the voices of people are heard.  I hope the Senator will meet the Minister and accept his invitation.</p><p>Senator Devine received a very comprehensive reply from the Department of Health on the matter.  I want to make the House aware of a number of points in that letter, if people are not aware of them, before we vote on the Order of Business.  The Minister said, "My officials have liaised with the HSE on this issue and have sought to identify an approach that will ensure that parents are afforded the best opportunity to contribute to the work underway by the HSE to enhance the delivery of paediatric homecare in the community."  Second, he says "the Steering Group established by the HSE is a clinical group and addresses issues relating to the business process, which is commercially sensitive".  His letter also refers to the fact that to provide parents with an opportunity to be involved, there would be an establishment of a parental reference group.  He said, "This new Group would provide parents with the appropriate forum in which they can identify and discuss ideas of concern or examples of best practice in relation to the provision of paediatric homecare packages."<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is a fairly accommodating decision by the HSE.  However, as I said last week, I will not divide the House on the matter and I will accept the motion.  It is important that the Minister's response be provided because it was a comprehensive and full response.  The Senator asked for no debate last week on the matter, but to be fair to the Minister, following the Senator's representations last week I liaised with the Department and the Minister.  I know the Senator also did that last week here.  The Minister and the HSE have made some movement on the basis of last week's interjections.  I wanted to put that on the record of the House to be clear.  I will not divide the House on a very important matter and I will accept the amendment.</p></speech>

I have no control over the Minister's diary.  When I became aware of it, I deliberately informed the House at the beginning of the Order of Business that the Minister could not be here because I know it is an important issue for Members of the House.  I did not have to do so.  I give the Senator a commitment that we will in the immediate future have further debates with the T&aacute;naiste on foreign affairs.  I know where she is coming from.  I give her that commitment.</p> <p>To be fair, it is an important matter raised by the Senator and other Members of the House.  I apologise that the Minister cannot be here, but I do not have control over his diary.  I am told there are issues requiring his attendance and that is why he cannot be here.  However, the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, will be a very fine replacement.  He is a Minister of State in the Department on his own merit.  I will be happy to have the issue the Senator raised on the ongoing debate on foreign affairs dealt with immediately.</p> <p>I will not go back over the Taoiseach's remarks last week because we could have a political debate on that until the end of time.  To be fair, Senator Higgins has her view on the Taoiseach's comments.  Those of us who heard what the Taoiseach said have a different view.  We will agree to park that.  We will invite him back in again and we will have that discussion.  In my contribution I said I thought Senator Ruane made a fine contribution on the issue.  It is something we need to discuss in generic terms in terms of political response to how we handle issues.</p> <p>Senators Mulherin, Norris and Leyden all skirted and touched on the issue of Irish Rail, rural sustainability and the national planning framework, if I can use those terms all together.  Senator Mulherin is right in this.  The headline today was from a 2016 report.</p></speech>

The headline is about creating sensation.  I will have the Minister, Deputy Ross, come to the House because it is about ensuring that we have good-quality public transport, that we have sustainable transport links but that we have transport links for rural areas.  I am not afraid to say that we have a dispersed population, but we cannot have all the growth in Dublin.  Last week the Taoiseach made the point in this House that parts of Dublin are beyond the M50, which was what Senator Murnane O'Connor's contribution was about.  We must go beyond Naas and have that contribution, and go east and west as well.  I am not aware of plans to close any railway line.  I say to Senator Leyden that the report today has been in the public domain for quite some time.  It was not about a freedom of information request.  As I said, it was a 2016 report.</p> <p>Between 2008 and 2016 the taxpayer has made &euro;5 billion available to the three CI&Eacute; companies through its PSO and capital investment programme.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann received &euro;3.7 billion, which is 75% of that total Exchequer funding.  The issue of rail is intrinsically linked to where people live, work and wish to travel.  What we must do is to ensure that we create more jobs in rural Ireland.  This is at the very core of the Government's national planning framework.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I agree with what the Taoiseach said last week.  Can we stop talking ourselves down and promote positivity instead?  Senator Leyden referred to successes in many towns in rural Ireland.  Consider the Ludgate Hub in Skibbereen, for example.  Let us be positive.  If we want to sell Ireland, let us not be negative.  The debate is necessary but must be balanced.

This framework provides the goals and the priority area of focus for the Government's global engagement to safeguard a secure and prosperous future for the Irish people and make a distinctive and principled contribution to the collective international effort to build a better world.</p> <p>My understanding is this House would like an update on broader foreign policy matters and not just work under way regarding Brexit.  Suffice it to say that today Brexit remains front and centre of the efforts of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and all of the Government.  This work will continue and intensify into 2018.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2253"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2253&amp;amp;pid=CiaranCannon&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There was a huge collective effort to achieve our goals in phase 1 of the negotiations, for which we received unflinching support from our fellow EU member states and the institutions.  Work has begun on ensuring these achievements will be translated into the withdrawal Bill that is to be negotiated by October. </p><p>Attention is shifting to the shape of the future EU-UK relationship.  We have been clear that we wish to see the closest possible trading relationship, one which will sustain the &euro;65 billion worth of trade across the Irish Sea each year and the 200,000 jobs in Ireland that depend on same. </p><p>It would be one thing if the frequency and pace of international events moderated in response to Brexit, but, unfortunately, as Senators know, we enjoy no such luxury.  This means that we cannot afford, even for one day, to take our eyes off fast-moving developments.  This, in turn, requires continuing and renewed investment in global governance, with a strong United Nations as the bedrock of the international rules based order.  This investment is all the more important in the face of the multiple challenges that confront the multilateral system.  Our engagement in the development of the common foreign and security policy of the European Union is a key vehicle in pursuing this core objective.  </p><p>The European Union's support for a global order, based on international law, which ensures human rights and sustainable development has been reaffirmed in its 2016 global strategy which commits it to promoting peace, prosperity, democracy and the rule of law.  The aim is to improve the quality of life and security of peoples threatened or afflicted by conflict.  In turn, this will help to prevent or mitigate the negative effects for our own citizens of insecurity and conflict elsewhere.  Ireland co-operates closely with its EU partners in protecting citizens through the justice and home affairs framework.  As well as dealing with, as we must, the immediate symptoms and manifestations of conflict through necessary security measures, a medium to longer term strategy to address the root causes is required and being formulated.  Action through the common foreign and security policy plays a complementary role in addressing the underlying drivers of threats such as terrorism which have their source in instability in the European Union's neighbouring regions.  A range of factors are in play, among which are conflict and societal fragility, as well as poverty and underdevelopment.  Continuing engagement in supporting peace and state building, security sector reform and the promotion of the rule of law are key to addressing the causes of conflict and building stable and resilient societies.  </p><p>With our partners, we are developing an integrated approach to marshal more coherently the full range of instruments available to the European Union, including diplomatic contacts, economic development, trade, capacity building and peace support measures.  This entails a mix of actions in the civilian and military spheres.  The significant majority of operations under the common security and defence policy have been civilian in character and tasked with support for the rule of law, improving governance and guiding security sector reform.  Strengthening the European Union's ability to provide these supports is a major ongoing priority.  Sadly, there are circumstances where it is necessary to have the military capacity to manage crises, create space for negotiated political solutions and protect civilians.  The EU treaties confer on the European Union a mission to preserve peace, prevent conflicts and strengthen international security, in accordance with the United Nations charter.  The tasks that may be undertaken in pursuit of these objectives cover the full spectrum of conflict cycle, including conflict prevention and peacekeeping; crisis management and peacemaking; post-conflict stabilisation; joint disarmament operations; humanitarian and rescue; and military advice and assistance.  </p><p>The European Union has no defence capabilities of its own.  It relies on member states to provide the civilian and military assets to undertake these tasks.  Considerable difficulties have been experienced in sourcing the necessary range of capabilities for EU peace support operations.  It is recognised that there is a need for greater co-operation between member states in generating the requisite assets.  The Permanent Structured Cooperation arrangement, PESCO, is a mechanism aimed at addressing this need.  It enables countries to come together voluntarily on a project by project basis to jointly develop military crisis management capabilities in support of EU common security and defence policy operations.  PESCO will enhance the European Union's capacity to engage in peacekeeping and crisis management operations.</p><p>As the House will be aware, Ireland has actively engaged in the shaping of the common security and defence policy from its inception to equip the European Union to act effectively as an international peace provider in support of the multilateral order and the United Nations.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2253"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2253&amp;amp;pid=CiaranCannon&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Consistent with this, we have been one of the main contributors to common security and defence policy, CSDP, missions both civilian and military.  Our Defence Forces are currently serving in three of the EU's six military CSDP operations in Mali, Bosnia-Herzegovina and in the Mediterranean.  My Department supports the deployment of some 14 experts to nine civilian CSDP missions in eight countries which promote respect for the rule of law, human rights compliance and gender sensitivity.  Additionally, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na contributes a further five personnel to the EU mission in Kosovo.</p><p>Permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, is provided for in the Treaty on European Union which was approved by the Irish people by referendum in October 2009.  Some 25 EU member states, including Ireland, are participating.  Austria, Cyprus, Finland and Sweden which, like Ireland, are not members of any military alliance are also participating in PESCO.  Ireland&rsquo;s participation in PESCO will enhance the Defence Forces&rsquo; capabilities for a wide range of United Nations-mandated missions where they must be able to work with contingents from other countries.  It allows the men and women of our Defence Forces to gain access to the latest equipment and training, which enhances their ability to participate safely and effectively in challenging peacekeeping missions.  Accordingly, I believe Ireland&rsquo;s participation in PESCO is in our interests and consistent with our foreign policy and values.  It will also enable us to continue to influence development of the CSDP.</p><p>Participation in PESCO in no way diminishes or undermines Ireland&rsquo;s policy of military neutrality.  PESCO is a vehicle for developing capabilities required for peace support.  However, deployment of Irish contingents on peacekeeping missions will continue to be governed by the triple lock mechanism.  Our military neutrality has helped us to develop a distinctive and independent voice on the maintenance of international peace and security.  I assure the House that this Government upholds and will continue to uphold this longstanding and publicly valued policy.</p><p>The deployments of forces by the EU have all been UN-mandated or supported.  The UN increasingly relies on regional security providers such as the EU to run peacekeeping and other peace stabilisation operations.  This is why PESCO has been warmly welcomed by the UN Under-Secretary General for Peacekeeping as potentially offering additional capabilities for UN-mandated missions.  Support for and engagement with the UN of course remains a cornerstone of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy.  Ireland has a distinguished peacekeeping record with not a year having passed since 1958 without Irish men or women having been engaged in UN peace support operations.</p><p>It is, therefore, right that, at appropriate intervals, Ireland seeks to be part of the body that shapes the policy and practices that our troops carry out - the UN Security Council.  We have a responsibility to participate fully in the UN&rsquo;s work and to champion its role, particularly at this time of global instability and challenge to the rules based international order.  These considerations inform Ireland&rsquo;s candidature for election to the Security Council in June 2020.  A seat on the council would strengthen our voice and influence on the global stage.  It is a platform to amplify our values and key foreign policy priorities, including those on sustainable development, human rights, disarmament, rule of law and the peaceful resolution of disputes.  Ireland can be, as it has been before, an independent but authoritative voice on the major political and security issues impacting our world.</p><p>Ireland continues to play a leadership role on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, issues which are of high priority for my Department and, I know, for many members of this House.  Last autumn the T&aacute;naiste signed, on behalf of Ireland, the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which was adopted by 122 states following negotiations mandated by a UN General Assembly resolution put forward by Ireland and five other countries.  This treaty, when it enters into force, will implement the disarmament provisions of the non-proliferation treaty.  We also continue our work on conventional weapons, remaining fully engaged in implementation of the landmine and cluster munitions conventions and working with partners to promote universal ratification of the Arms Trade Treaty.</p><p>On human rights, we have pioneered an initiative to protect the space for freedom of expression for civil society which is coming under increasing pressure in many parts of the world.  We continue to support human rights defenders and we will further strengthen our engagement on gender equality and women&rsquo;s empowerment when we chair the bureau of the Commission on the Status of Women in 2018 and 2019.  Last November, the T&aacute;naiste launched Ireland&rsquo;s national plan to implement the UN guiding principles on business and human rights.</p><p>Our additional foreign policy priorities include the EU and Ireland's relations with Africa and the Middle East peace process.</p></speech>
