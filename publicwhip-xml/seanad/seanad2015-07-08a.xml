I will share time with Senator David Norris who has already raised the issue in the House.  I understand the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, is attending a meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade and accept totally that he is unable to be present.  I, therefore, welcome the Minister of State with special responsibility for European affairs who is very involved in the region.  The matter has been highlighted by a young councillor, Mr. Patrick Costello, who represents the Rathgar-Rathmines ward at Dublin City Council.  I compliment him on raising it and bringing it to the attention of the Members of this House and others.  He was in Palestine last year and has made a submission to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade in which he has outlined his concerns about the situation in Palestine.</p> <p>We are well aware of the issues in the village of Susiya.  The matter was raised comprehensively by Senator David Norris recently.  To be quite frank, the Israeli Government has decided to demolish this Palestinian village.  It is a very serious issue which will affect the lives of people in the area.  There has been an absolute contravention of every rule and regulation governing international arrangements, but this is only part of what is happening in Israel in dealing with the Palestinian issue.  We know about the increase in the number of houses constructed by the Israelis.  However, the eyes of the world have been taken off what is happening in the region because of the threat posed by ISIS and other issues around the world.  Somehow it is below radar, which is why the Israelis are conducting themselves in a most offensive manner towards Palestinians, as they did in the past.  All we in this House are seeking - it has been the policy of this and previous Governments - is a two-state solution.  </p> <p>We have an ambassador in Tel Aviv.  Will the Minister of State contact the ambassador and Israeli officials?  Will he contact his opposite number in the Israeli Government and beg them not to proceed with this provocative action against Susiya which is very special to the people of the region?  </p> <p>I again compliment Senator David Norris who has outlined the exact position in great detail.  I can make the Offical Report available to the Minister of State in order that he can read the Senator's contributions.  I hope the Minister of State can take action as we should utilise international opinion.  Given his responsibility for European affairs, I request him to raise the issue at the next meeting of the Council of Ministers to get the European Union involved in the region to protect the people of this village.</p></speech>

I know Susiya as I have been there.  I also know its people.  My friend Ezra Itzhak Nawi has been villified, framed and wrongly charged by Israeli Governments because of his attempts as a Jewish Israeli to support the people of Susiya.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Five things need to be done.  First, a protective diplomatic presence is needed.  If there was a co-ordinated diplomatic effort to have a presence there in solidarity with them, this would inhibit the Israelis.  Second, the impact should be recorded.  Where demolition threatens donors' investment, the donors should enter into immediate communications with Israel and request that the Israeli Civil Administration delivers a official signed copy of the demolition order for its files.  Donors should insist that these official signed orders clearly state the legal premise on which they are based and should challenge any premise that is not based on international humanitarian law.  They should also plan to seek reparation for the damage done by Israel.  Israel confiscated and demolished protective structures, temporary structures and slides for schools.  What it is doing is outrageous.  They should support fact finding to determine if a grave breach has occurred.  The UN Secretary General has stated that Articles 53 and 49 of the Geneva Convention have been seriously breached by the Israelis.  They should also insist that the Palestinians be given a role in the planning.  They are excluded from planning, which is illegal under international law.  </p><p>The people in Susiya have been there for 200 years.  It was declared an archaeological site and they were forcibly moved.  The village was demolished and was partly rebuilt.  Israeli settlers were then allowed to move into what was an archaeological site and build a settlement.  A total of 500,000 Israelis live illegally on Palestinian land, which is shocking for the families involved and the people being moved.  They lose their homes and the effect on children is catastrophic.  </p><p>On 15 May 2015, the High Court in Israel refused an application from the people of Susiya to defer the demolition until the court had heard a serious and complete application.  This is very unusual for the Israelis.  I point out to the Minister of State that the state of Israel in these proceedings raised no security arguments nor did it argue against the petitioners' ownership of the land.  It did not use security and did not challenge the Palestinians' right to this land.  What always happens in these situations is that demolition and eviction is speedily followed by the illegal occupation of the Palestinians' land by Israeli settlers.  The situation is a disgrace.  I have spoken at length on this issue.  I am particularly glad that the plight of the village of Susiya has been raised by Senator Leyden here this morning because it is a village I know.  I know the people.  They are humble Bedouin farmers.  They do not have any connection with politics.  They just want to get on with their lives.  They are there legally and have 200 years of inheritance.  The Israelis are demolishing, illegally moving them and illegally moving their own settlers in.  I support Senator Leyden in urging the Minister to take very strong action on this matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-07-08a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/985" speakername="Dara Murphy" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015070800002#B00200"><p>I thank Senators Leyden and Norris for raising this very important matter and for their understanding regarding the unavailability of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade this morning.  There are two current demolition-eviction cases which have been the subject of recent reporting.  Many of us in the Oireachtas have received correspondence relating to them.  Some 46 Bedouin communities in the hills east and north east of Jerusalem, containing about 7,000 people, have been the subject of relocation orders since 2011.  They have been ordered to move to three designated resettlement areas, in one of which some Bedouin removed earlier are already located.  This threat has been hanging over the villagers for some time, and former T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, visited one of the threatened locations during his January 2012 visit to the region to support the villagers.</p> <p>However, there are indications now that the Israeli authorities are progressing their plans.  A retired general has been appointed to liaise with the communities and oversee the transfer and work is ongoing on preparing the relocation sites.  A total of 18 of these communities are in the strategic E1 area adjacent to Jerusalem, which has previously been the subject of strong US and EU pressure on the Israeli authorities because of its strategic location and previous settlement moves there have been withdrawn.  The implementation of this plan now may provide an early indication of the intentions of the new Israeli government in respect of settlements.</p> <p>In a separate case, the village of Susiya in the south Hebron hills is also subject to a general demolition order and a previous injunction freezing this while a planning process was completed was set aside by an Israeli court in May.  In theory, this allows demolition to proceed.  While this has not yet occurred, it must be assumed that the authorities intend to proceed, perhaps after Ramadan is over.</p> <p>Both of these cases are classic examples of the policies of eviction, dispossession and demolition which are being relentlessly advanced as part of the Israeli occupation - in many, but not all, cases to allow for the expansion of nearby Israeli settlements.  The pretext is generally lack of planning permission for residential and other structures but in practice, it is impossible for Palestinians in Area C, which is 60% of the West Bank, to obtain such permission.  Many of these families have already been subject to dispossession by Israel one or more times.</p> <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has said he agrees with the assessment of the UN Secretary General that these policies amount to forcible transfer, which is forbidden by the Fourth Geneva Convention in respect of a population under occupation except in specific circumstances of immediate military necessity, which, as Senator Norris pointed out, do not apply here.  Thus, they are contrary to international law.  These policies are, therefore, an intrinsic feature of the occupation.  Both Ireland and the EU have clearly and consistently condemned the expansion of settlements and the associated policies of evictions and dispossession, most recently in the Foreign Affairs Council Conclusions in November 2014 which specifically referenced the Bedouin case.  Bilaterally, Ireland has conveyed the same messages in public statements and in diplomatic contacts in Israel and with the Israeli embassy here, at EU and UN level at the Human Rights Council in Geneva and directly with the Israeli Government, most recently with the Israeli foreign Minister during the visit by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to the region in February.  </p> <p>We do not have the resources to attempt to follow and be active on every case on the ground in which these policies operate.  Ireland's main focus is on trying to put political pressure on the occupation as a whole.  However, the Irish representative office in Ramallah has made a number of field visits to the Bedouin communities and confirmed that the villagers, contrary to some reports, do not wish to relocate.  The Irish representative visited Susiya in May - I acknowledge the Senator's visit - to meet the community and show support for their struggle.  There was another visit to Susiya in June with a delegation of EU heads of mission accompanying the Palestinian prime minister.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is continuing to monitor developments in both cases.</p> <p>The question of recognition of Palestine, or of any state, is an important issue to be considered on its own merits.  It has not been raised here this morning.  It should not as a punishment or reward for one side or the other.  In respect of a specific request that the issue be raised by Ireland at the next meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council, I will make that suggestion to the Minister.  It seems to be a most reasonable suggestion.</p></speech>

Even if it is difficult for us to be represented there we could co-ordinate with the other donors to make sure there is a diplomatic presence.  The EUROMED agreement has human rights protocols and it was supposed to be activated when there were human rights violations by Israel.  The United Nations Secretary General has spoken of breaches of articles of the Geneva Convention.  Surely it is time that the EUROMED agreement be examined in light of Israel's human rights violations.</p></speech>

On the question about co-ordination I think that would be appropriate to raise it in the context of a discussion at the Foreign Affairs Council so both will be linked.  I assure Senator Norris that we are aware that on 22 October 2014 and 10 December 2014, Seanad &Eacute;ireann and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, respectively, adopted unanimous motions calling on the Government to recognise the State of Palestine.  It is a matter for the Government as to when that would be most appropriate to put in place but we are aware of the unanimous wishes of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

This sector is of vital significance to many parts of rural Ireland.  In her brief as Minister of State with responsibility for rural development and rural affairs, she will be very aware of the sheep sector's importance in many rural parts of the country where the land may not be as good as in the major agricultural areas.</p> <p>According to the national sheep register there are more than 3.5 million sheep in the country.  Most sheep flocks are located along the western seaboard.  My county has 12.5% of the national sheep stock with approximately 450,000 sheep in County Donegal - more sheep than people.  For example, there are 387,000 sheep in County Galway; 369,000 in County Mayo; and 308,000 in County Kerry.</p> <p>I have highlighted those numbers because they illustrate that the vast majority of those involved in the sheep sector are along the western seaboard which has seen significant rural decline over many years with young people leaving, for example.  Therefore, the sheep sector is very important as a means of keeping young people on the land.  Sixty per cent of the farm holdings in County Donegal represent sheep farmers.  I am raising this issue which was highlighted by my colleague, Councillor James Pat McDaid, who is a sheep farmer in County Donegal.  He spoke last week about the decrease of up to &euro;20 a head in lamb prices over the past fortnight or two and a half weeks alone.  This is having a drastic effect on many sheep farmers who are having difficulties finishing lambs earlier this year due to the fact that the weather was very bad and wet and there was slow grass growth.  They were forced to feed sheep later in the year and the increased feed prices means that they are being hit hard.  According to some of the farming organisations the factories are controlling the prices.  There is also price volatility in the UK and sheep prices are at their lowest point in the past five years.</p> <p>It is not an issue confined to this country but it needs Government intervention to support the sheep sector.  This support could be supplied by an attempt to bolster the export market.  Ireland exports most of its lamb and sheep meat.  We produce approximately 55,000 tonnes of sheep meat a year.  Last year, 45,000 tonnes was exported to France, the UK, Belgium, Germany and Scandinavia.  The French market has fallen.  There was a great demand this time last year from the French market but this has dwindled somewhat this year.  The Government response to support the sheep sector needs to be fast and drastic because sheep farmers will be driven out of existence given that the price has fallen below &euro;5 per kilo and according to some of the farming organisations it could fall to close to &euro;4 per kilo.  The farmers say that their floor price is around &euro;5 per kilo and when the price falls below this level they are producing and working in the negative, in the red.  That cannot be allowed to continue.  Farmers are primary producers and they need support.  The sector has 3.5 million sheep and farmers are willing to stay on the land which is marginal in many cases being commonage or poor land which is not of much use for any other farming.  I ask for a twofold response to this issue, first, that we go after those markets aggressively and try to open up the markets to new Irish lamb, that we promote lamb within the country; second, that a subsidy is provided to sheep farmers either from the Exchequer or through pillar 2 funding which is the &euro;580 million available annually under the CAP rural development programme.  That needs to happen.  The sheep sector is vital to the economy and it is particularly important to the western seaboard regions from Donegal down to Cork and Kerry.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-07-08a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/964" speakername="Ann Phelan" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015070800002#C00700"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this very important issue.  I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, who is in Strasbourg attending a European Parliament plenary session.</p> <p>This is a hugely important element of our agri-food sector and one which is a priority for the Minister.  Primary output from the sheep industry is currently worth about &euro;230 million, a value which has grown significantly in recent years.  Over two thirds of output is exported.  Exports in 2014 totalled 44,759 tonnes, with a value of &euro;218 million.  The sheep sector in Ireland is heavily dependent on the export market as the domestic consumption is usually only about 30% of overall production.  The core markets remain France and the UK with the French market usually representing double that of the UK.  This reflects the strong demand and reputation in France for Irish lamb and also the consumer preference in the UK for British product.  The growth markets in Europe are Sweden, Germany and Belgium with Sweden, for example, now representing our third most important market.</p> <p>I am also aware that the sheep farmers are vulnerable to price fluctuations.  While price is something that is subject to the normal dynamics of the market place the Minister has provided a range of financial and structural supports to the sector that can help to make the sector more resilient and position it to avail of development opportunities.</p> <p>The application of the latest scientific knowledge to the business of sheep breeding in Ireland is only in its infancy in comparison to programmes for beef and dairy.  However, the establishment of Sheep Ireland and the buy-in from stakeholders is improving matters considerably and proving to be of significant benefit.</p> <p>The sheep technology adoption programme which was introduced in 2013, has played a major role encouraging technology adoption at farms while also requiring participants to undertake a number of farm tasks.  These farm tasks make use of the best technologies available to sheep farmers in Ireland while also encouraging improved breeding through the use of a Sheep Ireland performance-recorded ram.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-07-08a.23" nospeaker="true" time="10:30:00" ><p>The programme is currently in its third and final year.  On average, around 4,000 farmers have participated in the programme in each year and total funding of more than &euro;6.5 million was provided in 2013 and 2014.  Under the Rural Development Programme 2014-20, the Minister has made provision for further improving efficiency and profitability in sheep production through the knowledge transfer groups measure.  The experience in the sheep technology adaption programme has informed the development of this measure.  In addition to profitability, the emphasis will be on the key issues of business skills, environmental sustainability and herd health, with increased interaction between individual farmers and facilitators in order to customise information exchange.  Approximately 300 potential facilitators recently expressed interest in running knowledge transfer groups for the sheep sector.</p><p>Various other schemes in RDP are also of direct relevance to the sheep sector.  For example, the green low carbon agri-environment scheme will benefit sheep farmers and they will continue to be significant beneficiaries from the areas of natural constraints scheme.  A series of capital investment schemes are being introduced under the TAMS II scheme, several of which will provide for sheep farmers.  It must also be remembered that the sheep grassland scheme, which invested over &euro;65 million in Irish sheep farms during its lifetime, has now been included in the direct payment of each sheep farmer under revised CAP arrangements.</p><p>Last week a new ten year strategy for the agri-food sector, Food Wise 2025, was launched with the key theme of local roots, global reach.  The agri-food sector is a sector unlike any other given its strategic importance to the Irish economy, its roots in local communities throughout the country and its rapidly increasing global reach.  Food Wise 2025 sets out a comprehensive plan for the development of Ireland's agri-food sector over the next decade.  It predicts that over the next decade Ireland can increase the value of agri-food exports by 85% to &euro;19 billion, increase value added to the sector by 70% to &euro;13 billion and increase the value of primary production by 65% to &euro;10 billion.  This should deliver a further 23,000 jobs in the agri-food sector by 2025.  With over 350 recommendations, Food Wise 2025 is very detailed but that detail is vital.  Many of these recommendations relate to the sheep sector.</p><p>The report acknowledges the importance of the sheep sector and notes that growth in the sector will come from improved technical efficiencies, as well as growth opportunities from an increase in consumer demand and export market opportunities.  Important actions identified for the sector include: genetic improvement of the sheep herd with a focus on ewe fertility and breeding resilience and resistance to diseases; working collaboratively with processors, Bord Bia, Teagasc and Sheep Ireland to modify the seasonal nature of our sheepmeat supply and maintaining presence; increasing farmer participation in the beef and lamb quality assurance scheme to 90% in terms of proportion of output by 2025; adding value to exports by further moving up the value chain from exporting entire carcasses to pre-packaged boneless cuts through wider market access; increasing sheep farmer participation in knowledge transfer programmes; and developing a carbon navigator tool for sheep producers.  The Minister will put in place a robust implementation process to monitor progress and deliver on the ambitious projections in the report.</p><p>My Department monitors average sheep prices and sheep slaughtering figures on a weekly basis because the two are clearly interlinked.  A national average sheep price is also submitted to the European Commission once a week.  While the recent movement on prices has been disappointing, it is not out of line with the trend in other countries.  I am satisfied that it does not point to a structural difficulty within the overall sheepmeat sector but rather reflects the fluctuations which can occur at this time of year.  The latest available figures show that after a strong first quarter in 2015, when the average Irish price was approximately 11% up on the same period in 2014, prices have fallen back.  This change in price in recent weeks is likely due to a combination of factors.  Supplies are in full flow at present due to seasonal factors.  At the same time, poor market conditions are believed to be driving down average prices as measured on a weekly basis.  While this recent dip in prices is disappointing, it remains the case that at the end of June, the average year to date price was running at approximately 4% ahead of the same period last year.  Just this week, I understand that prices have started to rise again and that demand for sheep and lamb by factories is rising.</p></speech>

In my neck of the woods in the north west region, prices are significantly below the figures for this time last year.  The fluctuations appear shallower than is actually the case because the Department is using generic figures across the country.</p> <p>A mechanism needs to be found to support sheep farmers.  I note that the Minister of State used the phrase "technical efficiencies".  For many sheep farmers, technical efficiencies are probably not possible.  We cannot continue to develop technical efficiencies in a sector that is already at break-even point.  We must assist sheep farmers either by finding new markets or providing a top-up subsidy.</p></speech>

At present the Department of Education allocates resource teachers on the basis of need calculated by time.  A resource teacher may work across two schools to make up the total time allocation.  These allocations are temporary unless the hours can be provided by teachers on permanent contracts.</p> <p>Regrettably, this has been the experience of Esker national school for quite some time.  For the last three years the school has had an allocation of between 20 and 23 hours, which when combined with other schools creates a full 25 hour post.  Every year the school community expresses the hope that the Department will see sense by allocating a permanent position in light of obvious demand and the fact that the school falls short by only a few hours.  However, each year the post is sanctioned on a temporary basis.  This is frustrating for all concerned but especially for the pupils and resource teacher, whose employment has not been made permanent even though she returns to the school year after year.  There is no certainty for the teacher, the school or the students who depend on her.  Based on the repeat allocation of resource teachers on temporary contracts, it should be clear to the Department that a permanent resource teacher is required at the school in light of the demand arising.  I understand the Department is relying on temporary positions until such time as it introduces a new model but schools like Esker national school have no clear idea of when the new model will be introduced or what it will comprise.  They have a rational fear that they will be left worse off after the introduction of a new model.  It is important that the Department assuages their fears in this regard.</p> <p>I call on the Minister of Education and Skills to clarify this issue by expediting the introduction of a new model and, taking into consideration my submission, moving to secure a permanent resource teacher for Esker national school.  The school deserves one because it is ridiculous that it requires 25 hours on a weekly basis to have a permanent teacher even though it has established a need for between 20 and 23 hours.  For the sake of certainty in our educational system, it is imperative that the school's resource teacher post be made permanent.</p></speech>

We have been resolutely committed to protecting and, in some instances, increasing the level of investment made to support children with special educational needs at a time when there has been a requirement to make expenditure reductions across a range of areas.  It is an area which has been prioritised above most others by the Government, despite the enormous pressures in all areas of public spending.  This year alone over &euro;1.37 billion or 15% of the Department's budget is being spent to provide supports to enable learners with special educational needs to access an education appropriate to their needs.  This week alone the Minister announced the provision of an additional 610 SNAs to support children with special needs in schools.</p><p>The growth in provision for resource teaching support has been a major factor in ensuring the successful integration of children with special educational needs into mainstream education.  More children than ever before are receiving resource teaching support in schools.  The number of resource teaching posts available for allocation has increased by 27% since 2012, from 5,265 posts in 2012 to 6,705 in 2015-16.  The allocation of resource teaching posts to schools will increase by over 9% for the coming school year.  This is in excess of demographic increases in 2015 of approximately 1.8% at primary level and 1.2% at post-primary level.</p><p>The House will be aware that the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, through its network of local special educational needs organisers, is responsible for allocating resource teachers to schools to support children with special educational needs.  It operates within the Department's criteria in allocating such support.  All schools were asked to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching support for the 2015-16 school year by 18 March 2015.  The NCSE continued to accept applications after this date in recognition of the fact that enrolments might not have been completed or where assessments had not been completed.  It has published details of the resource teaching allocations which will be made to each individual school on its website.  It will also have a second round allocation process to respond to late enrolments, or diagnosed disabilities emerging after the closing date for the first allocation round, to the start of the new school year.</p><p>The Department's Circular 05/2015 sets out arrangements for filling NCSE-approved resource teaching posts in primary schools.  Permanent resource posts are allocated to schools with an allocation of 25 resource teaching hours.  Many schools will receive an allocation of less than 25 resource hours.  In such cases, they join neighbouring schools to form clusters with an allocation of 25 hours.  In these circumstances a temporary post is appointed and based in one of the schools.  The school referred to in the Senator's question has been approved for such a temporary shared post for the coming school year.  Clustering arrangements operate successfully throughout the country.  They ensure pupils can continue to access additional teaching supports in school and also that the additional teaching resources are utilised to best effect to maximise teaching and learning outcomes for children.</p><p>I again thank the Senator for raising this important matter.</p></speech>

I accept that 15% of the Department's budget is being used in meeting special educational needs.  It was heartening to hear the Minister's announcement earlier this week on the allocation of an additional 610 SNAs.  While I am delighted that Galway, in particular, will receive an extra allocation of 42 SNAs, I ask the Minister to look at the specific needs of Esker national school.  There is no doubt that there is a demand and a pressing need for a permanent post at the school.  As I said, there is a need for certainty and clarity.  I, therefore, ask the Minister of State to convey to the Minister that this needs to be taken into consideration and borne in mind when introducing a new model for the rolling out of resource teaching posts.  We must try to make an impact in an area in which assistance is needed the most.</p></speech>

I understand he has retired and that a second consultant who worked at the hospital has returned to the country.  The number of transplant consultants has been reduced to four in total when it should be eight, which means that we have a major problem.</p> <p>In the past six months the figures for transplant procedures were presented on a number of occasions to us at the Joint Committee of Health and Children where comparisons were made with the position in Norway, which has a population of 4.8 million, of whom only 370 are on dialysis.  In Ireland there are over 1,800.  A transplant saves the Exchequer in the order of &euro;750,000 in real terms, which is a huge saving for the country.  </p> <p>The appointment of consultants is an issue about which I have been concerned for some time.  Last October, at the Joint Committee on Health and Children, I asked representatives of the HSE a question, only to be told in reply that there was no information available at a national level on the number of posts which were vacant.  At the time I advised the HSE that if it was to give me the name of one porter in each hospital around the country, I was sure I would be able to obtain the information.  It was a further six months before I eventually received a list which indicated that there were over 300 vacancies.  </p> <p>This issue dates back to the time of Comhairle na Ospid&eacute;al which was subsumed into the HSE in 2004.  When Comhairle na Ospid&eacute;al was in place, a vacancy would have been flagged by a health board at least 12 months in advance, advertising would have taken place and the post would have been filled as soon as the vacancy arose.  We now seem to have a policy of advertising vacancies only after they arise.  There is a lack of long-term planning, which seems to be the case at Beaumont Hospital.  Responsibility for filling the vacancy seems to lie with the HSE, Beaumont Hospital and the Department.  What we need is clarity.  We must decide how to fast-track the filling of the post and how to make it attractive enough for someone to apply from abroad if there is no one available in Ireland to fill it.  A candidate may be Irish, but at least such a process would ensure the post was filled and thus allow us to meet the target for the number of transplants to be undertaken in this country.</p></speech>

Given the limited number of surgeons who specialise in transplantation, the filling of such vacancies poses a challenge.  While Beaumont Hospital is making every effort to recruit a suitable replacement, it is also collaborating with St. Vincent's University Hospital on a combined approach to kidney and pancreas transplants.  It is proposed that pancreas transplants, of which six were performed in 2014, will be carried out in St. Vincent's University Hospital.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Leo Varadkar:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2192"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2192&amp;amp;pid=LeoVaradkar&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The two hospitals, together with Organ Donation and Transplant Ireland, ODTI, which is part of the HSE, and my Department, are working to make arrangements to facilitate the commencement of this work as soon as possible.<br/><br/>Most pancreas transplants are combined with a kidney transplant.  These cases will involve transplant surgeons from St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital and Beaumont Hospital working together in St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital.  In addition to working with St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital in a combined approach to kidney and pancreas transplants, Beaumont Hospital is collaborating with it in the development of an intra-abdominal organ retrieval service that will facilitate a more effective and cohesive overall procurement and transplant service.  <br/><br/>In May Beaumont Hospital wrote to all patients who had received a pancreas transplant, in addition to all patients on the transplant waiting list.  It has also written to all referring consultants.  At this point, all pancreas transplant recipients have been seen by clinicians in Beaumont Hospital or have appointments in place.  Future pathways of care are being discussed with all patients at these meetings.<br/><br/>A joint assessment clinic for the eight patients waiting for a pancreas transplant, involving consultants and nurses from Beaumont Hospital and St. Vincent's University Hospital, will be held on 24 July.  Management and clinical staff at the hospitals are committed to ensuring an optimal service will be put in place for the long-term benefit of those in need of pancreas transplants.  As St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital is already established as the national liver transplant centre and is a designated centre for pancreas cancer services, it is well placed to undertake pancreas transplants.  Every effort is being made to have all of the necessary arrangements and protocols in place to facilitate St. Vincent's University Hospital to be in a position to undertake pancreas transplants from mid-September should there be a suitable donor-recipient match.<br/><br/>Additional funding of almost &euro;3 million has been provided to facilitate the development of the most appropriate infrastructure to support organ donation and transplantation.  This will facilitate the appointment of 19 whole-time-equivalent staff dedicated to organ donation and transplantation across the country.  Included in this number are five organ procurement co-ordinators who have been appointed and six organ donation nurse managers<b></b>who will be in post<b></b>in each of the hospital groups by the end of August.<br/><br/>I recognise all of the families who have facilitated the donation of the organs of their loved ones, often to the benefit of several recipients.  I reiterate my commitment to enhance organ donation and transplantation rates for the benefit of patients and their families.</p></speech>

Why was there such a delay in advertising for a replacement?  What is the HSE now doing?  Considering that it took me six months to obtain a list of vacancies from the HSE, it appears that there is no national co-ordination.  I asked what consultants were to retire in the following 12 months and in what number, but the HSE could not give me an answer.  This is an extremely important issue which concerns long-term planning.  It is clear from what has occurred that there was no long-term planning.  There is none; the matter is being put on the back burner.  It is no longer acceptable that there are long waiting lists.  We can talk all we like about waiting lists, but until such time as we sort out the issue of consultant appointments before they arise, we will be complaining about waiting lists for the next 20 years.  This matter needs to be prioritised.   With regard to appointments, we are down to four consultants carrying out transplants.  What incentive is going to be offered to try to bring people back from abroad to take up the vacant posts?</p></speech>

I cannot say with absolute certainty when it was advertised, but it was certainly advertised many months ago.  However, it was not possible to find a suitable applicant.  As the Senator will know, the health service works in such a way that the HSE is not always the employer.  Beaumont Hospital, for example, is a voluntary hospital.  Therefore, the people who work there, in St Vincent's University Hospital and many other hospitals are not actually HSE employees but employees of the voluntary hospital.  As a consequence, recruitment procedures vary.  There is direct recruitment by the HSE and also recruitment by individual voluntary hospitals.  Quite a large number of consultant posts have been advertised in recent months.  Advertisement is through the Public Appointments Service which fills the posts.  It is trying to speed up the filling of posts, but sometimes it can take time because recruits have to give notice elsewhere before taking up a post, particularly if coming from overseas.  There are difficulties in attracting applicants or any applicant in some cases, particularly when the job is not in one of the major cities.  That is a particular difficulty.  Obviously, any incentive that can be offered is limited because we are bound by the rules on public sector pay.  The current structure does not give us flexibility to offer bespoke contracts, top-ups or incentives.</p></speech>

I compliment Senator Burke for what he has done.</p> <p>In regard to No. 2, the statements on the report of the working group on Seanad reform, I welcome the fact we will have two former colleagues in the House on this matter.  I have been reading about this report with interest and have my own views on some of the proposals, which I will mention later.  I am not sure how workable the proposals are, but my main concern is the role of the Government, particularly of the Taoiseach, in this.  The Taoiseach has not met any of the leaders of the Opposition in regard to these proposals.  We do not have an existing, sitting Senator on the working group and I see that as deficient.  The Leader should have been part of the group.  If there was to be only one sitting Senator on it, that should have been the Leader.  Since the referendum on the Seanad was defeated, we have had only one meeting with the Taoiseach.  We were told there would be a series of meetings on Seanad reform and how it would be done.</p> <p>I do not disparage in any way the work that has been done by the working group but it appears that what is proposed now is to rush through some proposal document.  This is not doable between now and the next election and is probably not doable at all.  The proposals contained in the report would probably ensure a Seanad election would be more expensive than a D&aacute;il election and, as set out, would cost taxpayers a lot more.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Darragh O'Brien:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2178"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This does not make any sense and I am worried that it is a box ticking exercise by the Taoiseach and the Government in order that when he goes to the public, he will be able to say he has a detailed Seanad reform plan which he knows will never be implemented.  I am concerned that we are just going through the motions and that what will happen later today is a false debate.  We will be having a chat with two well respected people, former Senators Maurice Manning and Joe O'Toole, but they have no power.  They have produced a report, but let us be straight - the only person who can make any change is the Taoiseach but only if he wants it to happen.  I am wary of this process.  Has the Taoiseach indicated to the Leader that there will be a meeting of group leaders with him on Seanad reform?  Will he follow through on his commitment which he gave more than two years ago to work with the Seanad to improve the workings of the House?  The Leader has introduced many valuable changes and I know that he would have made more if he had been sanctioned to do so.  He has changed the workings of the Seanad in the past four years, for which I commend him.  However, I am concerned that this is a case where, having produced a report on Seanad reform, it will be a matter of saying "off with you now" and that during the general election the Taoiseach will say he brought forward reform proposals.  Most of us know that none of it is going to happen.  We are to spend three hours listening to statements on the report of the working group, yet I cannot get certain Ministers to come to the House to discuss various matters.  We could spend three hours discussing things which really will happen and really affect the public.</p></speech>

Up to 610 additional SNAs will be allocated from September 2015.  When the Minister spoke on radio this morning, she made explicit the Government's commitment that every child with an assessed care need would have access to SNA support.  The new allocation reflects a significant increase in assessed needs, of which her Department has become aware, and is very welcome for many parents around the country.  It means that the allocation of full-time SNA posts will rise in September to 11,820.  </p> <p>Also welcome is the announcement made by Vodafone of 200 new jobs in Dublin, with the European sales centre to be located in Carrickmines.</p> <p>I commend Senator Jillian van Turnhout for her initiative in putting together an all-party Oireachtas group on children's future health which will work with the Irish Heart Foundation.  I commend her for the successful launch of the all-party group this morning.  Colleagues in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad were present at the launch, including Senator Marie Moloney.  Professor Donal O'Shea and Miriam O'Callaghan were also in attendance.  I look forward to having a debate in the House, perhaps in the autumn term, on the work of the all-party group which will address the issue of children's future health on a cross-party basis and with a view to taking real action.</p></speech>

I thank Senators and Deputies, across parties, who joined me.  They included Senators Ivana Bacik and Marie Moloney and Deputies Clare Daly, Billy Kelleher, Sandra McLellan, Mary Mitchell O'Connor and Thomas Pringle.  I thank the Irish Heart Foundation for supporting us in our work with a secretariat, with the Children's Rights Alliance, Social Justice Ireland and Healthy Food for All.  The need for a cross-party group on children's future health is to be found in the reality that one in four children in Ireland is overweight or obese and that one in five children goes to bed hungry.  We hope that, as a cross-party group, we can agree on actions to be taken in this area.  Later this year we will launch the first ever study of food marketing to children via the Internet and social media which is being carried out by the Irish Heart Foundation.  We will work with anyone and everyone who wishes to work on the issue of children's future health.  </p><p>I wish to raise an issue with the Leader regarding the children's rights referendum.  Yesterday there was a decision on costs when the Supreme Court dealt with the legal challenges.  The President signed the children's rights referendum Act into law on 28 April which was a glorious day.However, if one looks at the Office of the Attorney General's website, <i>www.irishstatutebook.ie</i>, concerning the 31st amendment to the Constitution it states the result of the referendum &quot;is currently the subject of a legal challenge&quot;.  On Friday last I wrote to the Attorney General to seek clarification.  As I had contacted her office prior to that but without success, I decided to write to her.  I have been advised that the Office of the Attorney General will not update its website until the Constitution is reprinted, a matter I have found that comes within the remit of the Office of Public Works.  When I contacted that office, it stated it had completed a print run in February and had no intention of completing another in the foreseeable future because it was waiting to include the latest amendment in the next print run.  The result of the marriage equality referendum is being challenged in the courts.  This is unacceptable and an impasse.  The Office of the Attorney General's website states there is a legal challenge to the 31st amendment to the Constitution - the children's rights referendum.  To me, it feels like children are being told to wait again because we have to wait for a reprint of a book.  I do not understand it.  The President signed the Act into law on 28 April and we have waited long enough.  There are children who did not receive their rights during the period of two and a half year while the outcome was being appealed.  I respect the concept of democracy, but there were children waiting to be adopted who turned 18 years of age during that period and whose rights were extinguished.  I have written to the Attorney General and the Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris, who has responsibility for the Office of Public Works, but I would be grateful for any guidance, help or support the Leader could offer.  At the very least, the websites should be accurate.  </p><p>I repeat my call for a discussion on the implementation of the proposals made in the working group's report on the direct provision system which was published last week.  It is a weighty tome, but much of it requires to be implemented.  We need to see action on the proposals made in it.  I, therefore, ask for a debate on the issue at the earliest opportunity.</p></speech>

It follows a meeting I held in May on tackling crime and burglaries in the Dublin Rathdown area.  More than half of the people who attended that meeting had had their houses burgled, which is serious.  On 30 June the CSO published figures showing there had been a surge of 8% in the number of burglaries in the past 12 months.  I am calling for the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, to come to the House to discuss with us what she intends to do and how she will increase the numbers of garda&iacute; to halt the increase in the number of burglaries.  A surge of 8% nationally is frightening.  It was folly to close the Garda station in Stepaside.  The constituency of Dublin Rathdown is very close to the M50 which those who want to carry out burglaries in the area can use to get in and out easily.  Based on my experience, I am passionate about the need to revamp the Neighbourhood Watch scheme.  At the public meeting next week I will have three brilliant speakers: the chairman of Crimestoppers, Mr. Tim Dalton; the local community garda in the area and Ms Noreen Barron who will speak about the Neighbourhood Watch scheme.</p></speech>

I am glad to say a risk assessment is now taking place in Galway with a view to drawing down funding from the OPW, the lead Government agency in providing long-term flood defences.  The Government's catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme will consider the long-term effects of flooding, as well as the impact of climate change and rising tides.  There will be a public consultation process in Galway and other affected areas across the country.  I urge anyone affected by flooding to become involved in the consultation process.  There will also be a risk assessment, the findings of which will contribute to a draft flood management plan for local areas.  I also understand works on the Clare river in Claregalway are being held up by legal difficulties, but it is hoped they will be overcome shortly.</p></speech>

Yesterday I had the opportunity to visit Our Lady of Good Counsel national school in Johnstown, Killiney, County Dublin.  A summer course on physical literacy is being held there for primary teachers.  Today I thank the Minister for Education and Skills and the Professional Development Service for Teachers for listening to me and taking on board the points for life initiative I launched in the Seanad four years ago.</p> <p>As part of its well-being team, the Professional Development Service for Teachers has established a number of staff who have been assigned to upskill national teachers in the area of physical literacy.  The design of the fundamental movement skills, which I have been talking about consistently for some time, is in the final stages and, once completed, they will be rolled out on a trial basis throughout 2015 and 2016.  This is all part of the national physical activity plan and the Get Active framework announced in recent years.  The teachers who attended this seminar this week and previous weeks were absolutely blown away by what they have learned in terms of fundamental movement skills, the foundation we build in children and how important this is.  They are really encouraged and enthusiastic about going back to school.</p> <p>This is only a seed that has been sown and I would like to see it blossom as quickly as possible in the school curriculum in the next few years.  A number of teachers mentioned to me yesterday that the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is responsible for writing the curriculum on numeracy and literacy in schools.  The teachers I spoke to yesterday have encouraged me to ask for the Minister for Education and Skills and the NCCA to take on board now the writing of a proper curriculum for physical literacy in schools.  I thank the PDST and the Minister and all those teachers who have enthusiastically taken on what we have been trying to get through the Seanad in recent years.</p></speech>

Is the Leader in a position to update the House on the work of Michael Kelly and a university for the south east?  He has been meeting stakeholders.  He was to complete a report and furnish it to the Minister and one hopes the findings will be published.  This is a hugely important issue for the people of Waterford city and county.  It is massively important that this is delivered.  There is a concern that we are into the last year or less of this Government's term of office.  To be frank, we are no closer to having that university in Waterford and for the people of the south east than when this Government came into office.  This is not all the fault of the Government as it is more to do with internal politics in the region and for other reasons.  It is hugely important.  We cannot allow this to slip under the radar and not to go ahead.  It was in the programme for Government as a clear promise and we must ensure it is delivered.  I am sure the Leader will concur it is hugely important, not just for the people of Waterford city and county but for the entire south-east region, that this university is delivered.  We have been, in educational terms, operating with one hand tied behind our back for far too long.  I met Michael Kelly and the Minister for Education and Skills.  I know that Government party Deputies and Senators and Opposition Members have been pushing this issue and working very hard in the locality to ensure this is delivered.  It was envisaged the report would be published well before now but there is a concern as to why it has not been published yet.  If the Leader is not in a position to answer today, will he get an update from the Minister.</p></speech>

Ireland has the fourth highest asthma statistics in the world.  In my own county of Tipperary alone, there are 15,000 people suffering from asthma, approximately 10% of the population.  In 2011, the Government approved a clinical programme for asthma but, to date, this programme has not been implemented.  There are a number of facets to this programme but the ones I will highlight in particular are the provision of one free GP visit per year for asthma sufferers, which would cost approximately &euro;2.5 million, the provision of an Asthma Society of Ireland advice line, which would cost approximately &euro;150,000, and a recognition that asthma is a long-term illness.  The number of people suffering from asthma increases during the summer and many people will experience asthma along with hay fever.  For a person who suffers with asthma all year round, it is a debilitating disease and it deserves to be recognised as a long-term illness.</p> <p>The Government, in good faith, approved the strategy four years ago but it is time for action.  There has been some loosening of the purse strings in advance of the budget and money could not be spent in a better way than by providing the services I have outlined for asthma sufferers.  Perhaps the Leader would request the Minister for Health to come to the House to have a debate on this subject before the summer recess.</p></speech>

A few weeks ago, Senator Norris and others raised the issue of an alleged village called Susiya in the West Bank.  A number of us had received information on this by e-mail.  I decided that in this instance I would contact the Israeli embassy to establish exactly what its position was.  Inevitably what happens in this House whenever issues of Israeli-Palestinian relationships are raised, we hear about the Palestinian side.  If the House will allow me, I will read relevant parts of the response I received.  The Israeli embassy response states that Susiya is not and never was a recognised village.  It states that there is an archaeological site there showing signs of ancient Jewish habitations from 1,500 years ago.  In recent years, clusters of illegal structures have been built around Susiya in breach of planning and zoning laws.  The embassy response also points out that it is a Bedouin settlement which is a largely barren territory that is controlled by Israel and is state land according to the Oslo Accords.</p></speech>

They say that the authorities in the area have offered alternative lands nearby which will improve the petitioners' quality of living, enabling access to civil infrastructure systems and improve access to educational facilities.  They state the offer does not obstruct the continuation of the same agricultural activities in the lands to which the petitioners lay claim, that their petition will be heard by the Israeli Supreme Court next month, and that the authorities will heed any decision reached by the court.  The final point of the embassy is that in the broader context the attempts to portray the issue of Susiya as a human rights issue are egregious in that the issue relates to illegal building and any attempt to portray it as anything else merely confirms that it is being used as another propaganda tool to generate hostility towards Israel.  I wanted to put that statement on the record of the House.  It is a matter for Members of the House to decide on who is right and wrong but time and again in this House we have heard one side of this argument and I wanted to put the other side on the record.  Whether one supports it or otherwise, they are entitled to their point of view.</p> <p>I ask that the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs would come to the House, tomorrow if possible but certainly next week, to afford this House the opportunity of discussing the Greek crisis.  As a House we have not voiced any opinion on the Greek crisis as it has developed over recent weeks.  Particularly in light of the decisions that are imminent this weekend it is very important that this House has an opportunity to express its views and to hear the Government view.  There are conflicting signals coming from the Government on what exactly is the Irish Government's attitude towards Greece.  We are hearing on one hand about the great empathy we have with the Greek people but on the other hand there are suggestions that we are siding with the German bankers.  I do not think that sort of obfuscation and ambiguity should be allowed to stay on the record any longer.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paschal Mooney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1990"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1990&amp;amp;pid=PaschalMooney&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We need clarity.

Senator Wilson recognises how well these people perform in their illegal activity dealing with stretched petrol and laundered diesel.  I welcome the recent announcement by the Minister for Finance regarding the introduction on 1 April 2015 of a new and more effective product for marking rebated fuels that was identified as a result of a joint process conducted with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs in the UK.  The work of Revenue officers in testing fuel for the presence of the new marker will be supported by mobile equipment that will allow on-the-spot analysis of samples.  We wish them well.  Anything that can be done to strengthen the Revenue Commissioners' hand in combating this must be done.</p> <p>I know the issue arose at the previous meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council in Armagh.  The report that was adopted in this Chamber at the plenary session of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly in February recommended that a task force be set up.  The Revenue Commissioners cannot deal with this on their own.  The PSNI in the North and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the South cannot deal with this on their own.  There are 34 Border crossings in the Dundalk region alone.  These people have been known to break roadblocks on occasion.  Apart from that, it is impossible to police 34 Border crossings so we must get real.  It must be done an all-agency basis that involves the Revenue Commissioners, Customs and Excise, the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Environmental Protection Agency in addition to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI.  These people have been in business on the Border for 20 or 30 years.  If this is not adopted, they will remain in business for the next 20 or 30 years.</p></speech>

I have said a few times in this House that the criminal organisations we are talking about are largely run by the Provisional IRA.  Whatever difficulties they pose for small businesses, the threats, intimidation and tactics they use to control and subjugate their own communities are quite abhorrent.  There does not seem to be a massive amount of will on the part of the police to tackle them.  I do not know whether it is down to resources.  It seems that this artificial peace process is being protected at all costs.</p> <p>I also wish to raise the issue of the N20 motorway between Cork and Limerick.  I wished to raise the matter under the Commencement debate today.  It relates to connectivity between Ireland's second and third largest cities.  It is a major barrier to investment in County Limerick in particular but also in the south, south-west and mid-west regions.  If we do not have that kind of road connectivity between two of the country's major cities, it is quite inhibiting.  My Commencement matter was ruled out of order because a similar matter had apparently been raised a couple of weeks ago so I amended my Commencement matter in such a way as to make it different.  I have been in contact with a civil engineer of considerable experience based in Austria who has proposed a different public private partnership model from the one used by the National Roads Authority and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  This model is an enhanced public private partnership model that could go some way towards solving the issue of connectivity between Cork and Limerick.  I use the road quite often.  There are always tailbacks between Mallow, Buttevant and Charleville and there are some terribly dangerous accident blackspots in Rockhill, Anahid Cross and O'Rourke's Cross.  This project has been put on the long finger for far too long and is something County Limerick really needs.  Will the Cathaoirleach consider a Commencement matter I will resubmit?  I hope it will be taken because it is the only opportunity I will get to hear from the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport about this very important project.</p></speech>

It is an international crisis that, regardless of the way it is resolved, will have a detrimental effect on the European project as we know it.  Regardless of whether it is resolved satisfactorily or not, Europe has changed as a result of the Greek crisis.  It would be no harm if the Leader were in a position to organise a debate to clarify the Government position, which I have no doubt is very clear.  Like the Irish people, the Government empathises with the people of Greece.  Some of the ill-informed and misconstrued comments on the Government position were regrettable because they are not true and the Taoiseach and other Ministers have made that clear in recent days.</p> <p>On a more positive note, the aviation industry in this country is doing remarkably well.  I am delighted to be able to tell the House that AerCap, which is one of the world's leading aircraft leasing companies, has created 100 jobs, 50 of which are in Dublin in Senator Darragh O'Brien's area and 50 in Shannon.  These are high-end and highly sought after jobs in the area of technical aircraft leasing as well as legal, treasury and finance jobs.  AerCap has had a tremendous growth trajectory over recent years.  It now has about 2,000 aircraft, the latest of which is being delivered to Dublin Airport today.  We all remember the great dream that was Guinness Peat Aviation.  Unfortunately, due to bad timing and a bad initial public offering, it did not lead to the international stardom and success for which people had hoped.  We now have far more balanced and measured development of the aircraft leasing business.  Ireland is the world leader in aircraft leasing.  No one can come near us.  We need to play to our strengths.   The 100 new jobs are an incremental step in the development plan of an aircraft industry that does not just involve flying planes but encompasses the industry around it, particularly aircraft leasing.  I hope we will see in due course many more jobs in aircraft finance, engineering, marketing and so on.  There is no reason Ireland cannot become a world hub and expert in the aircraft business.  I again welcome this jobs announcement which is a great vote of confidence in counties Clare and Dublin.  It shows the expertise this country has in the area.</p></speech>

The future of the European project is very much in doubt, especially in light of the role the euro has played in the debt crisis in Ireland and other countries in Europe.  We see the weakness of the euro project in Greece.  We saw it in Ireland.  It is the only currency in the world that does not have the fiscal reasonability that goes with a currency from where it is printed, namely, the ECB.  We do not have that with the euro and we have seen the difficulties this presents.  We should have a debate about this, Ireland's position in Europe and the European project in general, including the euro.  We may not have time before the recess but perhaps the Leader would arrange it when we return in early September.</p> <p>I also call on the Leader to facilitate a debate to discuss the undocumented Irish in the US.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2261"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2261&amp;amp;pid=BrianODomhnaill&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is an issue in particular at this time of year when families like to be together over the summer months, but many are locked in the United States because they cannot come home, due to the three-year and eight-year bar.  There is an alternative which would allow approximately 25% of the undocumented Irish to avail of a waiver scheme, according to the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform group, whereby visa waivers can be given at the discretion of US embassies abroad without the need for congressional, Senate or presidential approval.  Mexico was facilitated with 58,000 such waivers in 2011, and in fact Mexicans got 8,542 waivers last year.  Ireland only got 118 waivers last year while the North and the UK got 2,250 waivers.  There is a real opportunity for the US ambassador to Ireland to consider a mechanism to approve waivers to facilitate some of the undocumented in the United States to become legal citizens there.  To be fair to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, he has raised the issue with US officials but we should have a debate on it here.  I am not sure if there is a mechanism for the Seanad as a group to facilitate a discussion with the US ambassador to Ireland on the issue.  In terms of thinking outside the box, perhaps the Leader could think about it over the summer and we could revisit the matter in September.</p></speech>

The reason it was refused was because of the impact it would have on a rare breed of swan.  I read in today's newspaper that a proposed wind farm development in Doonbeg in County Clare was refused planning permission because of the impact it would have on a rare mussel.  In the past, some wind farm developments have been refused because of the potential effects on a lesser horseshoe bat, or even a snail.  We have never had a decision from An Bord Plean&aacute;la refusing planning permission because of potential adverse effects on human health and well-being.  People are not even taken into consideration.  A couple in my county, Michael and Dorothy Kane, had to move out of their home because of the effects a wind farm development had on them.  They moved to County Leitrim.  They were driven demented by the development.  Politicians often say we must put people first, however, we are putting bats, snails, swans and mussels ahead of human beings in this country at the moment.</p> <p>The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, is trying to introduce new set-back distances for wind farms from people's homes.  He is meeting resistance from within Government circles.  I ask the Leader that we would urge the Minister to introduce the new guidelines as a matter of urgency, and most certainly before the summer recess.</p></speech>

The whooper swan was one of the reasons, but also the very important heritage we have in County Meath.  I am sorry to say that heritage is being further threatened by EirGrid, which has put in a planning application for a gigantic and extremely ugly overhead power line at a time when we are told that nothing is happening in that regard and that the Taoiseach has stopped various projects.  That is not the case in Meath, Cavan and Monaghan.  There is a major proposal to put a 400 kV line from Kilmullen in south County Meath all the way up to Kingscourt and beyond into Cavan and Monaghan.  It will have a severe impact on the heritage and tourism potential of County Meath and on the enjoyment of life and health of citizens there who, as Senator Kelly rightly pointed out, are the most important people in the process.  It is the people whose will and view should be listened to by the authorities.</p> <p>This particular type of project was stopped in its tracks in County Mayo because there is a Taoiseach there.  This project was also stopped in its tracks all through the constituency of the former Minister, Phil Hogan, but in County Meath, despite the fact that five of the six Deputies in County Meath are Government Deputies, they seem to have had no influence whatsoever on the project.  Planning permission has been sought but it is not too late for the Government to say it is unfair and unjust on the people of County Meath.  In the meantime, because it is going through the statutory process, it is important that everybody in County Meath, not just those under the proposed route of the pylons, would take part in the An Bord Plean&aacute;la planning procedure.  They should lodge their objections, and if they cannot afford the &euro;50 fee they should join with others to put in an objection.  It is important that the public knows that people can join together in one objection to save money because it is very expensive to go through the process.</p> <p>I hope that someone will listen to the people, and to those who have been campaigning on the issue for almost eight years, and will say that the lines can be put underground.  The people of Meath support an interconnector route but it must be put underground.  Who would have thought the field of Tailteann, the area where the Tailteann Games took place - that famous celebration in ancient Ireland - would be utterly destroyed by what EirGrid is proposing?  It is outrageous and disgraceful and the people of Meath will not accept it, in particular the people who own the land, who in effect are the caretakers of the land of Meath for the next generations.  They will not let EirGrid on to their land to build the project and I support them in that.</p></speech>

Each and every part of the country has witnessed that.  Only last weekend a young man who opens and closes a church on the Cooley Peninsula was at the church to close it at 9.10 p.m. in his new jeep.  It takes him a couple of minutes to close the church.  When he came out the jeep was gone.  The problem is the quick access to Northern Ireland because within five or six minutes anyone committing a burglary on the Cooley Peninsula or in my home town of Carlingford can be in a different jurisdiction.  I call for an increase in the number of garda&iacute; in Border counties in particular because of the number of access points to Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

I say that with all due respect to Killarney, Westport and Kilkenny.  The population of the town increases threefold with discerning visitors from Friday to Monday.

Perhaps the meeting has something to do with that.</p> <p>Senator Bacik and others welcomed the additional special needs assistants announced by the Minister for Education and Skills.  We now have 11,820 special needs assistants.</p> <p>Senator Bacik referred to the additional jobs in Vodafone and Senator Conway referred to additional jobs in the aviation sector.  The good news on the creation of jobs is continuing.  Long may it continue.  We have seen the lowest unemployment rate for quite some time.  It is 9.7% and decreasing as we continue to implement the action plan for jobs.</p> <p>Senator Bacik welcomed the all-party group on children's future health.  Senator Jillian van Turnhout outlined the proposed work of the group.  We all wish it well in its efforts.</p> <p>On the children referendum, the result is in law and there is no question about that.  The President signed the legislation.  Why the website of the Office of the Attorney General does not reflect this, I do not know.  However, the referendum result is enforced and is in law.</p> <p>With regard to direct provision and the report that was published only last week, we will certainly try to facilitate a debate.  I do not know whether we can have it before the end of the session in a fortnight.</p> <p>Senator Mary White referred to burglaries.  Senator Terry Brennan also raised this matter.  I compliment Senator White on her electioneering and on having a meeting on this in her new constituency.  There are joint policing committees in that area and I presume they are working hard with the chief superintendent in determining where the number of burglaries can be minimised.</p></speech>

Many more garda&iacute; have come on stream and more will be coming on stream.  The deployment of garda&iacute; is an operational matter for the Commissioner.  I suggest to the Senator that the chief superintendent make a case to the Commissioner.  I am sure the allocation of resources will be very fair on the part of the Commissioner.</p> <p>Senator Hildegarde Naughton referred to proposed flood defences in Galway and the work proposed for the OPW.  I compliment the OPW on the works it has carried out in many parts of the country on flood defences.  I am thinking of areas such as Clonmel, Waterford and Kilkenny where the OPW has done an outstanding job.  It should be complimented on it.</p> <p>Senator Eamonn Coghlan referred to his Points for Life initiative and outlined the successful seminar for teachers that was held yesterday.  We will certainly offer any help we can to the Senator in this regard.  It is a wonderful initiative that should be promoted in schools throughout the country.</p> <p>Senator David Cullinane referred to technological universities and called for a debate on them.  With regard to the specific matter of Waterford and Carlow institutes of technology, we are awaiting the report of Mr. Michael Kelly.  As he mentioned, many of the delays were due to internal politics in the system.  I hope we are making progress.  The Government mooted that it would investigate the possibility of a university for the south east, and it included this in its programme for Government.  We have seen action on it.  That is a far cry from having letters from former taoisigh days before elections were called, and that was the end of it where universities were concerned.  We are making progress and I would like to see a lot more on this matter.  I hope there will be a development soon.</p> <p>Senator Denis Landy referred to the implementation of a clinical programme for asthma.  There is certainly a need for further action on that.  The step of free GP care for the under-sixes will assist with this matter.</p> <p>Senator Mooney referred to the Palestinian village Susiya and to the need for balance in outlining the Israeli position.  We had a Commencement Debate matter on that this morning.  It is important that there be balance in all our discussions.</p> <p>On the Greek crisis, I will try to have the Minister here next week.  It is an evolving set of circumstances.  Ireland supports the objective of having a sustainable and mutually beneficial agreement acceptable to all concerned that would return Greece to growth within the eurozone.  We want to Greece stay in the eurozone, that is the Government's position.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, is currently attending a euro group meeting and the Taoiseach will be attending a special meeting of the European Council.  We will wait to see what proposals are discussed at the meetings and, if possible, I will try to arrange a briefing for the House next week.  However, we have a very busy schedule and will be sitting all week.</p> <p>Senator Paul Coghlan referred to the new marker to combat fuel smuggling.  This is to be welcomed.  We have seen an all-agency approach to the creation of this new marker.  I agree with the Senator that there is a need for a task force to deal with diesel laundering and for all agencies to be involved.  Senator Heffernan suggested that the Provisional IRA is still actively involved in this area.</p> <p>With regard to the road infrastructure between Cork and Limerick, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, would welcome any proposals that Senator Heffernan has.  I am sure that if the Senator wrote to the Minister he would take on board his points and discuss them with him.  We had a Commencement debate on the matter a month or so ago, as the Cathaoirleach mentioned, but I am sure the Minister will listen to the Senator's proposals.  I agree with the Senator on the Cork&ndash;Limerick road.  There are many blackspots, just as there are blackspots on the road between Waterford and Limerick, which is one of the very poorest roads.</p> <p>Senator Martin Conway referred to the aviation industry and the creation of 100 jobs in leasing.  They are to be welcomed.</p> <p>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill referred to the undocumented Irish in the USA and to the possibility of their availing of a visa waiver scheme.  As the Senator mentioned, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, has been actively involved, as has the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan.  I am sure they will continue to be actively involved in this area and I will bring the matter to their attention.</p> <p>Senator Kelly referred to wind farms and the need for An Bord Plean&aacute;la to take greater cognisance of people's concerns rather than the concerns of swans and so on, as he mentioned.  He urged the Minister to come forward with the new guidelines and implement them as soon as possible.

The Minister regrets that she is unable to be present here today.  However, she welcomes the fact that it was possible to have this Bill initiated in the Seanad so that Senators will have the first opportunity to comment on its provisions.</p> <p>The Bill is short and technical in nature but it is of significance in terms of enabling us to fulfil our EU obligations.  It is also of significance because the convention to which it relates has the potential, over time, to create a more predictable legal environment for companies which do business with third countries.  That predictability should, in turn, encourage companies to be more confident in terms of expanding their trading relationships with such countries.</p> <p>The purpose of the Bill is to make provision for the measures which are required to ensure that the Hague Convention of 30 June 2005, on choice of court agreements, can function effectively within the Irish legal system.  The convention was negotiated under the auspices of the Hague Conference on Private International Law.  The Hague conference is a body which facilitates the development of multilateral legal instruments across a range of areas.  In the past, conventions have been negotiated which touch upon commercial matters, family law matters and administrative cooperation.  Apart from EU member states, the Hague conference includes among its membership countries such as China, the US, Japan, Australia, Canada and Russia.</p> <p>The convention is geared towards the promotion of choice of court agreements in international business to business contracts.  Within the EU there is already a legal framework in place which ensures that choice of court agreements are honoured.  However, there is no equivalent framework at the international level and the convention will fill this gap.</p> <p>Negotiations on the choice of court convention, to use a convenient shorthand, concluded in June 2005 after a negotiating period of over two years.  This convention is much narrower in scope to one which had originally been contemplated.  It evolved out of earlier work which had been ongoing within the Hague conference for a number of years.  That work was very ambitious in aim and would have resulted in a convention which prescribed a list of approved grounds of jurisdiction as well as a list of prohibited grounds of jurisdiction.  Judgments based on the former list would be entitled to recognition and enforcement in other contracting states to the convention, and would obviously have facilitated the circulation of a greater volume of judgments at global level.  However, it became clear that it would not be possible to bring this work to a successful conclusion.  Eventually, it was agreed to work on a convention with a reduced scope which would deal only with choice of court agreements in international commercial cases.</p> <p>The European Commission presented a proposal for a Council Decision authorising signature of the convention in September 2008.  One of the reasons informing the presentation of the proposal at that time was the perception that, when in force, the convention would reduce legal uncertainty for EU companies trading outside of the EU.  Following the adoption of the proposal by the Council, the convention was signed in April 2009.  It was also signed by the US in January of the same year.</p> <p>The European Union has exclusive competence in respect of the matters governed by the convention and, therefore, Ireland will not be ratifying the convention in its own right.  At the time of the signature of the convention the European Community, as it then was, made a declaration indicating that it exercised competence over all of the matters governed by the convention.  Also, that member states would be bound by the convention by virtue of its conclusion by the Community.  This is a routine arrangement for international instruments where the EU has exclusive competence.</p> <p>Several years elapsed before the Commission came forward with a proposal for the conclusion of the convention in January 2014.  The main reason for the lapse of time was the need to bring to a conclusion the revision work on the Brussels I regulation on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters.  That work was brought to a conclusion in December 2012.  The new regulation which resulted has applied since January of this year.  It contains amendments which align the choice of court provisions that had existed at EU level with those provided for in the Hague Convention, thereby facilitating the approval of the choice of court convention by the EU.</p> <p>The proposal for a decision authorising approval of the convention was adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs Council at its meeting on 4 and 5 December 2014.  Under its terms the instrument of approval was to be deposited within one month of 5 June 2015 and, in fact, the deposit took place on 11 June last.  Mexico had already acceded to the convention in September 2007.  Under the terms of the convention, approval by the EU triggers the entry into force of the convention on I October of this year.  The timetable for EU approval was influenced by the fact that, as part of the negotiation process, it was agreed that member states would be given some time to make any legislative changes which were needed at the domestic level prior to the approval of the convention which, brings us to where we are today.</p> <p>In general terms, a typical choice of court agreement will specify that the courts of a particular State should have jurisdiction to hear proceedings under the contract which exists between the parties.  Such agreements are widely viewed as being beneficial in terms of creating a stable trading environment for international commerce.  Their value is critically dependent upon the extent to which the parties can be confident that their agreement will be upheld by a court if litigation ensues.  This arises both in regard to the court chosen being willing to take jurisdiction and also in regard to other courts being willing to recognise and enforce the judgment given on foot of the choice of court agreement.  To take a concrete example, a company may be reluctant to do business with a particular State because it either mistrusts or is unfamiliar with its legal system.  If a supplier of goods is confident that in the event of any issues arising in regard to the payment of the goods which have been delivered, a court in which it trusts will have jurisdiction to rule on the dispute, he or she may be emboldened to proceed with the deal.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Jimmy Deenihan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=306"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=306&amp;amp;pid=JimmyDeenihan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The other party, who wishes to receive the goods, may be equally happy to agree to a court in which they, too, have confidence.  In the alternative, the fact that the state, with which the supplier wishes to do business, is a contracting party to the choice of court convention may encourage a feeling of security in terms of being willing to accept a choice of court agreement in favour of that country.  In this regard, it is noteworthy that research exists which indicates, particularly in the case of large businesses, that significant business decisions can be influenced by uncertainty regarding the courts that would resolve disputes or the law that would apply to the contract.  In effect, lack of legal certainty may function as a barrier to trade.</p><p>The convention aims to ensure the effectiveness of choice of court agreements by providing guarantees that the chosen court will hear the case when proceedings are brought before it.  Linked with this is a requirement that any other court before which proceedings are pending must refuse to entertain them.  Finally, provision is made to ensure judgments given under the convention will be entitled to recognition and enforcement in those states which are contracting parties to it.  None of these principles is absolute but the overall aim is to find the right balance between flexibility and certainty.</p><p>I will now deal in some detail with the key provisions of the convention and highlight the articles which are probably the most important in terms of the overall content of the convention.</p><p>Article 1 defines the scope of the convention.  The case must be international in nature, the choice of court agreement must be exclusive and the subject matter must fall within the range of what is normally understood by the term civil and commercial.  Article 3 sets out the formal requirements that must be satisfied if a choice of court agreement is to fall under the convention.</p><p>Article 5 is a key provision in that it mandates the court designated in the agreement to hear the case unless the agreement is null and void under the law of that state.  Article 5 is complemented by Article 6 which requires a court not designated in the agreement to suspend or dismiss the proceedings even if it has jurisdiction under its national law.  There are a number of exceptions to this rule, for example, where giving effect to the agreement would be manifestly contrary to the public policy of the state of the court seised or where the chosen court has decided not to hear the case.</p><p>Article 8 sets out the principle that a judgment given by a court of a contracting state which is designated in an exclusive choice of court agreement must be recognised and enforced in another contracting state in accordance with the convention's provisions.  By way of exception to this principle, Article 9 sets out the grounds upon which recognition and enforcement may be refused, for example, where there has been procedural fraud or where a party lacked the capacity to conclude the agreement under the law of the state where enforcement is sought.</p><p>Article 13 lists the documents to be produced when enforcement is being applied for.  Article 16 deals with transitional arrangements and sets out the basic principle that the convention will only apply to exclusive choice of court agreements concluded after the convention comes into force for the state of the chosen court.  Articles 19 to 22, inclusive, contain provisions setting out the range of declarations which a contracting state may make.  In this regard Article 19 permits a contracting state to refuse to apply the convention to cases where, except for the choice of court clause, there is no connection between that state and the parties or the dispute.</p><p>Article 20 allows a state not to enforce a judgment where all the factors, other than the choice of court clause, are internal to it.  Article 21 allows a state to exclude a specific matter from the scope of the convention and the EU has availed of this provision for certain types of insurance contract.  Article 22 allows for the making of reciprocal declarations to extend the scope of the convention to cover non-exclusive choice of court agreements.  An example of such an agreement would be one which designated the courts of two or more contracting states to the exclusion of all others.</p><p>Article 26 deals with the relationship of the convention with other international instruments and is of interest because it deals with the situation where a regional economic integration organisation such as the EU becomes a contracting party to the convention.  In essence, where a case is purely regional in terms of the residence of the parties, the convention gives way to any relevant regional instrument which might exist.  Furthermore, it will not affect the rules governing the recognition or enforcement of judgments between the member states of the regional organisation.  Within the EU the recognition and enforcement regime is much more liberal than that which exists under the convention.</p><p>Earlier in my speech I mentioned that Mexico has already acceded to the convention.  Both the US and Singapore have signed it and it is hoped that EU approval will encourage other states to become parties to it.  Ratification of the convention by as many states as possible should encourage commercial actors to avail of choice of court clauses when doing business in those states because they can be secure in the knowledge that they can rely upon its provisions.</p><p>I am pleased to say that Ireland has a solid and deepening trade relationship with Mexico.  In 2013, trade between the countries was of the order of &euro;1.277 million, comprising &euro;928 million in the export from Ireland of goods and services and &euro;349 million in the import from Mexico of goods and services.  Ireland's principal merchandise exports to Mexico are soft drink concentrate and chemical materials and products.  Ireland's main merchandise imports from Mexico are medical devices, miscellaneous plastics, stents, and telecommunications and sound equipment.  The value of Ireland's exports of goods to Mexico in 2014 increased by 76%, from &euro;692 million to &euro;1.216 billion.</p><p>Of the states that have signed the convention, the US is Ireland's biggest goods export market, with the value of goods exported in 2014 standing at almost &euro;20 billion.  As a trading bloc, the 28 member states of the European Union traded goods worth &euro;515 billion with the US in the same year.  The &euro;54 billion trade between Ireland and the USA in the preceding year, 2013, can be broken down evenly between imports and exports of both goods and services.  Ireland's most significant exports to the US are organic chemicals, which are mainly used in the pharmaceutical industry, and medical and pharmaceutical products.  Ireland's main imports from the US are royalties and licences and research and development services.</p><p>Trade with Singapore is understandably more modest.  Trade between Ireland and Singapore in 2013 was valued at a little over &euro;2 billion, broken down as &euro;1.359 billion in the export of goods and services, and &euro;717 million in imports.  The trade relationship is mainly focused on computers, computer parts and storage devices.  The EU trade bloc has a healthy trade relationship with Singapore, expressed in trade in goods to the value of &euro;47 billion in 2013.</p><p>I mentioned earlier that EU accession to the convention should have a beneficial effect in terms of encouraging other states which are members of the Hague Conference on Private International Law to become parties to it.  I should add that the convention is also open to states which are not members of the conference.  Even in markets where the EU is already very active, widespread adherence to the convention could have the potential to lead to further growth in trade.  To take two examples where Ireland would have a specific interest, Ireland's trade relationship with Australia in goods was valued at &euro;802 million in 2013, while trade in goods between the EU as a whole and Australia in that year was valued at &euro;33 billion.  Of the EU's &euro;59 billion trade in goods with Canada in 2013, &euro;2.5 billion came from the exchange of goods between Ireland and Canada.</p><p>The details I have just outlined highlight the importance to all our economies of international trade.  The progressive elimination of barriers to trade means that now, more than ever, predictability and certainty are vital in the area of business and commercial relationships within Europe and beyond.  Business people need to be sure they can readily enforce contracts and secure judgments for what can, in some cases, be large sums of money.  Measures aimed at promoting such security have the twin effects of protecting existing trade and encouraging new trade.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Jimmy Deenihan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=306"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=306&amp;amp;pid=JimmyDeenihan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In recent years a lot of emphasis has been placed at EU level on "justice for growth".  The Bill and the convention to which it relates are a small but practical example of the way in which justice policy can contribute towards improving the conditions for EU businesses which are active in trading with partners outside the European Union.</p><p>The Bill contains ten sections, all of which are technical in nature.  The key provisions are contained in sections 5 and 6.  Section 5 provides that an application under the convention for the recognition and enforcement in the State of a judgment shall be made to the Master of the High Court who may make an order for the recognition or enforcement of only part of a judgment.  Section 6 provides that if an enforcement order has been made in respect of a judgment, the judgment shall, to the extent authorised by the order, be of the same force and effect as a judgment of the High Court and that proceedings for its enforcement may be taken accordingly.</p><p>Other provisions are ancillary to these sections.  Section 1 contains relevant definitions which are self-explanatory.  </p><p>Section 2 authorises the Minister for Justice and Equality to make certain orders in relation to convention matters, most notably that a specified state is a state bound by the convention or that particular declarations or communications have been made.  While such orders are in force, they will be of evidential value.</p><p>Section 3 states the convention has force of law in the State, while section 4 provides that judicial notice shall be taken of the convention, the explanatory report prepared in relation to it and relevant court judgments.  This provision is in aid of the uniform interpretation of the convention which is important in an international agreement of this nature.</p><p>Section 7 deals with provisions in enforcement orders for the payment of interest on judgments and the payment of costs.  Section 8 deals with the proof and admissibility of certain judgments and related documents and translations.  Section 9 contains a technical provision to bring section 20A of the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments Act, 1998 into line with the provisions of section 7 of the Bill.  Section 10 contains standard citation and commencement provisions.</p><p>As I indicated, the European Union has exclusive competence in the matters governed by the convention and Ireland will not be ratifying it in its own right.  Nonetheless, implementing measures are required to ensure the convention can be applied within our legal system and the purpose of the Bill is to make provision for these measures.  I look forward to hearing the views of Senators on the Bill which the Minister hopes can be enacted before the convention comes into force on 1 October.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

The Bill will clarify the rules surrounding the international agreements which outline within them which court shall hear a case in the event of a dispute.  Acceding to the convention will promote greater legal certainty in cross-border business and create a climate more favourable to international trade and investment.  The increasing codification of international dispute resolution mechanisms provides the Irish legal sector with an excellent opportunity to become a world centre for the hearing of legal dispute cases.</p><p>As a common law and stable eurozone jurisdiction with strong international relations and in which people speak English, the Government should be exploring ways to increase commercial opportunities in this sector.  The Minister should examine whether it would be possible to create the legal equivalent of the Irish Financial Services Centre to deal with international legal disputes.  There is a niche market that could be exploited.  I hope the Government, at Cabinet level, will look seriously at the significant possibility it could provide for the country.  It would be a win-win.  I have absolutely no doubt that Ireland is recognised internationally, in Australia, China, South America and elsewhere, as a very effective and efficient legal services centre.  The added bonus of having an international court to deal with disputes under the Hague Convention would be a major boost to the country.</p><p>I have no difficulty with the principle of the Bill.  The convention contains three basic rules that give effect to the choice of court agreement.  First, the court must, in principle, hear the case under Article 5; second, any court not chosen must, in principle, decline to hear the case under Article 6; and, third, any judgment rendered by the chosen court must be recognised and enforced in other contracting states, except where there are grounds for refusal.  </p><p>I wish to bring one matter to the Minister of State's attention which constitutes an extraordinary departure from Oireachtas legislation.  Section 4 of the Choice of Court (Hague Convention) Bill 2015 provides that a judicial note shall be taken of the convention and the explanatory report on it prepared by Mr. Trevor Hartley and Mr. Masato Dogauchi and relevant court judgments.  I understand this provision is in aid of the uniform interpretation of the convention.  I am not taking in any way from the fantastic work these two academics have done.  However, I am concerned about this unprecedented inclusion of a reference, in essence, an academic piece, in a section of a Bill proposed to be passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to clarify whether it is appropriate to include this specific reference in the Bill.  I would also like to know if the provision is being included in primary legislation in other parliaments of states which have signed up to the convention.  I would like to ask how the Judiciary will be prepared to implement the Bill.  The explanatory report on section 4 is more than 100 pages long.  Will the Minister clearly outline what information or training will be provided for the Judiciary on implementation of the Bill?</p><p>I must stress my unease at the inclusion of a specific reference to an explanatory report in primary legislation and look forward to hearing an explanation for it.  In my 20 years of service to the Oireachtas, in both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, I have never seen such an unprecedented and extraordinary departure in the proposed inclusion of the names of two academics in section 4 of the Bill.  It is best expressed by the Latin phrase<i>inclusio unius est exclusio alterius.  </i>Would the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, insert in a Finance Bill the name of the extraordinary civil servant Mr. T.K. Whitaker who worked with different Governments?  Would Mr. John Kelly or others who did outstanding work on constitutional law have their names included in a Bill?  I forewarn the Minister that while the Fianna Fail Party totally supports the concept behind the legislation which it would like to see enacted, I will table an amendment on Committee and Report Stages, if necessary, to have section 4 amended to exclude the names of the two academics concerned.  I am sure they have done extraordinary work, but it represents a departure from parliamentary procedures in the Oireachtas.  I have never seen enshrined in legislation the names of two European academics.  I ask the Minister of State and the Minister for Justice and Equality to reflect on the logic of my contribution.  I am vehemently opposed to this proposal which the Fianna F&aacute;il Party will oppose.  I do not want to muddy the waters because this is a good Bil, but naming individuals in section 4 is a departure from precedent and not something with which I could live.  I will oppose it vehemently.</p></speech>

It was a very difficult time for young people and their families, particularly the families of students participating in the J1 visa programme.  He represented the Government with dignity in very difficult circumstances.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am keen to put that much on the record of the House.</p><p>I agree with Senator O'Donovan that few people would have an issue with what is being proposed in respect of this legislation.  In fact there are golden opportunities.  I have said before that I believe we should have a legal hub here, the equivalent of the IFSC.  As Senator O'Donovan has pointed out, correctly, we are an English-speaking nation that has done an extraordinary work in terms of international relations in the area of humanitarian work.  We are a neutral nation respected throughout the world and that is strong currency.  We should be using that currency to create jobs in this area.</p><p>The country is already internationally recognised in the area of arbitration.  I believe with the recent legislation on mediation, the work done by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality and the commitments in place in terms of mediation we will become an international hub in mediating international disputes.  This legislation provides us with a golden opportunity to become a centre of international excellence in the area of dealing with commercial disputes.  We should become the country of choice where people seek to go to resolve their disputes.  This legislation is an incremental step in the right direction to ensure that we can create such a hub.</p><p>Many other things need to be done in this area - I have spoken about this before.  The Oireachtas committee has done a good deal of work in the area of e-conveyancing.  At the moment if someone buys a property in this country it can take anything between four and eight weeks to deal with conveyancing, the transferring of documents and everything that goes with it.  If this was done electronically it would take between four and eight days.  Let us consider the likes of a big business purchasing large corporations or properties.  Even more time is involved in such cases, especially if we throw in due diligence and everything that goes with it.  If we were to become a centre of excellence and embrace e-conveyancing then we would be augmenting our reputation as being an information and communications technology centre of excellence.  The European head offices of six of the seven major ICT companies are based in this country.  This is where the jobs are, in particular the high-end jobs.  This morning in the House I was pleased to point out that 100 jobs have been created by an aircraft leasing company based in Shannon and Dublin.  There will be 50 jobs in Shannon and 50 jobs in Dublin.  We are considered the world's leading country when it comes to aircraft leasing.  There are so many other areas where we could become leaders with the proper innovation and by incorporating positive steps, including this legislation.  Certainly that is the case in terms of dispute resolution.  We are getting there in the case of arbitration and we will get there in the area of mediation.  The area under this legislation is an open door.  We need to drive forward in job creation.</p><p>I suggest that we should consider basing any such hub outside of Dublin.  Simply because the IFSC is in Dublin does not mean that if we were to go down a similar line and create a legal hub, it should not be based outside of Dublin.  We need to be mindful that we are working on broadband and we need to ensure that within a few years we will be totally accessible in most areas of the country.  I have in mind places like Shannon or other places outside of Dublin that could be considered.  I believe anything up to 30,000 or 40,000 jobs could be created if we were to make this a major initiative.</p><p>Senator O'Donovan raised a point about naming people in the legislation.  I bow to his greater experience and that of the Minister of State in these Houses over mine and I take his word that it has not happened before.  I am unsure of the reason for it but I imagine the Minister will clarify it on Committee Stage.  When legislation is good and when it is being embraced and endorsed across the House, we should simply make a point in the House and send the message out; we should not be dividing.  I strongly suggest that if there is a misunderstanding it could be clarified on Committee Stage.  I have no doubt that whether it is the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, or whoever takes Committee Stage, clarity will be forthcoming.</p><p>It is great to see yet another justice Bill initiated in this House.  I understand more justice Bills have been initiated in this House than from any other Department.  It is good for this House.  The people gave us a renewed mandate in 2013.  Given the constraints within which we are operating we have delivered on that mandate as best we could.  We have a unique opportunity, which the other House probably does not have, to analyse and debate legislation as well as enhance it and discuss the bigger picture.  I welcome the fact that the Government and the Minister have opted to initiate the legislation in this House.  I look forward to seeing this legislation passed through the House in time for the ratification process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-07-08a.98" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1173" speakername="Lorraine Higgins" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015070800002#T00200"><p>As has been outlined already, the purpose of the Bill is to make provision for the measures that are required to ensure that the Hague Convention of 30 June 2005 on Choice of Court Agreements can function effectively within the Irish legal system.  The convention comes into force on 1 October this year and Irish legislation will have to be updated to reflect this.</p> <p>It is important to be clear.  The convention we are discussing is designed to facilitate choice of court agreements between commercial parties.  While such a framework already exists within the EU, no corresponding agreement exists internationally unless we consider the likes of arbitration, which is an alternative dispute resolution mechanism.  Therefore, while such court agreements are abided by within the EU, internationally their application is far more difficult.  As I understand it, the proposed convention would provide the necessary legal framework to remedy this situation.</p> <p>Similar to many provisions in arbitration agreements, choice of court agreements usually stipulate that the court of a specific state has the jurisdiction to hear cases based on the contract that exists between the parties.  These types of agreements are generally seen as advantageous for commercial purposes, as outlined already by previous speakers, as they are designed to facilitate uniform trading across borders.  The extent to which this arrangement works well is reliant on how assured parties are that their contract will be upheld by a court in the advent of legal proceedings.  This is in reference to both the court requested being able to hear the case and in respect of other courts being obliged to acknowledge and enforce any judgment handed down by the choice of court agreement as well.</p> <p>However, I am compelled to wonder what the downsides might be in allowing companies to cherry-pick which jurisdictions and which courts to oversee their disputes.  In such a context, I wonder about national legal mechanisms being bound by the rulings of international commercial courts, such as the newly-convened institution in Singapore.  I have reservations on the effect or status of our national courts and perhaps our competitiveness, particularly from an arbitration viewpoint given that many hearings take place in this country and this area has been successful in recent years.  If we can replicate the success of the international arbitration hearings held in Dublin it would be fantastic.  Senator Conway has alluded to the reality and the need for a legal area akin to the IFSC in this country in order that we can make the most of our competitive standing.  He also referenced the facts that we have enviable legal infrastructure already in place, we are English speaking, we are from a common law jurisdiction, we are on the edge of Europe and we are a member of the European Union.</p> <p>While I appreciate that time, a competent legal infrastructure - something we already have in Ireland - and flexibility are significant issues that companies always consider, it is likely that these are among the factors that have attracted many companies to locate in Ireland in the first place.  We need to ensure that situations do not arise whereby big businesses shirk their legal responsibilities to the State and the people by sidestepping any laws in favour of another jurisdiction.  I call on the House to consider this on the next Stage.</p></speech>

It is a common sense Bill and one that Sinn F&eacute;in supports.  It is not very often I agree with a Bill relating to EU and global justice issues because some of these EU initiatives overtly impact on Irish sovereignty and deal with issues that are not entirely in keeping with democratic or human rights principles.  It recalls the old saying that if the European Union applied to join itself, it would not have much hope of being accepted given its clear lack of democracy at times.  We have seen how that has played out in recent times.</p><p>That said, we have to consider this Bill on its merits and the provisions of the convention make sense.  Christophe Bernasconi writes in the <i>International Financial Law Review</i>: &ldquo;A global agreement on the recognition and enforcement of private rulings makes so much sense it&rsquo;s difficult to understand why it isn&rsquo;t in place already.&rdquo;  I commend the Minister of State on moving this Bill forward and bringing to an end the delay in the ratification of this convention.</p><p>The Hague Convention of 30 June 2005 on Choice of Court Agreements aims at ensuring the effectiveness of choice of court agreements between parties to international commercial transactions.  The convention and this Bill are not part of a globalisation of criminal jurisdiction nor do they have any possible human rights implications.  The convention was focused in its approach and is aimed purely at promoting greater legal certainty for cross-border business and creating a climate that is favourable to international investment and trade.  This is something that Ireland as an island nation must be part of and for that reason Sinn F&eacute;in will support this Bill in its efforts to ensure this is the case.</p><p>I have outlined previously Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s concerns about a super-state EU or global legal architecture.  We have had many debates in this House on the institutions of the EU.  I have also spoken of the need to be mindful of human rights law in respect of Bills that seek to create such architecture.  This Bill, however, is different.  It is specifically intended to address cross-border co-operation among courts in commercial contractual situations, which has been a problem for some time.  Judges in different countries have tended to disagree about issues of jurisdiction and the enforcement of foreign rulings.  This convention has the potential to address such disagreements to provide certainty and conformity, both of which are essential in the modern day international practice of private law.  It ensures courts respect and give effect to selection clauses which are so common in modern business to business contracts.</p><p>The conformity benefits Ireland&rsquo;s attraction for foreign direct investment, FDI.  Although such direct investment is important, we would caution against an over-reliance on FDI.  It must not adversely impact on the growth of indigenous industry.  We also recognise the importance of trade and investment.  This Bill would support those concepts.  It is a short but important Bill to ratify the convention.  It is long overdue and I welcome it.  We do not oppose it and I doubt we will submit any amendments to it on Committee or Report Stages.  I hope it will be of benefit to the State and the possibility of job creation arising from it remains to be seen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-07-08a.100" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1150" speakername="Colm Burke" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015070800002#U00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and welcome this Bill.  As one who has been involved in court procedures I recall dealing with a company in the Minister of State&rsquo;s constituency.  Its first contract was made in Ireland, the matter went to arbitration and we spent 11 days arguing about whether there were one or five contracts.  If there were five another two were made in another jurisdiction.  It took 11 days before the arbitrator decided.  I had a very difficult experience with that matter.</p><p>At European level there is already a very structured system in respect of a ruling on contracts, whether service contracts or contracts for the purchase of goods.  This one involves dealing at an international level.  Article 3 of the convention sets out quite clearly how the matter is to proceed:<blockquote>&ldquo;exclusive choice of court agreement&rdquo; means an agreement concluded by two or more parties that meets the requirements of paragraph <i>c)</i>and designates, for the purpose of deciding disputes which have arisen or may arise in connection with a particular legal relationship, the courts of one Contracting State or one or more specific courts of one Contracting State to the exclusion of the jurisdiction of any other courts; ...<br /><br />[and] ... <br /><br />an exclusive choice of court agreement must be concluded or documented &ndash;i) in writing; or<br /><br />ii) by any other means of communication which renders information accessible so as to be usable for subsequent reference;</blockquote>It is quite clear what the convention sets out and it is important that we now have such a huge volume of international trade in Ireland.  Before now we mainly exported and provided services to the United Kingdom.  Now we play in a global market and it is important that we have proper procedures in place to deal with the sale of goods or the supply of services.</p><p>The difficulty with the contracts I mentioned at the outset apply to any company going abroad.  The initial contract might be in writing but an issue may arise about further work to be done and it is important to set it out in writing.  I also had experience of dealing with a German building company that came into Ireland which entered into a contract to do work and did more than &euro;1 million worth of work without setting out anything in writing.  I recall having to collect a cheque for it on Christmas Eve for &euro;1 million and send it back to Germany.  After Christmas I asked how it had done work on a site without having anything in writing and the response was, &ldquo;We were told when we came to Ireland you took everyone at their word.&rdquo;  That to an extent explains our banking crisis.  Maybe everyone took us at our word when in many cases issues should have been set out in writing.</p><p>Article 3 sets out that it must be:<blockquote>i) in writing; or<br /><br />ii) by any other means of communication which renders information accessible so as to be usable for subsequent reference;</blockquote>It is extremely important that people recognise, if they are in another jurisdiction, the importance of making sure for the court that is to adjudicate in any dispute that it is set out in black and white in writing.  It seems that business moves so fast and can change in a very short time and agreements are reached without any formal documents being exchanged.  That is the importance of this convention, making sure we have recognition of what court is to deal with a dispute.  This is welcome.</p><p>We are putting this into legislation, which gives jurisdiction to the Master of the High Court.  I know it is presumed there is a right of appeal but there is no reference in the Bill to a right of appeal to the High Court if there is a dispute on the Master&rsquo;s decision.  Can that be clarified?  I take it there is a right of appeal if for some reason the Master decided not to give recognition to the judgment of another jurisdiction but I am surprised there is no reference to it in this Bill.  Could the Minister of State clarify that issue?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colm Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2353"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is an automatic right of appeal but it would be useful to clarify the matter.  I thank the Minister of State and his Department for their work on this matter since it first arose in 2005.

This is a somewhat technical Bill but I appreciate the welcoming and open atmosphere in which our discussion took place, which reflects the fact it is not controversial legislation.  Notwithstanding its technical nature, the Bill will play a part in supporting and promoting Ireland as a successful trading nation.  The development and maintenance of trade relations are important at any time but they are particularly important to Ireland and the European Union at a time as we emerge from past economic difficulties.  By reflecting a whole of government approach, the Bill demonstrates how various Departments can contribute to the promotion of exports.</p> <p>Senators will appreciate that Ireland is a trading nation.  As I noted in my opening statement, legal certainty and predictability can contribute to the progressive elimination of barriers to trade and enable business and commercial relationships to flourish both within the EU and externally.  Commercial bodies need to be certain that they can readily enforce contracts and judgments on what in some cases can be significant amounts.  In a small way, this Bill and the convention it implements can protect and promote Irish business interests abroad by establishing a framework for upholding choice of court agreements in cases which end up before the courts of countries bound by the convention.  The guarantees offered by this framework will allow parties to trade with greater confidence than heretofore.</p> <p>While the legislation is mandated by our membership of the European Union, it is in our interest to legislate in a progressive fashion in this area.  The convention fills a void in the current international legal framework, as virtual no treaty relationship exists in this area between individual member states and the EU's main trading partners.  In this context, an impact assessment prepared by the Commission suggests that uncertainty regarding the appropriate court to resolve a dispute was a factor taken into account in making significant business decisions and was potentially a barrier to trade.  The assessment also noted that the majority of commercial contracts contained provisions dealing with dispute resolutions and a significant percentage included an exclusive choice of court clause.  The Bill is largely an exercise in the promotion of legal certainty.  There will be an opportunity to explore these matters further on Committee Stage.</p> <p>Senator O'Donovan referred to section 4.  The reference to the explanatory report is not without precedent.  A similar reference was contained in legislation relating to the Lugano Convention and the Brussels I Convention.  Our Judiciary is comfortable with such references but judges are not required to consider the reports.  Senator Conway raised a number of issues, including the possibility of promoting Ireland as a legal hub.  Legislation is being developed to promote us as a venue for alternative dispute resolution and further opportunities may arise for more traditional court-based litigation.  Given their legal backgrounds, Senators Higgins and O'Donovan will agree there are significant opportunities in this area.  Perhaps we have not promoted ourselves sufficiently as a country in regard to dispute resolution.</p> <p>The convent complements the existing arbitration regime.  Many larger companies would prefer to resolve their disputes through arbitration but SMEs may prefer a resolution in open court.  In the absence of the conventions, companies have freedom of choice on the way in which they resolve their disputes, but the convention grants a degree of certainty regarding the ability of parties to ensure their choices are honoured.</p> <p>Senator Burke referred to decisions of the Master of the High Court.

As Members know, the working group was chaired by Dr. Maurice Manning, a former Member of the House.  He is most welcome, with another former Member, Mr. Joe O'Toole.  I invite Dr. Manning to make his presentation.</p></speech>

We had a full debate on the report the last day we were here when we made opening statements which are available and in which we outlined the way in which the working party had operated and the principles we felt should be part of any body of Seanad reforms.  We worked on the fact that everything had to be done within the framework of the Constitution and outlined various ways by which the electorate could be greatly expanded, effectively to the point of universal suffrage, while at the same time retaining as far as possible the vocational nature of the Seanad.  We tried to go back to first principles, to the House the founders of Seanad &Eacute;ireann had envisaged.  In our report we tried to indicate the powers, role and functions that would be appropriate to such a reform.</p> <p>We noted clearly that the House had been in a state of constant reform in the past decade or so and that the question of reform had concerned and engaged the attention of many Members.  We also noted that many of the reforms made would - some as they were and some capable of being developed - form the basis for the role we envisaged was intended for Seanad &Eacute;ireann as a body that would not be in competition with D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann but which would fulfil a different role and do many of the things not being done in the First House.  That is what we outlined the last day when my colleague went into detail - he is prepared to do so again - on how some of the changes proposed would operate in practice.  We were very pleased with the response from Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  There was a general welcome for both the idea of reform and some of the proposals made.  There were some constructive suggestions and we are very glad to be back here today to continue the debate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-07-08a.111" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1130" speakername="Maurice Cummins" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015070800002#CC00400"><p>I welcome former Senators Maurice Manning and Joe O'Toole.  In our previous debate on Seanad reform I expressed the view that this should be the last report on the issue and that we should move on many of its proposals.  Many Members have expressed concerns to me and in the House about several aspects of the report.  I hope they will outline their concerns because this is their last chance to have their say on the report before a Bill is brought before the House in the next session.  The Taoiseach has informed me that it is his intention to set up an implementation group early to move on matters, with a view to having a Seanad reform Bill pass through both Houses during the term of office of the Government.</p> <p>On the Order of Business Senator Darragh O'Brien said it was mentioned on the RTE website that the Taoiseach was meeting group leaders in the Seanad today.  I have not been able to speak to the Taoiseach, but his officials have informed me that he intends to meet group Leaders in the D&aacute;il today to discuss the report.  I have no further information for the House in that regard.</p> <p>On the last occasion we discussed the report I dealt specifically with the reform of the role, powers and business of the House.  I made it clear, as the report does, that the primary role of the House was the scrutiny, amendment and initiation of legislation.  I welcome the recognition of the working group that in strengthening and refining the role of the Seanad a stronger institutional system must be prioritised and that Seanad Members should have access to adequate research services, specialist support services, training facilities and technological services.  We all share these sentiments.  We should have parity of esteem with Members of the other House in all areas that affect our role and the performance of our duties.</p> <p>The Seanad has sought to augment its role and functions.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maurice Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2003"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2003&amp;amp;pid=MauriceCummins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As the report outlines, these innovations provide a sound starting point for a clear definition and consolidation of the ways in which Seanad &Eacute;ireann can make a distinctive contribution to the work of the Oireachtas.  Our engagement with our MEPs, European Commissioner and officials has brought a new dimension to our work.  We had our Commissioner here early last week.  Our proposal to scrutinise the EU work programme in many areas would add to this work.</p><p>The public consultation process that was initiated has been a success.  Our most recent report on farm safety was published to great acclaim and the subject of a documentary on Oireachtas TV recently.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, will be in the House next week to debate the report with us.</p><p>The proposals for further debate on North&ndash;South Ministerial Council meetings are welcome, as are the proposals to consider the reports of regulators and other statutory inspectors, bearing in mind secondary legislation, etc.  To implement these proposals, the Government in power would have to buy in totally to the enhanced role of the House.  Ministers would have to be made available and regard attendance here as an important function, bearing in mind the new duties that would be assigned to the House.  This cannot be taken as a given considering what could occur under various Governments, as we all know on both sides of the House.  The Government must be serious and supportive of the House, which has not been the case in the past.  Future Governments must not regard it as an inconvenience but as a strong and integral part of our democratic system.</p><p>Let me refer to some of the contentious parts of the report, which deal mainly with how Senators are elected.  This matter has dominated all other reports and is one on which one will never have unanimity.  We are all clear on that point.</p><p>I favour the recommendation that 30 Members be elected by popular vote using the principle of a "one person, one vote" system.  That is fair.  People want to have a say in the election of Members to the Seanad.  The 30 seats recommended by the working group represents a fair balance in that regard.</p><p>I favour the retention of university seats, but Dr. Manning and Mr. O'Toole might clarify whether the proposal includes the other third level colleges.  The Government has not advanced its proposals to legitimise the will of the people in the referendum in this regard.  Do the recommendations imply that the university panel would remain as it is, or that the franchise would be extended to all third level colleges, as envisaged in the referendum passed by the people?</p><p>Extending the vote to include Irish citizens in Northern Ireland and the holders of Irish passports living overseas would present many logistical problems, some of which are outlined in the report.  Could we have circumstances in which more people outside the jurisdiction would vote in a Seanad election than voters within the jurisdiction?  This has been put to me by several members of the public.  Also put to me was the old chestnut of representation without taxation.</p><p>This is one of the main areas on which Members will probably dwell.  We need to be clear on the question of who could vote, how citizens would vote and the number who could vote.  I do not know how many Irish passport holders there are, but perhaps Mr. O&rsquo;Toole and Dr. Manning have that information.  If it were the case that more people outside the jurisdiction were voting than people within the jurisdiction, it would not be desirable.  This may not be envisaged under the proposals.</p><p>I will allow the rest of my colleagues to contribute.  Many have expressed concerns to me about the report.  I hope the sentiments they expressed to me personally will be aired in the House and put to the two gentlemen in order that they may address them.  This is our second time to deal with the report.  There were brief contributions from Members the last time, but they will have ten minutes each to contribute this evening.  They should be under no illusion that the Taoiseach has indicated that he will be setting up very soon the implementation group, with a view to having a Bill on Seanad reform passed during the term of office of the Government.</p></speech>

I thank the Leader for outlining his concerns, many of which I share.  As one who has relatively little experience in the Oireachtas but who has served in both the Seanad and the D&aacute;il, I very much value the role of the Seanad in the Oireachtas.  I have actually seen it at work in what some might call an unreformed Chamber.  I will make my remarks in the context of my belief the Seanad has not done a bad job during the years.  I have often said during debates with the Taoiseach, on the odd occasion he has seen fit to come here, that Seanad reform should take place in the context of overall Oireachtas reform.</p> <p>I refer to reform of the D&aacute;il, the committee system and the Seanad.  I will be political for one moment and state what is an absolute fact: since the Seanad has been in the crosshairs since the Taoiseach saw fit to put its abolition to the people, which proposal I am happy they rejected, it has nearly come to be regarded as the only Chamber that needs to be reformed.  I have seen the Seanad work very well.  I have seen Senators from all parties and none, on all panels and from universities, do a particularly good job in scrutinising legislation, which is our primary role.  As a Senator, I have written and published more legislation than I was able to produce in nearly four years in the D&aacute;il.  I have read more legislation than I did in the D&aacute;il as a Deputy.  I understand legislation a lot better for being in the Seanad.  People should actually realise this and respect the fact that the Seanad has done a very good job.  However, I have some concerns.  My party published a detailed Seanad reform document which I discussed with both Mr. Joe O&rsquo;Toole and Dr. Maurice Manning.  I am happy that many points made within the report they have published and are presenting to us again today encompass points made in many of the reform documents many of us have brought forward.  We want to see reform, albeit in the context of overall Oireachtas reform.  Any future Government should commit to doing this.</p> <p>I have grave concern about the manner in which this reform is being achieved.  My saying this is no reflection on the two gentlemen present.  The process is being rushed on the basis that the Taoiseach has said he will set up an implementation group that will produce legislation to be enacted before the end of the Government's term in office.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Darragh O'Brien:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2178"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If the term runs its full course then the Government will last until March or April 2016.  I expect the legislation will be quite detailed.  I have learned from my experience here that rushed legislation is poor legislation.</p><p>The composition of the implementation group is important.  I, again, would like to put on the record of the House how disappointed I am that a Member of the current Seanad, and in particular the Leader of the Seanad, Senator Maurice Cummins, was not included in the working group.  An existing Senator should have been included in the working group and I mean somebody who has worked through some reforms of the House.  My belief is no reflection on the two gentlemen present who did their job, along with their colleagues.  My grievance is more about who was selected by the Government to sit on the committee.  I believe that the implementation group must have a representative group from the existing Seanad.</p><p>I do not think the Taoiseach has woken up to the fact that the Seanad should have equality and parity of esteem with the other House because this evening he will meet party leaders of the D&aacute;il.  That includes my party leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, who is the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il in the D&aacute;il, plus Gerry Adams who is the leader of Sinn F&eacute;in in the D&aacute;il and the same for other party groups.  What is wrong with us?  I have had my moments with the Taoiseach but I am particularly interested in Seanad reform because I work here every single day.  It would have been appropriate for the leaders of the Seanad groups to be included for the meeting.  </p><p>That aside, I shall ask the delegation a few questions.  I appreciate all the work that both gentlemen and their colleagues have put into the report but I am concerned about the short space of time left.  How confident are both of them that legislation can be implemented during the remaining term of this Government?  Have they been advised of any timeframes by Government in regard to the publication of the legislation and on bringing it forward?  I heard Mr. Joe O'Toole say in the media that any changes would take place from the next Seanad election, not the one coming up but the one after that again.  </p><p>It is very important that all parties and Independent groupings sign up to Seanad reform.  As Senator Cummins has said, the problem with this report is that a number of reports already have been left on shelves.  A referendum was passed on extending the franchise to other universities but it was never implemented.  Even if legislation is passed in the D&aacute;il and Seanad during the term of this Government, it is down to the political parties or whoever is going to be in the next Government, whatever shape that Government is going to have, to drive forward these changes.</p><p>I am gravely concerned about extending the vote to people who do not live in the jurisdiction.  An argument for this can be made for people who live in the North of Ireland.  We have North-South ministerial bodies, we have all-island parliamentary groupings and that type of thing plus we share a common cause.  It may not be a popular to say the following but I will.  When we do not have a handle on the actual number of people who may be able to vote then one could have multiples of people living outside of Ireland, or Irish passport holders, voting in a Seanad election than we have people who live in the Republic.  That is a concern for me.  I understand the reasoning behind making sure that Irish citizens abroad have a say but we should look at restricting the number of seats further.  I am just uncomfortable with the situation.  We are a small country and are not like France.  I know that France and the US allow their citizens from abroad to vote in parliamentary elections.  We have multiples of our population who are resident in Ireland but live abroad and these are people who are entitled to Irish passports.  I do not know how one can make the distinction between people who are either born in Ireland and living abroad as an Irish passport holder and someone who has an Irish grandfather or grandmother and, therefore, gets an Irish passport.  That is a major concern for me.   It also gives an excuse for future governments not to proceed with these changes.  We must also consider the cost for administering such a measure.  There is no hierarchy of citizenship in Ireland and I do not believe there should be one in the electorate for the Seanad. </p><p>I cannot see how some of the proposals in the document could be implemented.  I have read into it that one would look at people registering online, receiving their ballot paper abroad and sending it in.  That aspect could be fraught with all types of dangers.  All of us use online banking and do various things online but we do not vote online.  I know voting online has not been proposed but I disagree with registering to vote abroad when it is very difficult to carry out checks.  The people who manage the electoral registers in this country can call down to a house and check that Mr. Joe O'Toole, for example, lives at a certain address in north Dublin or that Dr. Maurice Manning lives at a certain address in south Dublin.  Such checks cannot be done on people who live abroad.  </p><p>I welcome the proposal to extend the franchise to the general public for 30 seats.  I also believe we need to keep the vocational aspect of the Seanad.  For all the criticism of the Seanad, I have seen at first hand here that, in the main, one has people who are able to draw from their own experience of the vocational system.  It would be a problem if that aspect is lost and the Seanad becomes a mini D&aacute;il.</p><p>I would like to thank both witnesses and the working group for the report.  It is a serious document.  I agree with the vast bulk of the report but there are some things that I have concerns about which I have outlined.  I would like answers in terms of the implementation, timeframes and commitments from other parties.  The Government has given a commitment but I worry that it was given in advance of a general election so the Government can say it has published a reform document on the Seanad.  It seems likes a box ticking exercise but I would hate for that to be the case.  I thank the delegation for their attendance here today.  </p></speech>

I thank the Leader for organising the debate which follows the debate on Seanad reform that we had on 5 May, and in particular on the findings contained in the report of the working group on Seanad Reform.  I commend both of them on producing the report.  We all share in the hope and expectations expressed by Senator Cummins that this would be the last report on Seanad reform.  I very much welcome the announcement that there will be an implementation group established in early course which is long overdue.  It will be quite an achievement to get a Bill through the Oireachtas before the general election even if the implementation group is set up very quickly.</p> <p>Like Senator Darragh O'Brien, I am concerned that the Taoiseach is meeting the D&aacute;il leaders today.  I hope that Seanad group leaders will be met but it is not a matter for either former Senator present.  Clearly, it would be important that the Seanad group leaders also meet the Taoiseach to discuss a timetable for reform.  I also agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Cummins on the status of the Seanad, the importance that should be ascribed to the Seanad and that priority should be given to the work of the Seanad.</p> <p>Senator Cummins and myself, on the previous occasion, spoke at length about the procedural changes we have made to the workings of the Seanad.  We spoke about the initiatives we have taken.  For example, public hearings were held with interested groups and bodies on matters of public interest.  We have produced some excellent reports through the initiative.  Most recently, we produced a report on farm safety and the previous reports dealt with lifestyle changes to prevent cancer and the human rights of elderly persons.  We have produced a whole range of different reports through the new forum of the public consultation committee.  As Senator Cummins has said, we have also held a series of debates with MEPs and we have made a number of changes to the way in which the Seanad works.  All of those aspects are hugely important.</p> <p>I very much hope that the current Seanad will have some representation on the implementation group.  Others have spoken on the matter.  Indeed, I have spoken previously about the lack of representation by serving Senators on the working groups.  Having said that, and as I pointed out previously, very few former or serving Senators made submissions to the working group even though clearly it was open to anyone to do so.  I made a submission on behalf of Senators in the Labour Party and I went through the submission in more detail on the previous occasion we debated this matter.  Now that we are coming back again, and in light of the publication of a draft Bill which seeks to implement the recommendations in the report, I might refer to some of the changes we proposed that I think might be stronger, in some ways, than some of the provisions in the Bill.  </p> <p>In general, the Bill and the recommendations in the report would lead to a hugely improved and more democratic Seanad.  We may disagree on some of the detail but, in general, the principle of extending suffrage for the Seanad is a hugely important issue.  There is agreement across the House on the need to do so.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We can debate to what extent it should be extended, for instance, whether it should be extended to our diaspora or beyond the general election register to the local election register as proposed by the Labour Party group, and I have no doubt the implementation group will also consider these issues.</p><p>I have stated on a previous occasion that the report somewhat glossed over how universal suffrage for the 30 seats would work in practice.  Looking through the Bill, more detail is clearly available, but there is still some issue about university Senators, which Senator Cummins raised.  The issue is whether it is to be based on the existing register for the current institutions initially and for it then to be extended to all higher level education institutions.  I am not clear on the point and I could not quite make it out in the Bill so I would be grateful for clarification on it. </p><p>I raised a particular issue the last time and, looking at the Bill, it is still an issue for me.  The report recommends, on universal suffrage, that individuals who elect to register will choose the vocational panel of their choice and that university graduates may choose to remain eligible to vote on the university panel or transfer to one of the vocational panels.  My concern is that such an approach could skew the panels.  Looking at section 8 of the draft Bill, I am concerned that it could lead, in the first instance, to very uneven numbers of electors or voters across the panels, which would be a fairly obvious consequence.  There might be 100,000 people opting to vote on the arts panel----- </p></speech>

It is likely or possible that people would organise registration campaigns on a particular panel to ensure they were elected to it.  The problem with one voter, one panel is that that would be a likely consequence of it.  Our submission was brief but we did think through this issue a little.  We suggested that each person entitled to vote would have a separate vote for candidates on each of the five panels and that university graduates could opt for a vote on the university panel instead of just one specified panel.  This would guard against the skewing of voter numbers on different panels.  We argued this would be like a multi-seat constituency.  A person would have five votes on five panels and a person would vote 1, 2 and 3 on each of those panels.  This would get over the problem of different numbers registering to vote for different panels.  Under our system, people who opted in to register would register for all the panels.  These are some of the details. </p><p>An issue which I did not get to address in detail on the last occasion but which is addressed in great detail in the report and is reflected in the Bill is the use of online facilities.  Excellent suggestions have been made in the report about facilitating more efficient registration so that people can register online and also download ballot papers online.  The Constitution requires that ballot papers are returned by post and provision is made for that in the Bill but it would be more efficient and effective if people could register and download ballot papers online.  </p><p>I wish to make one further suggestion, which could be applied to current panels of voters on the university seats.  This is something about which I have been thinking for some time.  We should move to a system whereby those who are currently registered to vote on the Seanad &Eacute;ireann register, that is graduates of the NUI and Dublin University, should be able, as one can in a general election, to check the register.  A person should be able to go to a register like <i>checktheregister.ie</i>.  Currently people can check the register but they must look at the hard copy of the Seanad &Eacute;ireann electoral register, which is available in the libraries of the various institutions of the NUI and Dublin University.  The NUI register is available for examination in the reception of NUI offices, but there is currently no facility for people to check an online register.</p><p>Since we were here last on 5 May, we have seen the huge amount of people who came home to vote, who, having checked the register, saw they were still eligible although they had lived abroad for a short period of time.  We saw the huge strength of the Home to Vote campaign, but it relied on people being able to check the register.  It struck me that the referendum on 22 May highlighted how important it is that people can check if they are registered.  Whether one moves to the universal suffrage model here, or even if it is just in respect of the six university graduate seats, we should have a mechanism for people to check a register online to see if they are registered for Seanad elections.  I make that pitch now and I will also make it to the appropriate Minister, who I think is the Minister for Education and Skills.  It is clear an online register is available to public representatives so it should not be too difficult a system.  There are security issues but reading through the detail in the appendix to the report from the National Cyber Security Centre, NCSC, many of the security issues concerning online registration systems have been addressed.  That would also apply to existing registers for the university seats.  That is one very particular issue I did not get an opportunity to address on the last occasion which became more pertinent following the marriage equality referendum. </p><p>There is a lot more in the report and the Bill but I wish to raise a couple of other points.  There is the issue of giving councillors a continued say in a number of seats - 13 I think - in a reformed Seanad.  It is a good idea to give councillors some continued say in the make up of the Seanad.  We sought to address this issue in our submission to the working group by suggesting that one of the panels under the Constitution and in accordance with Article 19, the public administration panel, could be reserved for election by city and county council members, which would preserve existing links with local government.  There would, therefore, be no need to set aside as many as 13 seats to preserve that link.  There are other ways of achieving what I agree is a worthy aim, which is to preserve the link between those who are elected locally and the Seanad.</p><p>We recommended that if we were moving to universal suffrage, as we favour, that all those entitled to be registered to vote in the local election register should be entitled to vote in Seanad elections.  D&aacute;il elections are clearly confined to those on the general election register.  Using a local election register for Seanad elections would maintain the link between local representation and local government and the Seanad and would give us a broader franchise.  </p><p>We already have diaspora votes for the university seats so there is an argument that that would be one way of extending the franchise without encountering the problems others have addressed.  In principle, I agree that it would be positive to have votes for those who live abroad without the current restrictions that one can only live abroad for a very limited period of time while retaining one's general election vote.  There is plenty more to say and I am sure we will get more opportunities.  I thank the former Senators for engaging with us today.  </p></speech>

I acknowledge and applaud their work and the publication of the report and the extraordinary work of the members of their group too.  It is an extremely helpful resource for us.  I also thank them for their perseverance.  I know there were ongoing meetings in the background to keep this process moving and am most grateful for that and I hope they are successful in this regard.  I spoke the last time they were here, but I have a few more things to add given the passage of some time.</p><p>To begin, I refer to the fact that Senator Quinn and I published a motion yesterday evening which is listed in today's Order Paper.  It reads: &quot;That Seanad &Eacute;ireann calls on the Government to establish immediately the Implementation Body recommended in the <i>Report of the Working Group on Seanad Reform 2015</i>, and that the Implementation Body immediately begins to liaise with draft-persons to develop a Seanad Amendment Bill that reflects the spirit and text of the Report, as well as carrying out the other responsibilities recommended in the Report.&rdquo; </p><p>I hope both our statements sessions will be resources for the group when it is established.  It is great to see the opportunity here today for people to reflect on the draft Bill and to comment on it, as Senator Bacik has just done, since we did not really have it in front of us the last time.  As I said, I hope these statements will be resources for the group.  Otherwise these sessions are nothing more than talking shops, which is what people said no to in the referendum.  They did not want the old Seanad.  Notwithstanding the earlier remarks of Senator O'Brien on the reforms which have taken place and the quality of the work we do, we do not want these sessions to be talking shops and neither do the people.  If our words cannot feed into the work of the implementation body for this report, we are simply playing out the old Seanad right here, in the present, right now.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Katherine Zappone:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2392"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2392&amp;amp;pid=KatherineZappone&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In his remarks on the Order of Business Senator Darragh O'Brien referred to what the Taoiseach did today.  I woke up this morning to hear that the Taoiseach would be briefing Opposition leaders on his views or decisions on Seanad reform and the establishment of an implementation body.  I wondered all day whether it was happening.  Now it sounds like it is, which I welcome.  However, I want to know why we found out about it after RTE.  For once and for all I am hoping we can have some open government, especially in the effort to reform the Seanad.  Let us abolish the secrecy.  Why is it so hard to receive information on what is going on, especially for those who have been so involved in the process of the retention and reform of the Seanad?  <br/><br/>I welcome the announcement which now appears to be true.  With Senator Darragh O'Brien and others, I hope the Leader will be included in this body.  He was not a member of the working group, although, of course, it did do excellent work.  His comments this afternoon, as well as during the previous session, were reflective and helpful in terms of the work the body might do.  As stated in the motion tabled by Senator Feargal Quinn and me, I hope it will get to work immediately.  It should use as a prime resource the Bill published, with Dr. Manning's and Mr. O'Toole's report.  The Bill was drafted by Mr. Brian Hunt - no finer draftsman could most of us find.  It should also take into account our work and bring the heads of the Bill to a committee early in September, to be enacted before the end of the term of office of the Government.  I do not believe that is impossible to do because we have had so many discussions and debates in the lead-up to the publication of any Bill.  That is not to say we still do not have to tease everything out.  Of course, we can do that and there would be time to do so.  It would be possible to do it.  If Members are questioning whether there will be sufficient time, I wonder if it ultimately indicates an underlying resistance to change.  I do not think so, however, because I believe my colleagues want reform as much as I do.  I do not see any reason we would not have enough time, given all of our debates on reform up to this point.<br/><br/>I favour giving votes to the diaspora, but we need to tease out the many details.  The working group on Seanad reform did much of the work and some other reports are feeding into it.  It is great to hear some of the comments being made.  If we had doubts before the recent referendum about whether we should give votes to the diaspora - Senator Ivana Bacik referred to this issue - how could any of us resist it now?  The use of <i>HomeToVote</i>still makes me quite emotional.  People who are away want to be engaged.  I am also aware of persons who were deeply disappointed that they could not come home to vote because they had emigrated more than 18 months ago.  There is a problem with that restriction.  Why can the Seanad not lead on this issue?  Why can it not be the Government's first demonstration of a genuine engagement with the diaspora?  I see no reason the working group's recommendation of online registration of voters and the downloading of ballot papers could not be implemented to facilitate a deepening of democracy.  I applaud the working group for its efforts to engage in very extensive research on the issue, demonstrating how we could move forward on it and giving us confidence that it could actually work.  As Senators know, I am originally from the United States of America where I still vote.  I download my ballot paper and ensure I continue to be registered online.  I post my ballot paper and it works.  It has worked for many years and is not that big of a deal.  What might be a big deal is how to have it installed here and ensure it works.  The working group has demonstrated that we could move forward on the issue.<br/><br/>I welcome the proposed reform of vocational representation in the Seanad by opening up the nomination process and, of course, having one-person one-vote for most seats.  I agree with the working group's statement that our nomination and voting process &quot;fails to realise the constitutional ambition to create a largely vocational chamber which would represent a diversity of views, minority voices and specialist experience&quot;.  However, I also listened closely to the remarks of Senator Paschal Mooney and others the last time we debated the matter.  In putting forward that view one questions whether it could be a critique of the performance of current or past Members in terms of vocational representation.  I listened carefully to some of the things Senator Paschal Mooney said and do not think so necessarily.  Senator Paschal Mooney and many others, if not all of my colleagues, demonstrate an exceptional performance in that regard in representing the vocational concerns of the panel they represent.  This is a criticism of the system of nomination and election, not necessarily of individual Members who come from it.  The system should be opened up in order that we would have as wide a range of candidates as necessary to reflect the complexity and diversity of modern life.  The working group's recommendation that &quot;the level of knowledge and the practical experience required of candidates in the Constitution be defined in legislation&quot; is a good one.<br/><br/>I thank Dr. Manning and Mr. O'Toole.  Are we having an implementation body?  It sounds as if we are.  When will the Taoiseach speak to us?  There is still time for him to do so.  How can the Government go to the people next time around without reforming the Seanad?  There is no excuse not to do so.  I do not think there should be further delays.  We cannot have more talking shops.  The Government should let the people see that its legacy is reform rather than resistance to it?</p></speech>

I congratulate them on the work they have done.  They have obviously put a lot of work into the issue.  The Constitution was adopted in 1937 and we are subject to its constraints.  Therefore, we have had to adjust to this fact.  The working group on Seanad reform has done a very good job in looking at the issue and looking at what has been established on that basis.</p> <p>I believe the Taoiseach said the implementation body would operate very soon.  I am not happy with the term "very soon".  I would have thought that by this stage we would have something that was much closer.</p> <p>Let me touch on some items that may not have cropped up since the previous time I spoke on the matter.  Senator Darragh O'Brien mentioned a concern about emigrants' votes and spoke about representation without taxation.  I believe the Seanad does not really have that problem because there is no taxation in this House.  Therefore, the principle of representation without taxation does not apply in this case.</p></speech>

I would not have a problem with emigrants' votes if it was done on the basis of current passports.  I cannot believe there are many people with current passports who keep them up to date, who have actually not lost contact or interest during the years.  I imagine it would be well able to continue on that basis.</p> <p>I have a problem with the changes that have taken place since 1937 when we talk about registration and certainly about the voting system having to be operated by mail.  While we are used to modern technology, in 1937 the word "mail" meant an envelope with a stamp on it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Feargal Quinn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1972"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1972&amp;amp;pid=FergalQuinn&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Registered mail meant something else as well.  Nowadays mail is no longer an envelope with a stamp on it and therefore I imagine it is possible to be able to include a different method, be it e-mail or whatever else, that would enable us to have that.  That point has been touched on in the report as well.</p><p>What gets me is that the referendum took place in October 2013.  At that stage the Taoiseach said he got a wallop and therefore he would have to do something about it, yet nothing happened until the working group was set up in November 2014.  That is a huge delay.  I have often spoken in this House about the length of time it takes to get things done and the speed at which things happen in government circles, but this has been a very long period of time.  The working group moved quickly, to the extent that it was able to hand over its very good report on 13 April.  However, I had to ask the Leader in the House on 1 July what had happened to it.  What happened between April and July?</p><p>It is unfortunate that nothing has happened since then.  Even those of us who have invested confidence in the Taoiseach's commitment to achieve Seanad reform are beginning to doubt whether there is any real commitment at all.  Senator Zappone has spoken about the fact that the Taoiseach announced today - at least we heard about it on the radio today - that he is going to meet the leaders of the D&aacute;il to talk about Seanad reform.  I could not get over that, and Senator Zappone has said the same thing.  The first we heard about it was on the radio.  It seems to me that the Taoiseach does not have his heart set on making changes, and if he has, he does not have his heart set on involving this House in getting change made.  He did involve the members of the working group and there is a strong team with the added input of those involved in the implementation group, but the fact is that nothing has happened since then.</p><p>There have been a number of Bills, for example, the one Senator John Crown introduced, on which we had a good discussion.  Senator Zappone and I also introduced a Bill, on which there was also a good discussion.  We have had plenty of time to discuss reform but it is difficult to know what is happening and why things are not moving.  In some ways, it seems that as the weeks pass we are entitled to fear that the Government may merely have been involved in a process of running down the clock.  We heard in April that reform of the Seanad would be pushed forward by the Government but now it is July and there does not appear to have been any progress.  The Leader used the term "very soon", which I assume is a quote from the Taoiseach, but that is not good enough.</p><p>It is also disappointing to realise that even if enacted now, the proposal of the working group could not operate for the next Seanad election, which is due early next summer.  However, I am not sure that is true.  Senator Zappone said that if we were really determined, legislation could be enacted on that basis.  As I understand it, the working group completed the report on the assumption that change would happen before the next election.  Even if we do not get the change, passing an Act based on the working group's proposals would at least ensure that real reform would be on the Statute Book and usable in the following election.  While that would not be an ideal situation, the Taoiseach would be able to rightly claim a tangible and positive outcome.  More important, the Government would be able to tell the electorate that it had implemented the change that more than 630,000 people voted in favour of.</p><p>The Oireachtas will go on recess at the end of next week or the following week and there is no prospect of the Government bringing the group&rsquo;s Bill or its own Bill to either House before then.  Once the Oireachtas resumes in the autumn we have at most approximately 20 weeks to enact the legislation even if the Government runs full term.  I hope the Government will make an announcement on this immediately.  I was nearly going to say "very soon".  Next Tuesday would be the time if we are going to have Seanad reform because there will be a very busy legislative programme before the next general election, whenever that is.</p><p>The Taoiseach and the Government must realise they are now uniquely positioned to deliver what none of their predecessors had the leadership or the vision to deliver, namely, real and substantive Seanad reform.  The Taoiseach could make a name for himself.  That would be a huge achievement.  Without overstatement it would be something to go down in the history book.  The people spoke on the Seanad in 1979 and again in 2013.  It is hard to believe that although last Saturday it was 26 years to the day since the people voted for change in the Seanad, that change has still has not been implemented.  We have done enough of talking, although we have an opportunity to talk a little bit more.  The danger is that we are repeating ourselves.  I am not sure how many Members will speak today, but the Leader expressed disappointment that there were not many speakers on Seanad reform on the previous occasion.  I hope we will have plenty of speakers on this occasion.</p><p>The working group has done sterling work and has come up with a very sensible proposal which retains the spirit of the Seanad as envisioned by the 1937 Constitution.  It gave a different voice to that of the D&aacute;il while opening it up to a much wider electorate.  These are principles on which we all agree.  All we need now is some effort from the Government to give voters what they want.  Getting on with the task of delivering the historic reforms of the Upper House would signal the genuine shift to the "new politics" which has been promised by the Government.</p><p>I believe the customer is king, and in this case the customers have said they want change.  They voted for change back in 1979 and again almost two years ago, yet it seems to take a very long time to get something done.  I am disappointed that the Taoiseach does not appear to have grabbed hold of the issue because it is an opportunity for him to make a name for himself and for the Government by saying they were given a challenge by the people in 2013 and they have moved on it and are going to make the change now.  We could do it.  He could do it, but it needs determination.  The Taoiseach will certainly have the support of this House based on the report before us.  That does not mean everything in it should necessarily go unchallenged.  The report will be challenged on a number of grounds but it will benefit from that.  I congratulate the working group for what it has done and I urge it to make sure it insists on the Government doing something about it right away.</p></speech>

M&iacute;le bu&iacute;ochas as ucht an obair dhian at&aacute; d&eacute;anta acu d&uacute;inn inniu agus le bliain anuas.  I welcome the debate, which is very important.  As the Leader said, not everybody can be on a forum or working group and it is important to get the view of all Members.  It is the only chance we may get, as not all of us will be on the group.  Today's debate is about providing us with a chance.  It is not a talking shop or just for the fun of it.  It is to find out everybody's views because no one person has the say on what will happen.</p> <p>Back in 2009 Fine Gael proposed that every citizen would have a vote in the Seanad.  That predates my election to the Seanad in 2011.  Nobody has a franchise on reforming the Seanad.  We have many reports but we must have action.  The Taoiseach has said there will be action and the Leader has repeated that again today.  It is important that the group would be set up immediately and that it would start the process of change now.</p> <p>I welcome the report.  I accept it was not possible to provide a costing in the time available to the working group.  Every time a budget is put forward by a party in the House, we criticise it if it is not costed.  We must look for value for money.  We require change but it must be right for the citizen.  That is also the case with our own papers and policy documents.  When the argument for Seanad reform was put forward in the Seanad university constituencies the Government introduced change.  That happened since the Government took office in 2011.  I welcome that change, which was acknowledged in the report.</p> <p>Another recommendation from 2009 related to procedural reform.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator C&aacute;it Keane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2359"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2359&amp;amp;pid=CaitKeane&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Senator Cummins has done some work on that.  There is a lot more to do, which is why I want to ensure that the Seanad gets extra duties.  We have already succeeded in respect of the reform of the universities and Senator Bacik has outlined something that was recommended in the report.  It relates to how university graduates could choose to run on another panel.  I cannot figure out how that will work.  I will not dwell on it because Senator Bacik has spoken about how it is going to work.  That change was on the cards for 17 years.  The Government has done it and it should be acknowledged.  I thank the working group for acknowledging it in the report.  <br/><br/>We are setting up a electoral commission.  I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht, which is discussing that matter at the moment.  Many of the issues that will be on the agenda in respect of Seanad reform are coming up in the committee.  Examples include the registration of voters and who will be responsible for it.  The electoral commission is an important part of this debate.  It was recommended in the report that the interim group that would be set up would be subsumed into the electoral commission.  This is putting the cart before the horse because the committee that is looking at the electoral commission will be making recommendations on how the commission should be formed.  Both groups must work together because one group could recommend one thing, the other could recommend another, we would fall down in the middle and nobody would do anything.  This is what we must guard against.  <br/><br/>Part 6 of the report deals with implementation and recommends that the membership of the interim implementation body should have access to IT experts.  I agree with this.  As Senator Cummins said, the Seanad must have secretarial back-up because if it does not, how can Members are scrutinise EU legislation with their hands tied behind their backs?  This must be taken into consideration when it comes to cost.  The report recommended that the interim body have access to political scientists and experts with knowledge and practical experience of national politics and that eventually the interim body and its functions would be subsumed into the wider electoral commission.  I have a question about that.  <br/><br/>I thank the reform group for the work it has put in and those who provided their time, all of whom worked on a <i>pro bono</i>basis.They include Brian Hunt from Microsoft and Deirdre Lane who provided advice on the deconstruction of the complicated nominating process.  It is quite a process to deconstruct because I have tried explaining it to a few people.  Another individual who was involved is Michael McDowell who provided legal counsel.<br/><br/>One statement I noted in particular is the statement on popular legitimacy.I agree that a reformed Seanad must be seen by Irish citizens as having a legitimate voice and role in the political process.  We would be doing ourselves a disservice, and I do not think the report meant this, because when I look around me in here I see quite a few people who have earned their legitimate voice.  They were put here by people who were elected by the legitimate voice of the people, namely, councillors who are in touch with the people on the ground.  Councillors have a legitimate voice so I would not dismiss their value and I do not think the report intended to do this by suggesting that it would be more legitimate if people were elected some other way.  The legitimacy of elected and nominated personnel of this House has much to offer.  The Seanad has offered much since the foundation of the State and as Senator Darragh O'Brien, who has served in both Houses, noted, there is no better House in terms of scrutinising legislation.  As the old saying goes, &quot;If you respect yourself, you're given respect&quot;.  The people had respect and, hopefully, still have respect for the Seanad because they voted to retain it.  This says a lot.<br/><br/>Senator Cummins has changed and enlarged the duties of the Seanad in respect of scrutinising EU legislation.  He has invited different representatives from community organisations, taken their recommendations on board and implemented them through legislation.  We all agree that the Seanad will be reformed within the legislative process and not through altering the Constitution.  <br/><br/>Another recommendation was that the Seanad should have a distinct composition.  It is related to the various methodologies of panels.  I looked up the definition of &quot;distinct&quot; because I was unsure what is meant by the term &quot;distinct composition&quot;.  When I look around the House, I see distinguished Members who differ in philosophy and personality.  A system that excludes the majority of its citizens from participation does lack popular legitimacy.  Including every third-level institution in the voting process will go some way towards addressing that.  We must go further but it is far harder to do it than to say it must be done.  <br/><br/>Section 35 of the Bill recommended that the Northern Ireland division of the Electoral Commission of the United Kingdom would be involved in verifying eligibility to register by applicants based in Northern Ireland.The Taoiseach pointed out here that legislation made in this State could not compel or direct a body in another state to perform a particular function.  We need verifiable data analysis if we are to have electronic voting because every country that has electronic voting has a system of verifiable electronic data identification.  It could be through PPS numbers, passports or another methodology.  <br/><br/>In respect of the recommendation on gender balance, I was never in favour of gender quotas until I saw that they actually work.  However, it only relates to a recommendation rather than actual voting so that measure is problematic as well.  In case everybody thinks Ireland is the odd country out and that the Seanad is only elected by the few, Canada's Upper House is un-elected.  All Members are appointed.  The German Upper House is formed indirectly of Members appointed or elected by the regional governments.  All the Members of the French Upper House are elected indirectly by the elected members of the 100 French Departments.  <br/><br/>Some very distinguished Members of this House have come from Northern Ireland.  In respect of citizens living abroad, <i>#hometovote</i>was a great initiative but <i>#stayawayandvote</i>is a different matter.  I do not have all the figures but according to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, 230,000 Irish citizens are living in Australia.  The figures are skewed.  The <i>globalirish.com</i>website gives totally different figures.  How many of the 3 million holders of Irish passports are Irish citizens?  Could we have more people voting abroad than at home?</p></speech>

Are 500 people required to nominate somebody for direct election?  I saw a figure of 500 mentioned somewhere in this.  That seemed to me to be a ridiculous figure.</p> <p>I will rain on somebody's parade by saying this but there seems to be a growing perception that the decision of the Irish people to retain this House contained within it a passion for reform.  I have found nothing in any statistics, other than Members of this House and others saying that there was such a need.  It is reflected in the report stating that there was unanimity that it should be reformed.  As far as I am concerned, and my view may or may not be shared by others, the overwhelming majority of those who voted for the retention of the Seanad did so because first, they wanted the Seanad to be retained and second, they did not want to give the Government any more powers.  As far as I am concerned, those were the reasons why they voted to keep it.  I do not think they got into the complexities of whether this House was in urgent need of reform.  That is not to say that I am not in favour of reform but I want to put it on the record that I do not agree with this cosy consensus that has arisen that there was an obsessional need among the Irish people for reform of this House, if they even thought about it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paschal Mooney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1990"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1990&amp;amp;pid=PaschalMooney&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->When they were asked to think about whether they wanted to keep it, they made a very simple decision that, yes, they wanted to keep it.  I wanted to get that off my chest.<br/><br/>The report deals with the selection of candidates.  It proposes that each nominating body be entitled to nominate a candidate and that candidates be required to have both knowledge and participation.  The onus is on the candidates to prove beyond doubt that they meet these requirements.  As anyone who has gone through this process knows, there is a very strict protocol involved, irrespective of the looseness of the language about knowledge and general knowledge and experience, but that actually requires a High Court judge sitting along with the Clerk of the House to decide whether a person is suitable for nomination to a particular panel.  It is not that one just writes in and ask to be nominated to a panel.  There is a very strict protocol involved.  To use the American term, &quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it.&quot;  There is already an onus on the candidate to prove they meet the requirements.  I had to do it and I am sure other Members of the House had to do it.<br/><br/>I refer to the oral responses on the previous occasion from former Senators O'Toole and Manning about the Whip system.  This seems to exercise the minds of some people who express the opinion that the Whip system is terrible and awful and we should get rid of it.  There would be chaos if that were to happen.  In fact, the report is riding two horses.  On one hand it is talking about having a representative body and on the other hand it refers to the O'Rourke report in the context of Taoiseach's nominations:<blockquote>[T]he Seanad must inevitably be a political body since it must discharge political functions.  This is clearly the case as far as the presentation and management of the Government's legislative programme is concerned and which must also be a legitimate factor in the consideration of any Taoiseach in making these nominations.</blockquote>In other words, the Taoiseach, at least up to this one, will do what previous taoisigh did, which is they made sure they had a Government majority in this House.  The criticism from outside was that it was terrible and awful but the political reality was that it ensured the legislative programme of the elected Government got through the House.  That is what it was all about and that was the constitutional requirement from day one.  It has strayed from that considerably and I will not go into what is in the mind of the current Taoiseach about his decisions that were taken in that narrow concept.  I am not talking about the quality of those whom he nominated.<br/><br/>On votes for emigrants I am totally opposed to the view that they should be passport holders. It should be time limited and be for Irish citizens who left this country within the past ten years.  Other than that I think it would be a recipe for chaos.  How would it work if all the passport holders started registering?  How would this work in principle?  How will the nomination process work for the 13 Members elected by councillors?  The report infers it will be a continuation of the Oireachtas sub-panel which currently takes four Oireachtas Members to nominate.  Keeping in mind that these nominations have traditionally come from the political parties in the Houses, I have no doubt that even though it is being reduced to 13, there will still be a very strong party political input into the 13 nominations.  People will be representative of their parties.  Inevitably those who are directly elected will be representative of their parties and they will come in here as political groupings.  Will they leave their political grouping outside the door?  There is this idea that this will be an Upper House that is so diverse and representative of this widespread opinion, of community organisations and the representatives of the whole of Irish society, whereas the reality is there will be people who will be elected to this House either directly or indirectly, under the terms of these proposals who will be party representatives and who will exercise and discharge their party obligations, along with the 11 nominees of the Taoiseach whom the report has acknowledged will be political representatives of the Government of the day.<br/><br/>How will the nomination process work for the 36 Members to be directly elected?  This is a national election.  I am opposed to a national election because I believe it should be regional.  I appreciate the difficulties that those who are university Senators have in reaching out to their worldwide alumni and to their voting register.  However, I ask the House to consider the implications of having a directly elected national election such as the amount of money involved and the logistics.  It is already difficult enough for those who travel around the country having to canvass Deputies, outgoing Senators and county councillors but to have a national election on the entire island of Ireland - those in the North will be entitled as Irish citizens to vote - suggests this proposal has not been well thought out.<br/><br/>The report talks about modernising the register of nominating bodies.  The Clerk of the Seanad each year issues an advertisement inviting representative bodies to apply to be included in the nomination register.  What is meant by modernisation of the register?  Anybody who fulfils the obligations and criteria is entitled to apply to be on the register of nominating bodies. There is quite a substantial number.  I do not have the figure but I am sure that if it were to be analysed I would think that practically all those bodies who are representative of the diversity of society are currently represented on the register.<br/><br/>I do not wish to seem negative about this report.  In the context of the recommendation that there be just 13 Members elected by Deputies, Senators and county councillors, I believe that the nominations will be party-based, and this coupled with the 11 Taoiseach's nominees, who will be party-based, means this idea that seems to permeate this report that this Chamber will somehow be non-political with a small &quot;p&quot; does not bear any scrutiny.</p></speech>

I thank them for all their work in producing this report.  I find myself very much in agreement with the outline that our Leader, Senator Maurice Cummins, laid out at the start of the contributions.  I suppose I am one of the fellows who harangued him often enough on representation without taxation which I believe is a non-runner.  I recognise, of course, the good work of Senators Maurice Manning and Joe O'Toole and their colleagues and that they are completely confined within the constraints of the 1937 Constitution.  I am glad to hear that there is a Bill on the way and, first things first, an implementation body is being set up.  In common with all Members, I hope that the Leader of the Seanad is on that body and perhaps some other Senators from the different sides.</p> <p>I agree with the broad outline with regard to the 13 directly elected Members.  The Taoiseach's 11 nominees are provided for in the Constitution and 13 are to be elected by the councillors - I would grant them more - but I think Senator Mooney hit the nail on the head.  We are wonderful navel gazers in here.  We are a great talking shop, despite what others might think.  I acknowledge Senator Quinn's smile, which is probably in agreement.  Senator Mooney spoke about how the people voted in the referendum, but the truth is they could not give a fig, the bulk of them.  Maybe for a lot of them on the other side it was a disagreement with the Government proposal.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Coghlan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1881"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1881&amp;amp;pid=PaulCoghlan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Let it be said, there were many on this side-----</p></speech>

It has to do the very same work, in a sense, that the other House does.  Some would say we do it better, some would say we do it worse - I do not know.  There are many who would say the D&aacute;il might be in more need of reform than this House, but I accept it is this House and this report we are dealing with.</p><p>I acknowledge the good work that has happened during this Seanad.  The Leader has outlined the consultation we have had with MEPs and there has been the setting up of the consultation committee, which has done very valuable work on quite a number of reports at this stage.  There was the hearing with the Commissioner and, while not much has happened yet in regard to EU scrutiny, the North-South meetings are being developed.  All of this will give the House an enhanced role.  While we still have to ask whether the public want that, I welcome it and I believe other Senators welcome it too.  However, it all comes back to how we read the minds of thousands of people, as a Senator interjected, because I do not know what they think.</p><p>There was a referendum in 1979 to reform, as it was put, the university seats.  No Government has touched this issue legislatively since then, and I look forward to hearing other views on that.  I believe very strongly, as do a number of other Senators, that we could not possibly have a system where there would be more voters overseas in other jurisdictions than within the country itself.  I think that is totally impractical and some would think it sheer madness, or at least some have very strong views on it, as we have heard.  I believe this is something that will have to be trimmed because I cannot see it working.  I know the argument about this House not having any function constitutionally as regards dealing with money Bills but I do not believe the public would accept that either House of Parliament should have more voters abroad than within the country to deal with the issues of the day that need to be decided on in an election.  They could not possibly have the same concerns that citizens living within the jurisdiction would have about day-to-day matters, budgetary matters and so on.  I do not foresee that working.</p><p>Senator Darragh O'Brien also touched on this matter when he referred to the position of this House <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the D&aacute;il.  Some very good work is done here and I believe people could be equally critical, if not more so, of the D&aacute;il than of this House.  Until we have a Bill and something concrete to deal with and tear apart, if necessary, we are dealing with a bundle of cotton wool that we cannot get to grips with.  Nonetheless, I welcome the report, the fact there is going to be an implementation body and that the work will proceed.</p><p>When Mr. O'Toole comes to respond to the debate, he might deal with the issue of the postal system.  I do not fully comprehend the system he envisages.  I know the ballots have to come back by post but, with all due respect, I do not think we would have the returning officer capability within the House to deal with what is envisaged.  I look forward to Mr. O'Toole saying more about this as I believe there will be huge snags in this regard.</p><p>I have touched on most of the points I wanted to make but I have been prompted by Senator Cullinane on one further point, namely, the important link between councillors and the Oireachtas.  Again, this was touched on with regard to other chambers being indirectly elected or appointed, including regional chambers in other countries.  It is very important we have had that since 1937.  The link through LAMA and AILG is regarded as very important and we would not want to lose it.  I know Dr. Manning and Mr. O'Toole do not want to lose that and it is being retained, although confined to 13 seats.  With regard to the vocational aspect, there are many nominating bodies and that number can grow.  That is also an important and valuable link between sectors of society and the Oireachtas, and I understand it is also to be kept.</p><p>There is this point that we could somehow be less political.  Dr. Manning and Mr. O'Toole have been practitioners for longer than many of us and they may have accumulated a lot more wisdom.  They know a legislative chamber is going to be political and, of course, the Government of the day will seek to get legislation passed.  The Taoiseach of the day will be politically constrained and will still have 11 nominees, so let us be honest, the Government of the day, of whatever hue, is naturally going to want a majority to get its legislation through.  To be fair, the Seanad is less partisan and more objective than the other Chamber but, that said, it will still have to be political.</p><p>I am very grateful to Dr. Manning and Mr. O'Toole for the work they have done and I accept it in broad outline.  I look forward to a Bill.  Until we have a Bill we can sink our teeth into, the talking shop will continue.</p></speech>

They were two very distinguished Members of this House and their contribution to the discussion about reform of the Seanad has been invaluable.  I am a little surprised, however, that there is no Bill yet because the last time our two friends were here with us, I think they promised a Bill within a matter of days.  It has not materialised, which is a pity, or at least I do not think it was suggested there is a Bill.</p> <p>The compulsive interest of Members of the House in this matter has led to a situation where there are 11 Members present - I counted them some minutes ago - and that has been about the average throughout the afternoon.</p> <p>Is that a Bill I see?</p></speech>

With regard to the Taoiseach's meeting with the leaders of the D&aacute;il, I also find this rather unusual.  The last time there was such a meeting, Members of the Seanad were invited and I took part in those discussions in the Taoiseach's office.  I had a brief chat with him during the week and he referred to the question of Seanad reform but he never mentioned there was going to be this meeting.</p> <p>With regard to the lack of a Whip in this House, I think that would be ideal.  It works in Germany so I do not see why it does not work here.  Members would vote on their conscience, except on crucial budgetary matters.  It works perfectly well in Germany.  The Seanad is the place for Independent Members, not the D&aacute;il.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If we had a disparate group of people it would be quite a problematic task to get them all to join together to defeat the Government, unless there was very good reason.  Moreover, they would be reflecting the views of the people.  I think that would be a very important step.</p><p>With regard to the question of tax, I listened with great interest to what Senator Feargal Quinn said.  Of course he made some good argument about taxation to the effect that this House is precluded from dealing directly with taxation matters.  However, we deal with the dispersal of tax money in a whole series of areas.  That is the important thing.  It is not the question of whether these people pay taxes; it is a question of the Seanad dealing with the dispersal of tax moneys.</p><p>There will be a vast number of candidates on the ballot papers.  I wonder whether people will bother reading their way through them and voting.  I tend to agree with Senator Coghlan.  I am unsure whether the people are obsessed with the Seanad.  They talk about it when it is drawn to their attention but it is not at the forefront of their minds at all.</p><p>One thing demeans the Seanad and every political party has been involved in it.  I am referring to horse-trading over seats.  Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Sinn F&eacute;in have all, to the discredit, traded votes to get seats in this House.</p></speech>

I have spoken previously on the matter.  Frankly, the idea of a whole-island constituency for the panel seats is daft.  It would involve vast numbers.  How would people canvass if there were several million people voting?  I would not fancy that at all.</p> <p>Whatever is going to happen, whether implementation committees or anything else, it ain't going to happen before the next election.  That is what I feel in my waters, and nothing the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, said to me at lunchtime during the week will make me change my mind on the matter.  However, those responsible might just tinker around with the university seats, because we are the soft option.  The view is that they are the ones to go for.  Then they can say they have reformed it and made it democratic.  The university seats are already perfectly democratic.  They are the only really democratic element of the whole House.  There are two constituencies, with 65,000 in one and 110,000 in the other.  The proposal is to run them all together into one monster constituency with 850,000.  That is only magnifying the distortion.  In the old days we went from 65,000 and 100,000 down to 1,000 councillors and then down to one person.  That is a distortion, but that distortion will be immensely magnified if we have a situation where the university seats are all jammed together and we have 850,000 voters, while we leave the other constituencies the same way.  Anyway, that is what I believe is most likely to happen.</p> <p>I know my view will not be popular and I am sure it will lose me votes, but what about it?  I have always said what I believe to be the truth regardless of the consequences.  In 1979 there was a vote to extend the franchise, but it was to extend the franchise to other universities, not to every kind of third level institution.  If there is no distinction between universities and third level institutions of various mixed hues all over the place, why has the Department fought against the recognition of a fine third level institution, Waterford Institute of Technology?  It is not recognised as a university.  There is a clear distinction between universities and other third level institutions in the world of real politics.  They are not the same thing.  I would prefer to extend it to the other universities, in limited number, and keep the two constituencies.</p> <p>I have already spoken on this on numerous occasions.  I was one of those who made a submission to the group.  It consisted of my speeches in the Seanad and some other papers because what I have had to say, I have said.  There is no point in inventing a series of extra things simply to make myself look important.  The important matters are those that I have specified in my contributions to the Seanad.</p> <p>I look forward to Seanad reform and I congratulate my two former colleagues on what they have done and the work they have done.  However, my realistic appraisal of the situation is that, implementation body or not, I do not believe anything substantial will happen in advance of the next election.  There is a possibility that the Government will be tempted to tinker with the university seats.  Frankly, I believe that would be disastrous.  I do not think they will have it in place - even for the university seats - by the time of the next election.  I do not believe that is realistic given the need to compile the registers and so on.  It is a major job.  First they will have to get the legislation through and then the register would have to be compiled and so on.  It will not affect me because the next election is probably the last one I will go in, but I still feel strongly about.</p></speech>

Dr. Manning is from Carlow-Kilkenny, where I am from.  He is most welcome.  I welcome the report.  I was one of the first Senators invited to address a conference in Waterford some months after being elected.  The subject of Seanad reform came up from the floor.  I was quoted in the newspaper as saying that I believed it should be elected by public vote.  That was one of the issues I raised.  However, reform for reform's sake is something we need to be careful of in this House.  We should remember that this is a body which is part of three bodies that legislate in this country: the President, the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  We should not simply reform it because it looks good to reform it.  If reform is going to happen we must ensure that it works.  Will we have a better house if this House is reformed?  That is the question we have to put in debates in both Houses.</p> <p>If we reform the Seanad, where are we going to go to with it?  Senator Norris made the point about a situation where there were numerous Independent Members.  We are part of the Government parties and we have a minority in this House.  We have no wish to go back to the previous situation.  Page 16 of the report refers to 1936 when the Seanad was abolished due to the fact that it was delaying legislation.  Would this country become ungovernable if the House became one not of Independents but of those with no political allegiances?  People could come along and suddenly defeat legislation - I am not referring to voting with conscience.  Anyway, how would we govern this country in that scenario?</p> <p>At the time of the conference in Waterford I said the public should have a say and perhaps a public vote.  I recommended at the time that perhaps a Seanad election could be run at the time of European Parliament and council elections by public vote.  That would amount to a mid-term review of the Government of the day.  However, let us consider the situation in America.  Whether it is the House of Representatives or the Senate, the representations change mid-term.  They have mid-term elections but then suddenly the government or the president of the day cannot get anything through.  We have seen that situation.  If legislation were to be defeated in this House, would we have to bring legislation to the effect that the D&aacute;il or the Taoiseach of the day would have a veto on certain aspects of legislation if it was not passed?  That needs to be considered.</p> <p>There is another way to look at it.  We have 43 Senators elected by the Members of the Oireachtas and the county councillors.  People say that is undemocratic, but there is a particular idea behind it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Pat O'Neill:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2364"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2364&amp;amp;pid=PatONeill&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We all know that each Seanad vote represents 1,000 people.  That is the reason county councillors vote.  Members of the Oireachtas and councillors elected 43 Senators and there were 43 constituencies in the last general election.  If we had worked the panels so that the last person standing in each constituency qualified for a Seanad seat, the composition of this Seanad after the last election would be 17 Fianna F&aacute;il Members, ten Fine Gael Members, six Labour Party Members, six Sinn F&eacute;in Members and four Independent Members, in addition to six University Senators and 11 Taoiseach's nominations.  However, changes our boundaries mean that we will only have 40 constituencies in the next general election.  Perhaps we could bring the number to 43 by providing for the automatic re-election of the Cathaoirleach and two Leas-Chathaoirligh.</p><p>This is the 12th time that the Seanad has been held up for review.  The Taoiseach is serious about Seanad reform.  He put a referendum the people on abolishing the Seanad.  That proposal was rejected by the people and he is now establishing an implementation body.  We need debates in both Houses, and with the general public, on how we should reform this House.  We cannot reform it for reform's sake.</p><p>The report also deals with the notion of indirect elections and the idea that voters should register for a panel.  I am from the Carlow-Kilkenny constituency and I was elected on the agricultural panel.  If people have to register on panels, elections to the Seanad will become a celebrity contest.  Senators might include people like Senator Norris, who is a well known celebrity, and people from the world of sports, such as Henry Shefflin from Kilkenny, who is known from Donegal to Kerry.  If his name was on the ballot paper, he would get the vote.  We would end up with a House of Independent Senators, some of whom might be affiliated to parties.  That would be unworkable.</p><p>On the question of people in the diaspora who hold Irish passports, some my colleagues have pointed out that the electorate living outside the country might be larger than the population resident here.  It is possible to hold two passports.  The report suggests that those who do not pay tax in this country should not be allowed to vote.  We could fine tune that proposal if necessary because a considerable number of people emigrated in recent years.  Perhaps the franchise should be extended to those who paid tax in this country in the previous five years.  Approximately 18 million people worldwide are of Irish descent.  What kind of electorate would we have if all of these individuals registered to vote?  What party in this country has the biggest connection to America and collects millions of dollars every year from the diaspora?  We would have a House that is not representative of every party in this country because of people with certain aspirations.  We all want a united Ireland but it is a matter of how we achieve it.  We cannot allow all in the diaspora who hold an Irish passport to vote in Seanad elections.  We might, however, consider extending the franchise to those who paid tax in this country in the previous five years.</p><p>Ms Mary O'Rourke made an excellent point when she described the Seanad is a political body which must discharge political functions.  We cannot turn this Chamber into a talking shop.  We are one of the three bodies, the President, the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, which play a role in producing legislation.  We cannot allow Government legislation to be held up because someone wants to get a headline.  If we have a House in which the Government does not enjoy a majority, it will become ungovernable and we will return to Mr. de Valera's decision to abolish the former Seanad because he did not like what Senators were doing to his legislation.  This House has served the country well since 1937.  If we are going to reform it, we must do so in a proper manner that best serves the people of this country.  We do not want reform for reform's sake.  I do not criticise the authors of the report when I say it is the start of a discussion.  When the legislation comes to this or the other House, we must allocate sufficient time for a proper debate on it and the Minister of the day must be prepared to accept amendments from both sides of the House.  This will be one of the most important Bills to come before either House.  We can debate budgets and the other matters that affect people's lives but this legislation will affect the lives of the people of this country for the next 100 or 200 years.  I look forward to participating in further debates on the matter.</p></speech>

We tried to turn the Seanad into something that it was never meant to be.  As one of the Houses of the Oireachtas, it is a political Chamber.  Senator Mooney made an interesting contribution.  He started by saying that he did not want to rain on anyone's parade but he gave us a monsoon of criticism of elements of the report.  I agree with him regarding many of the issues that he raised but, having said that, one cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs.  The difficulty with Seanad reform is that for every proposal someone makes, there are five more ideas in contention.  That has always been the case.  The people who sat on the review group had to consider all of those ideas, as well as a mountain of previous reports.  If they also paid heed to all of the navel gazing on Seanad reform that took place over decades, I do not know how they managed to prepare a report at all.  They did their job, however, by producing a report that stayed within the confines of the Constitution and I think they made decent proposals.  I have my own views on Seanad reform but they have produced what are possibly the fairest of proposals.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Cullinane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2357"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2357&amp;amp;pid=DavidCullinane&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That should be acknowledged because it was a good and decent job of work.</p><p>The difficulty is that I would go beyond the Constitution.  I firmly believe that from the outset this issue should have been put to the constitutional referendum.  The major problem with the Seanad is that it has always lacked democratic legitimacy and does not have real powers.  One can say the same about local government, on which we had umpteen debates about reforming it.  We have a centralised system of governance.  One thing the D&aacute;il will never surrender is power to either the Seanad or local government.  The reason we have weak local government and the reason the Seanad has never been the Chamber it could possibly be is that nobody was able or willing to grasp the nettle and say the Seanad needs to be given more powers.  If the Seanad and local government are given more powers, that power has to come from somewhere.  From where does it come?  It comes from the centre, from where the power is already, and it is reluctant to give it up.  That is the reality.  It  is the backdrop in which we have always tried to get Seanad reform, as limited as it could possibly be.  </p><p>In regard to some of the proposals made, the reason the Taoiseach did not agree with this being put to the Constitutional Convention is that he had given the commitment to hold a referendum.  He had his plans to abolish the Seanad.  That was set in train and was going to happen and because of that we lost an opportunity to have a good discussion at the Constitutional Convention on all of these issues.  I still believe that is the way forward.  We will possibly have a change of Government.  Certainly my party will not support piecemeal reform of the Seanad.  We are committed to holding a fresh Constitutional Convention which would look at radical reform not only of the Seanad but of local government and the D&aacute;il, something we should have done from the outset.  At some point we will arrive there because whatever we do here will still not be enough for many people.</p><p>I welcome the proposal to extend voting rights.  That is hugely important, not just symbolically for the diaspora and citizens in the North.  It would be a useful step forward.  I do not agree with that the Taoiseach can appoint 11 nominees.  That is undemocratic.  Neither do I agree with the university panels.  Some of my colleagues who get emotive when opposition to that is raised are not present.  It is a hangover of the elitist nature of the Seanad which should be done away with.  I understand it did not come within the remit of the working group, nonetheless it is not something that should or can remain in place. </p><p>The recommendation that only 30 of the 60 seats be elected by universal franchise is not enough.  Each Member of either House of the Oireachtas should be elected by the people.  If we were to move to what is proposed the vocational panels should not remain.  It should be on a regional basis, possibly along the same lines as the European elections which would be far easier.  Logistically, I am not sure how this will work.  Were this proposal to be implemented, one would have to chose what panel to vote in.  As huge numbers of people might vote on one panel and fewer might opt for another panel.  How can a balance be achieved?  Potentially, 2 million people could be registered to vote on one panel and, perhaps, 200,000 on a different panel and yet there would be the same number of seats.  That is an issue we should return to.</p><p>If we are to have directly elected Members to this House from popular vote and a universal franchise it should be done in a more managed way and by geographical constituencies.  While I welcome the vote for the diaspora and for those in the North, we need representation here as well.  It has been mentioned that people from the North have been appointed to the Seanad previously.  It would be a follow-on from the logic of the Good Friday Agreement, and all the other agreements, including the St. Andrews Agreement, to have democratic representation from citizens from the Unionist and Nationalist community in the North and for those who do no associate with any of those labels.  That they should have an opportunity to be represented in this House would greatly enrich and benefit it.</p><p>Reference was made to the intentions of the voting public in the last referendum and we can naval-gaze on that.  There are many opinions as to why people voted "No".  If we want to crystallise it into one argument and one reason that motivated many people, they were concerned about giving the Government more power.  They saw this as a sleight of hand from the Government.  Rightly or wrongly, they saw it as a power grab.  Despite everything that has happened and all the rhetoric that people do not have time for political institutions, people in this State and across Europe value democracy.  One of the reasons there is huge sympathy for the Greek people and one of the reasons the European institutions are under such pressure is because people value democracy.  People see a democratic deficit and think there is something not right, that there is an elite and that bullying is taking place.  There is a democratic deficit which is at the heart of those powerful institutions.  That is what motivates people.  They believe in democracy.  We saw that in action in Greece with its referendum and we saw it here in the marriage equality referendum a few weeks ago when huge numbers of people came out to vote because they value democracy.  That was important and it shows that people value the institutions here.  If they value the institutions we have a responsibility to make them fit for purpose.  Despite the lack of surveys I have no doubt that the vast majority of people who voted "No" believe in reform and they want this House to be fit for purpose.  They want this House to be stronger, to have democratic legitimacy, real powers and real functions.  We have to make that a reality as best we can.</p><p>I thank the members of the working group, including our two guests, for their work.  Given their remit they have done an outstanding job.  People can quibble over different elements of the report but they have presented a fair set of proposals and that should be acknowledged.  Unfortunately, because I am committed to much more radical Seanad reform that is where my head is at.  Certainly one of the commitments of my party in the forthcoming election is that we will commit to a new constitutional referendum that will further consider this and other issues in regard to D&aacute;il reform and local government reform.</p></speech>

Any departures I might have from the consensus that may have existed within its group about its recommendations should not construed as anything less than fully appreciative of the efforts they have made.</p><p>I came in here last week and spoke on a different issue in which I quoted Mill, Hume, Voltaire and Orwell and was greeted with the response that I should go back to being a doctor that I did not know what I was talking about.  It is with some trepidation that I will start by quoting<b></b>Descartes, but I will do so because with Seanad reform we are, in the words of the famous Irish diplomat, putting &quot;Descartes before the horse&quot;.</p><p>I am very cross at Senator Cullinane for using the phrase &quot;navel-gazing&quot; repeatedly because I intended using it and I am afraid he has stolen my thunder from his appropriate invocation of the phrase.  Problems with Seanad reform inevitably arise in that they resemble attempts at navel-gazing.  We have a group of people in the Seanad or those who are charged with looking at it from outside or from inside.  They have decided it is a body of sadly, minimally relevant officials with minimal legitimacy who are seeking their own reform in an attempt to increase their relevance and legitimacy.  Increasing the relevance and the legitimacy of the Seanad is a worthwhile undertaking but it is not the principal problem which besets our system of government.  When I ran for the Seanad I stated at the time that I would campaign for its reform or its abolition.  I believe the <i>status quo</i>is unacceptable and that therefore minor adjustment of the status quo is equally unacceptable.  I have consistently held that view.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Crown:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2369"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2369&amp;amp;pid=JohnCrown&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I have always stated that if the alternatives were a commitment to a wholly unreformed Seanad and no Seanad, I would say no Seanad would be better.</p><p>The problem, however, is not specifically with the Seanad but with the system of government.  There are a number of critical dysfunctions.  Consider the governmental dysfunctions that wrecked our country over the past ten years, condemned so many to unemployment, emigration and the loss of their homes, and caused an already mediocre health service to become even poorer.  Although I will not be dramatic enough to call the health system a Third World health system, I believe it is a poor one by comparison with the one we should have.  We found our universities dropping out of all the top league tables and there was so much wasted talent.  What was the reason, at Government level, for these occurrences?  By and large, it was incompetence.  It was not malice, malevolence or corruption, although in certain sectors of the economy, and to an extent in government, some of these might have been a factor.  By and large, however, it was a question of incompetence or, to use another phrase, non-competence and a lack of national focus.</p><p>Deputies in our more powerful Lower House are elected according to a system that, in 99% of cases, is rigidly focused on local politics.  I acknowledge we all have our personal ambitions and agendas and we all have our own interests to defend.  In this regard, I am not being holier than thou or moralistic but just stating a fact.  I do a lot of things in my own self-interest.  Deputies do many things in theirs, but theirs is principally determined by the next general election.  If they believe they will do well in the next general election by doing something good for the country, they will do it, and if they believe they will do well by not doing something good for the country, they will adopt that approach.  We see much of the spin-off from this way of thinking in this House, unfortunately.  I am not moralising about any of my colleagues but I must draw attention to the intense irritation many of us feel every time we hear someone in the House using the phrase "In my constituency".  It makes me want to ask which part of the agricultural, commercial or culture panel they are referring to when they make such a reference.</p><p>A major problem is that we have not elected people whose eyes have been focused on national problems.  It is not their fault as their activity reflects the system we have.  The result is that representatives are elected in disproportionate numbers for very local reasons.  My saying this will result in some criticism, which I can take.  Some are elected, not usually but disproportionately, because they have a certain family background or some other local advantage or because they have been very good at negotiating with the constituency organisation of a local party that is culturally strong in the area in question.  This is the gene pool, the talent pool, from which we must pick our Government.  These are the folks we must then rely on when facing really big problems, such as banking crises, banks spreads and bond yields.  Every taxi driver in Dublin has become an expert on these over recent years but hardly any of us had heard of them ten years ago.  Suddenly there are people making very big decisions about these major issues.  There are people making big decisions about the health service who know nothing about the delivery of health care.  Therefore, we need really fundamental reform of our system of government.</p><p>We need an arrangement that somewhat decouples the Executive from the parliamentary branches.  We need a system that results in the right people being appointed at the highest levels of the very technocratic Ministries.  I am not decrying civilian control of the military, for example, but contending that we need a system that allows people with expertise and talent in particular areas to put themselves before the people under some sort of ratification process with a view to becoming the folks who will sit around the table.  We need another group of people who will hold them to account in a national parliament.  We have neither.  The same people who pick the Executive sit in the Parliament and are whipped into silence and prevented from making statements they believe to be true because they are not allowed to deviate from the party line.  I will not personalise but I believe we have had examples of this phenomenon in this very House.  There was a spectacular case early in the history of this Seanad concerning a very fine and much-needed Bill that was introduced and advocated by a Member on the Government side.  That Member was then whipped into voting against the Bill having made a very passionate and articulate case for its acceptance and implementation.  This is the kind of daftness we are dealing with, yet we wonder why we have so many problems.</p><p>The two former Senators were given tremendously narrow confines in which to operate.  Within these confines, they have behaved competently, honourably and cleverly and have done a good job, but the problem is more fundamental.</p><p>It has been stated the Seanad is not the number one item on the agenda of most people in the country.  Perhaps this is the greatest truism ever spoken.  The Seanad may not be in the top ten, 100 or 1 million items on the agenda of most people in the country.  The House is regarded as largely irrelevant.  We love standing in our august Chamber making a speech that nearly nobody will hear or read.  That is sad but it is the reality.  For Senators, former Senators, people interested in politics and those who care about politics and the system of government, issues such as the reform of the current Seanad assume great importance.  It appears such people need us to increase its legitimacy and relevance.  There is something sad about an organisation that is seeking to increase its own relevance.  Sometimes a lack of relevance is a statement of reality, not something that needs to be changed.</p><p>In my ideal world, which I will never see, there would be a fine argument for a bicameral system of parliamentary representation in a country such as Ireland, with one Chamber comprising representatives very focused on local issues in their election campaigns.  I do not decry parochialism in politics.  The connection between individuals and government is critical.  We should never think the people are an irrelevance to the process of government.  They are not and are what the process of government should all be about.  If people have concerns, there should be a mechanism whereby they can identify a representative who can articulate them, but the Chamber in which such a representative would sit ought not to be the only kind of Chamber.  We could also have a Chamber or forum focused rigidly on national issues in which a representative would not be reluctant to advocate an approach to the national economy, employment policy or health policy that is unpopular.  He or she would be able to say, in spite of its being unpopular, that a certain hospital should close and that its patients would be better served if they had to travel 40 miles farther to get better care.  In our current system, almost nobody elected is able to say anything like that.  Therefore, there is a need for us to examine the system fundamentally.</p><p>In many ways, I am a great admirer of the Taoiseach, Deputy Kenny.  I have stated before that I believe he is the best Taoiseach we have had for a long time, although it must be stated the competition for that accolade has been somewhat weak.  With regard to the question of Seanad reform, however, the Taoiseach has played this one exactly wrong at every step along the way.  As a doctor, I would prescribe one of three approaches to somebody who received a wallop.  The Taoiseach correctly self-diagnosed his wallop.  One could deal with the disagreement that caused the wallop, one could wallop the person back or one could put something very cold over the walloped area to make the pain go away.  It is very hard for me to escape the conclusion that the latter is what the Taoiseach has done on this occasion.  He is trying to put a big cold compress over the wallop and wound, which is the deficiency in our parliamentary system of government, but he is choosing the wrong option.</p><p>It has been stated there have been many reports and much navel gazing and irrelevant debate on Seanad reform.  When I ran for election to this House, I said I would either work to abolish it or work to reform it.  I have worked to reform it together with my very able colleagues in my office, Shane Conneely, Aoife O'Toole and Aoife Casey.  We formulated a Bill, which was advanced.  Before the end of this Seanad, we will advance it for further discussion, although I know it will be shot down in flames.  It would be dishonest to do less than that.</p><p>I thank the witnesses unambiguously and acknowledge what they have done.  I sort of wish them well but must admit I am afraid we are aiming at the wrong target.</p></speech>

In thanking him, I cannot but express some disappointment over the number of people who have turned up in the Chamber today to add their voices to the debate.  Many people in this House will be running around the country over the next few months trying to secure their seat for the next term, but they have not got even the decency to be here to try to focus on the future of this institution.</p> <p>I congratulate the two former Senators.  It has been said time and again that the narrow focus or narrow terms of reference they had limited their scope.  Despite their limited scope, they delivered an excellent document that will stand for years to come.  Sadly, however, I believe it will just be left on a shelf somewhere.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2402"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2402&amp;amp;pid=GerardPCraughwell&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> The independence of the Seanad is of fundamental importance.  There have been arguments that one cannot run a government or an institution unless there is dominance on the government side or on the other, as the case may be.  I do not believe that.  Politics is the art of the possible and government need not dominate this House.  Experts in the various fields under the vocational panels should be dominant when proposals, such as legislation, come before the House thus ensuring that they could be addressed in a much better way.  Would it be the end of the world if a Bill was sent back because it was poorly written or badly conceived in some way?  It would focus those who draft legislation on ensuring it is written with more care before they send it to the D&aacute;il or this House to be initiated.</p><p>One of the issues that concerns me is the esteem in which this House is held.  Some of my colleagues, particularly Senator Crown, have spoken about the issue of constituencies for Senators.  My constituency is Ireland.  My interests are the macro-issues that are Ireland's issues.  I do not care if they are going to build a new school in Ballydehob or someone cannot get planning permission in a particular place.  That is not my role.  We have people in local government and the D&aacute;il to deal with those issues.  My job, as I understand it, is twofold.  The first is to scrutinise legislation that comes before this House and to offer comment on it.  I know I will be accused of having an eye to the election on the way, but the second is to represent my electorate.  That is what I am here to do.  </p><p>Another issue which concerns me are the nominating bodies.  I would like to have seen a simplification of the registration process for nominating bodies.  I would require the nominating bodies to put forward, when making their application, a set of qualifications which were verifiable and which would set the bar for those wishing to seek a nomination from them.  The report states that each person seeking a nomination should be able to make their candidacy or qualifications stand up but that should be tested at the nominating bodies level before it comes to this House. </p><p>I welcome the proposal regarding the change to the panels.  By increasing in particular the educational panel, the working group has reflected the change in Irish society and the importance of education to Ireland.  I welcome that.  </p><p>When the reform group was put together I commented on the fact that no sitting Member of this House, in particular the Leader, was included in the group.  Those in the group have done a great job so I am not in any way castigating its members but the Leader should have been a member of the group.  Meetings are being held with the Taoiseach and the leaders in the Lower House now.  What is that about?  Is it about how they are going to carve things up in the future?</p><p>I thank the former Senator, Dr. Maurice Manning, for reminding me that I am not the first Independent to be elected in this House to a vocational panel.  However, I am the first to be elected in a by-election, something I have said time and again since I have come in here.  I am sure all will agree it is next to impossible for a person independent of party politics to run for a Seanad election.</p></speech>

It is that simple.</p> <p>I see the role of this House as assessing legislation and not representing local constituency issues.  I do not see how there can be a constituency.  There is no funding for a constituency and no suggestion that one is in any way representing any constituency at a local level.  As Senator Crown said, we hear Members speaking about people in their constituency but what constituency are they talking about?  It has been made clear that the constituency is the constituency of Ireland.  That reads through the report and it is something on which I commend the working group.  </p> <p>I am very disappointed at the small number of people who have turned up for this debate.  Perhaps it is saving Dr. Manning and Mr. O'Toole a lot of time but I do not think either they or their group would resent giving the time to hear the views of people who had the future of this House at the core of their concerns.</p> <p>Everyone has referred to broadening the electorate but it raises huge problems.  The notion of some form of a regional electorate, similar to the European elections, appealed to me when I heard it.  It was not something I had considered.  I was concerned for those who would not be, if one wants, in cyberspace or familiar with it and who wanted to appeal to an electorate across the globe, be they holders of Irish citizenship or whatever.  How does one communicate with and get to those people?  How does one get one's message across?  Senator Norris made the point that if a person declares he or she wishes to have a vote in a Seanad election and if 15,000 pieces of information are coming at that person the situation becomes next to impossible.  This issue needs to be teased out a little further and I would like to see more clarity on it. </p> <p>The working group was not allowed to consider the issue of altering the Constitution, which is a pity because the days of the Taoiseach's 11 nominees should be long gone.  Let us be honest about it.  At least one Taoiseach nominated a person to the Seanad when he failed to be elected in a D&aacute;il and then a Seanad election.  He was appointed as a Taoiseach's nominee.  What does that say about respect for democracy?  It was outrageous and should not have been allowed.</p> <p>There are real opportunities available, as can be seen from the report.  There is an opportunity to populate the vocational panels with experts in their respective fields.  I turn again to Senators Crown and Quinn who are such experts.  They knew where they are coming from and they are non-party political.  I see some of the party Members are laughing and that is fine too.  In fairness, the Seanad was hijacked after the 1937 constitutional amendment.  The party political system sat down and looked at it and asked how it could maximise its seats.  The system was locked down and everyone else was kept out.  </p> <p>I turn again to the issue of legislation.  Implementation of the recommendations in the report would lead to a Seanad very different to the current one.  It would mean legislation would be scrutinised by people from all walks of life - or at least there would be the possibility of that - and these people would be here for a short time only.  Perhaps the notion of returning term after term is something that would change.  I thank Dr. Manning and Mr. O'Toole for their patience today.</p></speech>

I was a little surprised to be allowed speak on this report today because it is not that long ago since we were here, perhaps two months.  In terms of my input on this issue, I have made a written submission and I spoke on the last occasion.  Usually one is not allowed to speak twice on the same subject.  I am here, however, because this is important and we are being given the time to speak again.</p> <p>I hope Dr. Manning and Mr. O'Toole will respond before the conclusion of the session.  Can they enlighten us as to whether there will be reform of the Seanad prior to the next election?  Former Senator Manning is shaking his head in the negative.  If that is the answer, it is very disappointing.  It is a year and nine months, which is a considerable amount of time, since the people spoke.  Some people in this House have been relentless in keeping this issue on the agenda.  I wish to pay tribute to Senator Feargal Quinn in particular.  More of us have supported him.  What is the point in vague promises?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fidelma Healy Eames:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2223"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2223&amp;amp;pid=FidelmaHealyEames&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Let us cut to the chase.  As soon as the Government lost the Seanad referendum I believe I am correct in saying that An Taoiseach, Deputy Kenny, said that he would bring forward a Bill on the extension of the university mandate, to include other third level colleges in Ireland.  Where is the Bill?  This is vital.  There has been almost like a second class citizenry among the graduates of Ireland when colleges like University of Limerick and DCU, with very fine graduates, and graduates of teacher education colleges have not had a vote.  In 1979 the people said they should have a vote.  I would hope that at a minium this would be rectified before the next election because there has been a firm promise in place that this would happen.</p><p>Dr. Manning may be able to clarify for me how the new university groupings are to work together.  For example, NUIG will work with St. Angela's College while DCU, Marino Institute of Education and St. Pat's form a grouping.  I do not have all the exact groupings.  Given that some of the colleges within those groupings have votes on the NUI panel, for example, does this give reason to the graduates from the other colleges within those groupings to have a vote?  Another speaker said there was a difference between universities.  We all know there is a difference between universities but once a university or a college is granted the authority to confer its own degrees we have to accept its graduates.  I am keen to hear Dr. Manning's answer on whether those new groupings influence the extension of the vote to the graduates now within those groupings.</p><p>I am very disappointed to hear that there will not be reform before the next election.  However, we need evidence of action at a very minimum on the extension of the university panel.  Senator Norris said that if every graduate in this country had a vote there would be 850,000 graduates with the right to vote on the panel of either NUI or Trinity.  I presume there would be a larger number of NUI graduates than Trinity graduates.  If there are only six seats this would be an incredibly contested election.  For the 30 seats proposed to be directly elected with universal suffrage - which I completely support - will those graduates also have a vote for the direct elections?</p></speech>

However, I accept the argument put forward that it would be impossible to give the same weight to that vote.  We are known to be a country with a diaspora of 70 million people.  I accept that they are not all passport-holders but it would be very easy to have more voters from abroad than Irish-based voters.  There is a strong case to be made for the weighting of that vote, that there would be a different weighting for the vote of a person living abroad than for a voter living in Ireland.  This should be easy enough to achieve because we successfully transact much of our financial affairs online so there should be a secure way, therefore, to enable online registration of voters.  Senator C&aacute;it Keane referred to a system that is worthy of consideration.</p> <p>The proposal that 13 seats would be maintained for councillors is valid.  Direct election by councillors is a valid system but I believe it is widely misunderstood.  It is often commented by the public that the system is not democratic.  It is democratic but in a different format.  Some councillors who cast their vote may have been elected to a council by anything from 1,000 to 4,000 votes, depending on the local constituency.  Therefore, if such councillors have the pulse of the people in their area and if they are then using their judgment to give a vote to a particular Senator, I think that carries a certain punch.  The proposed breakdown is good.  However, I am disappointed at the retention of the Taoiseach's nominees for constitutional reasons because it is viewed with some cynicism.  </p> <p>I believe the House was retained because the people believe in a second opinion and they did not trust the Government.  They did not want to see a power grab.  They were very wise in deciding that they wanted to have a second opinion available.  If we are to think of the Irish public as a nation and are to consider our position within Europe then, as has been said by other speakers, we need a very distinct role for scrutiny of EU legislation and scrutiny of ministerial regulations that do not go to a vote in the House.  For example, we are dealing in Galway with a proposal for a bypass.  This proposal has come up time and again but it meets with all these restrictions.  I am not saying I fully agree with the bypass because what we are being offered at the moment is a through-pass, not a bypass.  The proposal has been met with restrictions around NHAs and SACs that enjoy incredibly high protection in Europe, in fact more protection than the citizen.  That is not a joke.  Those regulations and directives should have been scrutinised adequately in a House of the Oireachtas.  When it goes to the floor at any public meeting the Oireachtas Members blame Europe when in fact we should be blaming ourselves because we are not scrutinising in advance.  Nor are using all the mechanisms to inform the people in advance in order to get their views.</p> <p>Equally, yesterday I had a motion before the House that Montessori teachers currently enjoy restricted recognition to teach in special schools at primary level.  The Minister has committed to removing that restriction so that those teachers will never again be allowed to teach in special schools at primary level-----</p></speech>

I envisage a different type of Seanad which would include the removal of the Whip system so that decisions are not compromised along party lines but are made on the basis of best argument and evidence put forward.  This is not dissimilar to Senator Crown's argument.  Decisions would be based on expertise and talent that is critical to the subject area.  It does not mean we will not have votes nor does it mean that we should run the Seanad the same as the D&aacute;il.  There would still be a vote at the conclusion of a debate but there is no need for it to be compromised by a party line.  As another speaker said that in Germany, representatives are expected to vote according to conscience.

I welcome Dr. Manning and Mr. O'Toole and look forward to hearing their responses to the debate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-07-08a.201" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe O'Toole" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015070800002#SS00300"><p>With the permission of the House, I will deal with the direct questions posed and Dr. Manning will wrap up.</p> <p>I will deal, first, with what was not part of our role.  We did not deal with the university constituencies because of the existence of an extant Bill published by the Government and it would have amounted to interference in the work of the Houses for us do so.  Therefore, I will not respond to questions on that issue, except on the right to vote, to which I will come back shortly.  It is not our objective, intention or thought to depoliticise the House either.  That is the furthest thing from our minds because this is a political House.  We do not understand the criticism from a number of quarters that in some way, if our proposals were to be implemented, there would be no political groupings in the House.  We do not know how this came about, but it is just not true.</p> <p>On the question of there being a Whip or strong party political input, we are agnostic.  However, I remind the House that in the Bunreacht, t&aacute; s&eacute; thar a bheith soil&eacute;ir, it is written clearly, "The House shall organise its own business".  It is not our business to deal with the question of a Whip.  </p> <p>On the question of whether the university panels will be extended, that is a matter included in the Government's Bill, the heads of which have been published.  We had sight of them, as did Members, but we have not dealt with that issue.  In terms of overseas voters, including in Northern Ireland, the crucial issue is that this is a decision in principle.  Many have raised the question as to whether we would be overwhelmed in finding we had 2 million voters outside of the country and only 500,000 in Ireland.  First, as was mentioned by several speakers, the current Government proposal regarding the universities would see almost 750,000 voters on the panels, spread across the globe.  Therefore, there is nothing new in our proposals that is not already on the radar of the Government.  The issue of numbers is a matter for the House.  We propose that there be votes for the diaspora, but how should we deal with the question of being overwhelmed?  We could do a number of things.  We could restrict the overseas votes to a particular panel.  We chose not to do this, but the House could.  Therefore, even if 20 million were to vote, they could only elect the number of Members from that panel.</p> <p>Another way to do it would be to restrict votes to Irish passport holders.  There are approximately 60,000 Irish passports issued per yearabroad, which means that in a ten-year period there are far less than 1 million potential voters.  We could also insist on votes only being given to people who were born in Ireland.  That information is included in the passport documentation.  Votes could also be restricted to a number of years, for example, the number of years out of Ireland.  There are many structures that could be put in place to deal with the issue and we have looked at all of the different ways that could be used.  The decision in principle is what is important, but how it is implemented is a matter for the House.  It is a decision that can only be made in legislation.  It is important to understand this and that it can be changed at any time.</p> <p>The position is similar in extending the vote to people living in Northern Ireland.  It would simply be an extension of the Good Friday Agreement, which states that, by the principle of consent, people should be able to involve themselves in elections or express their citizenship as Irish, British or both.  This comes from the clear intention outlined in the agreement.</p> <p>A number of Senators raised the matter of taxation.  Our thinking on this issue is that because this House does not determine taxation matters and has a restricted role in the area of finance and money, this offered a way in for the diaspora.  Again, the House will have its own way of approaching the issue should it become a matter for discussion.</p> <p>On the register of electors, we are positive that the register we have proposed would be more reliable than the current register for local, D&aacute;il, European and university panel elections.  We agree that the register should be capable of being checked on line and that this should be easily done.  </p> <p>The question was raised as to how one could communicate with a global electorate.  This could be done by the simple pressing of a button and sending a communication to the 2 million people registered abroad.  This would be a lot easier, cheaper and more effective way than anything currently in place.</p> <p>Senators C&aacute;it Keane and Feargal Quinn asked about votes by mail.  The Constitution provides for a "secret postal ballot" or "le r&uacute;nbhall&oacute;id phoist".  We received advice on this issue from a number of counsel who were unanimous that votes would have to be returned by post.  We raised the point raised by Senator Feargal Quinn, that times had changed and that we had interpreted words in legislation to mean other things in order to deal with IT issues.  This issue concerns the Constitution and our advice is that it cannot be done here.</p> <p>Senator C&aacute;it Keane raised the questions of electoral reform, the electoral commission and political reform.  Many asked whether our report was putting the cart before the horse, whether we should do it in a different order or whether we should concentrate on total political reform.  There are three documents on electoral commissions that are of significance: the Geary Institute-UCD paper published in 2008; the all-party Oireachtas report published in 2010, and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government document published in January 2015.  I recommend that Senators read these reports.  Starting with the last report, they will find little or no reference to the Seanad in the document which is being dealt with by joint committee.  It states there should be consultation with the Clerk of the D&aacute;il.  The only reference to the Clerk of the Seanad is in a passing reference to returning officers.  Senators should be clear on this point.  Also, the document of January 2015 states the establishment of a commission should be considered on a phased basis.  What we propose would work into that timescale and system.  I ask Senators to look carefully at it.</p> <p>Senator Ivana Bacik raised a number of questions about Article 19 and whether indirect elections, the election of councillors, could be confined to panels.  We spent significant time discussing this issue.  We looked at Article 19, which has never been used, and thought it offered a solution.  It allows for another proposal.  It states: "Provision may be made by law for the direct election by any functional or vocational group or association or council...".  We thought the words in the article would include councillors and local authorities, but the advice we received from three counsel was that it would not.  They all said it would restrict it to one group and that it could not be used for different ones.  We then looked at the suggestion made by Senator Ivana Bacik, that we could include all of them in one panel, the Administrative Panel, for example.  If we were to do this, all of the other groups included in the Administrative Panel, which in the main deal with disability issues, would not have access.  We cannot transfer nominators to different panels.  We worked our way backwards and came up with a somewhat convoluted system, but we were stuck with a Constitution which provided for two or three on a sub-panel of each panel.  Our solution, however, is not ideal.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Mr. Joe O'Toole:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In response to the question from Senators Maurice Cummins and Ivana Bacik on the possibility of a skewed electorate, with people opting to be included in one panel and nobody choosing to be included in another, that could happen.  We have dealt with the issue whereby the format of the indirect panel could also be used for the general panel.  It may be the case that it might be decided to restrict the number who may opt for a particular panel by setting a minimum or maximum number of candidates, similar to the numbers set in the Constitution for elections to the D&aacute;il.  The Senators have asked a valid question, but we deliberately left it open.  There are many ways to deal with it, but we decided not to deal with it at this time.  One way of dealing with it would be by working registrations through the nominating bodies which would certainly ensure it was not skewed.  One could have more candidates on a specific panel.  Some of the nominating bodies may have small numbers to deal with, but that would not be a problem.  <br/><br/>Senator Paschal Mooney raised the question of knowledge and experience and spoke about the need for a High Court judge in this regard.  Let me reassure the House that we went through every High Court judgment line by line where there was a problem.  We also had a long discussion with the Clerk of the Seanad about this.  The problem is that there are no criteria for assessing knowledge and experience, on which a High Court judge has to adjudicate, and what one person may decide is sufficient, another may decide otherwise.  Senator Gerard P. Craughwell correctly said the nominating bodies determined what qualifications their candidates should have.  That is what we have inferred in our report, but the nominating bodies would have to put in place a system that would be clearly understood.  The Clerk of the Seanad, as returning officer, would have to decide whether a candidate had an adequate level of knowledge and-or practical experience and it would come down to a subjective judgment.  We propose that there be criteria to make the position clear.  That is all we are saying.  People say if it is not broken, do not fix it.  We work on the basis that if it is not broken, it will shortly become obsolete such that we should be changing it.  <br/><br/>A number of Senators raised the question of whether there should be more indirectly elected Members.  When one does the sums, one has very little room for movement.  If one decides that the majority of Members should be elected by popular vote, one is suddenly over 30, not including the six university seats and the Taoiseach's 11 nominees.<br/><br/>Another question was whether Seanad and European elections should be held at the same time.  We cannot do this because Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann is very clear that the elections to the Seanad have to take place within 90 days of D&aacute;il elections.  One cannot relate it to European elections as suggested.  <br/><br/>Senator David Cullinane asked about people from the North being elected to the Seanad.  That is not a problem.  Quite a number of the nominating bodies are all-Ireland bodies and can nominate anybody they like, North or South.  It is their call.  There is nothing in the Constitution to prevent this from happening.<br/><br/>I think I have dealt in general terms with all of the specific questions raised, but on the general question of political reform and the electoral commission, we have worked within the scope and context of the current position.  The issue is complex.  The Government's proposal is to set up an electoral commission and people were afraid that it would decide to do it altogether.  They talk about an election commission as if there is a general understanding of what it means.  There are no two countries with the same kind of electoral commission.  One of the three documents I mentioned states there should be no former politicians on an electoral commission, while another states there should.  We are discussing the third document.  This is an issue that has to be decided.  In some countries the electoral commission is utterly independent of the government, while in others it is appointed by the government and works separately, or it may be a mix of the two, but there is no model that is understood globally.  It will be whatever suits the Government of the day.  <br/><br/>We looked at the idea of giving everybody a vote on every panel, but we thought that would be too cumbersome.  We decided on the principle of one person, one vote.  That means an individual who is a councillor, a graduate and a citizen will not have three votes.  As a councillor, a person will have to vote in the indirect election.  That is written into our document.  As a graduate, a person may decide to de-register and re-register on one of the other panels or<i>vice versa.</i><br/><br/>I think I have dealt with gach ceann de na ceisteanna at&aacute; curtha chugam ag an bpointe seo.  If I have forgotten anything or if there are other issues, we will be happy to respond to questions.  If further clarification is required, we will be very happy to deal with queries.  Members can drop us a note or raise queries through the Leader, with whom we will be in contact regularly.<br/><br/>In many ways, this is an historic day.  Even though this is the 12th or 13th report - I cannot remember which - it is the first time a Taoiseach has come out and said to us that he will set up a body to implement it.  The question was raised fairly by Senator Feargal Quinn and others as to the cause of the delay until now, but it is not one for us.  I completely agree with the point raised by Senator Katherine Zappone.  We have written legislation and legislation has been brought forward previously by Senators John Crown, Feargal Quinn and Katherine Zappone.  We have asked that the implementation body have access to the Parliamentary Counsel.  It could be done within time.  The Government has made the decision to have the report implemented in time before the following general election.</p></speech>

There is a sense that there is a basis on which we can move forward.  I think former Senator Joe O'Toole has dealt with most of the questions raised.</p> <p>I want to be slightly political and agree very strongly with Senator Feargal Quinn.  The timescale is important.  We were able to produce our report effectively in three months.  I do not know of any other working party or committee that produced its report within that time.  We were able to do so in large part because we did not try to reinvent the wheel and because we were working on what had already been done.  The term "navel gazing" was used by Senator John Crown and others.  There had not been navel gazing but a significant amount of analysis of the Seanad, what needed to be done and what was possible.  With committee members, many of whom had deep experience of the workings of the House and all of whom had great respect for this House and were aware of the potential, we worked on that basis.  There is a draft Bill.  I believe there is enough material available.  The implementation group could work with the Parliamentary Counsel on the draft legislation and signpost the things that needed to be done such as dealing with the issue of cyber security.  This might be done in earnest given the intention of the Government that legislation will be in place before the general election.  It is like draining the River Shannon; people will only believe it when they see it happening.  Members are, therefore, right to be impatient, but the timescale is realistic.</p> <p>Former Senator Joe O'Toole has dealt with the question of political parties, but it is one that needs to be addressed head on.  I am and have been a member of a political party all my life.  I always encourage my students to be members of political parties.  A good society needs people to be actively involved in political parties which are the mechanisms through which parliamentary politics works.  When this House was set up in 1922, there was no Whip.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Dr. Maurice Manning:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Cathaoirleach of the day was also the Leader of the House and the absence of a Whip system meant chaos.  Very quickly the people who had said, to be different, we will have no Whips realised that for the practical purposes of getting business done, we had to organise Whips to be sure of votes.  There is a difference between having Whips.  As a former Whip myself, and in the presence of Senator Paul Coghlan, I think Whips play an extraordinarily useful role.  The confusion is with the dominance of a majority.  I was the Leader of this House for three years and I had a working majority of minus five because of the change of Government.  Therefore, I have great sympathy for Senator Cummins.</p></speech>

One can have a Government that does not have a majority because it means the Government has to listen to what the Seanad is saying and the Government has to argue its case.  As Senator Craughwell said, if it has to bring legislation back, the sky will not fall in.  It is a different sort of politics.  It will give the House a sense of mattering and of being independent.  The House, in turn, must be reasonable.  The House cannot set itself up as a roadblock to the work of the majority in the D&aacute;il.  The House cannot do so because if it does, it will lose credibility.  It has to be reasonable and credible.  It also has a position and is in a position to ensure it matters.  In addition, it has some of the relevance that Senator Crown spoke about.  It is important to make that point about political parties and Whips.</p> <p>All the main points have been covered and, again, I thank everybody.  The word "vocational" was used.  I want to stress something which Mr. O'Toole did not mention.  The Constitution describes the Seanad as a vocational House.  We worked within the confines of the Constitution and I think it enriched our work rather than impose restrictions.  I meant to say that political parties will elect the majority of those indirectly elected.  Political parties are in a better position than anyone else to register voters online.  Political parties have nationwide organisations.  They can register their people better than anyone else so there will be a presence of political parties in a reformed House.  I wanted to stress that point and hope I did not stress it too much.  I hope the work of reform continues.  What we have produced is not the last word.  As Mr. O'Toole said, the last word will be with the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The fine-tuning or maybe the substantive change to anything we have proposed will be the work of the two Houses of the Oireachtas and not of a committee.  It will be the work of Parliament.  I would like to say thanks again for the very good contributions made today.  I hope this will be the beginning of what will be the biggest reform since the 1937 Constitution.  If this reform goes through, it will be one of the biggest political reforms and I do not know why the Government does not grab it and run with it.</p></speech>

The Bill provides for a number of important legislative amendments, corrections and updates to a range of policy areas across the broad environmental field.  The Bill is also important in that it introduces a series of new streamlined procedures that will help to reduce the administrative burden on enforcing authorities as well as companies and individuals, and also provides for a more responsive system of changing environmental pressures and priorities.</p> <p>These new provisions include provision for fixed payment notices - on-the-spot fines - for certain alleged offences under existing environmental regulations.  Fixed payment notices have proved an effective deterrent against breaches of environmental regulation by providing local authorities with an additional enforcement tool that is less costly and resource intensive than prosecutions in the Circuit and District Courts, especially for relatively small-scale offences.</p> <p>The Bill includes important changes to the Waste Management Act to reform comprehensively our system of household waste collection.  These changes give effect to policy commitments set out in the Government's 2012 national waste policy framework, A Resource Opportunity - Waste Management Policy in Ireland, particularly regarding stronger enforcement powers for local authorities, improved environmental and customer service standards to be adhered to by collectors and encouraging more responsible behaviour by households.</p> <p>This new regulatory framework for household waste collection respects the waste hierarchy and the polluter pays principle, provides a mechanism for tackling below-cost selling, provides clear incentives and obligations for households and collectors, gives more teeth to regulatory bodies such as the national waste collection permit to tackle poor performance by waste collectors, provides a level playing field across all collection types, helps to support job creation in the sector by addressing feed stocks from various waste streams, for example, food waste for composting facilities, simplifies pricing structures and enables customers to compare the cost of different household waste collection services more easily, and provides an effective means of enforcing those obligations.</p> <p>The Bill also addresses a number of measures relating to water charges and the Government's interlinked announcements in recent months with a view to making the system of water charges clearer and more affordable.  Of particular note is the Government's introduction of a cap on the level of charges such that a household with one adult will pay a maximum of &euro;160 per annum and other households a maximum of &euro;260 per annum.  To provide further support to households in reducing their consumption, the Government has also introduced a water conservation grant of &euro;100 per annum for households meeting eligibility criteria.</p> <p>In addition to these measures, the Government has also signalled that further legislative measures will be introduced to address the non-payment of water charges.  The Bill addresses a number of these measures, including providing for a new obligation on the owners of dwellings to provide details of the occupiers to Irish Water, the insertion of a deemed obligation to pay for water charges in all new lease or tenancy agreements, and a requirement for the payment of water charges on the sale or transfer of a dwelling.</p> <p>These provisions are a balanced and considered package of measures aimed squarely at those who choose not to pay their water bills.  The Government is unwilling to leave compliant households subsidising the services for those who do not pay, as opposed to those who may not be in a position to pay.</p> <p>The Bill also provides for the establishment of a nationwide database of water services to facilitate the payment of the water conservation grant from 2016, while a measure is also included to provide for the payment of the water conservation grant to approved housing bodies in certain circumstances.</p> <p>This Bill will specifically provide for the following: the transfer of powers and functions under the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park Act to the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, in effect transferring ownership of the core part of Killarney National Park; the reinstatement of existing fixed payment notices, FPNs, for certain offences relating to the marketing, sale and distribution of solid fuel; the extension of FPNs to a range of other existing offences in the areas of air quality and waste management, in particular relating to waste electrical and electronic equipment, batteries, waste packaging and end-of-life vehicles; extending the scope of the Environmental Protection Agency to impose licensing fees for new and expanding areas; extending the deadline for the making of a declaration of non-use in the case of registration of a new vehicle and on change of ownership of a vehicle; amendment of some minor typographical errors in existing primary legislation; reform of the regulatory regime which applies to waste collection, in particular household waste collection and facilities which accept household waste directly from householders; amendments to water services legislation to provide for a requirement for the owners of dwellings receiving services from Irish Water to register details of the occupier with Irish Water, a deemed obligation to pay water charges to be inserted into all new lease or tenancy agreements, provision for the payment of water charges upon the sale or transfer of a property, the establishment of a database of water services to facilitate the payment of the water conservation grant from 2016 onwards, and provision for the water conservation grant to be paid to an approved housing body, on behalf of the tenant, in certain circumstances; and provide for a mechanism to make the required payment from the local government fund to the Exchequer in 2015, as envisaged in the 2015 Revised Estimates Volume.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ann Phelan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2293"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2293&amp;amp;pid=AnnPhelan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There are 51 sections in the Bill as passed by the Dail and I will now go through the structure of the Bill, which is divided into ten Parts.

As part of this, it provides specifically for the transfer of ownership of the property forming the core of the national park in Killarney.  Section 3 defines key terms specific to Part 2.  Section 4 provides that the functions identified in it will, on commencement of Part 2, transfer in its entirety from the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  Section 5 clarifies that references to any Minister or the Commissioners of Public Works will mean the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  Section 6 provides that all the property currently vested in the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government under the 1932 Act will transfer to the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  Section 7 provides for the transfer of rights and liabilities arising from the exercise of the transferred functions and also for the continuation of leases, licences and permissions granted under the transferred functions.  Section 8 clarifies that, following the transfer of functions, a claim for loss or injury arising will lie against the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  Section 9 contains a number of miscellaneous provisions intended to ensure continuity in the management of the park following the transfer of functions.  Section 10 inserts a requirement that expenses incurred in the administration of the Act be sanctioned by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, as per current standard procedure.  Section 11 amends section 11 of the 1932 Act to remove the requirement that management and control of the park be carried out in accordance with the general directions of the Minister as management of the park is now a ministerial function.  Section 12 amends section 12 of the 1932 Act by deleting reference to ministerial sanction in respect of aspects of the management of the park, such management now being a ministerial function.  Section 13 amends section 13 of the 1932 Act by deleting requirements for ministerial approval and sanction in respect of appointments as these are now a ministerial function.  Section 14 amends section 14 of the 1932 Act by deleting the requirement for ministerial approval of park by-laws, as the making of such by-laws is now a ministerial function.  Section 15 amends section 21 of the 1932 Act by deleting requirements for ministerial sanction in respect of aspects of the management of the chattels as this is now also a ministerial function.  Section 16 repeals section 20 of the 1932 Act relating to the management of the chattels acquired.  This is redundant as such management is now a ministerial function.<br/><br/>Part 3 concerns the amendment of the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act 1952.  Section 17 provides for two changes to motor tax legislation.  The first change is to section 1 of the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act 1952 and provides that clarification in respect of the construction and use requirements for eligibility to any motor tax class and the supporting documentation that may be required with a tax application will henceforth be provided for in secondary legislation rather than by way of circular, giving a clear legislative basis underpinning instructions to motor tax offices.  The second change is an amendment of the definition of a motor caravan and provides for the construction criteria for eligibility to the motor caravan rate to be provided for in secondary legislation.<br/><br/>Part 4 deals with amendments to the Air Pollution Act 1987.  Section 18 inserts a new definition for the Environmental Protection Agency, which was established in 1992, some five years after the Air Pollution Act was given effect.  The agency now has an integral role in air quality monitoring and air pollution prevention and control as well as enforcement.  Definitions are also inserted in this section relating to fuels registers and activities.  Section 19 amends the penalties provision in the Act with regard to fixed payment notices, or on-the-spot fines, in respect of alleged breaches of certain designated offences.  This amendment will remove the option for indictable prosecutions against fixed payment notice offences.  Section 20 sets out fixed payment notice offences for alleged breaches of the Air Pollution Act (Marketing, Sale, Distribution and Burning of Specified Fuels) Regulations 2012, SI 326 of 2012.  These regulations provide for the ban on the marketing, sale, distribution and burning of bituminous coal, or the smoky coal ban as it is more commonly known, inside certain designated areas.  It is important to note that this Bill does not provide for any further extension to the smoky coal ban areas.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government will review the extent of the ban areas when the current study being undertaken under the auspices of the North-South Ministerial Council into emissions from residential solid fuels throughout the island has been completed.  The fixed payment notice offences reintroduced by this section were previously provided for under section 10 of the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011.  The regulations have since been consolidated, however, and this requires that references to the fixed payment notice offences are updated accordingly.  It is important to note that no new fixed payment notice offences relating to solid fuel are being introduced.  However, fixed payment notices have proven to be resource efficient enforcement tools as well as effective deterrents.  As such, the EPA has recommended extending fixed payment notices to other areas relating to the wider protection of air quality.<br/><br/>Section 21 introduces two new fixed payment notice offences under the European Union (Paints, Varnishes, Vehicle Refinishing Products and Activities) Regulations 2012, SI 564 of 2012.  The first offence concerns the sale or supply of prohibited paint products and the amount of the fixed payment notice is &euro;1,000.  The second offence concerns the operation of an uncertified vehicle refinishing installation and the amount of the fixed payment notice is &euro;500.<br/><br/>Section 22 introduces a new fixed payment notice for a designated offence under the European Union (Installations and Activities Using Organic Solvents) Regulations 2012, SI 565 of 2012.  The offence concerns the operation of an uncertified solvents installation and the amount of the fixed payment notice is &euro;500.<br/><br/>Section 23 amends the powers of authorised persons under the Air Pollution Act.  As certain activities regulated under the Act, such as the distribution of solid fuel, are carried out from vehicles, the powers of authorised persons are being strengthened to allow for the stopping and searching of such vehicles.<br/><br/>Section 24 introduces a new Part 1A to the Act that provides a legal basis for the EPA to establish and maintain a fuels register.  The persons and activities required to register with the agency will be set out separately by way of regulation.  It is the Minister's intention that regulations will specify the practical aspects of the register and will, <i>inter alia</i>, provide for a distinction between persons involved in full-time commercial fuel activity and those engaged in more casual activity.  The provisions in this Bill will strengthen and clarify existing provisions relating to registration, in particular the circumstances in which the agency can refuse or revoke registration as well as provide for an appeals procedure relating to such decisions.<br/><br/>Section 25 will replace An Bord Plean&aacute;la with the EPA as the appeals body for decisions made by local authorities in respect of the licensing of certain small-scale industrial activities under the Act, given the agency's particular expertise in this area.  This will give effect to a recommendation of the independent review of the EPA carried out in 2011.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ann Phelan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2293"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2293&amp;amp;pid=AnnPhelan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Section 26 amends and clarifies the scope of the regulation making powers of the Minister under section 53 of the Act.  This will allow for the regulation of the storage of fuel alongside the existing powers to regulate for the placing on the market, distribution or sale of fuel.</p><p>Part 5 amends the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992.  The EPA currently provides a number of licensing services without charge, as it does not have the statutory authority to levy an appropriate fee.  In many cases, work to assess and license these activities can be resource and time consuming and costly.  These costs are often borne by other revenue generating activities carried out by the agency, which is inappropriate.  The proposed amendment of section 99A of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 will extend the powers of the Minister to make fee regulations in respect of these EPA services.  Such regulations will also require the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</p><p>The Bill also proposes to make some minor technical amendments to the Environmental Protection Agency Act, as required, following transposition of the Industrial Emissions Directive 2010/75/EU.  Section 27 proposes to extend the definition of an integrated pollution control activity to include the industrial processes involved in certain wood-based production services.</p><p>Section 28 proposes to extend the application of section 82A(5)(e) of the Environmental Protection Agency Act to independently operated wastewater treatment activities, in compliance with the terms of the industrial emissions directive.</p><p>Section 29 proposes to amend section 99A of the Environmental Protection Agency Act which empowers the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to make regulations providing for the payment of fees in respect of a range of environmental licensing services.  The consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will be required before such regulations can be made.</p><p>Section 30 refines certain definitions to ensure full compliance with the terms of the industrial emissions directive.</p><p>Part 6 of the Bill, sections 31 and 32, contains two amendments to the Finance (No. 2) Act 1992 which provides for the making of a declaration of non-use of a motor vehicle.  Owners currently have ten days from change of ownership or registration to make a declaration of non-use if it is not intended that the vehicle will be in immediate use.  This has proved to be quite a tight deadline, particularly on change of ownership of a vehicle.  Accordingly, it is proposed to extend the ten-day deadline to 21 days.  While delays are not proving problematic on registration of a new vehicle, it is proposed, for consistency of approach, to apply the same time 21-day deadline.  These are both very minor technical changes intended to provide additional time to allow owners of newly purchased vehicles to comply with the legislation.</p><p>In Part 7 section 33 provides that an authorised person for the purposes of the new section 10A of the Act of 1996 is distinct from the broader definition of an authorised person elsewhere in the Waste Management Act.  </p><p>Section 34 provides for the amendment of section 10 of the Waste Management Act 1996 to bring it into accordance with the Fines Act 2010.  It also designates proposed offences by collectors, punishable by a fixed payment notice, and an offence of providing misleading or false information as non-indictable offences.</p><p>Section 35 inserts a new section 10A into the Waste Management Act to provide for the introduction of a range of fixed payment notices, ranging from &euro;100 to &euro;2,000, in respect of specified offences under regulations concerning producer responsibility initiatives, PRIs.  PRIs are based on the producer pays principle and have been developed for a range of waste streams, including waste electrical and electronic equipment, batteries, packaging and end-of-life vehicles.</p><p>Section 36 provides for the insertion of a new section 10B into the Waste Management Act to provide for the introduction of a number of fixed payment notices, FPNs, or on-the-spot fines for household waste collectors where they commit certain offences that constitute a breach of specified conditions of a permit.  Examples of permit breaches that will attract the new FPN include a failure to carry a copy of the relevant waste collection permit in a waste collection truck, a failure to display a permit number on a collection truck and deposition of waste at a facility other than the facility named on the collection permit.  The FPN is to be set at &euro;500.</p><p>Section 37 significantly amends existing section 34 of the Waste Management Act 1996.  It provides for the introduction of the core new permit conditions for collectors of household waste in line with the commitments outlined in A Resource Opportunity - Waste Management Policy in Ireland to support improved environmental and customer service standards.  The key new requirements are: the obligation to charge on a pay-by-weight basis; the requirement to provide a three-bin service; the requirement to maintain a database of customers; and a mandatory customer charter.</p><p>Section 38 provides for the introduction of a new section 34A into the Waste Management Act introducing a formal new process for the review of a waste collection permit.</p><p>Section 39 provides for the insertion of three further new sections, 34B, 34C and 34D, into the 1996 Act.  Section 34B sets out the process for the transfer of a waste collection permit from one operator to another.  Where an existing operator intends to transfer the collection permit to another person, the two parties are required to make a joint application to the local authority.</p><p>Section 34C sets out the collectors' obligations to maintain a database of their customers.  It provides that local authorities may seek information from collectors in order that local authorities, in turn, can build a register of households that have signed up for collection services.</p><p>Section 34D provides a statutory footing for a "fit and proper person test" and the criteria against which a person is to be assessed for the purposes of meeting the fit and proper person test.  Anyone who fails the fit and proper person test is ineligible to hold a waste collection permit.</p><p>Whereas the amendments to section 34 of the Waste Management Act provide for the application of the core new requirements for kerbside waste collectors in terms of mandated levels of service, charging on a pay-by-weight basis and maintaining a customer charter, section 40 applies corresponding rules to waste facility sites permitted by local authorities.  This is to ensure a level playing field between waste collection facilities to which waste is brought.  Section 41 provides for the application of these conditions and obligations to licensed facilities accepting waste directly from households - local authority operated civic amenity sites and landfills - by way of amendment to section 41 of the Waste Management Act 1996.</p><p>Section 42 provides for the amendment of section 50 of the Waste Management Act regarding fees.  As the Act stands, a local authority may only charge a fee for an application for the grant of a waste collection permit.  The amended section will allow a local authority to charge an applicant in respect of an application for a review or transfer of a collection permit, as well as an initial application for a grant of permit.</p><p>Section 43 inserts a new transitional and savings section 77 into the 1996 Act to provide that applications for waste collection permits, authorisations or licences that are made but not determined before commencement of the new arrangements will be dealt with under the existing framework.</p><p>In Part 8 section 44 amends the Local Government Act 1998 to enable the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to make the required payment from the local government fund to the Exchequer, as envisaged in the Revised Estimates Volume, in 2015.  The amendment allows for a payment of up to &euro;540 million to be made to the Exchequer in 2015.  This reflects a budgetary decision agreed to and published as part of the Estimates process.  This provision is simply giving legal underpinning to that decision.</p><p>In Part 9 section 45 amends the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010 by making three minor typographical corrections to existing provisions and clarifying one existing provision.  No new or changed policies are introduced as a result of the proposed changes which are intended to clarify what is required under the 2010 Act and forestall any potential technical defence if an unregistered dog breeding establishment was being pursued in a court action.</p><p>Section 46 amends the Control of Dogs Act 1986 to ensure establishments which are registered as dog breeding establishments but which are exempt from dog breeding establishment registration fees do not also have an exemption from paying a general dog licence fee.</p><p>Part 10 of the Bill addresses a number of amendments to the Water Services Acts, 2007 to 2014.  Section 47 provides for an amendment to the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 by inserting a new section, requiring the owner of a dwelling to provide details of the occupier for Irish Water.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ann Phelan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2293"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2293&amp;amp;pid=AnnPhelan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This will allow Irish Water to identify the person responsible for paying water charges in respect of the dwelling.  Any future changes in occupation would also be required to be notified to Irish Water.  This section also provides that any future leases or agreements to occupy a dwelling are deemed to include an agreement to pay any water charges.  This would apply to all dwellings covered by the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.  However, it is important to note that it does not place any new obligations on tenants.</p><p>Section 48 provides for the payment of water charges on the sale or transfer of the property.  It requires the owner of a dwelling to pay any charges due to Irish Water before the completion of the sale or transfer and to provide evidence to his or her solicitor of the payment of the charges.  Where the charges have not been paid, provision is made for the vendor's solicitor to deduct any unpaid charges from the proceeds of the sale.  The section also provides that a tenant of a local authority dwelling who wishes to purchase the dwelling shall be required to pay any water charges before the sale of the property can be completed by the local authority.</p><p>Section 49 is a provision to allow an approved housing body to obtain the water conservation grant on behalf of a tenant.  This would apply where the body is liable for the water charges to the dwelling and is in receipt of funding from the Health Service Executive under an arrangement under section 38 or 39 of the Health Act 2004.  Section 50 provides for the establishment of a database of water services provided to dwellings by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The database is necessary to facilitate the payment of the water conservation grant to eligible households after 2015.  The section specifies the information to be contained in the database and provides for data transfer between parties holding the data.  It also allows the Minister to request the Local Government Management Agency or Irish Water to establish and maintain the database on the Minister's behalf.</p><p>Section 51 is a technical amendment.  It provides for the amendment of section 9 and section 10 of the Water Services Act 2007 relating to the prosecution of offences, to take account of the offence provisions introduced by amendment No. 43, which deals with the requirement to register with Irish Water.</p><p>This is an important Bill with provisions ranging across a wide and diverse range of issues, from the transfer of certain State owned assets through policy reforms of waste management and water services, to measures which will serve to streamline administrative procedures and enhance the protection of the environment.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-07-08a.217" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1128" speakername="Paschal Mooney" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015070800002#YY00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  This is comprehensive legislation, however, like the election candidate on the night of the election count who, unsure of the outcome, carries two speeches, one of acceptance and one of concession, I have two documents that relate to the Bill.  The first is a briefing note relating to the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014 which I received last week, before this legislation was introduced into the other House.  It said Fianna F&aacute;il supported the Bill and that the introduction of fixed payment notices to deal with air and chemical pollution offences is a more reasonable and cost-effective means of enforcement and deterrence than dealing with offences in the courts.  We also welcomed the increased functions and powers that were to be given to local authorities and the EPA to enforce the smoky coal ban in restricted areas, although we raised the point that it is questionable how enforceable the ban is.</p><p>The recent extension of the ban on smoky coal outside the major cities to other urban areas has sparked concerns that the ban would be virtually impossible to enforce, for example, in the extended smokeless coal zone around Cork city.  Earlier this year, the then Minister, Phil Hogan, said he envisaged a nationwide ban on the use of smoky coal within the next three years, which would be the way to go.  People can source coal from Northern Ireland, where lower environmental standards on solid fuel apply.  It is questionable how enforceable the ban on smoky coal in the restricted areas is and will be in the future, given that people can buy fuel outside the zones.  It would be far better to move rapidly to a national ban.  I am not sure what the North-South relationship is on the issue.  We should move towards a 26-county ban and look forward to entering a relationship with the Northern Ireland Executive on extending the ban across the North.  Perhaps the Minister of State could comment on it in her reply.</p><p>That was the good news.  The bad news is that we will oppose the amendments to the legislation, notwithstanding what I said about the generality of the Bill and the very plausible and acceptable elements in it.  The Government has decided to use this otherwise innocuous Bill as a Trojan horse to implement further water charges legislation.  The Government's sweeping amendments will create a new water customer database, make housing associations liable for charges, extract unpaid water charges from the proceeds of a house sale and place the burden of water charges on tenants rather than landlords.  Instead of openly debating the issues in the main debate on the Bill in the D&aacute;il, the Government has attempted to put them through under the radar.  Despite the fiasco that surrounded the introduction of Irish Water, the Water Services Bill and all the legislation surrounding it, which has led to protests on the streets of our towns and cities, the Government is going ahead with the amendments without proper consultation and debate.</p><p>We believe this has contravened D&aacute;il Standing Orders but that is a matter for the D&aacute;il.  When the Minister of State took the Bill on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il she said some amendments would be forthcoming but, when asked about their substance, said she was not in a position to say.  This also raises concerns among Deputies and Senators.  We cannot understand why the Minister has taken a Bill about air and chemical pollution and decided to amend it at the latest possible stage with a series of changes to the Water Services Bill.  It illustrates a lack of transparency the Government has taken in its approach to water charges from the outset, such as when it rammed through the original Water Services Bill, although, as I have said before, I exclude in this the Leader of the House.  While the Bill was guillotined in the D&aacute;il, considerable time was devoted to it in this House.  The Leader ensured the Bill was not guillotined, notwithstanding the conflict that has arisen since and the controversy arising from it.  We have concerns about Standing Orders 131, 136 and 141.</p><p>Amendment No. 21 places an obligation on the owner of a dwelling that is in receipt of service from Irish Water to register and provide details to Irish Water regarding the occupier of the dwelling.  Amendment No. 22 provides that any water charges owing to Irish Water are paid on the sale of the dwelling.  Amendment No. 23 provides for an amendment to eligibility for the water conservation grant.  Amendment No. 24 provides for the establishment by the Minister of a database of water services provided to dwellings.  Amendment No. 25 relates to the prosecution of offences provisions set out in sections 9 and 10 of the Water Services Act 2007.</p><p>I am curious to know about Part 8, section 44.  According to the Minister of State's detailed speech, it amends section 6 of the Local Government Act 1998:<blockquote>[T]to enable the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to make the required payment from the local government fund to the Exchequer, as envisaged in the Revised Estimates Volume, in 2015.  The amendment allows for a payment of up to &euro;540 million to be made to the Exchequer in 2015.  This reflects a budgetary decision agreed to and published as part of the Estimates process.  This provision is simply giving legal underpinning to that decision.</blockquote>The payment would come out of the local government fund, which is generated by motor tax.  I was in the House when the then Minister, Martin Cullen, made it clear that he was ring-fencing the money that would be generated through motor tax for use by local authorities.  It was going to be a substantial and significant amount of extra income that would accrue to local authorities and it was going to be ring-fenced.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paschal Mooney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1990"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1990&amp;amp;pid=PaschalMooney&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Am I right in suggesting that the allocation of &euro;540 million has been raided and it will go back into the black hole of the Exchequer?  All this is being done at a time when local authorities are crying out for more resources.  It is a time when there is not a council in the country that is not passing motions, in advance of the budget, for increased and improved allocations of money for roads, regional, local and national, in their various administrative areas.  I would be grateful if the Minister of State would clarify whether the &euro;540 million will come out of the fund that was originally provided for this purpose.</p></speech>

He refused a judgeship in the British courts because of the executions of the 1916 leaders.  He was an Independent Member of this House from 1931 to 1934 having been elected in a by-election.  He took the seat vacated by the death of the then Senator Patrick Kenny.  Mr. Vincent was re-elected in 1931 for nine years but resigned in 1934 due to reasons of ill health.  He was succeeded by Senator Patrick Lynch who had opposed Eamon de Valera at the famous west Clare or Clare by-election that elected Eamon de Valera to the first D&aacute;il.  Subsequently, Mr. Lynch took the anti-Treaty side, then he won the election during the period that Fianna F&aacute;il was in government with the support of the Labour Party and was subsequently appointed Attorney General.  That is the extraordinary background to the legislation I mentioned.  The reason the Minister is repealing the legislation is that in 1932, finding the management and expense of the Muckross estate too difficult and expensive, Vincent and his parents-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. William Bowers Bourn, donated Muckross House and its estate of 11,000 acres to the Irish State as a memorial to Maud Bourn Vincent.  The estate now forms part of the Killarney National Park.  In 1937, the former Senator and gentleman that I am talking about left Ireland for Monaco where he lived for the rest of his life.  He is now buried near Muckross House.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.</p></speech>

As the Minister of State has said, the legislation is wide and diverse.  I welcome her to the House to take this Bill.  This legislation covers parks, water, waste, finance, air pollution, dogs, landlords and housing, and I will not comment on them all.  The outstanding issues had to be dealt with and they were flagged by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government back in May.  The Minister of State also flagged them in a speech in the D&aacute;il but I know she did not have the detail at that time.</p><p>The legislation gives effect to measures designed to recover unpaid water charges relating to domestic property, including privately owned accommodation, occupied private rented accommodation, local authority rented accommodation, and housing authority and housing agency accommodation.  The Civil Debt (Procedures) Bill will be brought to the House shortly.  It will provide a legislative basis for those measures by implementing a number of the reforms that were recommended by the Law Reform Commission.  One does not set up a commission and just ignore it.  Many of the recommendations on fine collection were recommended by the Law Reform Commission.  In terms of enforcement and recovery of debt, when one decides to implement laws, one needs to have the wherewithal to ensure they are implemented.  If one thinks locking people up in prison for not paying a fine is the way to go about it, that is not good and is not a good policy.  There is a revolving door syndrome in prisons which everybody in this House has criticised.  I worry that if everybody who has not paid a fine is locked up, serious criminals will be left to walk the streets.  The Government is changing the current situation and is making space in prisons for the people who should be incarcerated and not for the people who should not be incarcerated.</p><p>In terms of registration with Irish Water, there will be a mandatory requirement that will make deductions for unpaid water charges.  I will not go into all the details of the Minister of State's presentation.  An amendment of the Waste Management Act 1996 will provide for a change in the legislation.  Throughout this country we have seen how waste legislation has been flouted by various bodies.  In Part 7 of this Bill there is an amendment to the Waste Management Act 1996.  The new proposals will emphasise the polluter pays principle.  They will also provide clear incentives and obligations for households and waste collectors.  The proposals will strengthen the regulatory bodies such as the National Waste Collection Permit Office to tackle very poor performance by waste collectors.  We have all spoken about poor performance in different areas in order that people should realise we must find a way to tackle it.  Every day we hear people ask for measures to tackle poor performance and they also ask us how we will ensure certain things do not happen.  The new provision will be of major benefit to the consumer.  It will simplify pricing structures and will enable customers to compare and contrast more easily the cost of different waste lorries, waste companies and household waste collection services.  Most important, it will provide an effective means of enforcing those obligations.</p><p>The Bill will also set up a database.  Councils will have more information on who is dumping what, where, when and how, which will leave household collectors more responsible as a result.  We also seek a sustainable environment and want to keep the environment clean for our children and future generations.  There is no point in saying we are in favour of environmental preservation if we close our eyes to the dumping that is taking place in the countryside and we do not know what is dumped where, when or how.  We need to know who is recycling, availing of bring banks and who is composting.  We are great in Ireland for making laws but this Bill is one of the ways to ensure we implement the laws as well.</p><p>Section 23A, inserted by section 47 of the Bill, refers to the mandatory obligation on the owner of a dwelling to provide details of who is registered as a customer of Irish Water.  One of the previous speakers said that every landlord should pay the water charge for every person renting.  Such an initiative would not reflect the polluter pays principal.  It would mean the landlord would be responsible for everything but the polluter would be responsible for nothing.  Deducting charges from the proceeds of the sale of a dwelling, as the case may be, is another way.  One can get at landlords in this way and ensure they fulfil their responsibility that whoever they have in their houses are responsible and environmentally friendly people.  This is a small ask.  The landlord must maintain his roof and everything else.</p><p>The water conservation grant database will make people responsible and accountable.  When one gives a grant, it is like throwing money up in the air and hoping somebody will catch it.  One simply would not know who would receive the grant.  The Bill provides for the establishment of a nationwide database of water services to dwellings from 2016 onwards.</p><p>Domestic water usage <i>per capita</i>in Ireland is among the highest in Europe.  All European countries have water charges.  As well as making economic sense, the driving force behind the introduction of water charges is the legal obligation to recover the cost of all water services under article 9(1) of the EU water framework directive.  Since 2000, Ireland is under a legal obligation to implement properly cost recovery measures for a wide range of water services and uses, including domestic water services.  The real issue is one the Bill is addressing - how to collect water and the introduction of the polluter pays principle.  The EU directive requires cost recovery on a polluter pays basis.  It is all very well linking it to motor tax but in terms of the polluter pays principle, while the car is a polluter in itself, one must distinguish between types of pollution, and financing is one aspect in this regard.  I am my party's spokesperson on the environment but we are all here today to discuss the environment.  The public has a right to a good environment and a safe and reliable supply of drinking water.  Last week alone, 11,000 people in Roscommon had clean water for the first time in years.  They paid for and bought more expensive bottled water.  As many as 21,000 people in Roscommon now have clean water.  It involves people paying.  In the countryside there are people who have paid for water all their lives and I say that as a country person myself. </p><p>In terms of septic tanks, the water harvesting grant will help people to ensure they invest in water conservation measures.  It will help people who have contaminated water to get clean water, be it through investing in water harvesting devices or devices that use ultraviolet rays to get rid of bacteria.  All those devices are available to people.We have to help people whom we have not helped before.  Many people who live in the cities say we have clean water but I am afraid that there are many people who do not have clean water.  We have to also ensure there is water conservation and cleanliness.</p><p>Leaks are another issue that has been well discussed in this debate.  The Minister has stated time and again that the charge will distinguish between those who are willing to pay and those who cannot pay, as opposed to just people who refuse to pay.  It was important for the Minister to say this.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator C&aacute;it Keane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2359"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2359&amp;amp;pid=CaitKeane&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is the potential to avail of easy option pay plans which are being availed of.</p><p>I will skip the part on the Civil Debt (Procedures) Bill and could say a good deal more about waste, but I will leave the matter of the transfer of finance to the Minister of State.</p><p>There is scaremongering on the issue of public versus private ownership.  The Government has consistently stated the body with responsibility for the supply of water will remain in public ownership.  This is provided for in legislation and will not be changed.  It cannot be changed without a plebiscite of the people.  Therefore, I do not want to hear the issue being mentioned again.  Let us be honest and say it has been legislated for.  Certain policies and philosophies are being pursued by many, but we need to think about the environment.</p><p>I do not have time to go into all of the details on the Environmental Protection Agency.  It is, however, an important issue which I hope we will get to debate on another day.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-07-08a.228" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1171" speakername="Jillian van Turnhout" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015070800002#AAA00200"><p>I wish to share my time with Senator Mary Ann O'Brien.  </p> <p>I thank the officials of the Department for the briefing they provided at my request.  It was useful to go through some of the issues I have with the Bill.  On Committee Stage we can explore in more detail certain aspects of it such as waste management, air quality, paints and solvents, about which I have learned a good deal, motor vehicles, the EPA and Killarney National Park.</p> <p>I will jump straight to section 47 and associated sections.  I made it clear when we were debating what is now the Water Services Act 2014 in December last year that I had serious misgivings about the way Irish Water had been established, the arrogance of its leadership and the completely misjudged manner in which the process had been communicated to the public.  While not a panacea, the Water Services Bill addressed and provided remedies for a number of significant concerns.  I do not intend to get into how the section was dealt with in the Lower House, but I certainly have misgivings about the way it was handled.</p> <p>I am very pleased that the idea of landlords retaining tenant deposits where there is an outstanding or unpaid bill has been put on hold until a tenancy deposit protection scheme is introduced under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012.  Deposit retention is a major source of disputes in the private rental sector.  I was seriously concerned that we were considering the addition of another clause on retention before a method through which deposits could be held by a third party was in place.  I was also concerned that landlords would deem it necessary to secure two or three-month deposits from tenants to cover unpaid water bills.  That would be near impossible for the majority of tenants who are already struggling with spiralling rents.  The rate of increase in rents is 8.2% nationally and already 10% this year in Dublin.  We will deal with this and a number of other pressing issues in the private rental sector when the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill is brought before the Seanad.</p> <p>I had concerns about how we would deal with Irish Water as compared to other utilities such as those in the electricity sector.  I appreciate that the Government does not intend to cut off supply by Irish Water, something that was provided for in the Water Services Bill 2014.  Therefore, this Bill is an attempt to find a consistent approach to deal with the matter.  The reality is that one in five families lives in private rented accommodation.  Therefore, the Bill will affect quite a number of families.  A tenant's liability in respect of the payment of Irish Water charges will be deemed to be implied in his or her tenancy agreement, unless the landlord and the tenant expressly agree otherwise.  Obviously, the legislation will not be retrospective, but we will explore the issue in more detail on Committee Stage.</p> <p>I welcome section 49 on approved housing bodies which will not have to name their tenants.  This is a good arrangement.  I welcome what the Department has done in this regard.  </p> <p>I am open to looking at all amendments proposed on Committee Stage.  The Government has tried to take a consistent approach to other utility bills, given the nature of Irish Water.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-07-08a.229" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1169" speakername="Mary Ann O'Brien" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015070800002#AAA00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House.  I also thank her officials for the briefing provided earlier today.  As the Minister of State noted, it took her half an hour to present the Bill to us.</p> <p>Part of the Bill concerns the role of the Environmental Protection Agency.  It seems there is a tidying up of loose ends to endeavour to comply with EU directions.  I will offer some thoughts for the consideration of the Minister of State.  </p> <p>I have in mind section 31 and amendments to the 1992 Environmental Protection Agency Act.  A very good public consultation process was undertaken by the EPA in 2010, out of which review came 58 recommendations.  I commend the EPA for its work because action has been taken on 43 of these recommendations to date.  However, one serious recommendation highlighted the fact that the EPA enjoyed absolute immunity in respect of a failure to discharge its statutory functions.  Section 15 of the EPA Act provides that no action or other proceedings shall lie or be maintainable against the agency.  I will not read the entire section because I do not have time to do so, but the review group noted that doubts had been expressed about the constitutionality of the EPA's immunity and whether it was compatible with obligations arising under the European Convention on Human Rights.  The review group concluded that absolute immunity was difficult to justify in a modern legislative scheme and that the matter should be revised, as appropriate, when the opportunity arose.  I took the view that it was appropriate to mention it.  In 2011 the then Minister, Mr. Phil Hogan, proposed that he would consider the issue as set out in the implementation plan.  He said it was likely that primary legislation would be required and that the matter should be progressed in the latter half of 2013.  Two important sections in the 1992 Act should be examined.  We have all been reading and studying the review and all know that the job the EPA has to do is vast, but its absolute immunity does not help it in dealing with big business and the public.</p> <p>Reference has been made to the smokey coal issue, on which the Asthma Society of Ireland has made a submission today.  Smokey coal causes considerable air pollution problems for asthmatics, of whom there are 500,000 in the country and of whom one dies every week.  Every 26 minutes an asthmatic presents in an accident and emergency department.  However, prevention is better than cure.  Therefore, the legislation the Department intends to bring forward is welcome.  The representatives of the Minister of State told us today that small businesses buying or cutting timber or young people who were trying to be entrepreneurial would not be affected because the burning of timber did not affect air quality.  I thank the Minister of State for listening to me.</p></speech>

Accusations were laid at her door in the Lower House about the way the Bill had been presented.  I compliment her on all 29 pages of her presentation.</p> <p>This is probably the most wide-ranging Bill I have seen come through in my time in this House.  It seeks to amend the Waste Management Act, 1996, the Air Pollution Act, 1987, the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992 and the Water Services Acts, 2007 and 2014.  As other Senators said, on Second Stage one takes a broad view of a Bill.  I wish, therefore, to focus on a number of areas.  </p> <p>I am keen to deal with the issues of waste and illegal dumping and the parts of the Bill that tackle them, which I fully support.  The country has been blighted by illegal dumping.  I have several questions to raise and trust the Minister of State will be willing to respond to them.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Denis Landy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2349"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2349&amp;amp;pid=DenisLandy&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Approximately 25% of houses do not have access to a waste bin collection service.  It was reported in last Sunday's newspapers that houses which are not listed as using a waste bin collection service may be liable for fines of up to &euro;3,000.  As somebody who has practised recycling, composting and waste management at the domestic level for the last 25 years, I could live without a bin collection service.  I ask for clarification on the notion that people could be liable for fines of &euro;3,000 if they cannot prove to their local authority that they do not require their bins to be collected because I have been contacted by a number of people who have concerns about it.  We have made great strides on waste management and we are currently responsible for 367 kg of waste per year, compared to an EU average of 438 kg.  We have come a long way in this regard.</p><p>The Bill also deals with the issue of air pollution and enforcement.  I have raised concerns about the EPA on a number of occasions.  The previous speaker was more polite than I intend to be.  The EPA is charged with controlling air pollution but in 2013 it only brought 11 prosecutions in the entire country, all of which were against local authorities.  It did not pursue a single prosecution against an industry.  I have previously outlined in great detail my concerns about the role of the EPA in respect of a number of cases.  One of the cases involves Enva Ireland, which has polluted the environment of the two counties in which it is based, Laois and Clare, and is responsible for particularly severe pollution in the centre of Portlaoise.  I was given a commitment by the previous Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government that a report was forthcoming from the EPA on Enva's activities.  I am still waiting for that report.  The EPA must act to deal with these issues under the Environmental Protection Act 1992, which tasks it with monitoring industry and local authorities.  Nobody monitors the EPA, however.  That is not acceptable and I hope this legislation will address the matter.</p><p>We have had numerous debates on water charges in this House.  Water charges have been put on the same footing as other utilities, such as gas and electricity.  People who comply and register will get a conservation grant towards their water charges.  They will not get a grant from the ESB or the gas utilities.  There is at last a recognition that supplying water in rural Ireland requires a different approach than in the cities, with rural dwellers now being categorised into those who use septic tanks and those who rely on the public wastewater systems.</p><p>Many of the provisions of the Bill aim to tidy up areas of the law.  I welcome the provisions on Muckross House in Killarney, which is an iconic building.  I also welcome that the registration system for fuel suppliers is being tightened to close off the loopholes which previously prevented prosecutions.  The changes to the regulations for dog breeding is also important in light of past cases involving puppy farming and cruelty against dogs.  I look forward to discussing these provisions further on Committee Stage and thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to take the Bill.</p></speech>

The Government drafted a Bill containing provisions for the Bourne-Vincent memorial park, which nobody could oppose, and then added several cynical provisions relating to Irish Water in order to take the last few quid from people who cannot afford it.  How did the Labour Party move from opposing water charges with the slogan "Every little hurts" to having one of their Members, the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, come to the Seanad to ram this legislation through?  The Minister, Deputy Kelly, abused D&aacute;il procedures to force this secret legislation through that House in the last few weeks of the session.  Opposition to water charges was the main element of the Labour Party's campaign during the last week of the general election but it is now driving the charges.  It is not even leaving Fine Gael to do the dirty work.</p></speech>

We oppose this Bill because it is utterly ludicrous.  The Government made a hames of water charges over many years.  This is the fourth or fifth Bill dealing with Irish Water, and there were many changes in the meantime.  This legislation will create a new customer database, make housing associations liable for charges, allow unpaid bills to be taken from the proceeds of house sales and place the burden for charges on tenants rather than landlords.  Instead of allowing an open debate on these provisions in the D&aacute;il, they were squeezed into a Report Stage debate before being sent to the Seanad.  While the Seanad plays a crucial part of the legislative process, the D&aacute;il is the House of elected representatives of the people.  That House is where the substantive debate on Second Stage of this Bill should have taken place.  That in itself is a reason to oppose the Bill.  We should be jealous of our parliamentary system and protective of our democracy at all costs rather than abuse it in the manner adopted by this Government.</p> <p>Irish Water was misconceived from the start.  It was a Fine Gael idea which the Labour Party took on board with relish.  The transformation of that formerly important party is an extraordinary sight to behold.  A party that once had its own distinctive voice has become merely the implementer of ideas it previously regarded as anathema.  I will be opposing this Bill and I am glad that my party and other colleagues will also oppose it.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that it represents a sleight of hand on the part of the Government.  Rather than bring forward legislation in the correct manner, once again it is abusing the parliamentary process for its own ends.  It should have introduced a stand-alone Bill to deal with water charges.  This legislation, which the Government brought before us with its tail between its legs, is essentially the water services Bill mark IV.  Despite multiple attempts by the Government to correct its water policy, the entire process has been a disaster from the outset.  The Government is not prepared to acknowledge that it made a mistake on the issue of water charges, however.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Cullinane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2357"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2357&amp;amp;pid=DavidCullinane&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Minister of State and her party have simply implemented Fine Gael policies.

It has castrated this Bill by putting in a whole series of amendments to make it something it should never have been in the first place and it is doing it because it lacks courage.  It is doing it because it has tried to pull a fast one.  It has tried to pull a stroke.  Here we are again with more stroke politics from this Government.  </p><p>This Government is developing a very interesting narrative, which will be the stake driven right through the heart of the Labour Party.

We are entitled to make whatever challenges we want in this House and it is about time Senators on the Government side of the House accept the democratic right of people to have their say.  If they do not like it, they should leave the Chamber.  I am entitled to have my say and I will have it.  The Labour Party's narrative and this Government's narrative has been one of cronyism.  There has been one rule for the elites and something else for ordinary householders.</p> <p>The Minister of State has no difficulty in walking into this House and introducing legislation which essentially pickpockets ordinary citizens who cannot afford to pay their water charges.  When the extra money being given to former politicians and Ministers in their pensions is put to the Minister of State's colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, the reply is the Government cannot do anything about it and that its hands are tied.  What of NAMA and what goes on when people call for more scrutiny and accountability?  The Government says it cannot do anything about it.  What about the tactical insolvency we saw in Clerys and see over and over again?  It is a denial of workers' rights.  Workers are being treated with contempt by employers but when we demand legislation to deal with it, it cannot be done and it is too complex.  However, when it comes to emptying people's pockets and bringing in cuts for lone parents or cutting the respite care grant or public services, that can be done, but it cannot be done for the elites, the wealthy or those who are really being represented by this Government.  This narrative will bring about the end of the Labour Party in this State.  We will see it at the next election and it will be entirely of the party's own doing.</p> <p>Like the civil debt Bill, this is another sneaky Bill which the Government is using to desperately push through its water charges policy.  The reality is the Government has lost the hearts and minds of citizens.  It will not even tell us how many people have signed up to or registered with Irish Water or how many people have paid.  Some of this might be uncomfortable for Senator Landy and his party-----</p></speech>

It is absolutely appalling and shocking that the Labour Party is the party in government driving this agenda and it will pay a big electoral price for it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-07-08a.248" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1172" speakername="Aideen Hayden" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015070800002#CCC01100"><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  My colleague, Senator Landy, has covered the broader aspects of the Bill so I will restrict my comments to the particular section of the Bill which deals with the landlord-tenant relationship and their obligations.  It is my view and that of Threshold, a housing charity which deals with in the region of 20,000 tenants and 3,000 landlords per annum, that the proposed measures, as set out in the legislation, will not achieve the intended goal and will, in fact, add to the difficulties in the private rental sector.  This sector is already experiencing supply and affordability issues, not to put too fine a tooth in it.  We are concerned the proposals outlined in the Bill will put tenants in a vulnerable position with regard to their relationship with landlords.  In summary, by making landlords responsible for their tenants' water charges, it will make it more difficult for low income tenants, in particular, to access housing.  It will lead to demands for higher security deposits and increase the number of deposit retention cases, thus undermining the forthcoming deposit protection scheme the Minister intends to introduce shortly.  It will increase the number of tenancy terminations and will generate a much higher workload for the dispute resolution service of the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB.</p> <p>The Minister has indicated in a number of interviews that he is determined to ensure this legislation does not undermine the position of tenants.  I will use this opportunity to outline some of the reasons we believe this will not be the case.  The normal position in the rental sector is that utility accounts such as gas and electricity are in the tenant's name and not that of the landlord.  In other words, it is the tenant's responsibility to pay and only in rare situations, where the landlord keeps responsibility for the utilities and retains the bill in his or her name, does the landlord have any call whatsoever on the tenant's deposit.  Utility arrears in the tenant's name are, therefore, not deductible from the tenant's deposit.</p> <p>The situation being proposed under this legislation makes the landlord accountable for the payment of the tenant's water bill.  Where the landlord is not the occupier of the property, he or she must inform Irish Water of the identity of the tenant.  Unlike other speakers, I do not have a difficulty with that obligation.  There is already an obligation on landlords to register tenancies and both landlords and tenants are obliged to comply with the law as it currently stands.  However, the proposed amendment states that where a tenant fails to register or pay, the landlord is liable to pay the water charge.  This is completely different from current practice where a landlord has no responsibility for a tenant's electricity or gas bills.  </p> <p>In order to protect themselves against these situations, landlords will seek to increase the amount of a deposit required at the start of a tenancy.  As I have already stated, this will make it more difficult for low income tenants to secure tenancies.  Given the extreme difficulty low income tenants have securing accommodation at the moment, particularly tenants in receipt of rent supplement, it is inevitable that tenants will be the victims of any situation which tries to make landlords responsible for arrears in water charges. </p> <p>The non-payment of a water charge will be a ground for terminating a tenancy under the proposed legislation.  We have not yet come across a case where a tenancy was terminated due to the non-payment of a utility bill but we believe the proposed amendment makes the non-payment of a water charge grounds for terminating a tenancy.  Tenants who have not paid their water charges face the prospect of eviction.  We have serious concerns about this particular measure.  If landlords are permitted to terminate tenancies in this way, it will lead to greater homelessness and a higher number of disputes, as I have already said, coming before the PRTB.  Disputes relating to Irish Water are not currently dealt with by the PRTB and this will be an unnecessary addition to what is an already overburdened workload.  </p> <p>Our recommendation is that there should be no change to the current system, which operates effectively.  In other words, utility bills are a matter for the tenant and not the landlord.  Non-payment of water charges should not be a ground for ending a fixed-term or Part 4 tenancy.  As a water charge is payable by the tenant, it should not be deductible from a security deposit.  In our view, this is unworkable because a landlord will not know if a tenant is in arrears in their water charges.  They would have to have a right to require information from Irish Water, which I believe would infringe data protection legislation.  Before this legislation proceeds to Committee and Report Stages, I ask the Minister of State to consider seriously the situation.  As already pointed out, one fifth of the Irish population live in rented housing.  If we do not safeguard tenants, in particular those on low incomes, we may regret it.  </p></speech>

Is d&oacute;cha an ch&eacute;ad rud n&aacute; f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an Minister of State to the House again today.  This Bill started out as one which everybody would probably have welcomed.  It was making general alterations to environmental legislation and providing for the transfer of assets from one Department to another.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2261"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2261&amp;amp;pid=BrianODomhnaill&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Bill proposes amendments to the Air Pollution Act and to the EPA Act.  It contains regulations relating to harmful chemicals, to vehicle respraying, the regulation of dry-cleaning solvents, powers to grant air pollution licences, regulations on the  non-use of motor vehicles and regulations on producer responsibility initiatives.  Then suddenly, Irish Water became embroiled in the legislation for one reason or another.</p><p>While I fully appreciate the Minister of State is not the Minister responsible, and while ultimately between Committee Stage and Report Stage in the other House, alterations were introduced to this legislation which deserve broad support, as we say as Gaeilge, an eireaball a chuir sibh leis, the tail the Government put to the legislation in the form of amendments to the Irish Water legislation, means it is not possible for this side of the House to support the Bill.  Senator Landy is correct that it is a utility company, but it will now become a utility company with more legal protection than any other utility company in the State.  No other utility in the State is being given protection with regard to, for example, consumer databases, payments of charges or charges fixed against properties, and which protection is being enshrined in legislation.  Irish Water is being given those powers.  This will cause fundamental problems in the execution of wills, in the conveyance of property and in general property transactions, whether for sale or being handed on as inheritance or gifts.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach is a solicitor and will have more experience in this area than me, but I can foresee problems down the line.  This will take the same route as the septic tank charge and the other charges such as the property tax introduced by the Government.  This will be another charge on a property which will make legal transactions more complicated.  Solicitors will need to exercise more thorough due diligence.</p><p>Why give such sweeping powers to a utility company?  It certainly makes Irish Water more financially attractive on the open market because of the database, the protections and the legal obligations.  This is wrong.  Whether we agree or disagree with charging people for water is a separate issue.  On balance, I think that people should pay for a service.  The difficulty I have with the establishment of Irish Water is that the powers, charges and collection rights are being handed to a utility company established by the State.  We are told that European regulations stipulate that it is at arm's length but that company is being set up to be sold later.  It is similar to what happened in England and the same prototype is being set up here as happened with Thames Water and Yorkshire Water.  Those companies were off balance sheet and sold.  The Labour Government in 1997 was returned under Tony Blair and tried to recover those companies but was unsuccessful.  The privatisation of water in England has resulted in increases of 200% in charges over an eight-year period.  That is where we are going.  On the face of it and going into an election, the conservation grant of &euro;100 per household sounds great and there will be no major charge this year.  However, those charges and the charging model are only in place until 2017 or 2018.</p></speech>

If the people on the Government side of the House were honest about it, they would say they know exactly what is going to happen.  If those in Fine Gael and the Labour Party are in opposition in a few years time, they may be criticising Sinn F&eacute;in, the Independents or Fianna F&aacute;il - whoever is in Government - if the charges are increased.  They should remember that they are setting the template not only to increase the charges but to sell a very profitable company with a massive database and a massive collection facility which is enshrined in law.  It is ludicrous.  We can return to this discussion on Committee Stage but I think it is wrong to piggyback on what is credible legislation and to muddy the waters of that credible legislation with this nonsense around Irish Water.  I think the Minister of State has been sold a pig in a poke.  I do not blame her for it but this amendment of the legislation is not right.</p> <p>Senator Hayden raised some very credible points and I agree with everything she said.  She speaks with authority and she is right in her view about the landlord and tenant issue.  I know this is an issue in Dublin.  I have friends in Dublin who are facing significant difficulties with landlord-tenant relations.  I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for his latitude.</p></speech>

This legislation seems to be set up to make the company more profitable and more interesting to speculators in the open market.  I remember at Christmas when the original Bill was introduced we were told that all kinds of safeguards would be included to ensure Irish Water would remain in public ownership.  The Government has side-stepped and forgotten to include any kind of clause that would put this issue to the people by way of referendum.  This is regrettable, to say the least.</p> <p>I have difficulties with this legislation, some of which difficulties have been articulated by previous speakers.  The idea that Irish Water and water can be considered the same type of utility as a gas or electricity network is a load of rubbish.  I can live without gas and electricity but I cannot live without water.  It is as simple as that.</p></speech>

I am an environmentalist and I am in favour of the conservation of water.  I regard water as a very important natural resource that we should not squander in any shape or form and I support the metering of water.</p> <p>However, the way the situation has evolved creates more questions than answers.  Given the whiff of corruption surrounding the sale of Siteserv and while that sale is still under investigation, it would not be right and proper for me to recommend payment to Irish Water.  The idea of a boycott of the payment of water charges while those issues remain outstanding is quite commendable.  I do not think people have confidence in the way that sale took place.  Serious issues and question marks have been raised.  It is somewhat heavy-handed and is a strong-arm tactic to oblige the owners of dwellings to provide the details of their tenants to Irish Water.  That kind of information is not given to any other utility company, so why should Irish Water be different?  It is an infringement of people's rights and I am sure it is an infringement of data protection legislation in some form.  I do not know if it would stack up.</p> <p>Part 4 of the legislation extends the scope of the EPA to impose licensing fees for new and expanding areas.  I have raised the issue of the EPA on a number of occasions with the Minister of State and with other Ministers.  The agency is protected by an immunity clause to protect it from any kind of prosecution.  I refer to cases where the EPA has granted a licence in the knowledge that the person is a known polluter.  I have an example in my own constituency of this.  I do not know what the EPA is afraid of.  If the agency is doing its job correctly and monitoring emissions correctly, there is no reason it should have immunity.  I refer to Senator Landy's contribution.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator James Heffernan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2362"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2362&amp;amp;pid=JamesHeffernan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A total of 11 prosecutions have been brought forward by the EPA.  We know how the EPA operates given the public statements made by its director general.  Not one prosecution has been taken against industry.  I find this bizarre to say the least.  Senator Landy mentioned Enva.  Cadence EnviroPower is trying to build a gasification plant in my neck of the woods.  This company does not have a great history by any stretch of the imagination.  As long as the issue of immunity is still enshrined in legislation, it will not instill confidence in the EPA.  This should be looked at and resolved in this legislation.  Perhaps we will see on the next Stage.  </p></speech>

The Government had the essence of a good Bill and then somebody somewhere took the smart move to throw Irish Water and everything about it into the middle of it.  As such, I do not believe anybody on this side of the House will support it, although I have no doubt that if we produce 100 amendments, it will be accepted anyway just like the original Bill was accepted here before Christmas.  Everything that was said fell on deaf ears.  I am still baffled that decent people like Senator Barrett who brought amendments into this House - credible amendments by a noted international economist - were turned down and their arguments fell on deaf ears.</p> <p>Everything about Irish Water from its inception through to where we are today has been flawed, wrong and questionable.  Meetings with a Minister took place where no notes were taken, no records were kept and nobody knows what was said.  Contracts were awarded to companies that did not exist at the time they were awarded.  We are fitting meters in every house in the country that will be not be required until 2019 at the earliest and will be obsolete by the time they are required.  When will the Government learn that enough is enough?  It is flogging a dead horse.  It will not be the same as a gas or an electricity utility,  as my colleague said a few moments ago.  Everything about it is protected by law.  We were told earlier on that it will not be privatised without some sort of a plebiscite.  Does the Government think that we are all fools?  Does it think the people of Ireland are total and utter idiots?  </p> <p>This Bill is a Trojan horse.  It is here to protect a company that has been flawed from the outset.  The Government is giving out grants to households.  This is a conservation grant where I do not have to prove that I did anything for it.  We do not know what the cost of administering that grant is but my understanding is that it is about &euro;650,000.  This is to administer the payment of a grant for doing nothing.  </p></speech>

I have written to the European Commission about the issue being transferred to Irish Water through the Department of Social Protection.  It is a transfer of capital to a private utility company and is wrong in every sense of the word.  I agree with what Senator Hayden had to say.  I see nothing but problems when we try to deal with the issue of tenants.</p> <p>I will oppose every single step of this Bill.  I will submit what amendments I can and support any amendments that are brought forward.  I will sit here and watch the other side be marched in like sheep to vote for this Bill to pass into law.  I will not get party political about it because I do not care who forms the next Government but politicians on all sides will pay a high price for the sleight of hand the Government is pulling with this Bill because that is what it is.  It is a sleight of hand and an insult to the people of Ireland.  </p> <p>Someone said a while ago that we have not been told how many people have paid their water charges.  We have not been told for one very good reason.  Very few people are paying them.  I did not register for Irish Water and I do not want &euro;100 for doing nothing.  If the Government is going to give me a grant, it should at least ask me to do something for it.  It is an outrage.  For the remainder of this session, the Government will ram through as much legislation as it can, come out with a sweet little budget in October, call an election and think it has fooled the people of Ireland.  We are not fools.  Certainly, the people outside here are not fools.  A few clowns last week outside the gates of the D&aacute;il let down the water protest people by being thugs but the Government should bear in mind that the people who are genuinely against Irish Water are not the thugs that were out there last week.  They are the ordinary, decent working people of Ireland.  </p></speech>

Fianna F&aacute;il won a landslide victory in the general election in 1977.  Martin O'Donoghue was the Minister for Finance at the time when the Government abolished rates.  I do not know if the Minister of State is old enough to remember that.  The Minister who succeeded him, Jack Lynch, who had a proud history, recorded the largest deficit ever seen in this country at 17.8%.  When we did that, we wiped out our source of income to run our services.  This is over 40 years ago.</p> <p>I do not mind taking hits and shots.  In response to Senator Craughwell, I have never voted like a sheep.  I have always voted with the knowledge that we need to pay for what we get and that if we do not contribute, we are not going to get it.  The Sinn F&eacute;in team in here then tells us about all the wonderful stuff we can have for free but they have little Greece up in Northern Ireland where they get &pound;14.5 billion every year to run their services.  What Sinn F&eacute;in does not tell the House is that the average townhouse in Northern Ireland pays &pound;1,000 per year in household charges.  At the end of the day, someone has to pay and someone has to contribute a little.  This is all that is being asked for across the economy.  I have always paid for water both in business and in my home.  I will always continue to pay for the services but I do not see why others should not pay.  </p> <p>I think there is a lot more to this Bill than Irish Water.  Senator Landy raised the issue of Enva in my town and our faith in the EPA.  I have no faith in the EPA and I have said so on the record here previously given the kind of carry-on it engages in.  The Senator said that the EPA took cases against 11 local authorities but it never took cases against some of the companies it should have taken cases against.  </p> <p>When we talk about history, we can pick out all the nice parts but there are bad bits as well.  The bad bits are the bits that made us the way we are today.  That is a fact.  The destruction of this economy began in 1977 and, unfortunately, it continued until it eventually fell over.  Now that we are in recovery, we will work with Fianna F&aacute;il and anybody else to try and put it back on its feet but when we talk, we must be honest.  My colleagues and I got walloped here a while ago by the Sinn F&eacute;in Senators for making comments.  You can come in here and not be truthful and describe what it is like on all parts of this island where people 100 miles from here pay the majority of these charges.  It does not matter who is here next year.  People will still have pay here because somebody has to pay for these services.  If not, we are suggesting that the ordinary householder or those on lower incomes should not have to pay and that it should be transferred to the taxpayer.  We will then have the two million people in work in Ireland paying to carry the rest.  I am not prepared to accept that in any way, shape or form.  I believe everyone should contribute a little and that this is the way we should go forward.  </p></speech>

I look forward to dealing with the specific points raised on Committee and Report Stages.  Reports in the newspapers stating that households could be liable to pay a fine of &euro;3,000 are incorrect.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ann Phelan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2293"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2293&amp;amp;pid=AnnPhelan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is not the household but the company that is involved in the waste management.  It is important this message gets out so that households do not get the incorrect idea that a fine of &euro;3,000 can be imposed on them.</p><p>Householders are not compelled to be customers of waste management companies but must be in a position to satisfy, if requested, an environmental enforcement officer as to how they are dealing with their household waste.  Senator Landy and I have listened to debates in county councils about people who are paying for their waste collection, notice that their neighbours never put out bins and wonder what they are doing.  This has been an issue for a long time, and the legislation will address it.  I agree with the Senator that everybody must pay a little.  When schools educate our children about how to be clean, tidy and deal with litter, they should also educate them about how to pay their taxes.  Ireland has a very good society and everybody pays for the privilege of living in a particular area.  It is very important that children are taught in school that they pay their taxes to the State for good public services.</p></speech>

I refer to employment that pays workers enough on which to live, that gives sufficient security of hours and certainty of income and in which every employee is treated with respect and dignity.  These are the basic elements of a fair workplace and society, yet, to our shame, they are being denied to many workers across the State.  Many in full-time jobs are paid so badly that they cannot afford the basics such as food, clothing, heating and accommodation.  People in full-time work and people who have worked all their lives have been made homeless as a result of spiralling rents.  A growing number of employees are being hired on zero or low-hour contracts that give them no or very few guaranteed hours of work.  They are vulnerable to having their usual working hours reduced at the whim of their employer.</p><p>We saw recently the disgusting way in which Clerys workers were treated.  Some had served the company loyally for years.  Members of staff whom I met outside the gates of Leinster House last week had worked in Clerys for over 40 years and were dismissed summarily in the most, cynical and disgusting way.  Despite this, we have been told by the Minister and his colleagues that this was absolutely legal.  That may well be the case, but it is immoral.  It is incumbent on the Minister and the Oireachtas to change the law to ensure workers cannot be treated that way and are at least entitled to fair notice and dignity.</p><p>Owing to each of these developments, there is growing concern about the deterioration in the treatment of workers due to issues such as those I have raised and the prevalence of low-paid insecure employment.  The Government likes to talk about job creation and decreasing unemployment.  That is only right and it is positive that the economy is starting to take off again and that people are returning to work, but many of the jobs are not decent or of good quality.  It is utterly unacceptable in this day and age that somebody could be in full-time employment but unable to feed his or her family or pay for the basics.  It is for this reason that I support the proposed ICTU charter on fair working conditions.  I have tabled the motion to call on all Senators, of all parties and none, to join me in expressing their support for the ICTU charter.  I urge the Minister to do everything he can in his work with the trade unions and employers to help to secure each of the elements of the charter.</p><p>The charter has five objectives: a living wage; fair hours of work; the right to representation and collective bargaining; respect, equality and ethics at work; and fair public procurement.  I acknowledge that work is already under way in some of these areas.  We have legislation passing through the Oireachtas in respect of collective bargaining and representation for workers.  There is legislation to set up the Low Pay Commission on a statutory basis.  I support that legislation but believe there may be an excessive focus on the minimum wage.  We also need to consider the broader issue of low pay and to do more to support employers in order that they can pay their staff more.  Of course, we cannot put unfair burdens on people.  Many employers are often unable to take home any pay because, after they have paid everybody else, there is nothing left.  Many have struggled in the past few years to keep their businesses open and are just starting to enter a recovery phase.  Therefore, we must work with them to make it easier for them to employ others.  We must financially incentivise small businesses, in particular, to take on long-term unemployed persons.</p><p>We must ensure we are able to deliver increases in the minimum wage and work progressively towards a living wage.  In supporting employers to meet their obligations in that regard it is in the State's interest to have appropriate subsidy schemes.  Ultimately, if somebody on the minimum wage has a family and is not earning enough to support them, he or she is entitled to family income supplement.  He or she would have to apply to the Department of Social Protection for a top-up from the State, but ultimately the State is paying to top up his or her wages because he or she is not earning enough from employment.  There is a need for more creative thinking in this regard and to work with both the trade unions and employers to help to ensure companies are in a position to pay a proper living wage that enables staff to pay for basics.</p><p>The other issue about which I am very concerned is the prevalence of zero and low-hour contracts.  Of course, these have been in the news recently because of the circumstances in Dunnes Stores.  However, Dunnes Stores is by no means the only company using these contracts.  Their use has increased significantly in the past few years, mirroring developments in the United Kingdom.  Zero-hour contracts take workers back to a time when one had to stand at a designated corner in the hope of being selected for work on the day, as pointed out by IMPACT.  These days, of course, people are waiting at home for a text message or a call rather than having to stand on the street corner, but the indignity and uncertainty are exactly the same.  This makes it very difficult for people to plan their lives and next to impossible for them to obtain loans.  I have met staff who, despite working in Dunnes Stores for years, are only on 15-hour contracts.  They tell me they usually work 30 hours, but they cannot get a loan for a car or a credit union loan to cover costs incurred at Christmas time because the credit union sees they are contracted to work for only 15 hours.  This puts staff in very unfair circumstances and means that they are afraid to speak up for themselves.  They are afraid to become involved in a trade union because they worry their employer would push them back down to the minimum 15-hour entitlement and take action against them.</p><p>There is yet another difficulty.  If someone is working less than 19 hours per week, he or she cannot receive family income supplement.  This makes it impossible for people to claim the State benefits they need to bring their income up to a level that is sufficient to meet the needs of their family.  Uncertainty about hours of work means that one cannot seek work elsewhere.  If workers do not know what hours they will be working for their employer the following week, they cannot seek a second part-time job to supplement their income.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Averil Power:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2351"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2351&amp;amp;pid=AverilPower&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Employers have put employees in an unfair situation.  This is unwise of employers, because organisations thrive on the basis of having high quality staff who care about their jobs, work hard and are positive about their working environment.  It is short-sighted of employers not to treat people with dignity and respect and to have a high staff turnover because they are only looking at the bottom line and not providing quality jobs for their staff and a quality service for their customers.  </p><p>It is imperative that the Minister acts now on this issue.  IMPACT has suggested banded hour contracts and that is a reasonable proposition, but there is a need for flexibility in some sectors.  For example, a small catering company might not know if it will have three weddings next week or none or what business it will have over the next few weeks, so it needs some flexibility.  However, a huge enterprise like Dunnes Stores operates in a very predictable trading environment.  It knows the busy and quiet times of the year.  A company like this should not be allowed to employ people on low-hour contracts.  It is not right that it should be allowed to continue those practices.</p><p>Another issue is the issue of public procurement.  The State spends over &euro;10 billion annually on goods, services and major capital projects such as roads and school building projects.  It is essential that in addition to delivering those projects and getting better roads and schools, we should leverage that investment to help achieve social objectives, such as supporting local businesses, reducing unemployment, ensuring fair conditions for workers and protecting the environment.  EU directives have moved away from the use of price only contracts, away from the idea that a decision be made between competing bids on the basis of price only analysis.  The reason for this is that comparing bids purely on the basis of cost often fails to deliver real value for money for a state because they do not take into account the relative benefits of competing bids for the economy and society as a whole.</p><p>I urge the Minister to implement EU directive 24 of 2014 as soon as possible.  I urge him to ensure that social clauses are used in our public contracts to help secure social, economic and environmental objectives and to include as a condition of contracts for major public services factors such as the impact of the respective bids on local employment and opportunities for jobseekers, implementation of apprenticeships and training measures for the unemployed and payment of the living wage.  Other states, including Scotland and Wales, are looking towards ensuring contractors pay the living wage to employees.  The Minister should also look at issues regarding safety, equality and the commitment of companies to complying with safety, equality and employment law and to respecting the State's industrial relations machinery.  We should not give contracts to companies that have a track record of not engaging, for example, with the Labour Court, the LRC or other industrial relations mechanisms.  We should be using our money and ensuring that companies getting taxpayers' money are treating their staff with dignity, delivering top quality projects and delivering value for money for taxpayers in a broader sense.</p><p>I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.  I urge him to work with the employer bodies and the unions to deliver on each of the five issues addressed in the ICTU charter for fair working conditions.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister to the House.  I also welcome this legislation and commend the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, on bringing it before the House.  Due to the importance of the provisions, I trust there will be no delay in making it the law of the land before the summer recess.  The Bill provides for the reinstatement of REAs and for collective bargaining.  At the same time, a further piece of legislation, the National Minimum Wage (Low Pay Commission) Bill 2015 is progressing through the Seanad.</p> <p>I accept Senator Power's point that if people cannot get 19 hours work, they do not get the family income supplement.  I recommend to the Minister that he speak to the Minister for Social Protection about this.  We should have a situation where the payment is tapered, so that if somebody gets 18 hours they would get 55% of the payment rather than 60% and if they get 17 hours they would get 50% of it.  Consideration should be given to this at some stage.</p> <p>This package of legislative proposals on industrial relations between employer and employee is the most far-reaching reform of Ireland's industrial relations machinery in decades.  The new REA framework is particularly important as the old structure of REAs has been struck down by the Supreme Court on constitutional grounds.  Whole sectors of the workforce lost a critical component of industrial relations machinery.  Now we have a statutory, robust framework to enable workers to negotiate terms and conditions of their employment in a civilised fashion, which will be registered and binding on both parties to the agreement.</p> <p>A central part of the agreement on the sale of the State's shareholding in Aer Lingus to IAG was based on a commitment that this legislation would be passed urgently and that a series of REAs would be negotiated for various sectors of the Aer Lingus workforce and registered when this Bill becomes law.  This is intended to protect against the outsourcing of jobs and compulsory redundancies and to provide for pay and improved conditions for Aer Lingus employees.  The REA framework will provide a platform for good industrial relations and will contribute to industrial peace in the workplace.</p> <p>Second, the programme for Government included a commitment to reform the current law on workers' rights to engage in collective bargaining, so as to ensure compliance by the State with recent judgments of the European Court of Human Rights.  Henceforth, workers, with the assistance of their trade unions, will be able to progress claims about pay and conditions of employment and can have the Labour Court decide on the basis of comparisons with similar companies.  This will allow workers, where there is no collective bargaining in place, to access the Labour Court and obtain a statutory remedy against exploitation.  This entitlement will create a whole new precedent on workers' rights where trade unionism is not recognised by the employer at present.  Collective bargaining is now a fundamental legal right in 24 of the 27 EU member states.  However, 100 years from the Lock-out, this is still not the case in Ireland.  It is a significant achievement of the Labour Party in government and of the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, that we are now introducing collective bargaining legislation.</p></speech>

They seemingly value the euro over the well-being or entitlements of their employees.  Every business has a need and a right to make a profit.  Profitable businesses maintain and create employment.  Employment is the greatest mechanism for lifting people out of poverty.  What this congress document seeks to do is to crystallise what congress sees as a much improved, if not ideal, scenario for employees.</p> <p>The first issue is the living wage.  While I do not have any principled objection to this, it should be noted that we cannot simply fix on a monetary amount and then solve all the ills.  Having sufficient funds, amounting to a living wage, is at its heart an individual matter.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Hildegarde Naughton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2395"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2395&amp;amp;pid=HildegardeNaughton&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It often depends on the level of State support, be it children&rsquo;s allowance or family income support among other measures.</p><p>It should also be noted that in this country we have re-introduced both the joint labour committee, JLC, framework and sectoral employment orders.  We debated the legislation last week and the measures are due to be introduced shortly.  Both of those mechanisms involve wage setting above the minimum wage.  The first thing the Government did was to restore the national minimum wage, which when one factors in the cost of living is, according to EUROSTAT, the sixth highest among EU member states which have a minimum wage.</p><p>The establishment of the Low Pay Commission was a priority for the Government.  The commission was officially launched on 26 February this year, to operate on an interim administrative basis.  Legislation to provide for the establishment of the Low Pay Commission on a statutory basis is progressing through the Oireachtas and will be enacted later this year.</p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy Gerald Nash, has stated he intends to hold a forum on the living wage in autumn, to which civil society organisations, trade unions and employers will be invited to discuss the concept of a living wage in this country.  That is a positive step and I am sure the Independent Members welcome it.  Dialogue on the issue is critical.</p><p>Zero and low-hours contracts have attracted some debate, in particular in the United Kingdom.  In the UK employees on zero-hours contracts are only paid for the time spent working, and if they are not given any hours by their employer they receive no compensation.  That is not the position here.  An employee in this country who suffers a loss by not being given hours to work, or told to be free to work, is compensated for 25% or 15 hours, whichever is the lesser.  However, that is not to say that we should be mindless of the issue.  In that light, the University of Limerick has started work on a study into the prevalence of zero-hour and low-hour contracts in the Irish economy and their impact on employees.  Having canvassed widely, the study will provide the Minister with the basis on which to consider what, if any, policy recommendations should be brought to Government to address issues relating to the use of such contracts and their impact on employees.  I hope Senators accept the Government is not turning a blind eye to the issue but any policy change or legislative initiative must be introduced on the basis of evidence, hence the study, which I hope will be completed as quickly as possible.</p><p>The programme for Government contained a commitment to reform the current legislation governing the right of employees to engage in collective bargaining, namely, the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001, so as to ensure compliance by the State with recent judgments of the European Court of Human Rights.  That was done by introducing the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2015, which we debated last week and which will be on the Statute Book at the end of this month.</p><p>Finally, I wish to mention the references to tendering in the charter, and the proposal that they would have a social or economic dimension.  The Government has a reform programme in hand to modernise the public sector and improve service delivery.  The Government recognises that public procurement is a key element of the programme, maximising the impact procurement can have in enabling communities to benefit in areas such as employment, training, assisting small business and promoting innovation.  The Government is not opposed to the principle of community benefit and has established a social clauses project group to examine public contracts where social clauses can be deployed.  That has happened, for example, in the case of the Grangegorman redevelopment project.  In developing this area we must be careful not to fall foul of EU procurement rules.  It would be a breach of the rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates, and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing those rules.  Therefore, while we should develop the area further, we must do so carefully.</p><p>I again thank the Independent Senators for tabling their motion today.  I hope they will concede that the Government does take seriously the rights of employees and that it has taken measures to uphold and strengthen them.  This is a subject that requires ongoing scrutiny.  I commend my colleagues for raising the issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-07-08a.293" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1115" speakername="Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015070800002#KKK00200"><p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  I agree with the previous speaker, that the motion before us is very timely, coming as it does at the end of a recession and at the same time entering into a period of growth.  Senator Power made some very cogent arguments in support of the motion.  It would be difficult for anybody who has the welfare of citizens at heart to disagree with the essence of what has been said here this evening.</p> <p>We are especially lucky in this country in the past 20 years that we have very good industrial relations.  In fact, we have had very little industrial unrest.  That is a very important plank of development and growth in any economy.  It is particularly true when one is considering investment from outside the country.  There have been some glaring cases, which have upset many people.  I refer first to what happened in Waterford Crystal and the long-drawn out saga which we had there, and the manner in which the workers had to fight for their pension rights.  It seemed like daylight robbery for anybody who had even a cursory glance at the story.  The Dunnes Stores episode also stands out as something of which we cannot be particularly proud.</p> <p>On the other hand, there is nothing to be gained by setting out to hammer industrialists or employers who have stepped out of line.  We must look at the matter in a positive and productive way.  The minimum wage rate per hour of &euro;8.65 has been in place since 2007, a period of eight years.  Much has changed in that time.  I do not believe there has been any assessment of the changes within the economy during the period to assess whether the rate amounts to a living wage.  I accept it is a minimum wage but there is no doubt there is a difference between a minimum wage set by legislation and a living wage.  We must decide on what constitutes a living wage.  The Low Pay Commission should have some role in deciding what is a living wage.  It would obviously vary from one part of the country to another.  One must also take into account the fluctuations in the economy in terms of the construction sector, the acquisition of houses and mortgages.  Many areas have changed the landscape radically, yet we have not stopped to think what it would mean to the person who is trying to live on a certain wage and the demands on them.</p> <p>In addition, one must look for value for money.  It all depends on what one is expected to buy with the minimum wage.  It is necessary to examine the effect of the water tax, property tax and other taxes because they minimise the effectiveness of the wage one brings home.  One cannot just talk about looking after the rights of employers, one must also look after rights in terms of public provision as well.  However, one thing is certain, an hourly rate of &euro;8.65 cannot be considered a living wage in any context whatsoever.</p> <p>The most productive businesses are ones where the workforce is happy.  That has been proven time and again.  If the workforce is not happy then that will impact negatively on the work which is being done.  I do not have figures to support the case, but I think there was a degree of exploitation once the recession set in.  We saw the same exploitation with the undocumented Irish when they went to America, simply because they could not get their rights.  The same applied during the recession.  People found themselves in very precarious situations.  Very often they were prepared to accept less than what they were entitled to.  Given that we are entering into a period of growth, that day of exploitation must be confronted and made to stop.</p> <p>In terms of conditions within the workplace itself, I could never understand why there is any resistance to collective bargaining, representation or to the trade union movement.  It is the only mechanism that guarantees first, fair play for the people who are being represented, but it also contributes to a working environment which is conducive to providing the goods, so to speak.  Therefore, we should be very clear about discouraging in every way the idea that dividing and conquering within a workforce is the way to make progress.  It is not a good policy.</p> <p>Other issues arise also which employers could examine.  We are all very clear on one thing, namely, employers have a difficult position as well.  One cannot get water out of a stone.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1968"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1968&amp;amp;pid=LabhrasOMurchu&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The main thing is to provide the structures which are necessary for delivering what is correct.  We have come a long way in regard to the idea of any type of discrimination in work.  If there were discrimination, I think it would jump out very strongly and there would be a reaction to it straight away.</p><p>I also feel there should be opportunities in the workplace to progress and improve people's position.  It is one thing to have training opportunities in community employment schemes and so on.  However, opportunities should also exist within the workplace in order that people can see it not just as a full stop type position but also as improving their position.  It would be in the interest of any good employer to give employees the opportunity to do courses for self-advancement.</p><p>To come back to the motion, it is exceptionally well crafted and has a number of interacting elements which we should not deal with in isolation but together.  The appeal we are making to the Government is to engage with all the partners in employment - trade unions, the Low Pay Commission, employees and employers - to give them all the opportunity to have an input into a proper charter as we go forward.</p></speech>

I second the motion.  I thank Senators Averil Power and Jillian van Turnhout, who asked me to second the motion in her absence, which I am delighted to do.  Senator Power has set out the salient parts of the charter for fair conditions at work and has elaborated on its importance, and I fully support her in that.</p> <p>This motion is very timely and welcome in light of what we have seen happen in the recent past, with Dunnes Stores workers striking for the right to fair hours of work and an end to zero-hour contracts and, subsequently, the treatment of the former workers of Clerys.  The very minimum anyone can expect is to be treated fairly in the workplace and to have the right, at the very least, to a decent number of working hours.  How can any employer expect someone to work for less than what they would get on social welfare?</p> <p>Just this morning, I got a telephone call from a man who was recently offered a job after many years of searching and applying for positions.  This man was thrilled to have secured employment, albeit part-time, and it made him feel 100 ft. tall.  However, he now finds he is being given four hours on two days a week and three hours on a third day, that is, 11 hours per week at &euro;10 per hour, which makes &euro;110 per week.  If he stays at home and draws social welfare, he will get &euro;188 per week.  How can this be right?  Employers must realise what they are doing to their employees and, if they do not, then we are obligated, as legislators, to make them aware and to protect employees.</p> <p>Everybody has a right to expect a decent living wage which enables them to live with a bit of dignity and a reasonable standard of living.  As a former employee of a trade union, I am fully aware of how unfairly some employees are treated by their employer.  Employers can, at the drop of a hat, change the terms of employment or working hours, increase the workload with no extra payments and, in some cases, they have even reduced the pay.  Their attitude is: "Take it or leave it.  If you don't do the job, there are many more who will."  However, let me be quite clear in what I am saying.  I am talking about "some" employers as not all are so ruthless.</p> <p>I have attended some Rights Commissioner hearings with people and I know how intimidating this can be for the ordinary worker, hence the need for union representation.  Funnily enough, every time I went there, the employers, who would not recognise the unions and would not allow their workers the right of union representation, always had legal representation at this hearing.  They did not represent themselves as they expected their employees to do.  They always had someone there to represent them.</p> <p>What are the employers worried about?  Is it dominance by a trade union in the workplace?  That is not what trade unions are about, nor indeed do they want to be about that.  What they want is to see fair working conditions for their members.  Surely that is not too much to ask.  Most people want to work and want to do a fair day's work for a fair day's pay.  It is common knowledge that the better one looks after one's employees, the better a return one gets, as Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; has just told the Chamber.  That is why I very much welcome the legislation on collective bargaining.  This is progressive legislation which will give workers whose employers do not recognise trade unions or collective bargaining the mechanism to put forward claims around their pay, terms and conditions and working conditions, and it means both sides can actively participate in negotiations.  I also look forward to the legislation which will establish the new Low Pay Commission on a statutory basis.  This commission will give a yearly report to the Minister with its recommendations.  I believe the first report is due on 15 July and I eagerly await its findings.</p> <p>This morning Senator van Turnhout read out statistics on the number of children who go to bed hungry.  Why?  It is because of a failure by successive Governments to ensure a living wage that will ensure a minimum standard of living and a former Government that saw fit to reduce the minimum wage.  What was it thinking?  Thankfully, we have addressed this, and it is to be hoped, following the report from the Low Pay Commission, that we will be looking at increasing this further.</p> <p>In a poll conducted in June, the key findings showed that 86% agreed that the minimum wage should be increased while 77% agreed it should be the same as a living wage.  It also found that 86% agreed the Government should do more to prevent the use of low-hour contracts.  Last week the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill was passed by the D&aacute;il and it will become the law of the land shortly.  The Bill largely reinstates registered employment agreements, REAs, and also provides for sectoral agreements.  Many of those who will be covered by the legislation work in exposed or low pay sectors of the economy.  The Bill provides us with an important tool to protect their conditions of employment.</p> <p>While there is an absence of specific data, it is believed that low-hour contracts are most commonly found in the retail, hospitality, health and education sectors.  A research team from the Kemmy business school at the University of Limerick has been appointed to conduct the first Government study into the prevalence and impact of zero-hour and low-hour contracts in Ireland.  Perhaps the Minister would update us on that.</p> <p>The motion refers to procurement.  I had a recent Commencement debate matter proposing that the tendering process be done on a regional basis rather than a national basis.  Some small businesses cannot compete with the big multinationals and big businesses, which can tender at much lower prices.  If it was done on a regional basis, it would keep the work in the regions.  I have discussed this with the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, and we have been working on it.</p> <p>I could say more but I will conclude.  I commend the Taoiseach's nominees on bringing forward this timely motion, which I am very happy to second.</p></speech>

I commend the Independent Senators on bringing forward this motion.  It was bizarre earlier that we had a Labour Party Senator who gave us a Second Stage speech on a Bill we had discussed last week, and we had what can best be described as a Thatcherite speech from one of the Fine Gael Senators, so the debate did not get off to a good start.  However, some very good contributions were made by others who have spoken.</p> <p>I know some of the Independent Senators who have tabled this are trying to get support and consensus from across the board.  However, I have to say that many people have been hurt by this Government - Senator van Turnhout spoke this morning about child poverty - and more people are living in poverty in this State now than was the case before this Government took office.  It has deepened inequality and injustice, yet Government party Members seconded this motion today.

At some point my party may be in government and will have to make tough decisions.  All of the reports that have been published on the issue of low pay by EUROSTAT, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, the Think-tank for Action on Social Change, TASC, and others show that 20% of all citizens in the State are in low paid jobs.  That means they do not have a living wage; they are working, but they do not have money to pay basic bills and meet their needs.  </p><p>In the past few years there have been several industrial relations conflicts: at Talk-Talk, Waterford Crystal, Game, La Senza, Lagan Brick, Clerys, Dunnes Stores and Vita Cortex.  In every instance ordinary working people were shafted and not given the protection of the State.  That shows that we have very weak industrial relations law.  Nothing the Government has done would have prevented any of it from happening.  In the next few years, unfortunately, owing to a lack of political will on the part of the Government, there will be more of this.  It has brought forward a very weak form of collective bargaining which is voluntarist.  It has not brought forward any legislation to prevent tactical insolvencies such as the one that affected the Clerys workers.  There is nothing to deal with the prevalence of low-hour contracts and their exploitative nature which is driving under-employment and precarious employment in the State.  In turn, it is driving many women into poverty.  Women make up the huge ranks of those who live in poverty and &ldquo;the precariate&rdquo;, those in low paid, low-hour contract jobs.  Nothing the Minister has done will prevent Dunnes Stores from treating its workers in the way it does, or prevent another tactical insolvency such as that in Clerys, or prevent all of the other problems that affect ordinary working people from arising.  Every time this happens Ministers and Deputies roll out the tea and sympathy, saying it is terrible, but when it comes to supporting legislation such as the Bills we have published, including the Companies (Amendment) Bill 2015 to deal with the corporate veil and the Protection of Employees (Amendment) Bill 2012 which sought to deal with insolvencies, it votes all of them down because it does not have the political will to deal with the problem.</p><p>I judge the Government on what it does.  I want to see legislation in place to prevent these issues from arising.  Industrial relations law in the State is heavily weighted in favour of employers, not employees.  If we want fair hours, decent work and pay, we have to bring forward legislation, which is what the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, wanted.  I attended the briefing session which the Independent Senators also attended in the aftermath of the Dunnes Stores debacle.  We have produced a Bill which we will publish next week to seek to give effect to the ICTU's proposals on banded hour contracts.  That is the way forward.  Most of those on low-hour contracts are working between 25 and 40 hours a week for long periods, some for four or five years, but they are stuck on ten, 12 or 15 hour contracts.  Our Bill will seek to ensure a worker who works 20 or 30 hours a week would be able to move into that band and the contract should show this.  Unscrupulous employers do not do this because they use low-hour contracts to exploit workers.  The hours are cut if a worker steps out of line or joins a trade union.  That affects many workers.  The Minister does not want to deal with any of these issues because when we raise them, he tells us it is a question of competitiveness.  That word is always thrown about to prevent the State from doing what it should do to ensure proper treatment for workers.  The most competitive countries in Europe are the ones in which there is decent work and pay and that have robust industrial relations laws and proper protections for workers.  They do not build their economies on indecent work or low pay.  They build them on strong wages, not poverty wages, and workers&rsquo; rights, not a denial of workers&rsquo; rights.  That is what my party wants to see happen.  </p><p>I commend the Independent Senators for bringing forward this important motion and the ICTU for its relentless campaign to have these issues dealt with.</p></speech>

I am pleased to support the motion and thank Senator Averil Power for tabling it, as it gives us an opportunity to see where there is consensus and agreement for the betterment of all.  </p> <p>I compliment the ICTU on putting forward the charter for fair conditions at work.  I have been an employer more often than I have been an employee.  I worked in the private sector for almost 15 years with a small or medium-sized enterprise, SME, an office supplies company in which I rose to the position of director and took many decisions as an employer.  When I approached the ICTU charter to sign it, I brought some of that experience with me.  What it lays out is reasonable and something we should all be striving to achieve and ensure.  That is why I am very happy to support the motion.</p> <p>The living wage technical group, comprising the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice, the Nevin Economic Research Institute, Social Justice Ireland, SIPTU and TASC, on Monday published a report which calculated that people needed to earn &euro;450 a week or &euro;11.50 an hour to achieve a minimal acceptable standard of living.  That is one third more than the current national minimum wage of &euro;8.65 an hour for an experienced adult, that is, an adult over the age of 18 years who has been in employment of any kind in any two years.  A person under 18 years earns &euro;6.06 an hour; someone in the first year of employment since turning 18 is entitled to &euro;6.92 an hour.  I deal with groups dealing with children in crisis.  A young person who comes out of the care system at the age of 18 years is expected to fend for himself or herself and make ends meet, but in a first job he or she is entitled to only &euro;6.92 an hour.  That is a meaningful &euro;4.58 below the estimated living wage.  How is anyone, especially a vulnerable young person leaving care with very little support, supposed to survive on this?  I know that the Low Pay Commission is set to report on the issue next month.</p> <p>The sum of &euro;11.50 represents a 5% increase on the living wage calculated in 2014, despite a decrease in food, energy bill and universal social charge, USC, payments.  I was surprised by this, but it includes the private rental sector which we discussed earlier today.  It comes up time and again that a disproportionate amount of people&rsquo;s incomes is eaten up every month.  One in five families is in the private rental sector, quite a significant number.  It is absolutely essential, therefore, to tackle the housing crisis.  There is a chronic shortage of social housing and a lack of rent certainty and regulation.  There are continual rent increases.   Threshold has made several proposals on the Residential Tenancies Act, 2004. </p> <p>There is a lack of investment in child care services.  I was very surprised to hear the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection suggest that in the next budget there be an increase of &euro;5 in child benefit.  Throughout the crisis we heard lectures in this House to the effect that cash transfers were not the answer, that the Government had to invest in services to reduce the cost of services and ensure quality services were available for all children.  We have the highest child care costs in the European Union, at 35% of a family&rsquo;s income, whereas the EU average is 12%.  That is not because child care providers are charging more but because the Government is investing so little.  Our rate of investment in child care is 0.4% of gross domestic product annually, which means that we are lagging way behind the European average of 1% of GDP.  This issue needs to be tackled.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jillian van Turnhout:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2391"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2391&amp;amp;pid=JillianVanTurnhout&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Colleagues have already raised the issue of fair hours of work and I certainly back what Senator Moloney said.</p><p>I also wish to raise the issue of the family income supplement.  An employee must work at least 19 hours per week.  Particularly for lone parents we were promised cuts would not be made without the aforementioned child care being in place.  Even though that is not in place, draconian cuts were made.  Having been an employer, I find it demeaning that employees have to bare their souls to employers.  They have to fill out a form outlining all their life details and ask the employer to sign the form.  All this information is known by the State.  The employer, who is signing this, has that person over a barrel and knows his or her personal life story now, which, as an employer, I do not believe should be the case.  That brings us into the exploitative low-hours contracts.  It avoids obligations regarding pensions and holiday pay.  It is immoral to keep staff in a permanent state of insecurity.  It has a real impact on quality of life and family life.</p><p>I wish to deal with the right to representation and also, with my former employer's hat on, the right not to be represented.  There are both rights.  The difficulty is that when it comes to the gender pay gap, the figures clearly show that those who are represented by unions will do better.  Figures from Britain show a staggering 22% difference between unionised women's pay and non-unionised women's pay.  The gap is narrower in the public than in the private sector, which is primarily due to the higher rate of unionisation in the public sector.  This is mirrored across the EU where women's wages in the private sector are approximately 10% less than in the public sector.</p><p>This is borne out by a recent international analysis.  In the US in 2014 the National Women's Law Center found that the gender pay gap between what unionised male workers make and what unionised female workers make is just 9.4%, meaning that women working full time make more than 90% of what men do.  This compares with a pay gap of 18.7% among non-union members.</p><p>US companies such as Facebook and Apple recently announced they would pay for female employees to have their eggs frozen to facilitate starting families later.  It might be more useful for employers to consider giving facilities and fridges for the production and storage of breast milk.  We really need practical Government policies, such as a one-year maternity and paternity leave.</p><p>I commend Senator Power on tabling the motion, which gave us an opportunity to explore the different aspects of the charter.  It is a really good device for us for us all to strive to find better working conditions and to have the society we wish to have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-07-08a.302" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1123" speakername="Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015070800002#NNN00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to engage in this debate.  I commend Senators Power, van Turnhout and Moloney on tabling the motion.</p> <p>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has brought the issue to the fore in recent times.  I was very happy to sign the charter it presented to Members of the Oireachtas regarding subscribing to a national living wage that would be available to employees.  I listened to what Senator Cullinane said about employees.  There is a need for balance, which Senator van Turnhout from her days as an employer will recognise.</p> <p>There is a need for a national debate on the issue, which goes beyond simply a wage.  It is about what sort of society we want to have into the future.  In Scandinavian countries and in Holland society is about much more than work.  It is about living, leisure time, family time and having preschool facilities.  All of that fits into the type of society.  Today's debate is about having a living wage.  While such a threshold would not be legislated for, all employees would strive towards it and employers would be encouraged to provide that level. </p> <p>Dr. Miche&aacute;l Collins of the Nevin Economic Research Institute produced an interesting initial document which can be used for part of the debate.  He went into some of the work that was done in the greater London area looking at the minimum wage and the living wage there.  In his budget today, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer announced a national living wage that would be &pound;9 by 2020 and the threshold would be somewhere around &pound;7.50 or &pound;7.60 this year, and the British low-paid commission would implement that.  There is certainly something there we can use.</p> <p>Particularly here in Dublin there is a rental crisis.  In some parts of the city rents have increased by 48% over the past 24 months.  That is creating widespread poverty in working-class areas.  Setting the living wage might not necessarily deal with that, but there is a wider issue of where the State should be involved and where the State should not be involved.  For example, should the State be involved in setting thresholds for rent to allow people to live in areas close to where they work or do people have to spend three hours commuting to Dublin?  Is that the type of society we want?  The State must be involved.</p> <p>There is a theory of economics that suggests the state should not be involved in such issues.  However, the state must be involved where there is market failure.  Clearly there is market failure in the provision of adequate living standards to provide for people's needs - not their wants, just their basic needs - and that is what a living wage is about.</p> <p>I commend the work done by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The technical document that has been published is certainly very detailed.  It covers a multitude, including transportation costs, educational costs, social inclusion and participation, housing, household fuel, personal costs, child-care costs, insurance costs, savings and contingencies, health, personal care, clothing and food.  These are essential items for anyone and the State has to intervene in this area.  I hope that in conjunction with his Government colleagues the Minister will be in a position later this year to set a plateau.  I understand that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Nevin Economic Research Institute identified &euro;11.45 as the minimum living wage and we should strive towards that.</p> <p>The research carried out in Britain identified &pound;9 as the living wage required in London and the British Government announced today that it would achieve that by 2020.  The information produced here and the research undertaken can facilitate a Government response, and I hope there will be a response to this important issue.  It will distinguish our society.  It will mean that the State has an onus to recognise and appreciate employees.  We can recognise the valuable contribution workers make to our society by setting that living wage threshold.  I hope the Government engage proactively on the issue.</p></speech>

I congratulate him on some of the work he has done in recent times.  There is no doubt that he is bringing employment into the country.  I am concerned that we constantly look for big-ticket employment announcements by large companies, such as the Vodafone one today, which is, of course, tremendous.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2402"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2402&amp;amp;pid=GerardPCraughwell&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, sometimes, particularly in rural Ireland, we should be looking to create five or six jobs here and there instead.  If enough small companies employing five or six people were created, eventually we would have 150 jobs.  I wonder if we are concentrating enough on that aspect.  Perhaps there is room for the education and training boards, ETBs, to get together with county development officers to do some work in that area.  </p><p>I am delighted Senator Power tabled this motion.  She and Senator van Turnhout have been great advocates for the downtrodden in this country, the number of which is becoming fairly large the way things are going.  We have a new term in this country which is "income poverty".  It arises where a family, the people in the house, are working, but are living in constant poverty and are never going to get out of it.  This causes me serious concern. </p><p>We are all aware of the Clerys debacle.  Today the T&aacute;naiste told the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that it will cost the country millions.  We have Dunnes Stores and its appalling treatment of staff, who have been kept on low hours, low pay or a combination of both for years.  However, this does not just happen in the private sector.  Casualisation has become a feature of public sector work and I am not just talking about work at the bottom of the scale.  Teachers, lecturers and nurses are being brought in on casual hours.  What really annoys me when I look at that situation is that as a trade unionist, I, like my colleagues, have taken cases to the Labour Court and before rights commissioners.  I recall taking one particular case to mediation, where the employer was told it was wrong.  We moved from mediation to the rights commissioner, where the employer was told it was wrong and ordered to pay compensation.  The employer decided not to take up the rights commissioner's judgment and forced us into the Labour Court.  At the Labour Court, the employer was castigated for not doing the right thing by its employees and told to pay the compensation.  I moved out of the role I was in but, as far as I recall, that case was ultimately taken to the courts to get the money paid over to those employees.  This case involved a State employer using State money to block people's employment rights, which is simply wrong in every way. </p><p>Yesterday there was an announcement on 610 special needs assistants for schools.  It was not announced that the work they are going into is fragmented.  It is not right to have them sitting around the place all day waiting for a couple of hours work here and there.  We have the issue of lone parents.  We are constantly arguing in this Chamber and looking for the Minister to come in here to deal with the lone parents issue.  The fact today is that a lone parent with 20 hours work is losing 16 hours per week and that is after family income supplement.  A lone parent who has less than 19 hours will lose as much as &euro;42 per week.  We can ignore these things but ultimately it is grossly unfair.  </p><p>I will be accused of politicking here but 25% of city and county councillors have no employment other than their representational role.  One particular councillor who rang me recently has a life threatening disease, cannot work, has been told there is no sick pay and, because there is no proper PRSI, has no entitlement to PRSI benefits and will finish up in some means-tested system.  This is totally and utterly wrong.</p><p>I heard something very interesting yesterday at the Irish Congress of Trade Unions event which stayed with me.  It was from a Northern Ireland colleague who was talking about the equivalent of family income supplement, or tax credits, as they call them up there.  The point she made was that we are subsidising bad employers.  The congress has called for a fair living wage of &euro;11.45 per hour and has circulated a document asking people to sign it to say they support the notion of a living wage.  It would be something else if the Minister were to sign it and say he supports it, was prepared to back it and thinks it a fair, just and equitable thing to do.  It would be an amazing move by a Minister in this Government or any Government to come out and say he or she supports people having a fair, decent livable wage with fair hours of work and fair terms and conditions of employment.</p><p>The Minister is doing an awful lot and is to be commended on what he is doing to bring employment back into the country.  I believe in giving credit where it is due but there are employers in this country for a long time who have been treating their employees in an appalling way and that includes employers in the public sector.  Much has been done.  The industrial relations Bill will solve some of the issues and congress is happy to see it although there are some issues it would like to see changed in future upgrades or amendments to the Bill.  </p><p>I will finish on this point.  There is nothing worse than the pain of unemployment and of getting up every morning not knowing what to do for the day - I have been there - but what is hell on earth is having employment and not having enough money to do the things one would like to do.  Most of us in this House have enough money to do the things we would like to do.  Let us support congress on this matter.  I thank my colleagues for tabling the motion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-07-08a.305" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1128" speakername="Paschal Mooney" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015070800002#OOO00200"><p>I will not keep the House long but I add my voice in support of this motion, which is an all-party motion, although particular acknowledgement and tribute is due to Senators Power, van Turnhout and others.  Like many colleagues who have already referred to it, I too was happy to meet representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and to sign its petition on having a living wage of &euro;11.45 per hour.  I understand this to be a 5% increase on the 2014 figure.  In its charter, ICTU notes:<blockquote><br /><br />A living wage affords an individual sufficient income to achieve an agreed, acceptable minimum standard of living, taking account of the need for food, clothing, heating, accommodation, transport and other essential costs.  Currently, it is estimated that in order to earn a living income from full-time work - taking account of taxes and welfare - it would be necessary for a single adult to earn at least &euro;11.45 per hour.  </blockquote>The living wage technical group publication also addresses family living incomes by setting out gross salary incomes per adult for a number of different family types.</p><p>To put that &euro;11.45 in context, I will wear my other hat.  I am chairman of the Leitrim County Childcare Committee.  There is a crisis in child care.  It is not necessarily an access or costs crisis.  The crisis relates to the number of people who, encouraged by this and previous Governments, upskilled by undertaking further education and have obtained FETAC level 8 qualifications, which is graduate status.  They are working in the child care sector for less than what is being asked here today.  They are working for less than &euro;11.50 an hour and, in some cases, it is as low as &euro;10.00 and &euro;10.50 an hour.  These are graduates.  These are people who have gone through the educational system as well as working to upskill themselves.  This is the bedrock of the policy we have been hearing from the Minister's Cabinet colleague, Deputy Burton, over the past number of weeks when she speaks about people getting out of welfare and into work.  These are people doing just that.  I am singling out this particular sector to put some flesh on the argument because it is in the context of what we are talking about here.  We have people who are at just about or under the figure the Irish Congress of Trade Unions believes, as I quoted earlier, is a living wage that helps people raise families and put food on the table.</p><p>I could not help but reflect, in the context of this motion, on the horrors being inflicted on the poor people of Greece.  One figure in the past few days stands out.  A man was quoted as saying his mother's pension had been reduced from &euro;2,400 a month to &euro;700 a month.  We are not quite as bad as that but there is a significant cohort of people who are living below the poverty line.  A case was brought to my attention of a woman who approached the Society of St. Vincent de Paul somewhere in the country looking for support to put food on the table.  She had sold her television the previous week in order to do just that.  I inquired if the family was in receipt of social welfare and learned this woman is doing a course and is trying to get out of the poverty trap but is finding it almost impossible to live.  I did not think a person would get money for selling a television in this day and age because they are a throwaway item nowadays.  That brought the situation home for me.  I am sure there are many other incidents of people in such situations despite all the economic statistics which show us as having an increase in GDP, growing jobs and that there are more people at work, all of which I welcome.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paschal Mooney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1990"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1990&amp;amp;pid=PaschalMooney&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am not disputing that notion and congratulate the Minister for the compassion and commitment he has brought to creating jobs since the recession hit hard.  Long may he continue to do so.  There is a cohort of people who find it almost impossible to live and, sadly, many children are suffering as a result.</p><p>Anybody who comes to this argument and approaches this motion could not help but be totally supportive of the initiative that has been put forward by ICTU.  Within the confines and the restrictions being placed on the Government in terms of funding, surely the first people who must be helped are those at the lower end of the scale, those who need a hand up, not a hand out.  I would hope that in the framing of the budget in October there will be a collective view within Cabinet that the most vulnerable in society, those who find it difficult to make ends meet, to put food on the table in this developed society, which Vincent Browne says regularly on television is one of the richest countries in the world, will be helped.  It should not be happening.  I am not suggesting that I or anybody in this House has a monopoly on sympathy and compassion.  We all come into this and the other House in the hope that we will make life better for our citizens.  Perhaps I can leave the Minister with one message, the theme of all that has been said during this debate, that behind the proposals for a living wage we urge the Government in the next budget to look at those at the lower end of society who desperately need some Government help.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-07-08a.307" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015070800002#PPP00200"><p>I thank Senators Averil Power and Jillian van Turnhout for tabling the motion which I am happy to support.  It is an important contribution to a debate on how we raise living standards and approach many issues in the industrial relations sphere.  I take issue with one thing Senator Averil Power said.  She gave the impression, maybe not intentionally, that most of the new jobs are low paid jobs.  That is not true.  We have 105,000 extra people at work in the past three years, 91% of those are full-time jobs.  Part-time working is in decline.  Part-time working overall fell by 14,500 in the past two years.  More significant than that is the fact that part-time underemployed, in other words people who were working part-time but were not happy to work under part-time, has reduced by 41,000 in the past two years, down 26%.  Much of the involuntary part-time working is in significant decline.  Long-term unemployment has come down 40% in the past three years, down 61,000.  We are making an impact on imbedded poverty in many of these areas.</p> <p>I thank Senator Power for paying tribute to the efforts in employment.  I believe that creating employment is one of the central anti-poverty measures that we can take.  We still have almost 10% unemployment.  Statistics show that the risk of being in poverty at work is one-seventh that of those who are out of work.  Therefore, getting people back to work is very significant.  Of the 105,000 extra jobs, 40,000 have come from Enterprise Ireland and IDA companies, which are high paying employments.  Some 8,000 are in education, 10,000 are in professional and scientific, nearly 8,000 are in construction.  I accept there is increasing work in tourism.  There is no doubt that much of that is on more irregular earnings.  That has always been a part of the sector.  It is a mixed sector as Senator Averil Power pointed out. There is irregularity in some of its work patterns.</p> <p>Clearly we are getting growth across the spectrum.  It is clear from the social breakdown that every occupation is experiencing employment growth.  We must keep employment growth central to our discussion on how we improve society.  We want to get more people back at work and people enjoying a higher standard of living.  Those are jewel objectives.  Given that we have 10% unemployment we have to keep those objectives as part of what we are trying to achieve.</p> <p>I reject totally the suggestion from Senator David Cullinane, who is not present, that we have done nothing but increase inequality.  Those jobs in themselves have greatly reduced the problems of inequality and also some of the direct measures we took by restoring the minimum wage, the JLCs, the registered employment agreements, protecting temporary agency workers, establishing the low pay commission, establishing a study into zero-hour contracts, all of which address practical issues such as the gap in collective bargaining legislation through which a horse and four was driven by the Ryanair decision of the courts.  We have been diligent in rebuilding protection for workers and, particularly, for vulnerable workers.  In terms of the minimum wage, the Minister of State, Deputy Gerald Nash, will set up a forum later in the year.  </p> <p>The living wage is a concept.  It is not a legally binding concept, it is a concept where employers sign up voluntarily to such an approach.  It  is welcome.  Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; said talent is the key to all growth.  Employers should be setting out to create an environment where they maximise the potential and protect their workforce because that is the key to growth.  </p> <p>I welcome the approach of presenting dignity, providing development opportunities and improving the living standards of workers.  That is something for which we must strive but, as the motion recognised, we have to do it in a balanced way.  We have to recognise what is the position of employers.  As Senator Averil Power recognised, some employers have gone through an appalling period.  Some 81,000 businesses closed during the crash.  One has only to think of the life's work that was put into building up those businesses, yet they are gone.  We have to strike a balance.  Congress is offering a charter and using that in a process of industrial relations development in the coming years is important.</p> <p>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill pointed to the UK and its decision today to increase the national minimum wage.  It calls it the living wage but it is an increase in the national minimum wage.  It is an interesting measure.  However, there are also other things that people will want to look at.  For example, it is withdrawing many of its social welfare benefits, and student grants.  There is a whole shift away from welfare, cutting welfare and increasing the minimum wage.  It is an interesting approach and one that people will examine but it has a very definite philosophy.  One has to examine the package, not simply the headline.  </p> <p>Across the actual programme, on the wage levels we have done much to protect and restore work.  As Senator Hildegarde Naughton said on zero-hour contracts, we have a different provision.  We guarantee that if people are on zero-hour contracts they must get at least 25% of the wage or 15 hours.  I do not think zero-hour contracts are such a widespread practice in Ireland as elsewhere.  The study will throw up some elements that need to be examined as to the pattern of working in some sectors and how we can better protect it.  One thing that is different from the UK is that it does not have REAs that can establish decent working standards in sectors where employers are in a position to pay.  An REA is sanctioned and collectively endorsed by the Labour Court and signed into an order, making it effectively law, by me as Minister or a future Minister.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Richard Bruton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=119"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=119&amp;amp;pid=RichardBruton&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is something different and creates a framework which allows the development of living wage concepts.  The striking down of them was very damaging in the short term, for example, in the area of procurement, where we were potentially very vulnerable in the absence of an REA, to very low wage conditions in public contracts bids.</p><p>We are examining the issue of unfair hours, to which we will return when the study is finished.  All sides have recognised that we have moved significantly to introduce a balanced measure on collective bargaining and there is something in it for everybody.  It gives employers more certainty and workers, in cases in which an employer does not recognise workers' right to collective bargaining, the opportunity to go to the Labour Court to have realistic conditions provided by order, if the employer is not providing a comparable rate of pay or conditions to those in similar types of employment elsewhere, unionised or non-unionised.  It also protects workers from victimisation in the workplace, which was one of the issues raised.  It is balanced legislation.</p><p>Respect for people at work is one of the goals we have been trying to achieve.  The reforms we have brought through in the Workplace Relations Bill bring together the five disparate bodies engaged to try to have a more streamlined process for dealing with workers' complaints.  Much of the problem was due to long delays, multiple channels of application and the fact that it had become very legalistic.  As Senator Marie Moloney said, employers were coming in with an army of lawyers.  These factors made it more inaccessible and we are trying to simplify it to have a quicker turnaround.  </p><p>On the issue of public procurement, in the Workplace Relations Commission we made it easier in that if the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, was pursuing cases, one could go not just to the employer but also to the subcontractors in a public procurement contract if they were not honouring the terms of an REA.  We are moving towards having more social clauses in contracts.  A number have been built into contracts.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, has been keen on this and they have been included in school programmes, Grangegorman programmes and so on.  They have had the dual effect of ensuring people who have been unemployed are given an opportunity and building in a certain proportion of apprenticeships.</p><p>As a community, we must set an objective in the coming years of returning to full employment.  As Senator Gerard P. Craughwell said, people need to have the dignity of a job to go to, as it gets lives back on track.  One estimate is that 200,000 people need to get their lives back on track through a concerted effort to achieve a national objective of full employment.  It is not a soft or easy road but will demand many changes in how we do public policy, not least in education.  If we put our hands on our hearts and ask whether the education system is equipping young people with modern skills, there are weaknesses and we need to make changes.  If we want to equip the next generation with the skills they will need to cope in a globally competitive environment, we need to do better and introduce changes.</p><p>Setting a target of full employment would force us to iron out issues that might stand in our way, of which there are many.  We need to engage in this important debate.  We need people's living standards to rise, not by imposing obligations with which the system cannot comply but by way of a virtuous circle, by success and innovation in the workplace, leading to higher living standards and improvements in employment.  We have the opportunity to create such a virtuous circle.  There have been moments in our history when we have had the opportunity to create such a virtuous circle and keep steady in how we manage our affairs in order that the circle can fulfil its potential.  The opportunity has come our way again and we must seize it.  While we are starting from a difficult position, with many people still out of work, we have the opportunity to seize it if we take the right approach.</p><p>I thank the Senator for proposing the motion which is very constructive in this environment.  Talent will be the key.  Ireland will win by the way it orchestrates talent, builds new businesses and an innovative environment and fosters workplaces that allow people to fulfil their potential.  That is how we will be able to deliver the services we want and have money back in communities.  We have embarked, for the first time, on our regional enterprise strategy.  It is a genuine, bottom-up strategy.  We are sitting down with all players, involving our agencies, getting the best ideas, having competitive calls and giving people the chance to reshape their regions.  That is the way we must go.  This has been a very good debate.  We must ensure we grow a strong economy that can provide full employment.  That would give us the avenue to do so much in other areas.</p><p>Because we have been successful in getting people back to work in recent years, as we approach the budget there are resources to address the damage suffered in parts of our system.  While Senator Gerard P. Craughwell is right to say there may have been problems with the terms and conditions under which SNAs were employed, it is a major change to be able to write a cheque and say we will have 610 extra special needs assistants in place in schools by September.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, has addressed the issue and is seeking more continuity and workflow.  That is included in the decision she has recommended to the Government, which has been approved.  </p><p>I thank the House for arranging this debate.  We will return to the issue again and again and can progressively build on the agenda set out.</p></speech>

In particular, I thank Senator Jillian van Turnhout, from the Independent group, for seconding the motion, for which I am glad that we have secured all-party agreement.  As a group, we deliberately drafted it in such a way that it would be achievable.  We did not seek to score points, throw petty criticisms at the Government or make it a party political matter.  We deliberately recognised progress that had been made and reforms that had been introduced in areas such as the collective bargaining legislation, as the Minister mentioned, which strikes a reasonable balance and has managed to secure wide support not only from employees but also from employers.  It has taken what has traditionally been a contentious, unresolved issue and resolved it in a fair way with access to the court, if necessary, to enforce workers' rights.  I recognise the work done on the national minimum wage and the Low Pay Commission and accept that much work has been done.  We have tabled the motion because there is still cause for concern.</p> <p>As I said in my opening remarks, many employees who have been brought into employment during recent years have been brought into low paid employment.  The record will show that I did not say &ldquo;most&rdquo; but &ldquo;many&rdquo;.  It is a concern and has been held up by research published this week by the Think-tank for Action on Social Change, TASC, which has shown that Ireland has the third highest incidence of low pay in the OECD and that the incidence of low pay is rising steadily and more quickly than in our international counterparts.  The incidence of low pay relates not just to the economic collapse of recent years; the study has found that the number of workers experiencing low pay has been rising since 2003.  This is a concern and we need to take stock of it.</p> <p>We have many fine employers.  Most employers have signed up on many of the issues we have raised such as good wages, fair working hours, the right to representation, respect, equality and ethos.  Generally, employers understand the point the Minister, Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and I have made, that a good employer understands the best way to have a successful business is to keep staff happy and that employees who buy into the business on the same level as the owners and managers are part of a shared vision and want the business to be successful.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Averil Power:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2351"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2351&amp;amp;pid=AverilPower&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I can often tell as soon as I walk in the door of a shop whether staff are treated well by their employer.  Most employers treat their staff well but it is our job to stand up for those who are not afforded decent wages and working conditions or who do not enjoy equality and dignity in the workplace.  That is why we have the State's industrial relations machinery and why we need to pass legislation to protect those who are exploited, such as Dunnes Stores workers and others working in precarious employment.  I am glad there is cross-party support for the motion and I urge the Minister to act on the issues of fair pay and decent conditions of work.  An issue also arises of bogus self-employment, whereby people are effectively the employees of a company but they are hired as subcontractors in order that the employer can avoid putting them on the books or paying the employee's PRSI.  They can be left in a difficult situation in that, not having been employees, they are not entitled to social protection if they lose their jobs.  I ask the Minister to investigate this issue.</p><p>Senator van Turnhout has pointed out that fair pay, dignity at work and fair working conditions are not unreasonable.  Any decent employer would seek to provide them.  I urge the Minister to do all he can to work with employers and unions to ensure they are delivered in order that we do not see another Dunnes or Clerys.  The public was rightly outraged to see employees treated in that manner.  We need to review our laws to ensure all workers can enjoy the decency and respect to which they are entitled.</p></speech>
