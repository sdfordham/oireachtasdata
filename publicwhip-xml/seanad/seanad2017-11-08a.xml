I raise the matter of the need for the Minister for Health to explore the possibility of the HSE rolling out a nationwide sleep training programme to provide expertise to parents facing the challenges of getting their babies and young children to sleep.  Some may think that this matter is not as pressing as some of the other problems currently besetting the health service.  For many parents with young babies, however, this is a very important topic.</p> <p>For those unfamiliar with the subject, sleep training is the process of helping a baby learn to fall and then stay asleep through the night.  Some babies do this quickly and easily but others have trouble settling down to sleep or getting back to sleep after waking and may need help along the way.  I must admit that, up until quite recently, I had never heard of sleep training.  My partner and I became very familiar with the concept, however, when we desperately needed advice on how to deal with the challenge of our baby daughter's inability to sleep well.  It struck me that there are many other new parents across the country facing the issue of sleep deprivation.  There is no doubt but that the problem of a baby who does not sleep can have an impact on the whole household.  If a child is not sleeping properly then the parents will not be sleeping properly either.  Both the child and the parents will then be out of sorts for the rest of the day.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Frank Feighan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2014"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This can be an absolute nightmare for parents who have gone through or are going through it and anyone who has suffered sleep deprivation on an ongoing basis will appreciate it is like a form of torture.  It becomes even worse if the mother wants to return to work and there is no proper sleep routine in place.  When my baby, Francesca, arrived there was no sleep in our house for the first ten months.  It was difficult for my partner and we were at our wits' end trying to figure out how we could get a baby to sleep for at least a few hours during the night rather than 45 minutes at a time.  The first ten months were very stressful and as my partner prepared to go back to work the stress became greater because our little baby had no sleep routine.</p><p>Through parents' forums we discovered a sleep trainer who ultimately used her experience to give us back our lives.  The sleep trainer stayed in our house for a weekend to observe our baby's sleeping patterns and then provided a solution to the problem.  This, along with follow-up calls from the sleep trainer, meant that within a very short period our baby was sleeping like a baby.  It was incredible; my partner and I got our lives back and the baby, Francesca, was sleeping right through the night.</p><p>When I first heard of sleep trainers, I thought it was something that one would have in California and that we must get it and and at one stage I laughed at the fact that we had a sleep trainer coming to our house.  It was probably the best money we ever spent and, more important, our baby is sleeping at night.  Although worth every penny, this private service did not come cheap.  However, the HSE should consider rolling it out nationwide, in particular for first-time parents who are struggling with their baby's sleep patterns.  There may be an opportunity for a call centre and much has been done in the area through on-screen media.  Some counties may have the service in place to some extent with the support of the HSE but I would like it to be extended or explored further.  There are huge pressures on the health system but I never thought I would have been in such a situation where a simple answer provided an effective solution to a huge problem.  I thank the Minister for his interest.</p></speech>

Anybody who has been through that journey of sleepless nights, as, no doubt, the Cathaoirleach is aware, will empathise with the issue the Senator raised.  Having raised six babies in my own house, I know I do.  Nobody who has gone through those sleepless nights would think it a waste of time for the Senator to raise the issue in the House.  Raising awareness of the issue is one thing but raising awareness of the solution is even more important.  I had never heard of a sleep trainer until I was made aware of the Senator's Commencement matter.  It is probably too late for me but there are many others who would like to know of that.  I congratulate the Senator on raising the issue and highlighting a solution.  I welcome the opportunity to address the House on the matter.</p> <p>Healthy Ireland is the blueprint for how we will promote, protect and improve the health and well-being of people living in Ireland.  One of the main aims of the healthy Ireland framework is to support parents in improving health and well-being outcomes for their children.  This is also a key objective of the national child policy framework Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures.  Approximately 68,000 babies are born in the State every year.  Children, that is, those under 18 years of age, account for 25% of the Irish population, which means we have the youngest population in the EU.  The Health Service Executive, through the delivery of the national healthy childhood programme, has a key role in supporting families in order that babies can fully realise good health and well-being outcomes.  As part of this, the nurture programme for infant health and well-being is being led, co-ordinated and delivered by the HSE's national primary care and national health and well-being divisions.  It is a three year programme, supported by a grant from Atlantic Philanthropies to the HSE, which is designed to improve the information and professional supports provided to parents during pregnancy and the first three years of their baby&rsquo;s life.  It includes antenatal education, maternity and infant care, the transition to home and a schedule of child health reviews, vaccinations and screening visits.  These are provided as part of the child health programme and delivered by public health nurses, practice nurses, community medical officers and general practitioners.</p> <p>The subject of sleep difficulties for babies and young children is recognised as a challenge for many parents.  It is being addressed as part of the nurture programme.  Research with parents on information needs and concerns has identified sleep as an area of specific interest along with issues such as nutrition, general development, screen time and early language.  Current evidence indicates that management of sleep and other issues cannot be addressed in isolation and are most appropriately supported in the context of positive infant mental health and parent-child relationships.  The outputs of the nurture programme will include management of sleep in the parent materials and resources in development, including a new evidence-based HSE child health website for parents and carers of infants and children, updated books on caring for one's baby and child and a healthy pregnancy book.  In addition to parent resources, the programme will also include sleep as a subject in the overall child health training programme being developed for practitioners.</p></speech>

It is very important.  Many of the consultations were done on Skype and that could be further considered.  Simple things such as blackout blinds, a routine and diet are effective but we are trying to highlight the problem because most parents are so busy they do not realise there is some small issue that may be of assistance, nor that there is a lot of help available.  I only realised the extent of the issue when I raised it three weeks ago on the Order of Business and many fellow Senators and even the Cathaoirleach asked for the phone number of the sleep trainer.  I then realised this is a problem across the country and we should articulate, highlight and advertise that there is help and advice available.  My baby, her mother and I are now sleeping much better at night.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-11-08a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1415" speakername="Maura Hopkins" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017110800002#B00500"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his attendance in respect of an issue I have raised several times in the Chamber regarding the ambulance service in County Roscommon and, in particular, its response times.  There have been a number of reports on the issue, such as a HIQA report in 2014 and the Lightfoot report in 2016.  Both are very stark in their findings and provide us with evidence that action is required to ensure we have increased resources in the form of increased ambulances and personnel to deliver better response times for those in our region.  People there are currently at an increased risk because they are living in an identified blackspot area and are exposed to an increased risk of delayed intervention.  All Members know that being able to access a medical centre that can intervene at the earliest possible time will have a positive impact on recovery.  All Members know of the FAST campaign highlighting the need for quick action for stroke victims and that being able to get to a centre that can intervene as quickly as possible has a major impact in terms of intervention and recovery.  A hugely positive impact for sufferers of thrombolysis across the country is getting people to centres where they need to as quickly as possible.</p> <p>Residents of west Roscommon and east Mayo have to wait the longest time in the country for an ambulance to arrive.  Although there is an ambulance base at Loughglynn, County Roscommon, it is currently being operated by a crew from Roscommon town.  I have raised this numerous times and it is not acceptable.  We need a functioning Loughgynn ambulance base serviced by a Loughglynn ambulance crew.  It is not acceptable that a borrowed ambulance from Roscommon town is catering for the needs of our region.  We do not want special treatment but we do want fair treatment and we deserve better.  It is not acceptable that no extra resources have been given for this area.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maura Hopkins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2478"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2478&amp;amp;pid=MauraHopkins&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->From the outside, it appears we are building hubs and a health service for an urban centre.  Medical treatments and interventions have become more specialised and centralised, which undoubtedly has resulted in positive outcomes according to the evidence and research.  As part of that movement, we must ensure that we are able to get those of our people who live in rural areas to those centres quickly.  It is currently very difficult in certain rural areas and I point in particular to west Roscommon and east Mayo.  We have also seen the hugely positive impact of the air ambulance service and its ability to improve response times, in particular for critically ill patients.  As such, it is essential to ensure that service is operational at night.</p><p>I have two questions.  First, when will we see increased resources for the identified black spot of west Roscommon?  Second, when will we see the air ambulance service operating at night?  What is happening?  The programme for partnership Government indicates that additional resources will be provided for the national ambulance service.  When will they be provided in identified black spot areas?  A feasibility study was to be carried out in respect of operating the air ambulance service at night.  What is happening within the HSE to progress that and when will it be operational at night?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-11-08a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017110800002#C00200"><p>The programme for partnership Government committed to a feasibility study on the expansion of the emergency aeromedical service, EAS.  In addition, the programme committed to delivering safer pre-hospital care by considering the recommendations of three reviews of ambulance services, namely, the HIQA governance review, the national ambulance capacity review and the review of Dublin ambulance services.  The programme further committed to providing additional annual investment in ambulance personnel and vehicles.</p> <p>The capacity review, which was published last year, examined overall ambulance resource levels and distribution against demand and activity.  Implementation of the recommendations of the capacity review will require a multi-annual programme of phased investment in ambulance manpower, vehicles and technology.  To that end, &euro;7.2 million in additional funding was provided in 2016 for the national ambulance service, NAS, including &euro;2 million in development funding.  In 2017, an additional sum of &euro;3.6 million was made available, which included &euro;1 million to fund new developments.  I confirm that additional funding will be made available for the continued development of the NAS in 2018.  This will be set out in the national service plan for 2018, which the Senator will be aware is being prepared as we speak.</p> <p>With regard to pre-hospital emergency care in Roscommon, the NAS operates from Roscommon town, Boyle and Loughglynn.  The Senator may wish to note that in order to further develop services in Roscommon, the NAS acquired the former Garda station at Loughglynn.  Following refurbishment, it opened in 2016 as a dispatch point.  This facilitates better utilisation of resources and provides greater geographical ambulance cover for the north Roscommon area.  The NAS dynamically deploys resources to respond to incidents as they arise.  This is achieved in the Roscommon area by dispatching resources from adjacent ambulance stations in neighbouring counties.  Thus, resources from ambulance stations in Carrick-on-Shannon, Tuam, Longford and Athlone can be deployed to incidents in Roscommon as required.</p> <p>Members will be aware that the EAS was established to provide a more timely response to persons in rural areas.  The service is operated by the national ambulance service in association with the Air Corps.  The service is available seven days a week in daylight hours and is specifically targeted at the west of Ireland.  The highest demand for the EAS comes from counties Galway, Mayo and Roscommon.  My Department and the national ambulance service are exploring the feasibility of extending the very successful EAS through the establishment of a community-based helicopter emergency medical service in the south.  Discussions in this regard are ongoing.  The capacity review identified particular difficulties serving rural areas such as County Roscommon.  Outside the greater Dublin area, the population is widely dispersed with a relatively large population living in rural areas.  On foot of this population distribution, Ireland has a far higher percentage of activity in rural areas than other ambulance services.  The review indicated that the only practical way to improve first-response times in rural areas is through voluntary community first responder, CFR, schemes.  The NAS continues to work with local CFR groups across the country to develop and enhance services.</p></speech>

In 2017, &euro;1 million in additional resources have been made available.  Surely, those resources should be directed towards identified, evidence-based black spots.  The Minister of State referred to the Loughglynn ambulance base.  To be honest, the response is not at all satisfactory.  The Minister of State said this facilitates better utilisation of resources.  This is otherwise known as a "borrowed ambulance", which moves between Roscommon town and Loughglynn.  It is not acceptable.  We need additional resources.  While the Garda station was acquired for refurbishment, a refurbished Garda station does not deliver an ambulance service.  We need ambulances and personnel.</p> <p>The Minister of State said discussions on the air ambulance service were ongoing.  I am looking for specifics.  Has the feasibility study started?  When will it finish?  We need to see the air ambulance service, which has been hugely positive and beneficial in getting critically ill patients to the centres they need to be in, operating at night.  Can the three specific questions be answered, perhaps outside of this Commencement debate?</p></speech>

He has given a comprehensive answer.  The Senator might take the matter up directly with the Minister of State in her own time.  In fairness, both Commencement matters thus far were supposed to be in for the last week but were not taken as a Minister was not available.  As such, the two slots lapsed.  We must find a way to improve our logistics.  I thank the Senator.  It is a very important issue for her and I am sure the Minister of State will talk to her about it.  Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn has four minutes for his matter.</p></speech>

I have spoken to one of his departmental officials this morning and have been in contact with his private secretary.  I have requested a meeting with the Minister and am happy for the Chief Whip, Deputy McHugh, who is also a Deputy for Donegal, to be present at that meeting because this is now an urgent matter which requires urgent attention from the Government.</p> <p>I will paint the picture for the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly.  Buncrana is a town of significant size but can he imagine any town in Ireland in which the main park, which is beloved by and rooted in the community, where families and the elderly go walking and where partnerships with schools, environmental groups and Tidy Towns groups are developed based on this amenity, has been utterly destroyed?  Just up the road there are major sporting amenities which have been utterly destroyed, including the destruction of a number of pitches at Cockhill Celtic.  It is two months since the flooding but I have had to raise the matter in the Seanad again and again to get someone in government to grapple with the issue.  That is how serious it is.  The major park and sporting amenities have been destroyed in one community while nothing is being done about it by central government.  That is why I am going to keep raising this every week, with the permission of the Cathaoirleach, until I get someone to grasp how serious the issue is and to grapple with it.</p> <p>A second issue is Glenevin Waterfall in Clonmany, a beautiful amenity which was developed by the local people and includes a riverside walk up to a wonderful waterfall.  It is part of the tourism offering in Inishowen and is beloved by the local community.  While they have worked to put it back in place, they need help and funding.  I acknowledge that the Government has stepped up with some of the relief schemes.  I acknowledge that Ministers came to Donegal very quickly when this crisis happened.  However, there is a sense that two months later, with the cameras moving on, major gaps exist which are not being addressed.</p> <p>Swan Park in Buncrana, Glenevin Waterfall in Clonmany and Cockhill Celtic Football Club are massive issues.  I am not taking a parish-pump approach to it.  I am being realistic when I point out that there is no other community in Ireland that would be abandoned in the way we have been in respect of our major amenities.  I ask the Government to understand that.  I ask the Minister, Deputy Ring, to meet me as soon as possible, address the issue and provide once-off emergency funding to get these amenities up and running again.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2321"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2321&amp;amp;pid=PadraigMacLochlainn&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is my appeal to the Minister of State.

I understand the Department of Rural and Community Development supported the development of Swan Park in 2015 through the pilot scheme for rural economic development zones.  We were all shocked at the extent of the damage to roads, bridges and property caused by the flooding in County Donegal in such a short period.  In response to these events, the Government immediately activated its humanitarian assistance scheme to assist people whose homes were damaged by flooding and who were not in a position to meet the costs relating to essential needs, household items and, in some instances, structural repairs.  I understand that temporary emergency support was provided for small businesses, community groups and sports clubs.  The Senator has acknowledged the Government's response in these areas.  I appreciate his concern about the amenities at Swan Park and Glenevin Waterfall.</p> <p>I am advised that, unfortunately, the Department of Rural and Community Development schemes which might have been of relevance closed for applications earlier in the year.  The closing date for county-based initiatives under the outdoor recreational infrastructure scheme was the end of May and applications under the town and village renewal scheme closed at the end of June.  Funding for 2017 under these schemes has been committed at this stage.  The Minister previously suggested in response to a parliamentary question that the Leader local action group in County Donegal could engage with the local community with a view to identifying whether Leader support could assist these projects.  Senator Mac Lochlainn has said he is not satisfied that Leader support is sufficient.  I suggest that if funding were available under Leader, it might help to leverage other sources of funding from the private or public sectors.  The approval of projects under the Leader programme is ultimately a matter for local action groups.  I encourage a further exploration with the local action group in County Donegal regarding the options available to support the repair of the amenities at Swan Park and Glenevin Waterfall.</p></speech>

That might lead to progress in this regard.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, does not have responsibility for this issue.  Ministers of State sometimes have to fulfil certain duties when Ministers are unavailable.  Perhaps the Senator's proposal could be worked on expeditiously.  That might be a better way to proceed.  If not, the Senator can certainly raise the matter here again.</p></speech>

I appreciate his guidance on this matter.  I ask the Minister of State to relay to the Minister the request I have made in support of the issue I have raised.  There is frustration because the unprecedented levels of water that accompanied this remarkable act of God destroyed the amenities I have mentioned.  On that basis, we are asking the Government to intervene.  This should not be treated as a regular application for funding.  The extraordinary events of last August require an extraordinary response.  Unfortunately, there are serious problems with the bureaucratic procedures involved in making applications for Leader funding.  In places like County Donegal, there are huge demands for the limited funds that are available.  The Leader programme is really not the way to address this issue.  In advance of the meeting I hope to have with the Minister as soon as possible, I emphasise to the departmental officials who are listening to this debate that we need an exceptional and extraordinary response.  This beautiful park, which is a key amenity, has been destroyed.  This beloved facility was developed over decades by the local community.  I cannot overstate the wonder and beauty of the amenities that have been destroyed.  In the case of Glenevin Waterfall, which is wonderful and beautiful, it is possible that Leader funding could make a limited contribution.  Urgent Government intervention is needed.  I do not know of anywhere else in Ireland where this would be allowed to continue without an intervention taking place.  I thank the Cathaoirleach again for his assistance and support.  I hope we can get a resolution soon.</p></speech>

We understand the Senator's plight.  Following Storm Ophelia last month, the people in coastal areas of west Cork can probably, as much as anyone else, empathise with the people of County Donegal.  I will pass the Senator's sentiments to the Minister.  Maybe it would be helpful to put a costing on the repairs that are required.  I know the Senator is engaging with Donegal County Council.  If he continues to work with the council to try to get an exact and precise cost for the repairs that are required, it will help in the process of getting funding for the project and ensure we are not talking in terms of unknown figures and facts.</p></speech>

This morning he is covering for the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, in respect of a matter of concern to people who live close to me.  I know the Minister of State is somewhat aware of the situation, which has been going on for some time.  I will elaborate on some of the facts before giving the Minister a chance to come back in.</p> <p>Ballinteer Educate Together national school opened in temporary accommodation in 2012 using classrooms borrowed from St. Tiernan's secondary school in the general catchment of Ballinteer and a number of half-sized prefabricated units while it waited for the design and approval process for the new school building to be completed.  In September of this year, it moved to temporary accommodation at Notre Dame secondary school in Churchtown.  While this is not a huge distance away in the context of the distances many Senators have to contend with, it is a considerable distance for national school parents who are used to bringing their children to a particular facility.  Some 280 students from Ballinteer Educate Together national school will share buildings at Notre Dame secondary school with two other schools for at least another two years.</p> <p>Five years on from the opening of this school, no timeline has been given for when it will return to its own permanent site adjacent to St. Tiernan's secondary school.  Some parents have experienced severe hardship as they have tried to facilitate the new arrangements at Notre Dame secondary school.  The lack of communication over the status of a new school building has contributed to this uncertainty.  Rather than being told anything officially, the parents involved have been getting news through word of mouth or on social media.  It is very unsatisfactory.  It is shameful that parents and staff first heard of the decision to move to Notre Dame secondary school through Twitter.  The issues that have created this situation do not appear to be budgetary and are not related to the planning of the building itself.  They seem to centre on the securing of planning permission for road access to the new site.  The initial application was submitted in 2012.  Today, we are no closer to any kind of decision that will help to get the new school built.</p> <p>Like the board and the parent-teacher association, I appreciate that these processes take time.  However, the continued absence of a solution to this problem has resulted in an unacceptable delay which is now beginning to have an adverse impact on the school's staff, pupils and parents.  As the school continues to grow rapidly, these effects will become more serious.  It is a matter of time before the children's educational experience begins to suffer.  I remain perplexed and surprised by the delays in the tricky negotiations involving external parties about access to the St. Tiernan's site.  I have been informed by the parent-teacher association that the Department intervened with a compulsory purchase order to make progress with a building at Gaelscoil Chnoc Liamhna in Knocklyon.  I wonder what legal impediments could be preventing a similar approach from being taken in this case.  Perhaps it is not possible.  We should investigate whether it is and let people know one way or the other.  I ask the Minister of State to convey this suggestion to the Minister for Education and Skills.</p> <p>I would be grateful if the Minister of State could give me an update on how mattes stand with the construction process.  It is not fair on the children and the parents to be treated in this way.  I have received a number of emails from the secretary of the parent-teacher association at Ballinteer Educate Together national school.  They confirm that the position is exactly as I have outlined.  They acknowledge that the children are happy in the transitional home to which their school has moved, even if it is further away from where they live.  We are all trying to get people to use sustainable travel and to work or cycle to school.  The site to which the school has moved is not half as convenient for most pupils as the school's long-term home adjacent to St. Tiernan's secondary school.  A stopgap solution has been found.  The Department might not consider south Dublin to be growing as quickly as other parts of the country, such as the commuter belt, but it has experienced a huge increase in population, and in population density, as a result of the construction of apartments and other housing units in places like Dundrum, Sandyford, Stillorgan and Ballinteer.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerry Horkan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2476"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2476&amp;amp;pid=GerryHorkan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is putting pressure on all the schools in the area.</p><p>I ask the Minister of State to convey to the Minister that there is a palpable sense of frustration.  The final sentence in that email I received is to the effect that it is unfortunate they have had to reach out to me again but they require actors on their behalf to help build their national school.  They have requested if I can ask the Minister, yet again, to make further inquiries on their behalf regarding the progress on building a permanent home for Ballinteer Educate Together national school.  I have outlined their case.  I believe the Minister is aware of the situation.  I emphasise that progress on this matter is needed sooner rather than later.</p></speech>

On his behalf, I thank the Senator for raising this matter.</p> <p>The Ballinteer Education Together national school was successfully relocated to the Notre Dame campus on Upper Churchtown Road in Dublin 14 pending delivery of the permanent accommodation at the St.  Tiernan's community school site in Balally, to which the Senator referred.  On behalf of the Minister, I extend my thanks to all concerned for their work and efforts over the summer months in facilitating that logistical move.  The accommodation provided for the school at the Notre Dame campus since September comprises 11 classrooms.  It also includes ancillary accommodation.  Provisional enrolment data indicate an increase of 40 pupils from a total of 234 pupils in September 2016 to 274 in September 2017, meaning that an additional two mainstream teachers were required.</p> <p>Regarding progress on the permanent school accommodation, as has been stated previously, access to the permanent site is a complex planning issue.  Since June, the Department has met a third-party landowner on a number of occasions with a view to negotiating an acceptable solution to the access issue.  As these are commercially sensitive negotiations, it is not possible to comment further at this stage.  All aspects are being progressed in close liaison with the local authority in order to ensure that a further planning application has the best likelihood of success.  The Department is fully committed to bringing this project to a satisfactory conclusion as soon as issues relating to the planning process have been resolved.</p> <p>The Senator asked if I would give him an assurance that I will bring the issues he raised today to the Minister's attention.  I give him that assurance now.</p></speech>

I appreciate that the negotiations involved are commercially sensitive.  I emphasise that school authority is aware of the compulsory purchase order, CPO, relating to Knocklyon.  I will not ask the Minister of State to further outline those details that are commercially sensitive but I stress the urgent need to proceed with the project as soon as possible.</p></speech>

It would also involve putting in place a roadway that will need to traverse a protected structure adjoining the site.  A conservation architect was engaged to examine how this might be done to the satisfaction of the council without substantially materially impinging on the protected structure.  The architect's report was submitted to the Department and was discussed with the council and the third party on whose land the protected structure stands and from whom the land for the road will also have to be acquired.  This is a very complicated planning issue.  Planning permission for the new building for Ballinteer Educate Together national school and a physical education, PE, hall for St. Tiernan's has been sought and rejected twice by An Bord Plean&aacute;la on foot of objections from the council concerning access.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la asked that the Department and the council work through the issues to arrive at a mutually agreed solution in respect of the issue of site access.</p> <p>The Minister has said it is imperative that all of the work is done to the satisfaction of the council in order to ensure that a further planning application has the best likelihood of success.  If we rush into a planning application at this point without going through the process diligently and carefully, we could set the planning permission process back more substantially in the long term and, as a result, jeopardise delivery of the new school once again.  The land adjacent to the school site is in the ownership of a third party and negotiations and agreement - of which the Senator will be aware and which I am sure he will respect - in the context of access are required before a planning application that is likely to be successful can be framed.  These negotiations are ongoing.  However, as they are commercially sensitive in nature - I am sure everybody will accept that this is only fair - it is not possible to comment further at this stage.</p></speech>

We have all been hearing in recent days about different individuals who have been able to take advantage of some of the fruitful tax arrangements to which these papers refer.  Ultimately, it was a database of information that highlighted the tax affairs of some of the wealthiest individuals and companies in the world.  Why is this matter important?  It is important because it highlights how unjust is the wealth and income disparity across the world and among individuals who live in our country.  The Paradise papers highlight the huge unfairness that exists.  Many of the schemes involved are legal and amount simply to tax avoidance rather than evasion.  However, what is happening sits very uneasily with many of us, including me, regardless of whether we are PAYE workers or self-employed.  We pay PRSI, PAYE and income tax and we do not have the luxury of forum shopping in respect of our income tax.  It is something that disturbs and upsets many people and makes them very angry.  Our country is losing out on millions due to tax avoidance schemes.  I hope the Minister for Finance will come to the House and engage in a debate on this matter.  I also hope he will ensure that Revenue will be adequately resourced to investigate some of these papers to see if there is anything we are missing out on and if there is a possibility that we could recoup moneys from any of the individuals involved.</p> <p>This leads me to think about the money involved and what we could do if there were billions more in our Exchequer.  A great edition of "Prime Time" last week highlighted the standard of rental accommodation.  We saw people living in really conditions that are very unsanitary and unsafe.  I call on the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to come to the House to discuss an NCT-style approach, which Fianna F&aacute;il has been advocating since 2015.  Obviously, supply is one of the major issues but this is also a significant issue.  We cannot have people living in hazardous conditions like this, which are, ultimately, unfit for human habitation and, on many occasions, animal habitation.</p></speech>

We certainly did not hear any solutions, which means events such as those organised by Senator Feighan are of the utmost importance.  There needs to be far greater engagement.  I congratulate and thank Senator Feighan on his efforts.  The administration behind getting people there and the amount of work in setting up meetings with all the political parties in the UK must have been phenomenal.</p> <p>I also congratulate the Taoiseach for having the courage to walk into the D&aacute;il yesterday wearing the Irish poppy, the funds from which support Irish veterans and Irish people who served in the British forces and who are in need of support these days.  The Taoiseach is to be congratulated on this.  It was not an easy thing for anybody to do.</p></speech>

The housing crisis continues to get worse from month to month.</p> <p>I want to paint the human picture of this.  Just two weeks ago, I raised the case of a young woman, eight months pregnant, who was living in the most appalling accommodation and the fact the State offered her no support whatsoever and turned her away.  I thank the Leader for following up on that particular query.  Unfortunately, matters have got worse this week, the week in which she is due to have her baby.  She spent last night in a car.  That is the housing crisis in Limerick in 2017 where a 19-year-old girl, eight and a half months pregnant, with no supports, spent the night in a car.  She had been forced out of her apartment because the landlord cut off the electricity.</p> <p>The State services gave her one option, which was to stay in Thomond House.  The staff there do a wonderful job but, unfortunately, it is inhabited by a large number of heroin addicts.  When I asked the shelter manager if he could guarantee this young girl's safety, he said he absolutely could not.  That is the reality of the housing crisis in 2017.  Tonight, that girl still will have nowhere to go.  It is shameful that this is happening in the week she is due to give birth.</p> <p>Speaking to my office in Limerick this morning, I was told the situation will get worse, not better, because there are simply not enough new builds next year.  The situation continues to get worse month after month.  The blame lies solely with the Government and Fine Gael's ideological hang-up that the private market must produce solutions to the housing crisis.  When it keeps that fixation with this right-wing ideology, the reality is 19-year-old girls spending the night in a car when they are due to give birth to a baby.  Shame on the Government.</p></speech>

They seem to show that Ireland is falling short with only one third of that target group welcomed to Ireland to date.  In that context, and given that the deadline for meeting the Government's commitment is only two months away, will the Leader invite the Minister for Justice and Equality to the House to make a statement on this matter and outline what he and his Department are doing to meet the Government's promise and moral obligations in the context of the worst global refugee crisis since the Second World War, affecting 22.5 million people, half of whom are children?  Will the Leader invite the Minister for Justice and Equality to explain to the House what urgent action is being taken to relieve the suffering of displaced people in crisis, including children, through no fault of their own but for simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time?  What measures will the Department introduce, including family reunification measures, to honour Ireland's relatively modest commitments, which now seem likely to be missed?</p></speech>

I listened to their frustration over the lack of proper engagement by management in this industrial dispute.  As we are heading towards Christmas, we may be looking at further days lost in the workplace due to the lack of proper engagement by management.  I also spoke to many commuters across the city who spent hours in traffic delays yesterday.  Many of them came into work late and lost part of their salaries at a time when they can least afford it.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is more interested in finding a solution for North Korea than finding one for our capital city and country.  I listened to workers in Cork on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; who had to club together to get the taxi fare to get home because trains were not running.  It is unacceptable that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has more interest in - and less influence over - what happens in North Korea.  I hope the Leader can put a rocket under the Minister to encourage him to pay attention to his brief.</p> <p>At the weekend the Citizens' Assembly met on climate change, an issue I raise frequently in the House.  The two line Ministers responsible are the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, and, unfortunately, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross.  We see a growing carbon footprint in the transport sector but no solutions coming from the Minister.</p> <p>At his earliest convenience, will the Leader arrange a debate on and all-party approach to climate change?  Obviously, transport is one major element of this.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport's contributions on climate change in this House have been poor.  Will the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, also attend as the Minister with direct responsibility for this area?  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine also has a large responsibility in this area because the agricultural sector contributes significantly to carbon emissions.  I recognise the farming community has, in many ways, endeavoured to reduce its carbon footprint.</p> <p>We need a whole-of-government approach to climate change.  Unfortunately, Ireland is well behind the curve.  While the previous Government made great progress with climate change legislation - the Leader himself contributed to this - nothing has happened since.  We have seen public consultation after public consultation but no plan or direction.  We will miss the 2020 targets, meaning we will be looking at fines of over &euro;500 million.  That money would be far better invested in our transport infrastructure and agricultural sector to reduce our carbon emissions.  I look forward to that debate at the earliest convenience which the Leader can arrange.</p></speech>

When Brexit happens, there are so many connections with Britain, whether we like it or not, trade-wise, relations-wise and more.  This will be more important than ever.  We have to pay attention to it and do something about.  They are on our side regarding wanting a soft Brexit but no specific solutions are there yet.  Without a customs union, we do not know how that is going to be achieved.

There is an acceptance that there will have to be a tradition period.  They are saying two years but it might have to be longer.  I think business would welcome that.  For the sake of their economy and ours, I would say the longer the better.  Let us keep up the contact.  More Members of this House and the Lower House should get involved.</p></speech>

The situation relating to the proposed &euro;850 million data centre for Athenry is very serious.  The project has overcome many planning difficulties in the past two years.  The last of these were cleared in the High Court last week.  The project should be going to tender at this point.  I recognise the contribution Apple has made to the Irish economy, with 5,000 jobs in Cork and 1,000 new jobs expected.  Let us be clear that Tim Cook and Apple have been good friends to Ireland, but Ireland has also been a good friend - from a taxation perspective - to Apple.  The company should bear that in mind when making its decision.  The Taoiseach said that consideration is being given to what it is going to be done in respect of this project.  In the words of Pete St. John, "Low lie the fields of Athenry".  It will be a very low day for Athenry if this project does not go ahead.</p></speech>

From a psychological point of view and from an international perspective, to locate this centre in Athenry, which is situated in the west of Ireland, would give hope and encouragement to those seeking employment in the region.  Martin Shanahan, head of IDA Ireland, seemed to indicate that he is not that hopeful the project will go ahead.  It will be for him and IDA Ireland to concentrate on bringing jobs to Athenry and the west of Ireland to compensate - if it happens - for the loss of the project.  We should appeal to Tim Cook to reconsider the situation and proceed with the project.  Last night, the Minister of State, Deputy Breen, stated in the Lower House that the project has not been abandoned and is part of our future.  That should be confirmed because there are two conflicting views.  The Taoiseach seemed pessimistic.  It was not a good exercise to go there and come back with bad news.  Normally, when Taoisigh go abroad on industrial missions, as I did myself, they normally come back with the bacon and not bad news.</p></speech>

This sought to promote and increase awareness among Members of vision impairment and blindness and it was a great success.  I also thank the many colleagues who, for various reasons, were unable to attend.  It is hoped that we will be able to repeat the exercise in 2018.</p> <p>This morning, I had the great pleasure of launching a phenomenal community initiative on the part of the Blanchardstown drugs task force and the Safer Blanchardstown community organisation at the Gresham Hotel.  The campaign, which is trying to make a start on dealing with recreational drugs, is called "Think Before You Buy" because buying drugs will harm someone and it is targeted primarily at the people in middle Ireland who go out on a Saturday night to dinner parties and decide, for whatever reason, to take recreational drugs.  They are not the quintessential or traditional drug addict one sees from time to time.  These are people in white collar and blue collar jobs who have families.  They go out and, whether it is weed, hash or cocaine, they buy and take drugs.  The consequences not just to their own health and lives but to society are enormous.  The money they spend, whether they like it or not, funds organised crime and results in deaths in inner city Dublin and throughout the country.  I commend the people in Blanchardstown on the initiative, which needs Government support and which should be rolled out across the country.  They are doing their best on a shoestring budget.  It would be worth bringing the Minister for Justice and Equality to the House to discuss how we deal with those in middle Ireland who are taking drugs on Saturday nights.  In the Leader's own good time, perhaps this House could have a debate with the Minister for Justice and Equality on the issue.</p></speech>

I congratulate Mayor Marty Walsh of Boston whose parents both come from Connemara.  He is a proud Irishman, an Irish speaker and a man of the people and he was re-elected as mayor of Boston last night.  It is a fantastic achievement.  The reports on the campaign indicate that one of the biggest things he did was tackle the housing crisis in Boston.  This created significant employment in recent years and provided affordable and social housing for those who needed it.  He also did a great deal of work with people who have drug and alcohol addiction problems.  It is fantastic to see him being re-elected.</p> <p>A week is a long time in politics.  Shortly before the break we had a debate on Catalonia.  In the intervening period, half the members of the Government of the region have been put in prison and the other half are in exile in Belgium.  Before the break, we heard from most Heads of State across Europe that this is an internal issue for Spain.  We cannot say any longer, however, that this is the case.  The two leaders of the cultural organisations are still in prison.  Even teachers who had debates in schools in respect of the events relating to the referendum are being threatened with imprisonment.  This is an absolute assault on fundamental human rights, including the right to free speech.  It is important that our Government reassesses its position on the issue.  From Brussels, President Puigdemont denounced the fact that there is a Eurocratic elite which only obeys the member states and which has betrayed and corrupted the defence of the foundational values of Europe.  For him, this elite has shown a lack of connection with what people are interested in.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2363"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2363&amp;amp;pid=TrevorOClochartaigh&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is a fundamental debate happening about what the European Union stands for, and what its leaders and prime ministers stand for.

It was a moment when we could realise what daily life is like for some of our fellow citizens.</p> <p>Before I attended the event I was reading a report by the National Council for the Blind of Ireland and the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice.  It examined the cost of living for basic needs, not what people want.  The minimum essential standard of living for a single adult with visual impairment cost &euro;285.76 per week in 2016.  That is &euro;44.54 more than the main minimum essential standard of living for a single adult with vision.  There are real but ordinary extra costs, daily and weekly, for people who have disabilities.  I acknowledge that the Government increased the disability allowance and other related income supports by &euro;5 to commence early next year.  That is across the board.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, a Government outfit, told us in January of this year that people with disabilities are going further into poverty while the rest of the population is thankfully, and that is my word, moving slightly in the other direction.  I request that the Leader now call on the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection to come to this House to set out the issue.  The facts are presented in this bird's eye report on one group of people, but according to the CSO people with disabilities are in fact experiencing more poverty and exclusion.</p></speech>

The meetings were very worthwhile.  We need to do a lot more of this.  We have taken our east-west relationship far too lightly because much more can be done.  A total of &euro;1 billion of trade is conducted every week between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.  After the Queen's visit in 2011, the British-Irish Chamber of Commerce was set up.  That tells us this was a relationship we took for granted.  Much progress has been made since the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the Good Friday Agreement.  Relations are at an all-time high.  There is a strong feeling of goodwill among the politicians from all sides in Westminster and there is a huge Irish diaspora that we sometimes do not understand.  It is very vocal.  We need to do much more of that.  That is why I would like to thank Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary, for taking the time out to meet us for an hour.  It was a robust meeting.  Our views were different but at least it was a good meeting with Vince Cable, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, Emily Thornbridge, the Labour Party shadow foreign secretary, Ian Blackwood, the leader of the Scottish National Party in Westminster, and Adrian O'Neill, the Irish ambassador to the United Kingdom.  When politicians from the United Kingdom come here, I urge all Members in this House to meet them.  They will meet people who have fathers and mothers, and grandfathers and relations from the island of Ireland and their own areas.  When they meet them, they will realise that we are very united in many ways.</p> <p>I pay tribute to the Taoiseach for wearing the Irish poppy pin in the D&aacute;il yesterday.  It reflected the mature direction we are taking as a nation.  When I first saw the poppy 25 years ago, I hesitated, thinking it was not mine.  We have to remember the 50,000 young Irish men from the whole island, nationalists and unionists, who fell in the Great War.  My favourite song about the poppy is the Green Fields of France: "Well the sun now it shines on the green fields of France, There's a warm summer breeze it makes the red poppies dance."  We sing it and love this song and we should be able to embrace a part of our history that we conveniently airbrushed.</p></speech>

I do the same in light of a report presented to the members of the Monaghan County Council this week by a group called the Irish Central Border Area Network, ICBAN.  Its research estimates that at the very best it will be the end of 2025 before County Monaghan has full broadband connectivity and the end of 2023 for County Cavan.  The council debated the issue and concluded that this was shocking news.  If rural Ireland is to have a future, broadband is a vital component.  It is vital for business and for communities.  When one considers the risk that Brexit poses for this country, I would claim as I often have that it potentially affects the Border counties worst.  If ever there was a case for prioritising the Border region, it is now.  The Government could prioritise the Border region for broadband because it is vital if we are to have a present, never mind a future.  I ask the Leader to bring this to the attention of the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment and ask him to seriously consider prioritising the Border region with full broadband connectivity as soon as practically possible.</p></speech>

In 2015, the Greyhound Industry (Racing) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations were introduced, coming into effect on 1 October 2015.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2261"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2261&amp;amp;pid=BrianODomhnaill&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It specifically provided for the immediate disqualification of any greyhound that returns an adverse analytical finding.  Such greyhounds were to stand disqualified.  However, it has come to my attention that a greyhound that tested positive on three occasions for the banned substance, cocaine, was allowed to race by the Irish Greyhound Board last Saturday evening, where he won the Irish St. Leger.  There is a major issue in the greyhound industry.  The owners and breeders are not being listened to.  We have heard from the Government.  I gave the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, some credit when he was Chairman of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  However, since he has become Minister of State there has been little progress in allowing the ordinary breeders and owners to have their voices and concerns listened to.</p><p>The greyhound legislation is to come before these Houses.  However, existing legislation is not even being adhered to by the governing authority, which is in receipt of almost &euro;300,000 of taxpayers' money each week.  It will not even listen to the breeders and owners.  This industry is in decline and the issue is going to explode.  It is one of our traditional industries.  The greyhound is the poor man's racehorse.  The situation is absolutely unacceptable.  I urge the Leader to ask the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, to come to the House to listen to the serious allegations that will be brought before him and to answer some of them and provide some clarity as to why the Government is allowing this situation to continue.</p></speech>

This is not a new phenomenon.  I was absolutely amazed last night to hear a Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy state that he could not say whether Fianna F&aacute;il supported Apple in respect of the &euro;13.5 billion it has been asked to return to the State to put into an escrow account.  He could not tell if Fianna F&aacute;il was for Apple giving back the tax or against it, nor if it was supportive of the Irish Government, which it is propping up, in taking this case against the EU.  The other thing I found astounding was that, while trying to stress the importance of foreign direct investment which is very important, the same Deputy said, "remember we have no natural resources".  He actually said that.  I am not surprised.  He was probably speaking on the basis that Fianna F&aacute;il gave away all our natural resources.</p></speech>

People in County Mayo and rural Ireland who listened to that would ask what in the name of God is going on in terms of our natural resources and the tax avoidance.  It is very clear from the Paradise Papers that the golden circle is absolutely still in operation.  Fianna F&aacute;il set it up and Fine Gael has continued on with it.  The illusion that is given year after year that tax loopholes are closed down is just not true.  The Leader should ask the Minister for Finance to come in here for a full and frank debate about our fiscal sovereignty, taxation and the tax loopholes that he is not genuinely closing.  They are losing billions of euro to this economy while we have children with no homes to go to this evening.</p></speech>

The killing and injuring of so many civilians was a turning point in the Troubles and it did signal a new emphasis on peace.  The Hume-Adams dialogue recommenced and ultimately in 1997, Gerry Adams apologised for the bombing on behalf of the Provisional movement.  Gordon Wilson lost his daughter Marie that day and his response to this atrocity was remarkable.  In a BBC interview, he recounted the last words of his dying daughter: </p><blockquote>She held my hand tightly and gripped me as hard as she could.  She said, 'Daddy, I love you very much.'  Those were her exact words to me and those were the last words I ever heard her say.  But I bear no ill will.  I bear no grudge.  Dirty sort of talk is not going to bring her back to life.  She was a great wee lassie.  She loved her profession.  She was a pet.  She is dead.  She is in heaven and we shall meet again.  I will pray for these men tonight and every night.</blockquote> <p>This message of reconciliation and the call for no retaliation was a sign of a true Christian.  Born in Manorhamilton in Leitrim, Gordon ran his family drapery shop in Enniskillen, yet he became an unexpected campaigner for peace.  He was nominated as a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann in February 1993 by the Taoiseach and leader of Fianna F&aacute;il, Albert Reynolds.  Who is afraid of peace?  This was the question that Albert Reynolds asked.  Gordon Wilson was not afraid of peace.  His death in 1995 was an immense loss to Ireland.</p></speech>

We are going to see a lot more of it over the coming weeks and months.  It will take varying amounts of time for women to feel comfortable.  Some may have to talk to family and friends first, and tell them first about an experience they have had before they are in a position to talk about it publicly.  I think there is an avalanche on the way.  It is welcome and I thank the women who have spoken up so far for their courage.</p> <p>In Grace Dyas's blog, if people have not read it yet, there is a very important line that says, "I believe you before you open your mouth."  It was such an important sentence for me.  It is because of that fear of not being believed that the culture has existed to facilitate silence of sexual abusers and people who abuse their power in certain sectors.  This House could send a very important message to those women, that we believe them before they open their mouths, by calling for the Minister for Justice and Equality to come in and talk about abuse of power, misogyny and sexism in the workplace.</p></speech>

I think it is terribly dangerous to say, "I believe you before you open your mouth."  Everything we do must be evidence based.  There have been false accusations.  We should be very careful in this sensitive area.</p> <p>The banks are at it again - what else is new?  I would like to talk a little bit about the poppy.  I listened to Senator Neale Richmond this morning on the wireless and I thought he was extremely dignified in what he said.  I used to wear the poppy.  I do not any more because I am so much against war.  The poppy was a symbol that also raised money for the people who were mutilated and injured in the two great World Wars.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->My father got the marine VC in the First World War and a knighthood in the Second World War.  He was English but, if anybody challenges me, I am descended from one high king, six kings of Leinster and I do not know how many kings of Ossory, so I am as Irish as anybody else in this place.  There were 250,000 Irish volunteers at the time of the First World War and 50,000 in the Second World War.  I am delighted my Fianna F&aacute;il colleague raised the question of Gordon Wilson.  I remember Gordon Wilson very well as do other Members of the House.  He was a good friend of mine.  We used to go to a conference in Oxford every year where we met people from the violent republican movement.  It was an opportunity to exchange views and to try to bring peace.  He was a very remarkable man and I am glad his words were echoed today.  </p><p>I would like to end with one memory of that period.  On the day of the Enniskillen bombing - or the day after, I cannot remember which - somebody brought a poppy and laid it on the Cathaoirleach's desk and the Cathaoirleach wore it that day.  It was breaking the rules but it was a very important signal of solidarity.  The people who were blasted into nothing in Enniskillen on that tragic day were just ordinary simple people going about their business remembering their relatives and family who had died.  It was a tragic and disgraceful thing.  Gordon Wilson's words were wise and Christian and it is appropriate that we honour him here today.  </p></speech>

I saw the programme, as I am sure all of us did.  It is very sad that we depend on RT&Eacute; to highlight issues that we have been constantly highlighting to the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  He is doing absolutely nothing about it.  Only 4% of rental properties are assessed.  It is unacceptable.  I have brought this up several times with the Minister, Deputy Murphy.  People who are in receipt of HAP or rent allowance come into my clinic because they are looking for the landlord to do work.  There is no staff in local authorities to go out and check the properties.  People cannot find another property.  There is no accountability, regulation or staffing yet the Minister will tell us there is plenty of money in housing.  It is unacceptable.  I say well done to RT&Eacute; for highlighting issues that we know are happening.  The Minister is not listening.  He is telling us he is doing the work but is absolutely not.  There are good landlords out there too.  There are a lot of properties that are not inspected and which are not up to standard which people, families and children should not be living in.</p> <p>With regard to the water refund planned before Christmas, the legislation is to be voted on in the D&aacute;il.  It is crucial it goes ahead because a lot of people have contacted me in my clinic who are waiting for the refund.  It is only seven weeks to Christmas.

Senators Ardagh and Conway-Walsh raised the issue of the Paradise Papers.  I join with Senator Ardagh in saying that, as a society and State, there can only be one tax code for all citizens.  Any complex, labyrinthine way of getting around the paying of tax by tax residents of this country should be eroded.  We all agree with that.  The more people who pay tax, the more people we can have availing of essential public services.  It is important to recognise the importance of taxation in our economy, whether direct or indirect.  Senator Conway-Walsh referred to the Apple issue in the context of the Paradise Papers.  Ireland has acted to address definitively the issues around stateless and double Irish status companies.  When the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, comes to the House he will be discussing the changes he has already brought forward for a regime for capital allowances.  Ireland has always been very compliant despite the Senator's protestations.  We will play and we have played a full part in implementing international tax law.  The Senator need not be so dismissive.  I know the Sinn F&eacute;in Party does not like to hear good news.</p></speech>

I have every confidence the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and the Government will work with the Revenue Commissioners to ensure there is compliance with our tax laws.  If any Member has information he or she should share it with the Revenue Commissioners.  In view of the Apple case, as Senator Conway-Walsh knows quite well, the Government has a different viewpoint to her.  The case is before Europe, and the Government will continue to ensure we are collecting tax from all corporations and foreign entities whether it is Apple or another.  I would be very happy to have the debate in the House for Senators Conway-Walsh and Ardagh.</p> <p>Senator Murnane O'Connor and Senator Gavan raised the issue of housing.  The "Prime Time" programme is one we all watched with incredulity.  We did not need "Prime Time" to tell us about some of the standards we have to watch because we actually go into those houses ourselves.  We made representations to the RTB and the city and county councils regarding the matters.  It is not correct to say the Government is inactive in the matter.  The Senator may shake her head and dismiss me but sometimes it might be good to listen.  All of us recognise that the landlords preying on people who require accommodation must be taken to task, investigated and held to account.

In addition, the Government has increased the provision for inspections with &euro;2.5 million in funding to be provided in 2018.  The Minister, Deputy Murphy, intends to further increase the annual allowance up to 2021 and &euro;10 million will be invested.  This will allow for inspection rates to increase to 25% annually, which means there will be inspections of a property every four years .  Each house or apartment will be inspected every four years.  The issue of housing and homelessness is one we all want to see addressed as a matter of priority.  It does not give any of us any solace to come in here to raise these kind of matters about citizens.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Senator Gavan made reference to the young woman in Limerick.  It is unacceptable, whether the lady is living in Cork, Galway, Limerick or wherever, that she is forced to be in the situation she is in.  None of us condones or accepts that situation.  <br/><br/>I would be very happy to accept Senator Craughwell's amendment to the Order of Business and I commend him for the Bill that he is bringing forward.  It is an important piece of legislation that will give recognition to the people who serve in our country, in particular those who have died in defence of our nation, and in other armies as well.  It is an important Bill and I welcome the fact that he is bringing it to the House.  I will accept the amendment. <br/><br/>Can I join with Senators Craughwell, Norris, Swanick<b>,</b>Burke and Coghlan in congratulating Senator Feighan on organising the visit to Westminster yesterday.  The issue of Brexit is of course one that is of gargantuan importance to us as a nation, and it is through dialogue and engagement through parliamentarians that we can bring our voice to the table.  I know that Members of this House have been very involved with the Seanad Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, which has produced a very fine report. <br/><br/>Equally I commend Senator Swanick for raising the memory today of the late Senator Gordon Wilson and his daughter.  One of the key phrases that he used this morning was &quot;reconciliation&quot;.  It is by building bridges, as Mary McAleese in her Presidency tried to achieve, that we can bring lasting and secure peace to our island.  That is what we all want to see achieved, so that both sides of the political divide can live together in mutual respect and co-operation.  I commend the Taoiseach for wearing the poppy yesterday.  I note what Senator Norris said about the issue of war, but it is important that the symbolism that we saw yesterday is transferred across all divides.  I know that many Members of the House are playing very key roles in that.  I would be happy to speak to Senator Gavan, who I think has just left, on the issue he raised yesterday with me as well.  <br/><br/>In response to Senator Kelleher, I would be happy to have the Minister for Justice and Equality come to the House.  Ireland is committed to adhering to the numbers of refugees that we have agreed to accept.  The Senator is right in saying that it is the worst global refugee crisis in modern times.  There is Private Members' business tonight in regard to the International Protection (Family Reunification) (Amendment) Bill 2017, and the Minister will be here.  We will be happy to have the Minister come back again in regard to that. <br/><br/>Senator Humphreys raised the issue of the rail strike.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, is not in North Korea.  The Minister was on the public airwaves----- </p></speech>

That is the way we should go.  </p> <p>In regard to North Korea, it is a very important issue, there is no doubt about that.

The national mitigation plan and the energy White Paper reflect the recommendations that came from the Citizens' Assembly last weekend.  As the Senator will know, we are having a series of ongoing debates here regarding the annual transition statements.  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Michael Creed, will be before the House in the coming weeks in continuation of that.  I would be very happy to have that debate continue in regard to the matter the Senator has raised. </p> <p>In answer to Senator Leyden, the issue of jobs in Athenry is one of absolute importance.  The Government has been very committed to the project.  It will not be the fault of the Government if the jobs do not come.  It ill-behoves us to play politics with it on the floor of this House, when we should have a unified approach, working together to ensure that the jobs are delivered.  That is why the Government has been very strong through the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, the Taoiseach, the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Breen and the T&aacute;naiste in ensuring that the jobs come to our country.  We are very fortunate that Apple is located in Cork city.  It is a huge employer in our region-----</p></speech>

The Industrial Development Authority, IDA, did this when the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, was at the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, and this is continued now by the Minister of State, Deputy Breen, and the T&aacute;naiste.  Senator Gallagher's point in regard to broadband internet in Monaghan and Cavan is one of extreme importance and seriousness here, because it is about connectivity.</p> <p>A report that was referred to that was given to Monaghan County Council yesterday.  I did not quite understand the name of the group that put it forward.  The Minister, Deputy Naughten, and the Government must act on it as a priority.  I agree with the Senator.  Whether it is in west Cork, west Cavan, Monaghan, or parts of Mayo, we must ensure that the regions are connected and that we have a platform within which jobs are created outside of the urban areas.  That is something the Government is prioritising, and I am very much of the view that what the Senator is referring to should be prioritised.</p> <p>I join with other speakers in congratulating Senator Freeman on her new appointment to head up Solace House for the Irish diaspora in New York, and I wish her well in her appointment.  I know she is not here now.  Certainly the diaspora was a theme of the last Government, through the appointment of the Minister of State at the then Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional and Rural Affairs with responsibility for the diaspora, the then Deputy Jimmy Deenihan.  This continues in this Government through the appointment of the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon.  The diaspora is very important to us.  The mental health of our diaspora is something that has been perhaps forgotten sometimes, but that I am glad to see prioritised now.  </p> <p>I congratulate Senator Martin Conway on his Dine in the Dark initiative last night.  This is about raising the visibility of those who are vision-impaired or blind, and it is important that we continue the work that he has started.  </p> <p>Equally, the Blanchardstown local drugs and alcohol task force's "Think Before you Buy" community initiative is one that we all support and we hope sees results.  It is not about different socio-economic groups, but about all of us combined, working to combat the misuse of drugs in our society. </p> <p>D&eacute;anaim comhghairdeachas le Marty Walsh as a bheith athtofa mar mh&eacute;ara ar Bhost&uacute;n.  I join Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh in congratulating Mayor Marty Walsh.  I join the Senator in wishing him well in his new term as Mayor of Boston.  He has been a very dynamic Mayor in his first term, and as the Senator quite rightly said, he has never been ashamed or afraid to cite and use his Irish links as a part of his mayoralty.  It is a good day for the city of Boston now that Mayor Walsh has been returned. </p> <p>The issue of Catalonia is an ongoing evolving issue.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Government are aware of that, and are maintaining an overview on the situation.  I am sure we will get an insight in the coming weeks when we have a debate in the House on that issue.  The issue of the future of Europe and what it stands for is a different issue, and we will have that debate in the coming weeks as well. </p> <p>Senator Dolan raised the issue of the cost of living for people with disabilities.  The budget did see an increase in the allocation of payments to people with disabilities.  However, the Senator is right that we need an ongoing debate on the disparity between those who need to pay more to maintain a standard of living and the rest of our citizens.  I would be happy to have that debate in the House. </p> <p>Senator Feighan referred to the issue of Brexit.  I hope that we have a debate in the House on Brexit in the coming weeks.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I thank those Members of the House who travelled to Westminster.  It is important that we have dialogue.  Whether we agree with Members of the UK Parliament on this is irrelevant, this is about ensuring our voice is heard.</p><p>Senator Paddy Burke commended the Garda on its work in combating crime.  It is important that people who have information regarding a crime go to the Garda.  The importance of community policing cannot be overstated.  I join the Senator in congratulating the Garda on its work.</p><p>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill referred to the greyhound industry and the issue of the greyhound that tested positive for cocaine.  The Irish Greyhound Board, IGB, has a proactive control mechanism in place.  Its control committee is carrying out an official investigation regarding that greyhound.  The prize money has been frozen, as the Senator is probably aware.  It is important to stress that the prize money has not been paid out pending an analytical outcome of no adverse findings.  The IGB has enhanced its anti-drug doping regime.  If there is an issue that needs to be addressed, the IGB will not be found wanting.  The Senator was right in that it is important the IGB listens to the owners and breeders because they are at the heart of the greyhound industry.  I join him in emphasising that point.</p><p>I have addressed the points raised by Senator Conway-Walsh and Swanick.  Senator Ruane raised the issues of sexism, misogyny, sexual abuse and sexual violence.  Abusive power has no place in society - none whatever.  All of us who are in positions of responsibility as Members of this House and Members of the Oireachtas must play our role in ensuring our work is carried out in a manner that is fair, equitable and has no tolerance of any misuse whatsoever.  I would be happy to arrange for the Minister for Justice and Equality to come to the House to address the matters the Senator raised.  The Minister was to meet members of the Gate Theatre either yesterday or today.  This is an issue to which we cannot turn a blind eye.  I commend all those women and the men who have come forward who have been victims.  I hope they will be given the support and help, in some cases, that is needed for them to get on with their lives and to right a wrong.</p><p>Senator Davitt raised the issue of councillors' pay and conditions, an important issue which unifies all of us in this House.  Many Members of the House are writing, emailing and telephoning councillors regarding this issue and sometimes I think they do that too much.  There is a need for the role of the councillor to be recognised, the hard work they carry out on behalf of the people who elect them and on behalf of their communities where they serve on a variety of boards and strategic policy committees, SPCs, and are involved in amending development plans which require them to be very competent and capable.  We are lucky with the quality of people we have in local government.  I am confident that the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, together with the Minister with responsibility for local government, Deputy Murphy, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Finance will address this issue in the coming weeks.  It is important that councillors' remuneration is kept up to a level, not least because they deserve it, but that the rate of pay will ensure we have quality people staying on in their roles and continuing to work in local government.  </p></speech>

I was not referring to the Senator <i>per se</i>.  It is important that, collectively, we work to ensure there is success in terms of the pay and conditions of councillors who are doing a huge amount of work in changed circumstances.  We recognise that there needs to be an increase in their pay.  That is not a matter of us trying to appease our electorate, rather it is based on the fact that we must recognise that the work of a councillor has changed over time.  It has now become a more full-time role.  We must keep people interested and involved in local government and not lose a body of knowledge and experience that could be lost at any time.</p></speech>

I join him in commending Senator Richmond on his dignified response on the radio this morning.  The issue of our history in terms of recognising those who died and served in armies in other countries is one we should not just airbrush from history, but one upon which we should reflect.  I know from reading the Senator's autobiography that he made a very strong point about that.  It is good we can do that.  It is a great sign of our maturity as a nation that our Taoiseach or a Member of our House can come in here with a lapel pin recognising and remembering our own people as well.</p></speech>

We had the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, here on the last occasion.  I am delighted we have been able to bring this important Bill back to the House on Committee Stage.  I thank the Senators, a majority of whom voted in favour of this Bill on Second Stage on 19 July.  As I and others have said time and again in this House and in the D&aacute;il, Ireland is failing in its duty to adequately respond to the global refugee crisis, the worst since the Second World War.  According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, 65 million people have been forced to flee their homes due to conflict and persecution.  There are currently more than 22.5 million refugees, half of whom - 11 million - are children.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colette Kelleher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2484"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2484&amp;amp;pid=ColetteKelleher&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Two years ago, Ireland made a modest promise to welcome 4,000 of those refugees by the end of 2017, which is just two months away.  Despite great plans, we have only welcomed about a third of that number.  Welcoming refugees at a time of global crisis is the right thing to do.  When governments fail to meet promises and their moral obligations, such governments are standing on the wrong side of history.  Essentially, this Bill will make it easier for our Government to fulfil its promises to people <i>in extremis</i>through no fault of their own other than to be living in the wrong place at the wrong time.  This Bill will help our Government to reach its modest target of welcoming 4,000 refugees by undoing possibly unintended but definitely ungenerous measures contained in the International Protection Act 2015 by narrowing the definition of &quot;family&quot;.  By excluding the extended family, which is an unrecognisable definition for most Irish people, the possibility of family reunification has been made far more difficult.  Our Bill proposes to go back to an earlier more recognisable and more generous definition of &quot;family&quot; for the purposes of family reunification, which served us well from 1996 to 2015.  This, as well as removing overly restrictive time limits for applying for family reunification, are the main thrusts of this Bill.  We should remember that in terms of how we respond and vote.  <br/><br/>Having considered the Bill since July and listened to the debate, I put down a number of amendments aimed at improving the Bill.  Regrettably, two of the three amendments were ruled out of order.  Amendment No. 1 would have changed the rules on marriage to ensure they are inclusive of LGBT people who may have been denied the right to marry in their country of origin and who have only been able to have a relationship since they arrived in Ireland.  This has been ruled out of order.  I am told it would put a charge on the Exchequer.</p></speech>

That never stopped me before.  As has been pointed out, we are facing the greatest global displacement ever in the history of the world.  Senator Kelleher's Bill is attempting to address the attempt by the Government to reverse the situation that existed until 31 December 2016.  It is doing so in order to narrow the definition of "family".  This effectively makes it impossible for family members outside the nuclear family to meet up with their loved ones.</p> <p>I am particularly disappointed that the question of gay people and their relationships is being ignored by the Government.  This paltry excuse that it would cause a charge on the Exchequer is yet another reason we address the situation and free Seanad &Eacute;ireann from the shackles of this ridiculous restriction on our powers.  The 2015 Act radically changed the family reunification policy by narrowing eligibility for reunification to spouses and children if the children were under the age of 18 and unmarried.  God almighty, how much bureaucracy do we have to have in this area?</p> <p>It is completely ridiculous when one considers the fact that internationally the family is regarded as the fundamental building block of society and the Irish Constitution specifically recognises the family as being of primary importance.  It is quite extraordinary to me to look at the way in which the Government is addressing the situation.  It is not as if we were flooded with this situation.  Up to and including 24 November 2016, 756 applications for family reunification were made by people with refugee status and of these, only 406 - about 50% - were accepted.  I will be strongly supporting Senator Kelleher's excellent and humane amendments.  I know we have a decent Minister of State.  I do not know what is going on here with the Government's attempt to narrow the situation but it must be resisted by Seanad &Eacute;ireann with all means possible.</p></speech>

I will be very brief.  The key word used by Senator Norris with regard to this piece of work by Senator Kelleher was "humane".  That was the word that came to the fore when I listened to the previous debates on Second Stage, the lobbies and the people who will be and have been directly affected by this issue.</p> <p>This issue is impacting on many families.  Senator Norris rightly said that in the greater scheme of things, it is a relatively small number.  It is not a huge influx.  It is not scary bears coming off the boats to take up jobs, houses and school places and all this nonsense we hear at times when we bring forward understanding and humane legislation like Senator Kelleher's legislation.  It is an important and humane piece of legislation.  It is understanding of the reality of the life and period in which we live, given that the nuclear family unit is no longer the established and sole notion of what a family is or should be, if it ever was, certainly not in Ireland.</p> <p>We profess to be the land of a thousand welcomes and an emigrant nation that understands the suffering that leads people to leave their homes and take up life elsewhere.  Without rehashing all those clich&eacute;s, and I use the term "clich&eacute;" respectfully because they are clich&eacute;s for a reason, it is about time we put our money where our mouth is and ensure that we can compassionately make a better life for our refugee and asylum-seeking community but also understand that in order to do that and help that life develop and flourish, we can impact practically, tangibly and positively in bringing their families and loved ones here to be with them and help build not only their lives but the life of this State.</p></speech>

Given that we listened closely to the Brexit debate and have witnessed what has happened across Europe where the Austrian Parliament is, unfortunately, welcoming people of a very right-wing persuasion and where the people almost elected a far-right President, and where one third of the electorate in France voted for a representative of the National Front, we can see that far-right, anti-immigrant rhetoric and sentiment are rife across Europe and in the US.  Given our history, this country has a responsibility to stand for something better and more profound and decent.  This is exactly what this Bill is.</p></speech>

Before I call on the next speaker, I would like to welcome to the House former Deputy M.J. Nolan and a delegation that he has with him.

She has our support and she has our support for the amendment.  It is excellent that Senator Kelleher has put so much work into this Bill and it is very much appreciated.  The Bill is supported by my group.  It addresses the ever-evolving global situation regarding immigration and migration and refugee cohorts around the world.  We need to tackle and deal with the situation in a humane fashion as mentioned by colleagues.  There were many problems with the 2015 Act.  I know Senator Kelleher's Bill is hoping to address these issues.  The Senator has our support.  </p> <p>Our colleague made reference to family values and that mantra that is often trotted out.  However, sometimes we actually need to step back and ask ourselves what exactly family values refer to.  It is keeping a family unit together.  Whatever that unit is, families are evolving.  If we look back at our own history in Ireland how many of us have parents and grandparents that were reared by aunts, uncles and neighbours?  Orphan children were taken into homes and given a roof over their head and that is their family unit and children always flourish within their own family unit.  We are talking about people who have gone through horrific war and famine situations.  They have lost their place in the world and what we must ensure is that they do not lose their place within their family unit as well.  The Senator has our support and I wish her the very best of luck.</p></speech>

T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm go bhfuil s&eacute; anseo mar t&aacute; a fhios agam gur Aire St&aacute;it &eacute; a bhfuil an-suim aige sa gceist seo agus san &aacute;bhar seo.  I welcome the Minister because from what I have heard him say, I believe he is genuinely concerned about these issues and I do think he wants to do the right thing when it comes to asylum issues.  I want to wholeheartedly welcome this Bill and commend Senator Kelleher for the work she is doing.  It is important as well to recognise the work of the NGOs in this area.  The ones I would have worked closely with have been the Irish Refugee Council, NASC and others.</p> <p>When the International Protection Bill was coming through the House, we highlighted this as a major issue.  I raised the issue and it is great to see the change of heart from Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, who was Minister of State at the time bringing that Bill through, because we did argue that this was going to be an issue coming down the line and it was not going to be acceptable. </p> <p>I am not going to go into great depth.  It is very important that Fianna F&aacute;il is now supporting the Bill.  That is really welcome.  I will again put on the record that direct provision is an appalling system.  I do not think it is acceptable.  It is institutional abuse in itself.  I can appreciate that certain tweaking around the edges is being done on direct provision.  However, we as a country need to look at a totally different model of dealing with people who are seeking asylum in this country and the way that they are accommodated.  In case people think that this is a kind of a theoretical amendment, it is not.  I have been in the direct provision centres in Galway again recently.  This is a very real issue for the people in those centres.  They have loved ones whom they cannot be reunited with at present.  They are very concerned about their well-being.</p></speech>

It is such a very live issue for them, their relatives and their extended relatives or grandparents.  In some case where people have come through a situation of conflict there may be uncles and aunts who are looking after nieces and nephews and they are completely dependent on them.  It is really important that they could be reunified with those people who care for them and support them, and who are there guardians as well in those scenarios.  I also refer to those more infirm people from families who are dependent on younger members to look after them.  I am not going to go on <i>ad nauseam</i>.  I know the Minister of State is very concerned about all of this area.  I hope the Government and the Department can look very compassionately on these issues, accept the Bill that is being put forward today in good faith and do the right thing.</p><p>I mentioned this morning on the Order of Business that Marty Walsh, a Galway man and a Connemara man, has been re-elected as the Mayor of Boston.  One of the major things that he has done while Mayor in Boston for the last four years is stand up for immigrants, legal or illegal, and defend their rights.  If we are talking about beacons of light in the international arena he certainly is one.  We need to come up to the mark as regards this legislation and I fully support it.  I commend Senator Kelleher on the work she is doing in this regard.  Go raibh maith agat.</p></speech>

I thank the Senators for their comments earlier on.</p> <p>As regards the comments that Senator Kelleher made, we are very aware of the situation globally and we are working as hard as we can to address that and to improve matters where we can.  Senators will be aware that there is a distinction between refugees and people who are seeking protection or who are asylum seekers. </p> <p>Senators will also be aware that the Government opposed this Bill when it was discussed on Second Stage in this House in July for a number of valid reasons.  This position has not changed and I would like to briefly set out again the factors that we have taken into account.  As the Government is not supporting the Bill, I will not take up the time of the House in responding to individual amendments proposed unless Members want me to do that.</p></speech>

I am aware that some Senators have said that they did not support all elements of the Bill at that time.  However, it was passed.  The 2015 Act brings Ireland closer into line with the provisions under the EU Family Reunification Directive while retaining more generous features including a longer application time limit and by not imposing economic conditions on sponsors.  The Bill seeks to restore the broader definition of family members under the old Refugee Act 1996, as amended, while removing the element of ministerial discretion that was contained therein.  The amendment proposed by the Senators to the 2015 Act would establish the discretionary permission under section 18(4) of the repealed 1996 Act into a legal right for family reunification for extended family members.  Family reunification requires admitted family members to be resettled in the same location as the sponsoring refugee.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy David Stanton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1053"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1053&amp;amp;pid=DavidStanton&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Local authorities, which are already feeling the strain of providing permanent housing for refugees in the midst of a national housing crisis, will be asked to provide additional houses for the family members covered by the Bill.  As the Government informed the House in July, the average number of family members applied for under the family reunification provisions of the Refugee Act was 20 and the largest application was for over 70 family members.  The admission of so many people would have significant and unquantifiable impacts on the provision of housing, health care, education, welfare payments and other State supports.  The financial impacts of this proposal are not contemplated in the Bill.  As a result, the Government must be upfront about its intention to decline a money message for this Bill when it is considered in the Lower House.</p><p>The proposal to reverse the reforms made in the 2015 Act and to reintroduce an open-ended scheme for a broader definition of "family members" would substantially curtail the ability of the State to respond to ongoing and further crises by way of resettlement and other forms of humanitarian admission.  Our priority should be to ensure we support a maximum number of families, rather than allowing a smaller number of families to admit larger numbers of extended family members to the disadvantage of others.  The Bill fails to take into account that the discretionary permission under the 1996 Act has not been abandoned.  The Minister continues to apply this provision under the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service non-EEA policy document on family reunification.  Where appropriate, the Minister will waive the economic conditions for sponsors on humanitarian grounds.  This practice will continue.</p><p>Although the policy document and certain other immigration permissions already provide legal avenues for addressing many of the specific cases raised by Senators on Second Stage, the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, and I are considering the establishment of a humanitarian programme to address the family reunification needs of some immediate family members from established conflict zones who are not covered by the provisions of the 2015 Act.  Further announcements in this regard are expected in the near future.  I expect that this approach will address many of the motivating concerns of the Senators who proposed this Bill.</p><p>I am also engaging with the global refugee sponsorship initiative.  My officials and I met some of those involved with the initiative for quite some time in Dublin last week.  Housing and accommodation are major issues.</p><p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh spoke about direct provision.  I am open to any suggestions he might have regarding an alternative that would work.  If he has an alternative to direct provision, he should bring it on because I want to see in writing the details of the costings, etc.</p></speech>

I have yet to see an alternative which will work and which will ensure that a person who comes to Dublin today and looks for asylum will be guaranteed a bed, food, heat, safety and comfort tonight.  As Senators know, the system is under ferocious pressure.  We are running low on numbers.  If Senators can assist in increasing bed numbers throughout the country for people in these circumstances, we want to know how they can help.  We have tried and we have asked.  I have asked in the Lower House and I have asked in this House.  We have met representatives of non-governmental organisations.  We are working as closely as we can with all such organisations.  If there are other ways of doing things that will work and will be practical, Senators should let us know what they are and we will pursue them.</p> <p>We have to look after the people who really need to be looked after.  The established conflict zones are important.  I do not want us to go back to the early 1990s, when people who came here and applied for asylum ended up on the streets.  We do not want that.  The direct provision centres are filling up very fast.  I am extremely concerned about what will happen in the winter if people arrive here and we have no physical places for them to go.  If Senators have an answer in that regard, I ask them to let me know what it is.  This Bill could end up putting even more strain on the outer limit of extended family members.  As I have said, we are looking at a humanitarian programme for people from established conflict zones.  I think Senators will agree that this is very important.  I thank Senators for their engagement on these sensitive and important matters.  Like the Minister, I am always willing to come here to discuss these issues and to take on board practical suggestions that will work and that we can make work.  As the Minister of State with responsibility for this area, I value these discussions.</p></speech>

I have just received a communication from Active Retirement Ireland, which says it strongly supports this Bill because it recognises the role of grandparents in families.  The Minister of State's statement is very helpful because it gives us additional information.  However, when he says "the average number of family members applied for under the family reunification provisions of the Refugee Act was 20 and the largest application was for over 70 family members", rather like the character in "One Foot in the Grave", I have to say "I don't believe it".  If it is true, it is an aberration.  I have put the figures on the record of the House.  Over 750 applications were made and approximately 400, or not much more than 50%, were granted.  If there was one application for 20 family members and one application for 90, that is over 25% of the total.  It is ludicrous for the Minister of State to suggest we are overwhelmed by applications from people who want to be joined by 70 family members.  I just do not believe it.  There may be one such instance.  I do not know.  It is absurd to base legislation on one extraordinary situation given that the total number of applications was just over 750.</p></speech>

The Act of 2015 is amended by the insertion of the following new section after section 57:<blockquote>&quot;57A. (1) Where an application under section 56(1) made by a sponsor for permission to be given to a member of the family of the sponsor to enter and reside in the State has been refused, or where a permission to enter and reside in the State granted to a member of the family of the sponsor has been revoked pursuant to section 56(7), the sponsor may seek a review of that decision.<br /><br />(2) Where an application under section 57(1) made by a sponsor for permission to be given to a member of the family of a sponsor to reside in the State has been refused or where a permission to reside in the State granted to a member of the family of a sponsor has been revoked pursuant to section 57(6), the sponsor may seek a review of that decision.<br /><br />(3) An application for a review pursuant to subsection (1) and (2) shall be submitted to the Minister within 15 working days of the receipt of the decision and shall set out in writing the grounds for review.<br /><br />(4) The Minister may, where he or she is satisfied that it is warranted in the particular circumstances, extend the period referred to in subsection (3) within which a review must be submitted.<br /><br />(5) A review under this section shall be carried out by an officer of the Minister and shall be of a grade senior to the grade of the person who made the decision.<br /><br />(6) The officer carrying out the review may&mdash;<blockquote>(a) confirm the decision the subject of the review on the same or other grounds having regard to the information contained in the application for the review, or<br /><br />(b) set aside the decision and substitute his or her determination for the decision.&quot;.&quot;.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote> <p>I am glad this amendment has not been ruled out of order.  I am disappointed that so many other amendments have been.  This amendment relates to the right of appeal.  There was a problem with the 2015 Act.  The judicial review process is open to people, but it is very costly.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2461"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2461&amp;amp;pid=LorraineCliffordLee&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It also clogs up our judicial process which is chronically under-funded and under-resourced.

Amendments Nos. 50 to 52, inclusive, are related to amendment No. 10 and the House has agreed to discuss them together.  When the debate adjourned on the previous day, the Minister was in possession and I will call on him to resume his speech.  Before I do, I would like Members to bear in mind that I do not wish, as Cathaoirleach, to have any Second Stage speeches.  People can contribute obviously, but we have had Second Stage and we are well into Committee Stage.  I will remind Members not to embark on Second Stage speeches on the general issue but to stick to the amendments before us.</p></speech>

It is landmark legislation and the first time ever as a country that we will introduce public health legislation on alcohol.  I certainly do not intend to treat Committee Stage like Second Stage but, by way of a few introductory remarks, it is important to say that with this Bill we are, for the first time, taking the important step of addressing alcohol as a public health matter.  The clear intention of the Bill is to contribute to the reduction of the harmful use of alcohol in our country.</p></speech>

Examining our own relationship with alcohol and addressing the damage it can cause will never be popular, nor will it necessarily be comfortable.  Alcohol is an intrinsic part of our culture, and perhaps even of our identity, and to address the harms it can cause when it is misused requires courage and honesty.  I am confident the nature of the debate we will have here today will be very helpful in progressing this key legislation.  We hear Irish people drink moderately, but in 2017 the Healthy Ireland survey found that almost four out of ten of us binge drink regularly.  The Central Statistics Office recently published figures which showed Ireland as top in the EU for binge drinking in 2014.  Binge drinking involves drinking six or more standard drinks at one time.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Harris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2338"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The more we drink, the higher our risk of developing life-changing illnesses such as alcoholic liver diseases or alcohol-related cancers.  We can no longer ignore the evidence or the risks.<br/><br/>One of the objectives of this Bill is to address the relationship between children and alcohol.  It is worth noting the recent comments by our special rapporteur on child protection, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, in his report earlier this year on the exercise of Garda powers under the Child Care Act, who stated &quot;the failure by society to address alcohol as a fundamental problem, places insurmountable burdens on the child protection system&quot;.  This Bill on its own is not the answer to this pressing issue but it is an important contribution along with others identified in the national substance misuse strategy on prevention, treatment and rehabilitation, which the Taoiseach and I launched a couple of weeks ago.  The Bill aims to reduce harmful drinking by adults and therefore of children's experience of those harms but also to delay the age at which children themselves start to drink.<br/><br/>There is a strong link between alcohol, self-harm and suicide among our teenagers.  In the &quot;Irish Health Behaviour in School-aged Children Study<i>&quot;</i>, which was published in 2014, one fifth of Irish children reported that they had an alcoholic drink in the last 30 days and one in ten children reported having been drunk in the last 30 days.  In the most recent European school survey project on alcohol and other drugs, seven out of ten Irish 15-to-16 year olds had already drunk alcohol and more than three out of ten had been drunk in the past.  The same survey found that a quarter of Irish girls and nearly a fifth of Irish boys reported having been injured or involved in an accident due to alcohol.  These are frightening numbers.  While I have no doubt that the statistics on the relationship between children and alcohol may change from year to year, is it not time to say that no such relationship should exist and that our children should not be consuming any alcohol?  I believe that it is.  It is our responsibility as law makers to take what steps we can to reach that goal and to change the culture.<br/><br/>Research studies show consistently that exposure to alcohol advertising is associated with an increased likelihood that children will start to drink or will drink greater quantities if they already do.  The Bill sets out measures to create an environment where our children are not exposed to alcohol products or advertising on a daily basis and where alcohol consumption is not considered to be an automatic rite of passage for every teenager.  Our objective is to ensure that taking a drink is something that can be enjoyed by an informed adult who knows the risk of misuse.  Are we being a nanny state?  I have heard a great deal about this in recent weeks, but I do not believe so.  It is an intentional distraction from the purpose of the Bill.  Protecting the health and welfare of our children is a duty of the State.  We need to acknowledge and address the harms associated with the misuse of alcohol.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin was accused of introducing a nanny state when he implemented courageous measures on tobacco as a result of which people have lived who would otherwise have been dead.  If this were a discussion on legislating to control the exposure of children to other substances with an equal potential for harm, I doubt the nanny-state accusation would be made.<br/><br/>What about adults?  Some would argue that we should leave it to the individual to decide on their own drinking.  Certainly, I agree that we must all take personal responsibility for our actions.  However, when the decisions of the individual impact negatively and substantially on all of us as a society, including on our health services and on our social services, we cannot abdicate our responsibility to protect our citizens and those public services.  The cost of time spent in hospital for alcohol-related conditions in 2012 was &euro;1.5 billion, or the equivalent of &euro;1 for every &euro;10 spent on public health.  Many Members bring me to the House on important Commencement matters seeking more investment in the public health service.  I ask them to think about what we could do with &euro;1.5 billion of additional investment in waiting-list initiatives.  In 2013, alcohol-related discharges accounted for more than 160,000 bed days in public hospitals; that is almost 3.6% of all bed days each year being used up in relation to this.<br/><br/>This Bill contains a suite of measures but they are not designed to change a culture overnight, which is impossible.  Their aim is to raise awareness among all of us about the risks associated with the misuse of alcohol and to implement practical changes to protect our children and all of our citizens.  During consideration of the Bill last October, the potential cost burden on smaller mixed trading outlets of the proposals around separating alcohol from other products was discussed at great length in the Seanad.  I listened carefully to the debate and have read back over the transcripts of it.  I heard the concerns and I have tried to act on them.  When we come to consider the relevant section of the Bill, the House will see that I am bringing forward an amendment to provide an alternative for smaller retailers, which is a genuine effort to meet the concerns that were raised.  However, I do not wish to divide the Seanad on this issue today.  If what I have heard from all Members is absolutely the case, I believe we can all get to a point on which we can agree.  Let me be clear, however, that my bottom line on this is that I want to see alcohol made less visible in our shops.</p></speech>

There is significant misinformation and misunderstanding, however.  I commit to the Seanad today that I will engage with small shops and their representatives to provide clarity on the flexible options available to meet the requirements of this legislation.  However, I do not want today's discussion to focus solely on that one aspect of the Bill.  There are many important aspects of the Bill, of which visibility is but one.  The Government has a bottom line on visibility but I want to have the engagement on it.</p> <p>We need to pass all sections of the Bill on Committee Stage today, if possible but at least by tomorrow, and engage further on this point on Report Stage.  This legislation has been stalled for too long and we need to make progress today.  I am, as I know we all are, committed to tackling the alcohol problem in Ireland and to reducing the widespread harm and pain it causes both to those who engage in harmful drinking and to all others that are affected.  We have the opportunity today to take the first important steps to create a healthier society for our children, our vulnerable people and all of our citizens.  In that spirit, I now look forward to engaging and co-operating with the House to bring the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015 through Seanad &Eacute;ireann, to teasing out legitimate issues of concern and, ultimately, to enacting a really important piece of landmark legislation.</p></speech>

It is over a year since it was last debated.  I offer my support for Government amendments Nos. 10, 50 and 51 and will speak in favour of my own amendment No. 52.  Since we last debated the Bill, more than 1,000 people have died from alcohol-related harm and none of us wants to see further delays to this vital legislation.  I will keep my contributions short where possible to allow us to get through the amendments.  I urge my colleagues across the House to proceed in this spirit.</p> <p>I thank the Senators who have co-signed amendment No. 52, which is a relatively minor amendment to modify and clarify the Bill's preamble.  As it stands, the Bill's opening paragraph states that a key aim of the legislation is to provide for restrictions on the advertising and sponsorship of alcohol products.  We wish to add the words "generally and in relation to children" to bring some small but important clarity to the fact that a key reason to control the advertising of alcohol is child protection, to address our harmful with alcohol from an early age.  This is in line with the spirit of the Bill as evidenced by several provisions on advertising which relate specifically to children, including a 200 m limit near schools or playgrounds or children's sports events.  The minor change we propose places a focus on child protection from the very start and it is something we can all get behind.</p> <p>I thank the Children's Rights Alliance, the ISPCC, Barnardos and other children's rights organisations for their strong and unwavering support for the Bill to date.  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.  I will be pushing for a vote when it is moved.</p></speech>

It is important to take the question of children into account.  In his opening remarks, the Minister adverted to the fact that there is a culture in Ireland where it is a rite of passage that young people are introduced to alcohol.  It is perfectly normal and wonderful.  Getting plastered is a big laugh and all the rest of it.  That is a complete nonsense.</p> <p>There has been an enormous level of lobbying.  I assure the Minister of my strong and firm support for him in everything he is doing in the Bill.  That there is some dissent in the Fine Gael ranks is a real pity.  People have given in to the pressure of these lobbying groups.  I have received things too.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I got one from a gentleman who runs a petrol station in County Donegal and he is complaining about having to conceal something.  He should be selling petrol.  It was a great mistake to allow for the sale of alcohol through petrol stations.  A very decent man from Clontarf wrote to me.  I have had contact with him before.  He has 38 employees and he thinks it is going to be a real imposition to segregate the alcohol.  What rubbish.  If he can afford 38 employees, he can certainly afford the minimal disruption that will be caused by segregating the alcohol.  On this amendment it is important to include the specific reference to children.  I support the amendment and I want to indicate my very strong support to the Minister for everything he is trying to do in this Bill.  I hope the main political parties will have the guts at last to stand up to the drinks lobby, which is very effective, powerful and economically strong. </p></speech>

The focus and substantive content of this legislation, especially in respect of advertising sponsorship and warnings, is sufficient to justify the inclusion of child protection in the description of the Bill.  As legislators we are tasked with child protection and to act in the public interest.  That is not a nanny state.  All the reports, including Hidden Harm, show that we have known for years of the horrific effects of alcohol abuse on childhood and continuing into adulthood.  I urge everyone to support this and to speak as briefly as possible in their contributions.</p></speech>

As the former Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, I welcome the insertion of children in the Bill.  I remind Senator Norris that this a Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  It is not a question of collaboration with anybody but it is to ensure that we as a nation understand its importance.</p> <p>This morning I attended a briefing on lung cancer, which is the biggest killer in our society.  We have an obligation to ensure that the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill becomes law.  It involves children because they are impressionable.  I attended the Cork joint city and county policing forum two weeks ago where the Cork drugs alcohol task force co-ordinator, David Lane, gave a very interesting presentation on the association in children's minds between alcohol and commodities in a shop, such as sweets, milk or bread, as well as in the family home, where alcohol is seen with the cheese or yoghurt or whatever.  I welcome the Minister's remarks.  None of us wants a nanny state.  As Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas we are privileged to be charged with concern for public health.  We may have differing viewpoints.  I welcome the engagement the Minister proposes to have with various stakeholders because I have always found stakeholders in pre-legislative scrutiny, whether on this or other issues in respect of the retail industry, to be very responsible and capable.  We cannot do nothing, as some people want us to.  We cannot stand idly by.  Our health is our choice and children, who are impressionable today, have an association with alcohol in various ways.  Everyone must support this amendment.</p> <p>I thank the Minister for the spirit in which he came into the House this afternoon and for his opening remarks.  This is an important Bill.  It behoves us, notwithstanding the many well-intended and well-meaning viewpoints, to pass this Bill and enact it for the betterment of our society.  </p></speech>

He set the tone for a constructive debate.  It is a question of public health and nobody here, whether in the Visitors Gallery, the D&aacute;il or the Seanad needs to be reminded of the pain and suffering the irresponsible use of alcohol causes, most of all to minors and children but also to families, husbands, wives and loved ones.  We all agree on that.</p> <p>The Taoiseach has charged the Minister with responsibility for this issue.  I read some of the earlier debates on this Bill and was conscious of how he was driving this.  This is Government policy.  That is what we would expect of any government, that it would drive a policy.  Some aspects of this Bill were not in the programme for Government but I broadly support it because it is worth supporting.  I echo what the Minister said about there being many more strands to be dealt with in respect of educating people, dealing with alcohol and a range of other issues.  This is a start.  The spirit of the Bill is good but I have concerns about some of its measures which I will outline as we go through this process.  I thank the Minister's commitment to engaging on this.  I went to Greystones, to Quinsboro Road in Bray, to Arklow and Wicklow, four locations in the Minister's constituency, because I know them-----</p></speech>

I asked retailers about the issues concerned here.  One point that was made everywhere was the lack of consultation.  They have concerns.  They are not all right but that is important.  I am impressed that the Minister is telling us today that he will extend that period of consultation in the lead-up to Report Stage.  I think 99% of this is good and needs support.  We may need to tweak it but I wish the Minister well.</p></speech>

It was in the Fine Gael manifesto and in the programme for Government.  As Senator Boyhan noted, it was introduced by the present Taoiseach when he was Minister for Health and the Senator can read his comments on publishing this landmark Bill on the Department of Health's website.  Members of the Fine Gael Party, like everybody in this House, have a duty to bring forward the views of its constituents.  I am not one of those who believe that bringing forward their views and concerns is in any way inappropriate.  Everyone has a right to have their voice heard.  That does not mean that I will always agree.  Many of the concerns that small shop owners in particular have, which we will deal with in section 20, can be clarified by engagement.  There has been some misinformation and misunderstanding.  My party, every party and everybody in this House wishes to see in Senator Norris's phrase, "minimal disruption" to the shopkeeper.  It is not a question of maximum disruption for the shopkeeper but it is a question of making the alcohol product less visible.  That is the core of what we must do when engaging.</p> <p>The Government is pleased to be in a position to support Senator Black's amendment to add children who are the subject of this Bill.  Many of the measures deal with overexposure of children to alcohol at an early age and I can agree to adding children to the Title.  </p></speech>
