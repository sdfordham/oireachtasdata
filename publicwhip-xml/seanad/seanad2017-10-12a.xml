    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-10-12a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1409" speakername="Colm Burke" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017101200002#A00500"><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I raise the issue of the delay in the processing of claims before the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal which was set up to deal with claims by people who have suffered injury as a result of an assault or a crime committed against them.  It came to my attention as a result of a number of colleagues in the legal profession in Cork writing to me, one of whom wrote to inform me that his client suffered major injuries.  A claim was lodged in 2012.  All the documentation was completed and lodged more than two years ago and he has still not received a date for when the matter will be dealt with.  The person who perpetrated the injury has been sentenced to more than ten years in prison, so it was a very serious assault.  A number of judicial proceedings were held in the High Court as a result of the delays.  The most recent case involved a lady who suffered injury more than 13 years ago.  There was an eight-year delay in dealing with her claim.  To force the claim to be dealt with, she took judicial review proceedings to the High Court over that delay.</p> <p>This is about victims of crime.  These people have suffered serious injury.  The Minister of State is aware that they are not entitled to lump sum compensation.  They are entitled to recover the cost of medical care but also the cost of loss of earnings into the future on which actuarial evidence has to be produced.  These claims are not the same as medical negligence claims because a person is not entitled to get the same level of compensation.  It is to put the person back into the position they were in prior to the assault taking place.</p> <p>It is not good enough that victims of crime should have to go through this process for up to eight years before a decision is taken.  This matter needs to be addressed and the additional resources provided to ensure that all outstanding claims can be dealt with in a timely manner.  It is in that context that I raise the issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-10-12a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017101200002#A00600"><p>On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, who, unfortunately, cannot be here, I thank Senator Burke for raising this very important issue.  The Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal administers the scheme of compensation for personal injuries criminally inflicted.  The scheme was established on a non-statutory basis in 1974.  The tribunal consists of a chairperson and six members.  Tribunal members are practising barristers and solicitors who provide their services on a part-time basis.</p> <p>The average number of applications received annually by the tribunal in the past five years was approximately 220.  To date in 2017, it has received 153 applications.  The length of time taken to process an application can vary widely from case to case.  Each case is addressed on the basis of its individual circumstances.  While applications are processed with the minimum of formality compared with court proceedings, in making their decisions tribunal members must be satisfied that all supporting documentation submitted is in order.  In some cases there can be delays pending the availability of all required documentation, and some cases are complex in terms of medical conditions.  For example, I understand that in cases of serious injury to the victim, it can take a considerable amount of time, and in some cases a number of years, before their treating consultant is in a position to give a final prognosis.  It is also often necessary to await Garda reports arising from the related criminal investigation before a final decision can be made in a case.  By their nature, such investigations can be lengthy and complex.</p> <p>As a result of these factors, which are outside of the control of the tribunal, waiting times can vary significantly.  The majority of applications are assessed by an individual tribunal member.  A smaller number of these cases are subject to an appeal process. Appeal hearings must be conducted by three tribunal members, and the member who gave the initial decision is not present at the appeal hearing.  Dates for appeal hearings are dependent on the availability of tribunal members, appellants and-or their legal representatives.  The tribunal has focused in 2017 on processing a backlog of appeals cases.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy David Stanton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1053"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1053&amp;amp;pid=DavidStanton&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The tribunal is independent in considering applications and neither the Minister nor the Department has any role in the processing of applications.  The Minister has ensured that the tribunal has a full membership complement to enable it to process cases.  The operational budget has been maintained over the course of the scheme.  The tribunal budget for 2017 is &euro;4.016 million, compared with &pound;545,000 when it was established.  I have been advised that while it is a matter for claimants, under the terms of the scheme, to provide the tribunal with all the necessary documentation to support their claim, the tribunal deals daily with queries from members of the public in this regard and offers assistance to them.</p></speech>

I have been talking to legal colleagues who are frustrated at this.  In the case to which I refer, the perpetrator was sentenced in 2012 and is now in comfortable accommodation while the victim is still waiting, not for compensation but to be put back into the position they were in prior to suffering the assault.  This person suffered brain injury and it has been five years since the perpetrator was sentenced.  There are a number of judicial review cases and I cited one in Cavan where the person was waiting 13 years.  This has to be dealt with somehow.  We say we are on the side of victims of crime but we are not, and this delay is not justified.  If all the documentation has been filed the assessments should be done within six months, not six years.</p> <p>I ask the Minister to look at why these delays are arising, what we need to do to deal with the huge backlog and how we can deal with them in a timely manner.</p></speech>

The tribunal is independent in considering applications and neither the Minister nor the Department has any role in the processing of applications.  The length of time taken to process applications can vary widely from case to case.  We would like all cases to be progressed to a conclusion quickly but in some cases it is simply not possible.  Delays can arise where supporting documentation has been sought and-or the tribunal has queries, which must be satisfied if it is to properly discharge its duties.  I am informed that applications to the tribunal are processed as quickly as possible and the tribunal offers assistance on a daily basis to members of the public.</p> <p>The scheme was last reviewed in 1986 and the Department of Justice and Equality has, therefore, written to the Law Reform Commission requesting that it consider a review of the scheme in its forthcoming programme of law reform with a view to identifying improvements that could be made in the future.  A response to the request is expected in the near future.  I will ensure that the Senator's comments are brought to the attention of the Minister for Justice and Equality at the earliest possible opportunity.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-10-12a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1388" speakername="Maire Devine" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017101200002#B00600"><p>I will start by being frank.  I want to be nice, positive and upbeat but there is very little to be nice, positive or upbeat about.  I am absolutely shocked and appalled by the mental health budget for 2018 and groups in the sector are shocked and appalled, as are the mental health warriors.  Not only has the Government fallen way short of the mark, it is attempting to cover up the failings by announcing old moneys as new spend.</p> <p>I ask the Minister to explain how this inadequate budget will help our children and our most vulnerable because we owe them an explanation.  I sat in this Chamber for many hours as part of the Seanad Public Consultation Committee and listened to brave parents tell their stories about their utter dismay and heartbreak while trying to access mental health services for their children in distress.  I tried to help those in my area of Dublin South-Central and, last week, another child was admitted to St. James's Hospital.  This budget is a slap in the face for such people.  In July, over the summer recess when preparatory work started for this budget, the staffing levels in CAMHS were at 53% of the recommended levels and 11 beds remained closed in an inpatient unit in Linn Dara in Cherry Orchard.  There are suggestions that a Dublin hospital close down in its entirety because 40 staff are missing to cover its acute high-dependency beds.  I am sure this is replicated elsewhere and perhaps the Minister can say what he knows of this situation.</p> <p>In Waterford on Tuesday, two patients were admitted to plastic chairs in high-dependency units and a 16-year-old was admitted in August.  This goes on and on and it is no wonder I cannot be nice, upbeat and positive.  There are over 2,500 children on waiting lists but in this budget they are only worth a few pennies.  It is an absolute disgrace and the strategic communications unit of the Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, seems to be getting more attention than mental health.</p> <p>I ask the Minister of State to explain the budget to people on the waiting list, to their parents and to psychiatric nurses who are desperately trying to find a bed to calm the nerves of distraught parents.  He should tell the young people who were given false hope that the Government might actually do something.  I thought that, given the enormity of the problem, the Government would do something but &euro;15 million is an insult, a slap in the face.  I ask the Minister for a detailed breakdown of where the moneys are going but ask him to spare me the details of what the budget will do to keep things as they are.  We need at least &euro;65 million now, not promised for the future.  There was &euro;15 million last year and there is &euro;15 million this year.  What will it be in 2019?  There is a promise of &euro;40 million somewhere but I do not have any confidence in that and nor do the people out there looking for services.</p> <p>Can the Minister explain the expenditure report from last year and the HSE service level report on CAMHS?  Can he also explain how &euro;15 million is going to help our children in distress?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-10-12a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017101200002#B00700"><p>I thank Senator Devine for the opportunity to clarify some of the misinformation she is continuing to peddle with gusto.  In 2018, we will see an increase of &euro;35 million in development spending for mental health, part of which will pay for development commenced this year while part will pay for further new developments to be commenced in 2018.  There will also be additional funding of &euro;24 million for pay-related costs.  This will result in a mental health budget of &euro;912 million, which reflects an increase of around &euro;200 million, or approximately 28%, since 2012.  I challenge the Senator to identify any other area of the budget that has seen an increase of 28% since 2012.</p> <p>Mental health is also guaranteed a further &euro;55 million in 2019.  The additional &euro;35 million for this year will help build on the work commenced in 2017 on the enhancement of community teams for children, adults, psychiatry of later life and mental health intellectual disability services.  It will also help to continue our move towards a full 24-7 service, with an initial focus on increasing the provision of services on a seven day a week basis.  The HSE has been asked to prioritise this in 2018.  Developing a service response which is as seamless as possible for every service user is also a priority of the HSE.  It is the policy of the HSE, as reflected in its annual service plans, to provide an age-appropriate mental health service for those aged under 18.</p> <p>Mental health remains a key care programme priority for this Government, underscored by the fact that the HSE mental health budget increased from around &euro;826 million in 2016 to approximately &euro;851 million this year, and will further increase to &euro;912 million next year, an increase of &euro;63 million.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Jim Daly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2328"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2328&amp;amp;pid=JimDaly&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There will also be an additional &euro;55 million for 2019. </p><p>Taken together with &euro;35 million in 2018 and &euro;15 million allocation in 2017, this will bring the total allocation over the period 2017-2019, inclusive, to &euro;105 million.  This will deliver on the commitment to the full implementation of A Vision For Change.  Planning for the effective use of these additional resources will commence immediately to ensure new developments are introduced speedily.  The HSE service plan 2017 commits to the further development of various aspects of child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, to which the Senator referred, including more acute bed provision, better out-of-hours liaison and reduced waiting times, especially for those waiting over 12 months. </p><p>CAMHS is a strategic priority action for the HSE, and will remains so against a background where the population of children increased by around 8,500 over the last two years which inevitably created additional demand on CAMHS.  Around 18,500 referrals are expected to the service this year.  Additional resources and facilities means there are now 67 CAMHS teams and three paediatric liaison teams, supported by 60 operational CAMHS beds nationally, with further beds planned to come on-stream as approved staffing posts materialise at local level. </p><p>It is envisaged that the increased funding for CAMHS will go to areas such as: day hospital provision, thus improving responses to cases, avoiding inpatient stay and providing more appropriate support than available from community teams; the development of CAMHS eating disorder specialist community teams in line with A Vision for Change; improving the physical health of those under 18 years known to mental health services or who co-present or arc treated in primary care services; the expansion of liaison teams to work with CAMHS governance and ensure appropriate assessments for children including sessional capacity; and the promotion of prevention and early intervention services for positive youth mental health, including enhancing partnerships with non-statutory agencies. </p><p>The Senator can rest assured that CAMHS will continue to receive priority from me, the Department of Health and the HSE.  One aspect in particular which I wish to develop includes improved cross-referral within the HSE and better inter-agency links between the HSE and the education, disability, and child care sectors.  I will ensure that, in light of the significant funding provided in budget 2018 for mental health, CAMHS will continue to be prioritised by the HSE in formulating its service plan for next year.</p></speech>

He referred to the significant funding provided in budget 2018 for mental health and a figure of &euro;15 million.  I do not believe that figure.  There has been an increase of 1.7% and Minister of State said over several years the figure will be 28%.  The increase for this year is a measly 1.7%.</p> <p>To clarify, &euro;15 million was allocated last year and the same has been allocated for this year.  We need to prioritise community services.  I do not feel confident in our mental health services or the response of the Government.  I thank the Minister of State for being here today.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-10-12a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1404" speakername="Lynn Ruane" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017101200002#C00600"><p>I thank the Cathaoirleach and Minister.  I would like to raise the issue of what has become known as the "baptism barrier" and the religious-based discrimination currently practised in admissions policies in State-funded schools in this country.  As Ireland continues to become a more secular and pluralist nation, it is vitally important that the State acknowledges and vindicates the fundamental equality of every child, irrespective of race, socio-economic status and, in this case, religion.  Equality cannot be fully realised while we allow State schools to discriminate in their admissions policies based on religious denomination.  Therefore, the baptism barrier needs to go.</p> <p>The Minister is aware of this issue and is keen to see reform.  I would like to acknowledge his announcement earlier this year of the ending of this discriminatory practice.  My key ask today is, therefore, that this issue be dealt with by way of an amendment to the Education (Admission to School) Bill, which is on Fourth Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. </p> <p>As the Minister will be aware, the Joint Committee on Education and Skills, of which I am a member, recently conducted stakeholder engagement and scrutiny on the Bill.  Our report was published in June and one of our recommendations was that it is imperative that the relevant legislation is, the very least, amended so that no child is denied admission to a State-funded school on the basis of his or her religion or beliefs.  The relevant legislation is section 7(3)(c) of the Equal Status Act 2000.</p> <p>This is not provided for in the Bill as currently drafted.  Can the Minister indicate today whether he is considering amending the Bill to reflect the recommendations of the committee?  I would also like clarification on the three limited circumstances cited by the Minister as to when a school can use religion as a criteria for admission.  The Minister stated that these circumstances were in order to protect minority faith schools and we would need to see the detail so that we can ensure there are no unintended consequences.</p> <p>It does not make sense to me that we would pass a major admissions policy reform Bill when it does not comprehensively address what I believe is the most fundamental equality issue in national school admissions today.  The Minister has previously stated that this issue could perhaps be dealt with by a separate piece of legislation.  However, this approach should be reconsidered. </p> <p>The creation of a new bespoke piece of legislation could take years, whereas the 2016 admissions Bill could become law by Christmas.  I understand there is concern that constitutional issues could be at play, but Equate Ireland commissioned legal advice in this respect and if the Minister has not seen it I would be happy to share it with him. </p> <p>Ultimately, the baptism barrier has no place in a modern and pluralist education system.  In a recent poll 84% of Irish people called for an end to religious-based school exclusion.  We have a responsibility to move quickly and decisively to end it.  Let us commit to ending discrimination before the next academic year.</p></speech>

It gives me a chance to update the position.  The Senators is correct, in that the admissions Bill I introduced to the House dealt with a number of issues around which there was a fair degree of consensus.</p> <p>There remains a desire to put positive changes in place quickly.  The Bill deals with banning discrimination and waiting lists, requiring written admissions policies and empowering the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, and Tusla to require a school to take a child with special needs.  There are positive things in the Bill.</p> <p>There was a broad belief that we need to address the issue of admissions policies in respect of the use of religion in schools.  While proceeding with the Bill I established a consultation process and outline for four different options.  The consultation process took place earlier this year, at the end of March.  There were many submissions and there was no consensus.  No one approach of those outlined had a consensus approach.</p> <p>As I indicated on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, the way to deal with this was to remove religion as a general criterion in admissions policies and, as the Senator said, provide three exceptions.  The exceptions were outlined at the time and largely concerned allowing schools to protect their ethos if it was threatened and allowing children of minority religions to get into a school of their choice.  This is based on the idea that it is right and welcome that people should have the desire to bring up children in their faith if they want to.  </p> <p>In our Constitution we endow schools with the right to have religions to run schools and, therefore, we should try to facilitate that to the best extent possible.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Richard Bruton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=119"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=119&amp;amp;pid=RichardBruton&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is wrong that children cannot get access to a local school, and preference is given on religious grounds to children living a considerable distance away.  It is also wrong that people should feel obliged to have their children baptised to gain admission to a school.</p><p>The position in terms of the approach I outlined is that I have been dealing with the Attorney General to develop those proposals and to ensure that I am in a position to come to the House with legally and constitutionally robust proposals.  As the Senator knows, there can be a lot of legal opinions, but ultimately the Government must be guided by the Attorney General who is the legal adviser to the Government.  That work is ongoing, but at this stage I believe that it may be possible to introduce this by way of an amendment to the existing Education (Admission to Schools) Bill rather than requiring a separate Bill.  Obviously, I do not want to make a commitment that is irrevocable because clearly that depends on the proposal we have made being found to be robust.  I am working with the Attorney General and will revert to the Houses as soon as I am in a position to do so.</p><p>It is timely that we deal with this issue.  If we take the route that I have set out, effectively religion would not be used in 95% of the schools that are in place.  As the Senator knows, 80% of schools do not now use religion, and that will become law under the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill.  It will no longer be legal, where a school is not oversubscribed, to exclude a child on the basis of religion.  That will be outlawed.  What we are now doing for the remaining 20% is providing that religion would not be used as a bar but for two exceptions, namely, to protect minority churches and to ensure that the ethos of the school would not be threatened.  That is already provided for under equal status legislation.</p><p>I hope that I will be in a position to come back to the House in due course with a set of proposals.</p></speech>

Stepaside has been in the news quite a lot recently in the context of its Garda station.  As a local resident, I can confirm that it is an ever-growing area, with many issues causing concern to the local population, not just the Garda station but also education facilities, community facilities, housing and so forth.</p> <p>The Minister will be aware that the secondary school to which I refer opened in August 2016.  I had the pleasure, along with Councillor Emma Blain, of attending the opening.  The school opened in prefabricated classrooms in the car park of a local rugby club in Kiltiernan.  The school has moved for this academic year to prefabricated buildings on a site being shared by Stepaside Educate Together national school in the Belarmine development.  It is on the building list of the Department for 2018.  The question that the school community and the wider Stepaside community is asking is where the permanent, 1,000 pupil school will actually be located.</p> <p>This is an excellent school which I have had the pleasure of visiting many times to meet pupils, the principal, teachers, parents and others who are involved in it.  It is a leading school in terms of science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, education, with its revolutionary Bridge21 programme.  It has embraced, in its short life, a healthy school ethos, has established a football team, organised many extracurricular activities as well as winning both an amber and green flag in its first year of operation.  There is a massive demand for places in this school.  It already has a huge school population, with strong enrolment and a waiting list.  My own niece is one of many children who has already received a response to a letter of query.  There are three Educate Together national schools in the immediate area feeding into this secondary school, as well as a number of other schools, including a significant number of minority faith national schools.</p> <p>I must stress that this is a rapidly growing area.  Indeed, it is one of the fastest growing local electoral areas in the country.  I had the privilege of representing it for just under seven years on D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and I must say that for the entire time that I served on the council up until today, discussion centred around the question of when the area would get a secondary school.  During my second year on the council, we agreed the relocation of a fee-paying secondary school from Blackrock to Sandyford.  That school is now open in a fabulous new building and is thriving.  Other than that, however, the only other two secondary schools are just outside the local electoral area.  The local electoral area has a population equivalent to that of County Leitrim but has only one small, private, all-girls secondary school.</p> <p>Sites have been identified under the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown county development plan for school use but I fear that an opportunity has been missed because the Department has still not identified a permanent site.  The cost of land is rising rapidly, especially in this part of south Dublin.  The school itself is growing and demand for places is also growing.  Many of the pupils currently enrolled in the school may go through all six years of secondary level education without ever getting into a permanent school.  This must be a priority for the Department.  I am hopeful that an announcement will be made soon because the current accommodation is unsuitable for even medium-term, not to mention long-term, use.  I ask the Minister to provide an update on the future location of this school.</p></speech>

I am fully aware of the concerns to which he refers.  As the Senator has outlined, the school opened in September 2016 on the grounds of De La Salle Rugby Club in Kiltiernan.   It then relocated to temporary accommodation on the site of an Educate Together primary school at Belarmine in Stepaside.</p> <p>A major project to provide permanent accommodation for this school is included on my Department&rsquo;s capital programme.  Pending delivery of the permanent post-primary school building, it is planned that this school will, on an interim basis, share the new school building which is being provided for the Stepaside Educate Together national school when it is delivered.</p> <p>As the Senator may be aware, my Department has been working closely with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council under the memorandum of understanding towards the acquisition of a permanent site.  Engagement with the council in this respect commenced as far back as 2012.  However, as the Senator will appreciate, in this highly urban area there is very limited availability of suitable sites and this, coupled with the high demand for land generally in the area, has led to a protracted site acquisition process.</p> <p>In respect of the permanent site, I am pleased to inform the Senator that a suitable site option has been identified and a formal offer has been made to the landowner to acquire the site.  My Department is awaiting confirmation from the landowner with regard to formal acceptance of this offer.  Due to commercial sensitivities, it is unfortunately not possible to disclose the location of the site at this time until formal confirmation of the Department&rsquo;s offer is received.  However the school patron, Educate Together, will be informed of the proposed location as soon as it is possible to do so.  The acquisition of the site will be subject to agreement on some technical design issues and satisfactory completion of the conveyancing process, but if agreement in principle is confirmed, it is envisaged that preliminary design work in respect of the school building project can commence while the site acquisition is being completed.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Richard Bruton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=119"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=119&amp;amp;pid=RichardBruton&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I wish to assure the Senator that every effort is being made to progress the permanent accommodation for the school as expeditiously as possible.

There is a cohort of people who are relying on the charity of their siblings, parents and grandparents to live and to bring up their families.  A lady came to me who, along with her four children, was living with her sister.  She was sleeping on the sofa in the living room with her four children.  There were ten in the house.  For the purposes of the CSO figures, she is not categorised as homeless.  Once a person removes himself or herself from emergency accommodation, he or she is taken out of that category.  The Government needs to look at how we classify homeless people and consider how to reclassify them.  Obviously, this woman is living with her sister and is not in secure accommodation and is for all intents and purposes homeless.  I ask the Minister to come to the House to address how we calculate the real figure of homelessness.  We know there are 8,000 people in emergency accommodation, including 3,000 children, but in fact that figure is on the low side.  I believe there are many more people who are homeless and I would categorise them as hidden homeless.</p> <p>Second, I wish to raise the issue of gender pension inequality.  Yesterday, after the budget, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, when commenting on the gender pension inequality admitted it was "bonkers and unbelievable" that women were losing out on pension payment under the current regime.  He went on to say that the way they are treated is wrong.  It is pretty disingenuous that he made these comments yesterday but made no reference in his Budget Statement on Tuesday as to how he would rectify and amend the changes made in 2012.  Thousands of women have lost out every year on the level of the pension payment to which they were entitled.  Lipservice without action is not reasonable.  I think the Minister should come to the House and explain in detail what he will do.  Pension reform has been discussed.  When the Taoiseach served as Minister for Social Protection there was talk about pension reform, but all we saw was lipservice to the idea of pension reform.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Catherine Ardagh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2473"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2473&amp;amp;pid=CatherineArdagh&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, we did not see any pension reform, all we saw was lipservice to the idea of it.  We can do something now for these women.  We could reverse the 2012 changes immediately.  It would require a small piece of legislation.  I ask for the Minister to come to the House to address why he cannot make that change immediately.</p></speech>

The Government has committed to opening up every unoccupied house to alleviate the growing housing list.  Among the many workers on housing lists are serving soldiers.  We recently saw the case of a serving soldier being made homeless in Kildare.  Bearing this in mind, I wrote to the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, whom I support in his efforts, asking if he would consider reopening the decommissioned or locked-up Army houses.  I suggested that if it was the case that the Department of Defence or the Defence Forces did not want to become involved in the management of married quarters, it might be possible to transfer the housing stock held by the Department of Defence to local authorities or some housing agency.  I understand that the Minister is looking into this.</p> <p>Following a freedom of information request, I can advise that the following is the position regarding Department of Defence houses available in the State.  There are currently nine houses in use for enlisted ranks and 50 vacant.  There are 13 houses in use for officer ranks and 12 are vacant.  Some 62 properties are locked up and decommissioned.  I believe that these houses should be immediately refurbished if necessary and put back into use.  Not only would this assist in reducing the waiting list for houses but it would bring soldiers closer to their place of work.  I would also argue that there is an urgent need to provide suitable married quarters for mid-ranking officers within close proximity to each military installation, given the frequency of movement and transfer of these officers and the short notice given when they are transferred.</p> <p>I wish to discuss the issue of the Border.  I am becoming more concerned as to where we are going with Brexit negotiations.  I am now convinced that the British Government has no interest whatsoever in putting a border in place on the northern side of the Border.  This will put the gun to the head of the European Union to protect the Single Market.  I believe that the Taoiseach expressed concern in his comments yesterday, although I was not here to hear them.  I am aware of the fact that the Government cannot set out what contingency plans it has in place, but it is time that we started to talk openly about the likelihood that the British will not put a border in place.  That puts the EU in the position where it has to manage the Single Market.</p> <p>Almost a year ago, we promised our city and county councillors a slight increase in their income.  I will be meeting a number of those councillors this evening.  That increase in income has not occurred.  I am putting the Leader on notice that I will bring this back to the House next week because I think these people work extremely hard.  I was in Brussels for the last two dates and councillors were there from all over Ireland to address different issues.  To think that some of these people struggle to survive is not good enough.  I know the Leader is committed to getting some action, so I would like to see action and we will talk about this next week.</p></speech>

Thousands of women get smaller pensions because they left the workforce before 1994 to care for children.  Others are taking a pension hit because they once had a summer job or worked part-time for a while.  It is estimated that 23,000 females have been hit with lower payments due to changes to State pension eligibility rules in 2012 made by the then Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, to make it more difficult to qualify for a full pension.  Of all of the cuts that the Labour Party made when it was in Government, this is probably the most shameful.  Retired women lose more than &euro;1,500 a year on average according to Age Action.  This also means that women affected will not get the full &euro;5 increase in the State pension in the budget next March.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, has admitted that it is wrong.  He called it bonkers.  I would say that is probably not the right word.  It was mean, sly, regressive and nasty.

Our costing in our own pre-budget submission was &euro;70 million.</p> <p>Budgets are about choices.  Unfortunately, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il chose to go for tax cuts that benefit the well-off much more than ordinary workers and left these women high and dry.  The case was made much more ably by a caller to the Sean O'Rourke radio programme yesterday than I can make it, but we can all agree that this cut was wrong.  If the Minister for Finance can agree that it is wrong, then let us do something about it.  I call for a debate on the issue and for those in Fine Gael to recognise that it was wrong and that it is eminently doable to reverse it in this budget.  It would cost &euro;60 million to &euro;70 million.</p> <p>I wish to raise a failure in the budget relating to child care.  The 7% increase to the early childhood care and education scheme, ECCE, is welcome but, unfortunately, it is unlikely to result in better wages.  The real problem in the sector is that people are voting with their feet.  Qualified educators, managers and providers leave the sector each week.  Sinn F&eacute;in has made the case, along with SIPTU and IMPACT, for a sectoral employment order for the child care sector.  In our pre-budget submission, we costed it at &euro;40.58 million, which would have given child care workers a &euro;1 an hour rise.  A lack of political will is at fault here.  Everyone here knows that child care workers are underpaid.  Everyone has said so but, yet again, the Government has failed to do anything about it.  The solution, a sectoral employment order, is available.  Even the Minister, Deputy Katherine Zappone, said it would be welcome, but it will not happen without the funding.  I call for a debate on the issue and for the Leader, as a trade unionist, to support my call for a sectoral employment order for the child care sector.</p></speech>

The gender inequality-proofing of the budget which has been promised and which I was gratified to see mentioned in the Budget Statement by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, is not yet clearly evidenced in some of the decisions made on the budget.  For example, as Senator Ardagh said, there was a decision not to reverse the cuts made in 2012 and not to address the glaring issue of gender inequality in our pension system, something acknowledged as unfair by the Government and by previous Governments for many years.  The 2012 changes added insult to injury by having an unfair averaging system which mainly affected women and was compounded by cuts.  The fact is that all those on reduced rate pensions, most of them women, will not get &euro;5 extra on their pension.  They will get less because it will be reduced and it will be <i>pro rata</i>.  I would like these Houses to address that issue and for the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, to come to discuss, in detail, gender inequality-proofing more widely.  Policy documents have been published about it but it would be good to know where the ownership and direction of those policy documents will go.  I hope that we can have a specific debate on the gender inequality aspects of the budget.</p><p>My second request follows up from a request made by Senator Fintan Warfield a number of weeks ago for the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, to come to these Houses and discuss, in detail, the included tax reliefs, the tax relief schemes and their cost to the Exchequer, and how the cost-benefit of each scheme has been determined.  I raise this issue again because this can sometimes be an invisible cost to the Exchequer, yet it can be substantial.  I am very concerned at one new measure in the budget, which is to change the tax treatment of stocks and shares received as part of remuneration packages.  I believe this is dangerous and can lead to a hollowing out of our tax base.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I want to know how the cost of &euro;10 million that was estimated in the budget was arrived at.  How can we guarantee that the cost will not be much higher?  If those who are on high wage packages move some of their remuneration packages to a stocks and share offerings, it could remove some of their income tax pressure.  There is real concern in this regard.  I am reminded of the capital gains tax waivers of the past.  I think it is appropriate for this House to look in detail at the potential consequences and implications of tax reliefs.  I have requested for the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, to come to the House for two separate debates.  I would be grateful to the Leader if he could indicate whether he thinks it might be possible to hold such debates over the next couple of weeks.</p></speech>

Our eyesight is very important to all of us.  For the past five years, national sight day has been held on the second Thursday of October.  When many people end up with impaired vision of fuzziness across their eyes, they ignore it.  It is important to raise awareness of the need to have one's eyes looked at if one finds any difference in one's eyesight.  In such circumstances, one should go to a local optician to have a test carried out.  Diabetes screening is taking place downstairs at the moment as part of a very informative event.  Diabetes has an awful impact on one's sight.  It is very important to mention that today is World Sight Day.</p></speech>

The budgetary measure to which I refer is the 6% commercial charge, or transactional tax levy, on agricultural land.  It is an issue in the media and also for many small farmers, in particular.  The intended consequences and ramifications of this measure as enormous.  A farmer who owns approximately 600 acres in County Kildare said to me this morning that he had thought Fine Gael was the farming community's greatest supporter.  Through his involvement in the Irish Farmers Association, he will be cranking up a massive campaign against the Government on this tax.  I am not for a moment advocating on behalf of farmers who have more than 100 ha.  I am talking about very small farmers who will be crippled by this tax.  When we debated the budget the other day, I indicated that the transitional tax will have an impact on one-off shops in small towns and villages in rural areas.  At a time when the Government is advocating a policy of living over such shops, we should be incentivising people to tidy and redevelop small vacant retail units in towns and villages all over the country.  I believe that because of the 6% charge, this might not happen as quickly as we might like it to happen.  It is important to deal with that.  I would like to renew my call for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to address the impact on small farmers of new regulations with regard to fodder, hay and silage.  The changes in question, which I discussed here yesterday, were introduced by the Department last week.  I have mentioned two agriculture issues.</p> <p>I thank the Leader for organising next week's statements on child care in the presence of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone.  I would like him, through his office, to signal to the Minister that we will be asking questions about the impact of the budget in terms of beefing up social workers.  I hope we will get some information on this matter next week.  The Minister has said in this House - I checked the record this morning - that she is greatly concerned about the lack of resources and the insufficient number of social workers, who are needed to deal with very vulnerable children.  I am giving notice here today that I will question the Minister on this matter next week.  I am looking forward to it.  I would like the Minister to be equipped to answer my questions.  The Leader might signal my intention to the Minister so that she will be able to share with us the budgetary implications of her objective to have more social workers in place in line with the statutory requirements of social services.</p></speech>

Michel Barnier has said he does not intend to recommend to the EU leaders that the talks should move on to trade issues next week.  This is a huge kick in the teeth for the island of Ireland.  Mr. Barnier has also said the EU will not make concessions on the peace process, which is very welcome.  Once again, we are sleepwalking our way into a very dangerous situation for this island.  As I have said previously, the British electorate shot themselves in our foot.  They never thought about the Border or the issues on the island of Ireland.  This is the Achilles heel that will make Brexit simply unworkable.  We are in a very dangerous situation again because the electorate will blame the EU and the fight will never be what the fight is about.  We are in a very dangerous situation.  I appreciate that there is a debate after lunch.  This morning's news is very worrying and disturbing.</p> <p>I would like to call for a debate on another issue.  I am the father of a child who was born 11 months ago.  When she was very young, she had reflux and she did not sleep, so we brought in a sleep trainer.  I did not realise what a sleep trainer was, but as a result of her work our young child is now sleeping from 7.30 p.m. until 7.30 a.m.  Her mother and I are delighted.  This episode made me realise that many people who are affected by simple little issues are asking where to get facilities like this and are anxious to contact people who can help them.  I understand that many people are providing these services on Skype.  The difference that has been made by the sleep trainer who came into our house for two days has been incredible.  Our baby is sleeping and everyone is very happy.  Maybe we should invite the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs or the Minister for Health to come to the House to discuss this issue, perhaps with a view to establishing a helpline for parents to ring or something like that.  I never thought I would be standing up in the Seanad saying that this was one the best things ever to happen to me.  Many parents, especially mothers, do not realise that assistance is available.  Perhaps we could call for a debate, during which the Minister could outline the position in this regard.  I appreciate that there are many more important things in the health budget, but maybe this is something we could look at.  I do not think there is enough awareness of a facility and resource that could be very helpful for the mothers and fathers of young children.</p></speech>

I ask Senators to think of the major parks in their own cities, towns and communities.  Swan Park, which is an important amenity for tourists at the core of my home town of Buncrana, has been destroyed by floods and will be closed to the public for an indefinite period.  It has been estimated that at least &euro;1 million in funding is required because the bridge walk and the screen area have been destroyed.  I welcome the Government's decision to reactivate humanitarian, farm relief, small business and community and sports schemes that were previously in place for communities down the country.  Equally, it has funded repairs to roads and bridges in the Inishowen area of County Donegal, just as it did down the country.  However, there is a huge gap in this area.  I cannot get any Department to clarify where responsibility for this issue lies.  It is a matter of clarifying which line Department is responsible for funding this vital amenity.  I understand the Government can draw down European funding to deal with flooding and humanitarian issues of this nature.  Having spoken to a number of MEPs, it appears that efforts are being made at European level to work in co-operation with our Government.  This is not even about money from our own Exchequer, as I understand it.  This is the third time I have raised this matter.  Could the Leader organise for somebody at Government level to give me a response?  If the Government cannot fund these repairs, it should be clearly explained why not.  I estimate that a total funding contribution of between &euro;20 and &euro;30 million will have to be made to get our community and the people in it back up and running.  Why would Swan Park be left out in that context?  I would also like to mention the related issue of Glenevin Waterfall in Clonmany, which is an important community and tourism amenity.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2321"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2321&amp;amp;pid=PadraigMacLochlainn&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Glenevin waterfall is another important community and tourism amenity in Clonmany, about a 20-minute drive from Swan Park in Buncrana.  It is owned by a community committee and would not require anywhere near the amount of money for Swan Park, yet it has also received no funding.  These are two very important community tourism amenities which people have worked very hard to develop and cultivate but they have no funding support from central government.  The Leader will notice that I have not once attacked the Government in this Chamber about its response to the floods.  I have worked in partnership with Ministers, at local and national level, but there is a major gap in respect of Buncrana and Clonmany.  I asked the Government to step in because there is no way Donegal County Council, or a local Leader group in Donegal, could cover it on their own.  I would like to be able to meet a Minister on this matter to explain it face to face.</p></speech>

It is important to remind people of where we have come from.  Between October 2008 and December 2010 some &euro;12.5 billion was taken out of the budget because the money was not there and an extra &euro;3.8 billion was imposed on taxpayers in this country.  This budget is balanced, reasonable and fair but this is not what occurred between 2002 and 2008 when there was an increase of over 12% in spending.  We have kept it to 3.4%, which is below the estimated economic growth, and that is the way we have to keep it because we do not have blank cheques.</p> <p>I am concerned about third level students who, for economic reasons or because they need to repeat exams, take a year out or work during a year to finance themselves while studying.  When they go back to college they find their income for the gap year is taken into account in assessing their grants.  It is unfair to penalise them for taking a year out and working during that year and the issue needs to be taken up with the Minister for Education and Skills.  We need to see how we can deal with it because it is unfair and wrong.  It is an important issue for third level students at the moment.</p> <p>I agree with Senator Craughwell that moneys be set aside for councillors who are providing a huge amount of time on a voluntary basis and who need to be adequately provided for by way of expenses and allowances.  It is important this issue is resolved soon and not prolonged into 2018.</p></speech>

It is grossly unfair that commercial property is treated in the same way as farm land under the tax code.  There are exemptions available for developers and a stamp duty rebate if they build and move a development on within 30 months but there is no such rebate available to farmers.  A farmer who buys a farm for &euro;500,000 and who cannot avail of the family farm exemption or the under-35 exemption has an additional cost of &euro;20,000 and this will disincentivise farmers who are trying to increase the viability of their farms, leading to a negative impact on the rural economy.</p> <p>There has to be an amendment to the Finance Act to create a distinction between commercial property and farming land.  I support Senator Boyhan's call for the Minister for Agriculture Food and the Marine to come to the House for a debate on the issue.  He spoke in the other House on the issue last night and his comments were not what the farming community was looking for but this issue will be a major cause of concern to farmers all over the country.</p></speech>

Many homemakers are farmers' wives and we have discussed family farms and stamp duty with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Minister for Finance.  We need to find a stamp duty mechanism to ensure people remain in rural Ireland.</p></speech>

I welcome the ruling of the Commercial Court that the Apple data centre in Athenry can go ahead, which is good news for our local area.</p> <p>Not such good news, however, is that the Trolley Watch figures for Galway University Hospital have quadrupled in ten years and the problems in the health service in the west are getting much worse, rather than improving.  The figures from Trolley Watch and Ward Watch published by the INMO show that, from 2006 to 2017, the figures for GUH and Portiuncula Hospital quadrupled.  From January 2006 to August 2006 there were 1,190 in GUH and 306 in Portiuncula but the comparable figures for 2017 show that there were four times more people on trolleys, that is, 4,331 in GUH and 1,300 in Portiuncula.</p> <p>There are 101,261 on inpatient and outpatient waiting lists in the Saolta Hospital Group, 50,496 in GUH, 9,549 in Mayo General Hospital and 3,915 in Portiuncula.  Of that cohort, 10,652 have been on the lists for over 18 months so it is quite clear that successive Governments have failed miserably to address our health service issues, particularly in the west.</p> <p>We have brought forward some proposals that would address the crisis in emergency departments, such as increasing bed numbers by 500 and re-opening closed beds, increasing nurse and midwives numbers by 500 each year and recruiting 800 more consultants and medical secretaries.

It has  made an interesting proposal that I believe could be of great value to many SMEs.</p> <p>Like Senator Kieran O'Donnell, I wish to raise the issue of pensions.  It is a fact that 23,000 women are disadvantaged by the current situation, which the Minister for Finance has described as "bonkers".  This legislation, as members will know, was only introduced in 2012.  It penalises women who left work to rear children, to care for vulnerable people and to care for the elderly.  I am struck by the fact that even at a time when we had no money in this country, and I was in the thick of it, we found money to compensate women who had been damaged by symphysiotomy.  We sought to address the Magdalen laundries issue.  When I was Minister for Health, we put in place a commission of inquiry into mother and baby homes.  All of these issues affect women.  Our historical treatment of women has been poor.  We now have a situation where we continue to discriminate against women, in their pensions, who care for our children - the future of this nation.  </p> <p>It has been mentioned that it will take &euro;290 million to correct this matter but it is not available.  I think the Minister has done a very good job in terms of the budget.  There will be issues around stamp duty on farms, and that is for sure.  As many as 23,000 women have been disadvantaged and my calculation leads me to believe that it will cost the Exchequer &euro;34.5 million per annum to fix the discrepancy from this point on, as opposed to &euro;290 million retrospectively.  I ask the Leader to call upon the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Minister for Finance to come to this House and give us some indication of a plan or roadmap that will start addressing this clear injustice to women.  </p> <p>I shall finish by saying that an injustice one does not know about is one thing.  The injustice that is current and we do know about, and would appear to continue to discriminate against women in terms of the extra &euro;5 that we have produced for pensioners in their weekly income, is another matter.  It seems to be in doubt that these women will get the full amount of the increase.  This is a current injustice that we have created in our time and one that we must address if we are true republicans in a republic of equal opportunity and treatment.</p></speech>

As has been said, the Minister for Finance has acknowledged that the existing regime has thrown up bonkers results.  The people who pay the price are a cohort that is comprised predominantly of women.  It tells a tale about our history.</p> <p>At the time these women, who may have worked earlier in their lives, took time out to look after their children.  They did not have much choice in the matter.  At the time there was no such thing as child care or subsidies for child care.  We also know that the marriage ban in the Civil Service ensured many of them had to leave their jobs.</p> <p>As a result, even as we speak, there are women entering retirement age who will lose out a portion of their pension every week because of changes that were made in 2012.  Clearly, those changes have led to an inequality.  Irish society strives to address inequalities all of the time.  This inequality is being borne by women.</p> <p>One can argue that these are the very women who have raised the generations who have made this country what it is today and I think they deserve more.  They paid contributions.  However, because there was a gap in their service and through the method of calculation, it means that nearly 23,000 women receive less of a pension than they would have been entitled to prior to 2012.  Ironically, people with fewer contributions but a more compact span over which they worked will receive a greater pension.  That shows a pension is not based on one's contributions.</p> <p>I very much welcome the honesty shown by the Minister for Finance in acknowledging this situation.  We need action and to talk about how we will address the inequality.  Every week that passes these women lose money and more women are entering the system all of the time.  This pension situation goes to the heart of many of the principles that we have talked about here, but mainly equality.  Basically, these women have paid into a system, the rules were changed through no fault of theirs and they have lost out.</p></speech>

That is my view.  I have always articulated my view to both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance.  Overall the budget has been exceptionally positive.  There certainly is a feeling of optimism and the Apple decision today adds to the optimism.  This new confidence is important.</p> <p>I wish to acknowledge that today is World Sight Day.  I wish to acknowledge the more than 250,000 people in this country who suffer blindness or are visually impaired.  I commend An Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, because yesterday, the day after the budget, he spent an hour launching a bursary for the National Council for the Blind of Ireland that encourages young people with sight loss to attend third level.  The bursary is entirely funded by the NCBI and it does an exceptional amount of fundraising.</p> <p>The bursary will benefit a number of young people next year.  Yesterday, the scheme received a strong and significant endorsement from An Taoiseach at Government Buildings.  At the event he met some students who will benefit from the bursary and had his photograph taken with them.  He also showed the representatives of the NCBI where he displays the Proclamation in Braille, which the NCBI presented to him when I organised for its representatives to meet him when he was the Minster for Social Protection.  It is one of a few items that are displayed in his office, which indicates his commitment to making the lives not just of blind or visually impaired people in this country better but people with disabilities in general.  I thank him most sincerely for that.</p> <p>I wish to acknowledge the challenges and difficulties that the Halawa family is facing.  It is a disgrace that Ibrahim Halawa has still not been released from prison three weeks after being found innocent of all charges.</p></speech>

I agree with them that it is discriminatory and unjust.  All of us in our personal lives and our lives as politicians understand that the anomaly needs to be redressed.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A wrong was done to a group of women who had to leave the workforce.  To those of us who live in modern Ireland it seems incredible that they had to leave the workforce in the first place.  It is important to recognise that women should have and should receive fair treatment.  The Minister has been very candid in his approach.  As Senator Colm Burke said, we are coming out the worst recession in the history of the country.  The Minister is trying to make progress on the issue and he is anxious to address it but it was not possible to do so in this budget.  It is important that the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, would come to the House.  I would be happy to facilitate Members in such a request.  She is due to come before us in the coming weeks.  The matter has been raised previously by many Senators and it is a very complicated area with a very long-standing need to have redress put in place.  However, it does cost money.  As Senator O'Donnell correctly said, some people will not qualify, others will get partial payments, and others still will get reduced payments.  The important point is that I will bring the Minister to the House to address the issue as it needs to be debated in full in order to find a resolution because it is about equality for all citizens.</p><p>Senator Ardagh also made reference to housing and the hidden homeless.  She made a good point.  The Government gave an increase of 46% to the housing budget and Rebuilding Ireland is the roadmap for the future.  An extra &euro;500 million in supports is available to target 50,000 homes for those in need of social housing.  It is important that the remarks of Senator Ardagh are heard by the Minister.  I would be happy to bring them to the relevant Minister, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.</p><p>Senator Craughwell, who has been a champion of the Defence Forces in this House, raised the number of Army personnel with housing concerns and the need to see Defence Forces property freed up for use.  The Minister of State with responsibility for defence, Deputy Paul Kehoe, is open to doing some of the things to which Senator Craughwell referred.  The Senator is correct that the houses should be immediately refurbished and put back into the housing stock.  That would do two things, namely, reduce the waiting lists and also allow the soldiers in whom we have great pride, and who take great pride in their work, to live either on the Army base or, as the Senator indicated, close to work in the case of The Curragh.  That is something on which we might work with the Minister of State with responsibility for defence.  I would be very happy to speak to the Senator about the matter after the Order of Business.</p></speech>

Senator Feighan spoke about the decision this morning by Mr. Barnier.  From our perspective Brexit is about the island of Ireland.  Nobody in this Chamber or in the Government wants to see a return to the hard border.  The Taoiseach was right yesterday to paint a picture of what could happen.</p> <p>I made the comment yesterday in this House that it ill-behoves Deputy Donnelly or Deputy Martin to play politics with Brexit.  It is about wearing the green jersey and having one voice and standing up for all our people.  I know the Senator was in Brussels yesterday and Monday.  There is a need to see a committed, unified opinion on Brexit from our perspective.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, was in the House yesterday for statements on Northern Ireland and today we will have statements on the future of Europe with the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee.  It is important that we keep beating the drum of there being no return to a hard border, and that we do not bend in any way in that regard.  The Government has been strong in its position in that regard.</p> <p>Senator Gavan raised the issue of child care and child care workers.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, has secured a significant increase in the budget for the provision of resources in the child care area.  All of us accept that wages in the child care sector are low and we want that to change.  The issue is creating a barrier to recruitment in the child care sector and retention of staff is also a problem.  We are very lucky with the extraordinary quality of staff we have in the child care sector.  Having secured increased capitation levels in the budget the Minister is of the view that it will assist employers to improve conditions for their staff.  In addition, we all recognise that the situation cannot be sorted out in one go but that it will take time.  This is the second budget where there has been an increase in funding.  Equally, the Minister has set up an independent review of the cost of delivering quality child care, which I hope will allow for more investment in child care and child care providers and that the investment will be passed on to child care workers.  I share Senator Gavan's view that we need to do more in that regard.  I will work with him on the issue because it is important.  I already mentioned his comment on pensions.</p> <p>Senator Higgins referred to gender and equality proofing in the budget and tax relief.  I would be happy for the Minister to come to the House to discuss those matters.  I note that this week the equality budgeting campaign, which was set up in 2012, has stood itself down, in part because it has achieved its goal of having the Government committed to equality budgeting, and the Oireachtas Committee on Budgetary Oversight has been set up.  We all want to see equality proofing of budgets.  It is important that we keep that to the forefront and that we promote such an aim.  I would be happy to have such a debate in the House in the coming weeks.</p> <p>Senators Boyhan, &Oacute; Domhnaill and Kieran O'Donnell referred to stamp duty on agricultural land.  Stamp duty relief is still available to farmers aged under 35.  Young farmers will not be affected.  It is something that should be addressed in the Finance Bill.  Stamp duty has increased from 2% to 6% but it was at 9%.  The Minister is aware of the issues that were raised following the budget announcement.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill said that perhaps the Minister was not prepared to move from what he said in his speech last night but many people in this House and in the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party have raised the matter with him.  The mechanism is to ensure we look after the family farm and rural areas and that we continue to allow people to invest and attract people to stay and live in rural areas.  The Finance Bill may provide a mechanism which will act as a resolution to that matter.</p> <p>Senator Boyhan referred to child care and social workers.  There has been an increase in funding to Tusla as well which will allow for further employment in that area.  I am pleased to clarify that issue for him.</p> <p>Senators Maria Byrne and Martin Conway raised the fact that it is World Sight Day.  I compliment Senator Conway on his role as an excellent ambassador and advocate for people with sight impairments.  He has been to the fore in leading the campaign.  I am pleased the Taoiseach launched the report yesterday.  It is important that we recognise the world is changing and there are so many ways in which we can work with and improve the lives of people with visual impairment.  Senator Conway's leadership in the area is a testament to the need for all of us to work in a collaborative manner.  The point he and Senator Byrne made is important.  Equally, I encourage Members to attend the screening today for diabetes organised by Senator Noone.  Some of us might be afraid to be tested but it is about prevention rather than reaction.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill is testament to powerful living in terms of fitness, health and well-being.  It is important that we would attend the screening so I encourage Members to participate today as it is about prevention.</p> <p>I congratulate Senator Feighan on the sleep trainer.  I was looking at Senator Gavan who was smiling.  I wondered whether he had many sleep-deprived nights himself.</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran, will be in the House.  I have been in Clonmany myself.  It is a beautiful part of the country.  We need to see Swan Park and other such areas addressed.  The Senator is correct that it is a public park, an amenity, and it should not be closed indefinitely.  A plan of action should be put in place.  I would be happy for the Minister of State, Deputy Moran, to discuss that in the House with the Senator next week.</p> <p>Senator Colm Burke raised the issue of third level and people going back to education in order to better themselves.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The anomaly raised by Senator Burke is one that needs to be addressed and I would be happy to have the Minister come to the House to discuss this matter.

We have also seen an increase in the primary care budget.  We need to ensure that people are treated in their communities and that they have access to services and that is why there is extra funding in the budget.  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh might consult with his own party leader, Deputy Adams, who spoke yesterday in the D&aacute;il about an increase of &euro;1 billion in spending, which is way above what Sinn F&eacute;in looked for in its own costed budget proposal.

I wish the Senators well.  It is lovely.</p><p>I begin by thanking the Cathaoirleach, Senator Neale Richmond and Seanad Members for inviting me to address the House today on the future of Europe.  I am a firm believer that the national parliaments contribute actively to the good functioning of the European Union.  The Lisbon treaty includes provisions which encourage greater involvement by national parliaments in the activities of the Union and it enhances their ability to express their views on draft legislation emerging from the Union.  Commission consultation documents, the Commission's annual legislative programme and draft legislation are sent to national parliaments at the same time as they are sent to the European Parliament and the Council.  The treaty allows national parliaments to send reasoned opinions to the presidents of the European Parliament, the European Council and the Commission on whether a draft piece of legislation complies with the principle of subsidiarity.</p><p>These are important provisions.  They apply in equal measure to Seanad &Eacute;ireann and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, and each House is entitled to avail of them in its own right.  Representative democracy is at the heart of the European project and these new provisions were brought into domestic legislation in Ireland by the European Union Act 2009.  I believe these provisions enhance the right of every citizen to participate in the democratic life of the Union.  We often think of Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasbourg when we think of the European Union because those are the cities where the various institutions have their seats but Europe is not at all that remote since we do Europe's business when we do business in this House or in the parliament of any member state across the Union.</p><p>That is why the Union&rsquo;s values of freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human life and rights, are so important.  Without them, the lives of millions of Europeans would be greatly diminished.  Elsewhere in the world, many people know how it is when only lipservice is paid to these values.  They understand the cost to the quality of their lives and, increasingly, they look to Europe as a place where European values exist and that approach is taken to the issue of the day, such as climate change, globalisation and social progress.  This makes a real and often enviable difference.  When the leaders of the EU 27 met in Bratislava last year, after the referendum in the UK in which it decided to leave the European Union, their immediate focus was on meeting the expectations of citizens and on recommitting to our core values.  Citizens and values were at the heart of their preoccupations for the future of Europe.  It was stated:</p><blockquote>The EU is not perfect but it is the best instrument we have for addressing the new challenges we are facing.  We need the EU not only to guarantee peace and democracy but also the security of our people.  We need the EU to serve better their needs and wishes to live, study, work, move and prosper freely across our continent and benefit from the rich European cultural heritage.</blockquote> <p>I very much believe that we need to acknowledge that there was perhaps a reason that the UK decided to leave the European Union and we need to work towards the European Union working for and delivering for citizens.  There has been broad agreement across member states that, at this stage in its development, the Union needs to focus on outcomes rather than just institutions.  Across the member states, the fundamental importance of the European Union in dealing with the issues affecting us is also recognised.  When the leaders of the EU 27 met earlier this year in Rome, they said they, &quot;want a Union that is safe and secure, prosperous, competitive, sustainable and socially responsible, and with the will and capacity of playing a key role in the world and of shaping globalisation.&quot;</p><p>I am particularly pleased that the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs is paying such close attention to this process.  I know some Members here are members of that committee, which has launched a consultation process on the future of Europe.  I encourage all interested groups and individuals to make their submissions before the closing date on Friday, 20 October.  The committee has already heard from the National Youth Council of Ireland, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, Macra Na Feirme, IBEC and the European Movement Ireland and I look forward to reading the committee's completed report soon.</p><p>The committee's consultation process and today's debate here in the Seanad are excellent examples of how national parliaments can contribute to the better functioning of the European Union.  The emphasis we share on citizens is at the heart of the European Commission's White Paper on the future of Europe and of the five reflection papers the Commission has produced in the meantime.  The White Paper sets out five scenarios for the future of Europe ranging from simply carrying on as we are to being more ambitious and doing much more together, and various other scenarios.  The reflection papers are wide-ranging and they provide a set of options.  They deal with the social dimension, harnessing globalisation, deepening our economic and monetary union, the future of European defence and future arrangements for the EU budget.  It is important to note that this list is not exhaustive or exclusive, but it is a base to start a discussion.</p><p>Our starting point on these issues has to be to focus on the needs and concerns of our citizens.  This includes a focus on jobs and growth, opportunities for young people, completion of the Single Market and the key role of the EU in meeting the challenges of today's globalised world, from climate change to combatting international terrorism.  As any Member of the House will have noticed, the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, gave his state of the Union address to the European Parliament last month and later the President of the French Republic, Emmanuel Macron, launched his own initiatives on Europe.  While both speeches added a new impetus to the future of Europe process which began at the Bratislava summit in September of last year, it is important to put these speeches in context.  Each is a contribution to the debate but there are 27 member states, each with its own voice, perspective and view on what should and could work for the Union as a whole.</p><p>The future of Europe was discussed informally by EU Heads of State and Government at a summit in Tallinn at the end of September.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, spoke for Ireland and it was agreed that the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, would consult bilaterally with member states on substance and process and continue the discussion at the next European Council meeting, which is next week.  In Tallinn it was noticeable that many member states, including Ireland, took an approach rooted in the path set out by the Heads of State and Government in Bratislava and Rome, focused on delivering for citizens.</p><p>Without pre-empting that debate, I believe our thinking should reflect Ireland&rsquo;s priorities.  I do not want to be exhaustive on this but our priorities should include the completion of the internal market, especially in services and the digital Single Market, an area in which we feel we can lead.  They should also include the reduction of administrative burdens and compliance costs on small and medium enterprises.</p><p>Combatting youth and long-term unemployment must be a priority for all member states.  Investment in infrastructure, research and innovation should be a priority, as should the negotiation of trade and investment agreements with third countries, and we have seen agreements with Canada and China in recent months.  The completion of the banking union, promoting access to low-carbon energy and tackling climate change must also be priorities.  Finally, we all need to stand together on preventing international crime and terrorism.  Above all, we need an honest and fair debate which confronts the myths about the European Union and that is calm, considered and inclusive.  This is how we will formulate a contribution that reflects the concerns and expectations of the Irish people.</p><p>I look forward to hearing Senators' ideas and comments today.  I thank them again for the opportunity to engage with them on this matter of significant national importance.</p></speech>

The EU has been good to Ireland and Ireland has been good to Europe.  The biggest effect has been on the fishing industry and the lobby at that time was not as strong as it should have been compared with other interests.  That was then, however, and now we have to maximise quotas and catches under the Common Fisheries Policy and to ensure we get our product to the market after Brexit.</p> <p>I find the debate on the development of Europe somewhat unreal because the main focus is Brexit.  In March 2019, the United Kingdom will no longer be a member of the European Union.  There will be a transitional period of two or three years, which is acceptable, but I was in Brussels recently and met British MEPs who will be gone, along with all the influence they currently have in Brussels.  People should have some consideration for the dedicated civil servants who worked very well with Irish diplomats and civil servants in Europe.  I was given responsibility by the then Minister, Des O'Malley, to be the main negotiator for Ireland and I got tremendous support from the civil servants and ambassadors in that role.  I met John Redwood, a pro-Brexiteer, and others around 1990 or 1991.  Since that time, everything the United Kingdom wanted from Europe it got, such as derogations on issues it could not deal with at that time.  The Single European Act was an important provision for the European Union and has brought great progress to the region.  We should recognise the contribution of the United Kingdom to the development and strength of the European Union.  We are losing a genuine ally because our interests were totally parallel and always coincided.</p> <p>I am in favour of development in the EU but I am not at all in favour of a federal Europe.  We fought too long for our independence and we want to ensure a united Ireland in time, but not in a federal Europe.  The President of France is moving too far, too fast towards a two-speed Europe, with some in and others out, and I think that would be damaging.  I regard the prospect of further treaties with scepticism as we have enough to work on at this stage.  We need a Union that is more responsive and there have been changes to the role of parliaments.  As the Minister said, the D&aacute;il and Seanad are two separate Houses of Parliament in the Republic of Ireland and we have the right to put forward amendments to legislation or to yellow card proposals.  It is for the Leader of the House, the Cathaoirleach and his staff to devote a bit more time to European affairs in the Seanad.  We should have time set aside to review legislation coming from the Commission and to ensure there is an Irish input.  We will fight for and retain the 12.5% corporation tax as we have to.  This attractive package is imperative, now more than ever, for our development given the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union.</p> <p>The Union should not be paralysed in its expansion and I prepared a report for the Council of Europe in respect of Montenegro.  I recommended that it join the EU, along with Bosnia and Herzegovina, and they should be encouraged to continue with their negotiations.  I hope the negotiations are not put on hold but I accept that Turkey will never become a member of the EU as the policies it is pursuing at the moment make it ineligible.</p> <p>This is a worthwhile debate and I am glad to have had the opportunity to speak on it.  I hope we can come back to discuss these issues regularly though, as members of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, Senator Neale Richmond and I will have the opportunity to meet the Minister for briefings.  This is about Ireland Inc. and we need to work together as a team.  It is not a party political issue but a united Irish approach to the future of the European Union.</p></speech>

I join Senator Leyden in congratulating the Minister and wishing her and her husband the best.  There are many issues we could raise in a debate on Europe.  We have engaged critically with the EU over a number of years and we are concerned over the push to more centralisation.  I could raise the Common Fisheries Policy and the impact of the fiscal compact etc., but I want to go on a specific route, which is Catalan self-determination, a very pertinent and serious issue.  The Minister of State said representative democracy was at the heart of the European project and that the provisions enhance the right of every citizen to participate in the democratic life of the Union.  She added that the Union's values, namely, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, are very important.  She went on to say that, elsewhere in the world, many people know what it is like when only lip service is paid to these values.</p><p>I contend that millions of people in Catalunya would say the EU was paying lip service to these values at the moment.  I was an international observer in Catalunya for the referendum and there are huge concerns about the way things have turned out there.  Many international commentators put forward the fact that this was not a legitimate referendum.  A report carried out by a commission of international legal experts, &quot;Catalonia's legitimate right to decide&quot;, states:</p><blockquote>From an international law perspective it appears clearly that there is no international legal prohibition barring a sub-state entity from deciding its political destiny by assessing the will of its people.  Both case law and state practice support this conclusion.</blockquote> <p>It also states that EU member states have recognised many former sub-state entities that assessed their people's political will and decided to pursue independence.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2363"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2363&amp;amp;pid=TrevorOClochartaigh&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It also states:</p><blockquote>As regard European law, in the absence of specific Treaty provision on the right of Self-determination for a European people without a State on the territory of the EU, EU law...does not forbid the exercise of its Right to Decide for a European people within the EU.  There are even numerous Treaty provisions that indicate that if such Right was to be exercised, EU and it&rsquo;s member States would react positively to a new European State candidacy to join the EU.  Further, recent and consistent practice clearly points that way.  Finally, both as a collectively exercised human right and as a fundamental norm of international Law, EU recognizes the Right to decide.</blockquote><p>I do not think the case put forward by people that this is an internal issue for the Spanish Government to decide with the Catalan Government holds water in that regard.  It is an international issue and it is becoming a much more serious international issue.<br/><br/>One of the final conclusions is:</p><blockquote>The experts recommend the exploration of an earned sovereignty negotiating process within the framework of the EU.  This would imply involvement by EU institutions; we consider it possible in the perspective of a negotiation within the EU, fully associating Spain in seeking for Catalonia a constrained sovereignty solution, as an EU full member.</blockquote><p>There is certainly a case, whether people want to agree or disagree, that under international law Catalunya had the right to decide for itself.  The people of Catalunya had hoped the referendum would be a celebration of democracy, and it turned out to be far from that as the Spanish national police launched a widespread crackdown on Catalunya's self-determination referendum, as we know.  I saw at first hand the violence of the Guardia Civil.  I saw the peaceful and dignified way the people of Catalunya held themselves.  The international parliamentary delegation issued a statement on the night of the referendum, and I will give the House the opening remarks from the statement.  There were approximately 35 of us, all parliamentarians, and a number of other people.  The opening remarks were:</p><blockquote>We were impressed and reassured by the patient, determined and non-violent behaviour of the huge number of people who came out to vote across Catalunya.<br /><br />As a Parliamentary Delegation we wish to express abhorrence at:<br /><br />(a) The violence of the Spanish State that brought about more than 800 individuals being injured.<br /><br />(b) The electronic sabotage deployed against the democratic vote.<br /><br />(c) The removal of ballot boxes by Spanish State Forces.<br /><br />We would like to express our admiration for scrupulous and professional work of polling staff across Catalunya in the face of real and significant problems and pressures.</blockquote><p>That statement was unanimously agreed by people from all types of different political backgrounds.  We also stated that we considered it &quot;regrettable that the European Union, the Council of Europe and other international organisations have not acted to mediate with the purpose to facilitate an agreed solution, acceptable for both parties&quot;.  We think this is key.  I note there have been quite a lot of statements from international spokespersons.  The Elders is a group of international public figures, including elder statesman, peace activists and human rights advocates.  It was founded by Nelson Mandela in 2007, and the group is chaired by Ghanaian diplomat and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Kofi Annan.  Our own Mary Robinson is member of the group.  Kofi Annan, chair of The Elders, said:</p><blockquote>The constitutional crisis that is unfolding in Spain calls for consultation and not confrontation.  I urge the Spanish government and the regional government of Catalonia to renew their commitment to a resolution through dialogue. They must find a peaceful path out of this crisis.</blockquote><p>Carles Puigdemont, the President of the Catalan Parliament, has said the international community, and especially the European Union, has to be involved.  After the Spanish police violence to stop the 1 October referendum throughout the country, he said the Spanish Government should accept international mediation after the events on Sunday.  He also said the European Union probably cannot play this role, but it should sponsor it to make sure Spain takes part.<br/><br/>I note Nicola Sturgeon of the SNP and First Minister of Scotland is calling on the Spanish Government to respect the overwhelming &quot;<i>S&iacute;</i>&quot; vote won in the Catalan referendum as an expression of the democratic will of the people of Catalunya and urges the UN, EU and Council of Europe to mediate.  There have also been such calls in the Council of Europe and the European Parliament, and our leader Gerry Adams has called for this.<br/><br/>The Minister of State has a very important role in the EU.  I ask her to implore other members to look at what really happened in Catalunya and look at the international legal framework, and call for international mediation sponsored by the EU.  It is not right that we say to the people of Catalunya that it is an internal situation.  We can see from what has happened this will need international support to try to resolve the issues that have come forward.  It comes back to the basic tenets of what we stand for, and credibility has been lost by the EU in what has happened in the past week in Catalunya.  Chancellor Merkel, President Macron and others, including Jean-Claude Juncker, were quick to jump and side with the Spanish Government's position on the issue.  Ireland has always been seen as an honest broker and peacemaker.  We need to stand on our own two feet.  I would like this Parliament to make a statement to call for international mediation, and I would be delighted if the Minister of State would do this and bring the message back to her EU colleagues, and ask the Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, to do the same and stand up and be counted as a democrat in this scenario.</p></speech>

We are having this discussion on foot of a decision by the people of the United Kingdom to vote to leave the European Union just over a year ago.  Even if the people of the UK had decided to remain, or a referendum was never held, we would have had to have had this discussion because Europe needs reform and change.  This has been said by many people many times over.  Therefore, I welcome the position paper printed by the European Commission laying out the five clear options for the future of Europe.  There are many varied options, all of which deserve attention, but one which I feel is not viable is the option of simply doing nothing.  That does not get us anywhere or bring about reform of the European Union to bring it closer to the people and reimagine what the European ideals should all be about.  A cursory glance suggests a combination of elements of options four and five may probably be the best approach for Ireland, doing more but doing more better in a smaller area and focusing in.  The EU really needs to ram home exactly what it means to people and how it can benefit people.</p> <p>I also welcome the lengthy speech, referenced by the Minister of State and Senator Leyden, by the French President, Emmanuel Macron.  I welcome it because I do not know the last time an EU Head of State got up for almost two hours and spoke about Europe.  It was a really strong weighty speech that looked at some serious issues.  I consider myself as pro-European as it comes, but there are key aspects of the speech with which I simply do not agree and which I believe are strongly against the best interests of Ireland.  The vision of European federalism put out by Emmanuel Macron is very much a French vision of European federalism, and we must be very careful that we can respect those opinions but disagree.  That vision perhaps suits the French and some type of Franco-German alliance, but we have to see the reimagining of Europe to make sure it meets the needs of all 27 member states post-Brexit.</p> <p>I must put on record my absolute disappointment in the wake of the Brexit referendum that the six original member states of the European Coal and Steel Community saw fit to meet among themselves in Rome, leaving out the other 21 member states.  This cannot happen any more.  The idea that some people are more European or committed to the project than others is quite backwards.  In this vacuum I see a vital role for Ireland.  Ireland can easily take this opportunity to be the lead nation among small and medium member states and lead the majority 21 member states that were not in the original European Coal and Steel Community to lay out exactly what sort of future Europe we want and what Europe we want to see in 2025 and beyond.  Therefore, I ask the Minister of State in the strongest way possible to bring this message back to An Taoiseach, our friend whom we know well and for whom we voted very recently in a different election.  I ask her to lay down the challenge to the Taoiseach to assume that leadership role in Europe and allow Ireland become the counterbalance to France and the bigger nations and put himself in the driving seat opposite Emmanuel Macron, and state we do believe in a strong Europe and Ireland is committed to Europe, but that we can assert Ireland's role in Europe and on the global stage by taking a proactive leading role in designing a Europe that is not just suited to the large member states and is reflective of smaller member states and allows them to protect their interests, such as maintaining a competitive corporation tax rate, as referenced by Senator Leyden.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Neale Richmond:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2472"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2472&amp;amp;pid=NealeRichmond&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->When people talk about Ireland being at the heart of Europe it cannot be just a slogan.  Taking such a stance and laying out such a vision is a key way of making sure that Ireland remains at the heart of Europe.  The EU is absolutely wonderful but the reason for its coming into being and its positive impact on our daily life is I fear being taken for granted, particularly by the generation I share with the Minister of State.</p><p>The EU is the greatest peace project known to man after what was probably the worst conflict in the history of mankind.  People were able to come together.  This is what the EU is about, pooling steel and coal and making sure the tools of war could not be brought out again.  That is simple and that is what it goes back to but it has become so much more.  It means we go to Spain on our holidays and not have to fret about converting pesetas to punts every time we go into a shop.  It means we can go to France, Bulgaria or Poland without having to get a visa and to The Netherlands or Scandinavia without having to get a work permit, if we have an opportunity with one of the large multinationals such as Microsoft, which has bases in my area, Sandyford and in Copenhagen.  We need to reimagine what that Europe means and lay out clearly what the future of Europe will be and how it will benefit people.  We cannot just say this is what Europe has done and people should be grateful because the more we do that and forget exactly what it can do for people, the more people become sceptical about it, the more the laziness creeps in.</p><p>We as politicians have a responsibility to portray Europe in the fairest light and not to take the politically opportune moment to blame Brussels, Strasbourg and Luxembourg for something we do not like when it is probably our responsibility, or take credit and say, "Look what we have delivered", when it came through Structural Funds or negotiation at EU level.  We criticise it when it merits criticism and we praise it when it merits praise.  Simply using it as a punch bag when it suits us will lead to the rise of Eurosceptic movements of petty nationalism, which brought the UK out of the EU and which are on the rise in countries such as Germany with the election of a what is essentially a Nazi party so many years after the Second World War.  </p><p>I am absolutely enthused about the upcoming week's debate that the Minister of State is going to lead.  I wish her well with her partners in the Commission, the Parliament offices, the Institute of International and European Affairs, IIEA, and the European Movement Ireland.  This is one of the most important matters that we will deal with as an entity of 450 million people.  It needs to be taken seriously and engaged with at every level of society because if the people take ownership of the European project it will last for many more years.  It has been around for only 60 years.  It is great that it has lasted this long but it is now facing its greatest threat and its greatest opportunity.</p></speech>

I am very pleased by its content and tone.</p><p>The debate on Europe in Ireland has been polarised into a very unreal one between those who have always been opposed to Ireland's membership of the EU and have always sought to get a &quot;No&quot; vote in every referendum on the one hand, and those who, on the other hand, are deeply enthusiastic for the federalist project in Europe.  Between those two polar extremes there is a very different and enthusiastic vision for Europe which rarely gets articulated in any Irish debate.  There are institutions such as the IIEA in North Great George's Street, which does a great job from one point of view in bringing European speakers here and getting Irish people to think about European topics.  I do not want to decry it unfairly but it is very much a Brussels-oriented institution and that may have something to do with how it is financed and the like.  There are Jean Monnet professors in many of our universities who are sponsored by the European Union.  There are many European movements and funded organisations which are opinion shapers.</p><p>The real question, however, is whether it is possible to construct a united states of Europe, the kind of thing the Prime Minister of Italy claimed he was about to bring about, the kind of structure proposed by the Spinelli Group which includes Guy Verhofstadt and various other strong federalists, namely, a unified European super state.  Do we in Ireland want the development of such a body?  In my view the great majority of Irish people do not want it.  When the British were trying to negotiate a pre-Brexit agreement under the Prime Ministership of David Cameron, <i>The Irish Times</i>conducted an opinion poll on issues such as attitudes to further integration and the like there was a 2:1 or 3:1 majority in favour of a more intergovernmental Europe over a strongly federalist one.  Those opinion polls are not published very often.  Perhaps <i>The Irish Times</i>, editorially, is not very keen on examining what kind of Europe the Irish people really want.  We do not have a deep analysis of what would be involved in the establishment of a federal united states of Europe and whether the Irish people have any interest in being involved in such a project. </p><p>Guy Verhofstadt, who came here recently to address various committees in the D&aacute;il Chamber, wrote a book with Daniel Cohn-Bendit called <i>For Europe!</i>, three or four years ago.  In it he wrote about the necessity to build up Europe as an empire.  He said it would be a good empire.  More recently, he published a book called <i>Europe's Last Chance</i>and the thesis of that book is that we need a strong single state of Europe with a single government to play its part internationally.  The present arrangement in Europe, a partnership of sovereign member states which pool aspects of their sovereignty and conduct a lot of their relationship on an intergovernmental level, suits countries of our size and outlook.  It may not be very attractive to some people in Europe but it suits us and it suits most of the member states of the EU that this aspect of Europe should be preserved.  Therefore, strong leaps towards integration or an idea of a political defence and security union, etc., need to be challenged because we have to ask whether the ultimate aim of that project is credible.</p><p>Over the summer I read a book on the Austro-Hungarian empire, I know that is a terrible confession to make.  It was a fascinating read because the empire came crashing down in 1918.  It was a multicultural, multilingual, multinational empire but the only thing that kept it together was coercion.  In the end it was an unnatural thing, which was doomed to disintegrate because there was not a single population or <i>demos</i>underlying any effort to make it democratic.  There was not a single people who would be in a position to understand each other if there were, for instance, a debate for a president of Europe.  For example, if there were an elected president of Europe, in the same sense that the Americans have one, how would a Bulgarian person watching the TV debate know what was happening if it was an Irish candidate, or <i>vice versa</i>?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is not a degree of cohesion in Europe to justify the creation of a federated state.  Not merely is it an impossibility but it is a dangerous project to pursue because it is improbable.  One only has to look to the United States of America to see what huge federal parties did.  The Democrats in America became the most reactionary and pro-segregationist party for a long time.  At the same time, liberal democrats in New England were an entirely different breed.  America was a sort of coalition of people but at least they spoke the same language and could understand the points the other was making.  </p><p>We now need a debate in which not just short contributions of the kind that are possible here but well worked out positions on the degree of integration this country really supports, and in what areas, are spelt out clearly.  Looking at the final points that the Minister of State referred to on the last page of her statement, those are the tasks which I believe deserve our attention.  We should say to the federalists that this is the agenda, nothing else, and tell them to get on with it, to stop making noises that frighten everyone, to stop trying to dream up Europe as a single united superpower that can make war on people and the like, and to abandon that concept and stick to what is working at the moment.</p></speech>

As Senator Richmond said, it is an opportunity to highlight that it is not a polarised debate which we often see, of being for or against Europe.  There are many of us who are passionate about Europe.  I worked for many years with the European Women's Lobby, the European Anti-Poverty Network, and with others in civil society across Europe.  Now I am very lucky to be able to represent this Chamber in the Council of Europe.  </p> <p>Inter-European co-operation is crucial but we must be free to approach it in a critical way and we must give Europe the respect of putting forward critical and challenging positions.  I am concerned about the scenarios that have been outlined so far in this debate on the future of Europe.  These include the scenarios put forward by the Commission and by Mr. Juncker and Mr. Macron which force on heavily the speed of integration.  We would have a two-speed Europe, which is something I deeply oppose.  There is little discussion or nuance on the far more important question for Europe today, which is the question of direction.  For example, we need to look at not only what we are doing but how we might do it differently and how we might do it better.  Is it not the case that greater co-operation should not automatically mean greater centralised decision making?  That seems to be the assumption underpinning so many of the scenarios that were laid out here today.</p> <p>On the muscles of the Commission, how do we make the Commission more accountable to citizens?  How do we ensure that the European Parliament is more robust in its legislative role and able to genuinely put proposals on the agenda for discussion?  Can we ensure that we have greater transparency and engagement around the Council of Europe?  The European Semester process is meant to be a conversation between governments and European institutions.  I have had the opportunity to sit in on those conversations and they can be narrowly focused on fiscal targets with complete neglect of the other common European pledges in areas such as the Europe 2020 commitment to smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.  Can we not challenge all of those muscles that are already there?  Can we not challenge how they are working and make sure that they work differently and in a more accountable way?</p> <p>As Europeans we face three serious challenges and Ireland needs to find its voice and speak up on them.  First is the question of peace building as opposed to securitisation.  Securitisation is not the same as peace building.  Europe has been neglecting the work of peace building.  Referring even to the Minister of State's list of priorities, I note with some regret that we talk about the prevention of international crime and terrorism but we do not talk about peace building.  If there is a country that should be championing that voice in Europe, it is Ireland.  We see that Europe's diplomatic and peace building skills have been neglected.  That is particularly evident in the past week or two in respect of Catalonia when there has been an absolute failure to step into the space of peace building and diplomacy and a retreat into an extremely narrow interpretation of rule of law and implementation of law.</p> <p>Implementation of law takes places in the political context that is set by all of us as political representatives, legislators and representatives of citizens and their concerns.  There is a real need for Europe to find its voice on peace.  We have benefited from it in Ireland and we need to step up in that regard.  In Ireland, we have the extraordinary history of Frank Aiken, an Irish Minister who in 1958 initiated the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.  I had the opportunity to be present when Ireland sealed the negotiations on a global ban on cluster munitions in Croke Park in Dublin.  We have seen Eamon Gilmore, a former representative of these Houses, play a key role in the peace negotiations in Colombia.  Ireland has an extraordinary record in peace building and as a peace broker.  We have played a global and a European role and we are an asset to Europe as well as the world in that respect.  That is why I share many of the concerns expressed about Mr. Macron's proposals, which seem to be pushing us towards a militarised Europe and a narrow response.  Ireland must take a stand on this and it must defend its unique contribution as a neutral nation and peace builder.</p></speech>

Lastly, I note that Europe's credibility is also being damaged internationally.  When Europe is seen to have a militarised and securitised response, for example, to the migration crisis, it diminishes our capacity to step in with regard to the huge global movements of people in crisis, for example, in Myanmar or, in the past, in places such as India and Pakistan.  We need to hold that role.  I would love if the Minister of State could address that matter.</p> <p>Another part of peace building is social investment.  We know that from Northern Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement.  It is about giving people opportunities and hope.  The fact is that in Europe the austerity measures of recent years have not just had an immediate impact but have also undermined the social fabric.  There needs to be a willingness to admit and acknowledge that some of the economic policies put forward and the austerity measures imposed have weakened our social fabric.  They have done the opposite of what we do when we want to build peace, which is invest.  In many cases they have prohibited and blocked governments from investing in the areas which they identify as necessary for social cohesion and well-being.  That needs to be addressed.  While the social pillar produced by Mr. Juncker is a small step in the right direction, it is extremely unfortunate that he attached the language of the markets - calling on people to seek a AAA rating for society - given that it is those markets that have decimated society.  </p> <p>If we want to have public confidence and accountability restored and public faith in democracy, which is now more crucial than market sentiment for the genuine future of Europe, we will have to somewhat accept that quarterly returns and quarterly figures of the market are not the only indication-----</p></speech>

Far too often we have the simple narrative that a person is either for or against trade or has an open or a protectionist position.  We must listen to citizens who say that they want international trade but that it needs to be done well.  Some of the models put forward, for example, CETA and TTIP, have failed the test.  It is of note that the Court of Justice of the European Union is currently considering the legality of investor-court systems.  I suggest that this is an opportunity for governments to say that, now its legality is being considered, perhaps we need to re-examine the issue to see if it is an appropriate element to include in our international trade agreements.</p></speech>
