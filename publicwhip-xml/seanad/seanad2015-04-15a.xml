    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-04-15a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1131" speakername="Fidelma Healy Eames" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015041500002#B00400"><p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  I am raising an interesting issue that has come to light recently.  I am asking the Minister for Education and Skills to recognise inequities that are arising for Galway second level students where both dyslexia and a language exemption co-exist.  This problem is particularly affecting girls.  It seems from a survey that has been done - I can read out the names of the schools involved - that no girls school in Galway allows these students to access six subjects in the leaving certificate examination in order that they can achieve the maximum number of points in that examination.  I am seeking a solution to this problem, which was first brought to my attention by a family living in Corrandulla, a small rural village approximately ten miles outside Galway city.  A daughter in this family was diagnosed with dyslexia and giftedness in 2009.  She got As and Bs in her junior certificate.  She is a high performer in State examinations.  She was exempted from Irish and foreign languages from first year onwards.  She did her best to learn French, but the complexity of her dyslexia in that area made it impossible for her to do so.</p> <p>This student's school has informed her that she will still be able to get her six subjects for her leaving certificate.  When the language choices are excluded, however, six subjects are not available to her.  She can do English and mathematics.  She cannot do Irish, French and German because they are the areas from which her dyslexia exempts her.  She has tried her best to learn them, but she is unable to do so.  She can do three other subjects in the science area, in which she excels.  That brings her up to five.  She can also do the leaving certificate vocational programme, but the maximum number of points one can get from that programme is 70.  This means the maximum number of points that this gifted kid can get in her leaving certificate is 570.  I have met her and her family.  She is looking to achieve 100%, which is 600 points plus the bonus points for mathematics, if necessary.  No school in Galway will offer her that opportunity.  When she did a survey, she found that the only school in Galway which offers leaving certificate students the option of doing six subjects without having to do a language to achieve maximum points is St. Jarlath's College in Tuam.  As it is a boys school, obviously she cannot go there.</p> <p>This issue applies to this child and to other children.  Her options do not fit with the criteria required for universities in this country.  She cannot access six subjects with an opportunity to get 100 points in each.  When members of her family queried this problem with the principal in her school, she was told she would sit in study for the spare classes and she would have to finance a tutor to do the extra subject privately.  They came across the same issue when they approached other schools.  Most of the schools approached make their students take a foreign language at pass level, which allows them to access a maximum of 60 points for that subject, or facilitate them in taking an additional subject privately.  This child is being home tutored at the moment.  I want to keep stressing that she is a gifted high achiever.  She does not see the point in sitting out so many classes in school.  She is getting help at home at the moment, but it is not an ideal situation.</p> <p>A comprehensive survey was done of Presentation College in Tuam; St. Jarlath's College in Tuam, which is the boys school I mentioned; the Mercy Secondary School in Tuam; McHale College in Tuam; Presentation College in Headford; Calasanctius College in Oranmore; the Jesuit school in Galway; St. Enda's College in Galway; Salerno Secondary School in Galway; Taylor's Hill college in Galway; the Presentation Secondary School in Galway; Mercy College in Galway, St. Mary's College in Galway; St. Joseph's College in Galway; Presentation College Athenry; and Athenry VEC.  The only one of those schools that offers this opportunity to its students is a boys school.  Consequently, the conclusion to be reached is that girls with dyslexia are not treated fairly or equally.  There is no equity when it comes to the availability of six subjects at leaving certificate level, which would enable students to try to get maximum points.  The leaving certificate vocational programme is available but, as I have said, it does not allow her to get more than 70 points.  I would like to come to the solution.  It was said to me quite recently that the problem is that an increasing number of children are getting a diagnosis that allows them to be exempted from languages.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fidelma Healy Eames:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2223"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2223&amp;amp;pid=FidelmaHealyEames&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is causing a knock-on effect, and schools that have experienced a cut in resources have not realised the implications this has on students' entry to third level because they think the LCVP will cover the gap.  The solution is that one school in a central location such as Galway city should be assigned to offer additional subject for children with dyslexia who are exempted from languages.  That is the best solution, because otherwise there is not equal access for all children, particularly girls.  There is only one school in County Galway which is based in Tuam, that can meet this gap.  It is St. Jarlath's, which is an all-boys' school.  I look forward to the Minister of State's reply.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-04-15a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1078" speakername="Damien English" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015041500002#C00200"><p>I thank the Senator for the opportunity to outline to the House the position on teaching resources for post-primary schools.  My colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, could not attend and she sends her apologies.  I am happy to give feedback on her behalf.</p> <p>Teacher allocations to all second level schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment.  The criteria for the allocation of posts are communicated to school management annually and are available on the Department's website.  The teacher allocation for all schools includes provision for the learning and language support needs of the pupils in them.  I recognise that teacher allocations set the parameters in respect to the number of subjects on offer in schools.  However, the deployment of teaching staff in the school, the range of subjects offered and, ultimately, the quality of teaching and learning are in the first instance a matter for the school management authorities.  Sharing arrangements between post-primary schools can help to ensure the range of subjects available to pupils is maximised.  The Senator suggested one school for this.  I am not sure whether the schools to which she referred have explored the option of sharing resources but the option is open to them.  This, however, is usually co-ordinated at school level and it is not dictated to them by the Department.</p> <p>If schools have difficulties with providing individual subjects - for example, because of the retirement of a teacher in one of the subjects concerned, short-term support is provided through the curricular concessions process to enable them to meet their curricular needs.  The detail of this process is set out with the criteria for the allocation of posts and is also available on the Department website.  The allocation process also includes an appeals mechanism under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules.  The appeal procedures are set out in the published staffing arrangements.  The appeals board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p> <p>It is important to note that additional teaching resources have been provided to schools to cater for increased demographics and also to provide for pupils with special needs.  During the past two years, teacher numbers have increased by approximately 2,300.  Budget 2015 includes provision for 1,700 additional teachers and SNAs in our schools in the coming school year.  This is a significant investment at a time of scarce resources.  The challenge for all our schools is to maximise what is achieved with the resources that are provided to them and to cover as many subjects as possible.  The Government's approach to restoring the economy has helped Ireland to return to a position where we are experiencing economic growth.  A continuing improvement in our economic growth over a sustained period will enable us to move to a point where we can look again at providing for additional teacher resources in schools, which could bring about an improvement in the pupil-teacher ratio, class size, support for classroom teachers and increased subject choice.</p> <p>While there has been a moratorium on recruitment across other sectors in the public service, this has not applied to teaching, which shows the commitment this Government has to educating our future generations. The main priority for any additional resources for the foreseeable future will be to cater for the continuing increase in demographics at all levels in the education system, which the Senator has raised in the House on many occasions.  We are determined that education should be prioritised for investment as the recovery in our economy strengthens.</p> <p>Subject choice is up to each school locally.  Perhaps the Senator might inquire if they have communicated among themselves to provide a solution.  I will raise the issue with the Minister and pass on the solution she has suggested as well.</p></speech>

I accept that he has acknowledged the solution.  I did not say this in my initial contribution, but this family has been on to the Minister twice about this issue.

I will discuss the case, on which I do not have all the details, with officials to ascertain if the Department can provide any help on this matter.  It appears, however, that it could probably be resolved with some co-operation at local level.  In general, the Department does not dictate to schools what subjects they offer.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-04-15a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1173" speakername="Lorraine Higgins" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015041500002#D00400"><p>I am raising the approach of the National University of Ireland Galway, NUIG, to gender among its academic ranks.  The Minister of State may be aware that in December 2014, an NUIG academic, Dr. Micheline Sheehy Skeffington, won an Equality Tribunal case against the university for discrimination on the basis of gender in the 2009 round of promotions to senior lecturer.  Dr. Sheehy Skeffington is the first female academic to have achieved this outcome in Ireland.</p> <p>One of the consequences of the case was the establishment of a task force to deal with gender equality in the university.  Since then, the university's hiring policies and general staff promotion systems have come under scrutiny, which has been warranted, and many staff and students as well as the trade union are deeply dissatisfied and concerned about how the newly-convened task force will function.  SIPTU, for example, has advised its members on the NUI Galway campus not to co-operate with the task force as it has not engaged in consultations about its establishment.  The trade union went as far as describing the task force as "an effort to waste time in the hope that the issue will blow over, and with the expectation that the results from their handpicked panel will, in all essentials, be a whitewash".</p> <p>Among SIPTU's concerns, which are echoed by Dr. Sheehy Skeffington and her many supporters among the staff and students of NUI Galway, are that the task force lacks transparency and was not independently constituted and that no assurances have been given with regard to confidentiality.  This lack of buy-in by those who are close to the issue raises serious questions about the suitability of the task force as it stands.  While I have no doubt that all parties to the problem wish to see it resolved, the issue has been greatly exacerbated by the decision, as reported in a local Galway newspaper, by the chair of the governing body of NUI Galway to decline to meet elected representatives and Oireachtas Members to discuss their concerns about gender equality issues at the university. </p> <p>Despite everything that has gone before, I welcome the recent remarks made by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, in which she asserted that proper consultation between concerned parties is required if the task force is to be effective.  I hope that in the event that NUI Galway fails to address the concerns of many people regarding the effectiveness of the task force, the Minister will continue to exert her influence in the matter.</p> <p>On the issue of gender discrimination, it is clear that a cultural change is needed in NUI Galway and perhaps across the third level sector.  To change this culture, we must face up to it, however awkward it may be to do so.  An ineffectual and unrepresentative task force at this juncture will simply kick the can further down the road.  All of the women at NUI Galway, both former and current and including academics, students and support staff, as well as women across the third level sector deserve equality of opportunity, no more and certainly no less.  They have waited for long enough and deserve positive and determined action on this issue.</p> <p>The Minister must give a commitment that she will continue to exert her influence on this critical matter in NUI Galway in respect of procedures.  If we do not have faith in promotional opportunities and procedures at a third level institution, it will be a sad reflection on the students who come forward in years to come. </p></speech>

The Minister apologises as she could not be present for this discussion.  I acknowledge the serious shortcomings identified by the Equality Tribunal in its ruling last November.  Discrimination against women in the workplace is unacceptable in any setting and the issues brought to light in the case in question are of serious concern to me and the Minister.  For this reason, we have welcomed the response of NUI Galway in unreservedly accepting the ruling of the tribunal and establishing a task force to address related issues.  The membership of the task force, which I understand met for the first time at the end of March, has the breadth of experience and expertise required to allow it to comprehensively examine all of the issues involved.  It is now the responsibility of NUI Galway to engage with the student body and staff to ensure the task force has the broadest possible support for its important work.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Senator stated that is not the case and that there is not broad support for it.  We have to address that, and we must get buy-in from all parties on this if its work is to be successful in the long term.  Furthermore, we are satisfied that the ability of the task force to set its own terms of reference, and to operate independently of the management of the university, will allow it to provide strong and insightful advice on policies and practices relating to gender equality issues directly to the university's governing authority.<br/><br/>The requirement for gender equality is well-established in legislation.  The Higher Education Authority, HEA, has a specific legislative role in &quot;promoting the attainment of equality of opportunity in higher education&quot;.  The Universities Act 1997 and the Institutes of Technology Act 2006 require our higher education institutions to promote gender balance and equality of opportunity among students and staff, and to prepare and implement statements of policy in respect of equality, including gender equality, across all of their activities.  The HEA has a role in reviewing these policies across the higher education sector and is keeping the situation in NUI Galway under review.<br/><br/>More broadly, and as the Minister, Deputy O'Sullivan, noted in a previous discussion on this issue here in the Seanad on 10 March, the Higher Education Authority is actively considering how best to support the improvement of gender equality across the Irish higher education system as a whole and is developing a database of staff employed in the sector so that we can ensure gender equality at all levels within the academic profession in Ireland becomes a reality.<br/><br/>The data shows that here in Ireland women represent 43% of academic staff in the universities and institutes of technology but only 21% of professors and associate professors in universities are female.  It is clear, therefore, that ensuring the fair representation and career progression of female academics is an issue which needs to be addressed.  However, we also know that this is not a problem that is unique to Ireland.  The European Commission's 2012 report, Gender in Research and Innovation,<i></i>showed that across the EU member states, women represented only 20% of professorial staff.  That is often a subject of discussion at our European Council meetings also.  It is being recognised across Europe that it is an issue that must be addressed, and it will be addressed.<br/><br/>I would also like to acknowledge the positive role that initiatives such as the Athena Swan charter can play in ensuring that women receive the recognition they deserve in our higher education institutions and I am very pleased that all seven universities and 14 institutes of technology have signed up to this important initiative.<br/><br/>Returning to the particular situation in NUI Galway, I would urge all of the relevant stakeholders, including staff, the students and the unions, to engage as constructively as possible with the task force to ensure that it can succeed in its important work.  The Senator stressed that there is not that co-operation.  That is something we have to try to work on, and we might consult with her on that also.</p></speech>

It is important that we acknowledge the shortcomings of this task force, in particular issues regarding transparency, as I outlined earlier, the independence of the body and assurances to the academics regarding their confidentiality.  It is imperative that the students and also members of academia have confidence in this task force.  To move this matter forward I ask the Minister of State to ask his senior Minister, Deputy O'Sullivan, to try to facilitate a meeting between the public representatives and the members of the governing authority of the university.  That is imperative if we are to iron out issues and move the matter forward.</p></speech>

I raise the issue mainly on behalf of the countless city and county councillors, the lifeblood of local democracy, who have approached me on this subject.</p> <p>Councillors are paid a representational payment of &euro;16,590, described as a salary type payment, which is subject to deductions including PAYE, the pension levy, the universal social charge, USC, and PRSI at 4%.  For most councillors these deductions will mean a take-home payment of a little over &euro;8,000 per annum plus fixed allowances for travel and membership of committees, where appropriate.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2402"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2402&amp;amp;pid=GerardPCraughwell&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Unlike their non-officeholding counterparts in industrial, commercial and service-type employment, however, who are employed under a contract of service and who also pay 4% PRSI class A, local authority councillors get no benefits whatsoever from their contributions.  For the same 4% level of contribution, those in class A get jobseeker's benefit, illness benefit, maternity benefit, adoptive benefit, health and safety benefit, invalidity pension, widow, widower's or surviving civil partner's contributory pension, guardian's payment, contributory State pension, treatment benefit, occupational injuries benefit, carer's benefit and access to schemes such as the community employment scheme, having served their community and, perhaps, not been re-elected.  The disparity between the two groups could not be more stark.  It is a case of everything versus nothing at all.<br/><br/>I am aware of the historical development of this situation and that up to 2011, officeholders, including Members of this House, did not have to pay PRSI.  I am also aware that the Social Insurance Fund currently has a significant shortfall in income compared with expenditure and therefore I believe that the widening of the social insurance net to include officeholders is welcome and fair.  However, it is both unwelcome and unfair that those new contributors do not get any benefit from their contributions.  It is discriminatory and flies in the face of everything we hold true about equality and justice.<br/><br/>The Minister may argue that the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 provides that there are two categories of persons who are compulsorily insured - employed contributors and self-employed contributors - and that councillors are neither.  They do not have a contract of employment and what is generally understood as a master-servant relationship where the worker is subject to direction, control and dismissal, but neither are they self-employed.  They have a unique status as public representatives, but why should they be penalised for being so?<br/><br/>I am not alone in expressing these views.  In 2011, the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar told the <i>Irish Examiner</i>newspaper that he believed it was always wrong that politicians did not pay PRSI and that he had no difficulty with paying it.  However, he went on to state: &quot;[I]t&rsquo;s unfair that there is no benefit accruing.  There are many different classes of PRSI, but we are now the only ones who pay and get nothing back.&quot;<br/><br/>In explaining the Government's decision to include officeholders in the PRSI scheme, the former Minister, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, cited the solidarity principle of the Social Insurance Fund as a reason.  According to internationally and nationally accepted definitions, the solidarity principle stems directly from the recognition of the individual's right to social security protection.  The principle of solidarity is what justifies the existence of social security schemes in the first place and ensures that most vulnerable categories of citizens enjoy access to the social protection they require.  However, while officeholders are upholding their side of the solidarity principle by paying 4% PRSI, the State is not upholding its side of the same principle because the charge will not generate any subsequent benefit entitlement.<br/><br/>The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, speaking at the launch in September 2012 of the 2010 actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund, stated:<blockquote>A core principle of sustainable social insurance systems in advanced economies is that citizens receive benefits in proportion to their contributions.  I am very pleased that the philosophy of social insurance which is based on solidarity continues to hold true.</blockquote>Sadly, in the case of city and county councillors, this does not hold true.  The Minister, Deputy Burton, went on to state, &quot;Social insurance offers excellent value for those on lower incomes, people with shorter working lives&quot;.  It might be worth pointing out here that quite a number of councillors are now unemployed or are stay-at-home housewives or house husbands, having devoted their entire lives to their councils.  We must remember that the solidarity principle applies not only to those on low income but also to all those who, through the occurrence of social risks, lose a substantial portion of their earning capacities.<br/><br/>As politicians we all will be aware-----</p></speech>

Their job as a city or county councillor is their sole occupation.</p><p>Following the passing of the Local Government Reform Act 2014, councillors with an enlarged workload and extended electoral areas now spend even more time fulfilling their public office obligations, leaving less time for other paid employment.  Most councillors make a lifetime commitment to the people they represent and are elected for many decades of their working lives.</p><p>In return for this and the PRSI they pay, they will never get anything back.  We use the phrase &ldquo;a career in politics" but who would want a career outside the protections of the Social Insurance Fund while contributing throughout that career to it?  This exclusion is particularly relevant in the context of changes to the national pensions framework.  We all know the qualifying conditions for State pensions include a standardisation in the State pension age at 66.  Some councillors of 66 years of age are still paying 4% in PRSI.</p><p>Where will this leave councillors of the present and future who, having contributed for their entire career, will have no pension entitlements?  Christy Burke, Lord Mayor of Dublin, with over 30 years&rsquo; service, will have nothing to show for it.  Where does it leave those who take extended career breaks to take up mayoral or cathaoirleach positions in local authorities?  Where will it leave those who find themselves unemployed following elections?  Where will it leave women who are encouraged to enter politics in increasing numbers?  It is a well-documented fact that women are traditionally known to have reduced contributions due to time spent at home caring for children.  Women are now being disadvantaged as councillors as their time spent in the service to the public will not help them to accumulate one single PRSI contribution.</p><p>The argument can be put forward that a gratuity is provided for when councillors reach the age of 50.  This, however, does not provide for them for the rest of their lives in the way a contributory pension does.  When I recently attended a 1916 commemoration event, I was reminded again that the Proclamation declared, "The Republic guarantees religious and civil liberty, equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens".  Elected members of local authorities are not only citizens.  They are also citizens who devote hundreds of hours every week in service of their electorate and communities.  By ensuring democratic accountability, encouraging active citizenship and developing valuable local services, city and county councillors provide the cornerstone for our democratic State.  Discrimination against them is blatant and unnecessary.</p><p>Today, I appeal to the Minister of State, on behalf of all officeholders, particularly on behalf of our hardworking and dedicated city and county councillors, to revisit this issue and to address it as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

I have also had extensive engagement on this issue with Senator Denis Landy and Dublin City Councillors Mary Freehill and Dermot Lacey, who is in the Gallery.  It is not a popular subject to raise and I compliment the Senator on raising it.  He certainly will not get any brownie points with the public for raising this important issue.</p> <p>Many councillors who work full-time for their constituents will be severely disadvantaged when they reach retirement age because they have not picked up enough contributions for their pension fund.  I accept the gratuity in itself does not compensate for the hours of dedication and work they have given.  Not many people in the public would understand the long hours put in by councillors, especially if one represents a disadvantaged area.  One very much becomes a full-time advocate for the people one represents, often in difficult circumstances.  I am glad the Senator pointed out that what is not often understood by the general public is that some councillors are financially disadvantaged by representing people in their area because they come from higher paid jobs in the private sector.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Kevin Humphreys:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2289"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Even councillors who work full-time give up career opportunities such as promotions.  What person working in the private sector would give somebody a promotion knowing that person works long hours representing the people?  Other councillors feel duty-bound when elected and by no means see it as an advancement.  They are dedicated and want to work in local government.  It would be very difficult to live on a full-time salary of &euro;16,000 plus.  I have had several meetings with different groups in this regard and I wish I could report progress but I have not made much.  The Senator knows me long enough to know that I say it as I see it.</p><p>Some of the following issues have been touched on by the Senator.  City and county councillors are regarded as public officeholders for the purpose of charging PRSI.  They are not employees and are not subject to the contribution applying to employees.  PRSI charges on officeholders were introduced in budget 2011 and apply to public officers such as the President, Members of the both Houses, the Judiciary, the Attorney General, the Comptroller and Auditor General and city and county councillors.  There is a very big difference between the salaries paid to the first group I mentioned and city and county councillors.   From 1 January 2011, public officeholders pay PRSI on their incomes at the class K rate of 4%, providing their income exceeds &euro;5,200.  This is &euro;100 per week, which is not an awful lot.  All public officeholders are liable to pay the contribution, regardless of age.  People with incomes of less than &euro;100 per week do not pay PRSI and return their income under the PRSI class M stamp.  PRSI payments by officeholders do not contribute towards establishing social insurance entitlements prior to 2011.  All officeholders were exempt from PRSI on income received in their capacity as officeholders, which the Senator outlined in his contribution.  The income and consequential pension and retirement gratuities paid to officeholders are funded by the Exchequer.  The PRSI charges on officeholders' income were introduced as a measure of solidarity.  It was seen that public representatives from the very high to the very low would take an income hit and this is what happened.</p><p>City and county councillors may establish an entitlement to social security benefits based on non-council related activities.  Many councillors have their own businesses or are able to stay in employment and they keep their entitlement.  However, as the Senator outlined, a number of councillors work full-time and are, therefore, not entitled to these benefits after many years of service.  The public does not appreciate the sacrifices many county and city councillors make.  It is certainly not for financial advancement.  During my time on local authorities, I did not meet many wealthy councillors.  They do it because of their dedication to the community.  They often enter politics and local authorities through community activities and want to make their communities better.  </p><p>There is a voluntary contribution system that helps in respect of pension entitlements and there are quite restrictive limitations.  I participated in that system, which is probably one of the best investments I ever made.  When I became an elected councillor, I read Barry Desmond's biography in which he said that from the time he entered full-time politics, he paid his voluntary contributions which then gave him his entitlement.  This was only to the old age contributory pension and not to any unemployment benefit.  Many councillors from all parties and none have faced extreme financial difficulties.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Kevin Humphreys:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2289"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Given that their salaries were not high, they had not accumulated savings and found themselves in very severe financial difficulties.  Senator Landy has been engaging, not in a party sense but on behalf of everybody, and he is determined to continue to try to come forward with a resolution.  If the Senator wishes to participate in this, I am happy to work with him and see if we can find a solution.  Unfortunately, in many such cases, when one amends the Social Welfare Acts, there are unintended consequences.  Therefore it must be considered very carefully.</p><p>I wish I were coming here with good news.  I am not, and I do not want to spread false hope.  I am happy to work with Senators and councillors to see if we can find some kind of solution that does not have unintended consequences.  It must be limited and must target the councillors who are most disadvantaged.  Councillors who can remain in full-time work, have their own businesses or who work in the legal or education sectors are different.  This is a small group that is particularly damaged.  They contribute but receive nothing.  I take the Senator's points and thank him for raising them.  While I cannot give a promise, I will work with interested parties to see if we can reach a fair resolution.</p></speech>

It is a difficult issue to raise here, given that to be in public service is almost regarded as a crime.  I am not afraid to say these people are being treated very badly by the State.  In anticipation of the Minister of State's answer, I have already alerted the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection that I will be proposing a debate on this.  People who are tied up with council work suffer a serious career disadvantage.  We have let our councillors down extremely badly.  Although some time ago, we promised to align their salaries with those of Senators, we have not done it.  We are taking 4% out of their pockets, for which they receive nothing.  We must devise an opt-in solution by which a councillor who is not employed and does not have an independent source of income can opt in for a class A stamp.  It will cost them no more.  It is an outrage to take 4% from somebody and give them nothing in return.  The Minister of State is a man of his word and is always willing to try to achieve results, as is Senator Landy.  I am very happy to join him and work on this.  I call on councillors to lobby for this.  Let us not be ashamed of the fact that we are serving the State and that we are entitled to some recompense for it.</p></speech>

They do an extremely tough and thankless job and are often blamed for decisions that are made in these Houses rather than in the local chamber.  A councillor is the face of democracy, and people often vent at them in the wrong manner when they bump into them on the street.  The position of councillor is very undervalued.  We do not speak highly enough of the public service local councillors do throughout the country.  I thank the Senator for raising the issue.</p></speech>

Over the Easter recess I found out that a grand total of five houses have been remediated under the Government scheme, which has been up and running for almost two years and accepting applications for more than 12 months.  At the time I welcomed the scheme as a start, but I stated that it was inadequate and too cumbersome.  The Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, got quite excited on the radio over the Easter break.  I was not being personally critical of him; I just stated that the fact of the matter is the scheme is too slow and that hundreds of thousands of homeowners who require the State's assistance because HomeBond and the quarries were allowed to walk away by the former Minister, Phil Hogan, were left with this scheme, which has fixed five homes.  This is the reality.  We need to debate this and I ask the Leader to schedule time with either the Minister of State or the Minister for a response.  Perhaps he has already done so.  The Minister, Deputy Kelly, was particularly critical of me.  Both lads seemed to take it very personally.  I thought they would be bigger than that, but obviously they are not.</p> <p>Is it true that an additional &euro;7 million has been allocated to active staff in the Dublin Airport Authority to go towards their pensions?  While I would welcome this, I wonder why those being hit even harder than anyone else - namely, the deferred pensioners, who have taken cuts of up to 60% - have had no additional funds to reduce the cuts to their pensions.  I remind Members that it was the first time in the history of the State that any Government introduced legislation to change a specific private pension scheme to reduce pensions and payments to retired members by six weeks per annum, to reduce long-term deferred members' pensions by up to 60% and, without permission, to transfer existing members to an inferior pension scheme.  This bodes ill for all other pension schemes, because the Government has set a precedent.</p> <p>I want to know whether this is this true.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Darragh O'Brien:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2178"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Was an extra &euro;7 million secured by the unions for active staff members over 54 years of age?

It is estimated that approximately 100,000 people turned out in the city centre of Dublin to take part in this commemoration of the social and historical context to the period leading up to the Rising.  It was a most innovative idea to commemorate 1915, the year before the big centenary commemoration next year.  The numbers who turned out and the success of the event show the great public appetite for this sort of commemoration, which emphasises the social and historical aspects and the political context rather than focusing exclusively on the military side.  The military aspect was illustrated by actors on the streets in the uniforms of British soldiers, who would have been on the streets of Dublin in 1915.</p><p>We might usefully have another debate in this House in due course on the centenary events for next year and the idea of commemorations more generally.  We have had such debates in this House before but, in light of the immense success of the very innovative and novel event last week and the publication the week before Easter of the Government's programme for commemoration, it would be timely to have another on this matter.  I welcomed in this House, as did others, the allocation of funding to preserve the building on Moore Street, which is of such historical significance, because it is where the leaders of the Rising met.  There are further proposals on the table for buildings on Moore Street.  I would like to include that in any debate we have in this House on commemoration.</p><p>I ask the Leader for a debate on sentencing and criminal justice, particularly in light of the publication today by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, of the general scheme of the criminal justice (burglary of dwellings) Bill.  This Bill is being published in the context of great concern about repeat offenders engaging in multiple burglaries, including while on bail.  The Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality is likely to engage in pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill.  The substance of the Bill highlights other issues, including more general issues concerning sentencing, bail and the management of the criminal justice system.  I ask the Leader for a debate on that more general issue.</p><p>In the context of the marriage equality referendum, like many colleagues I was out canvassing on the &quot;Yes&quot; side over the break and got a very positive response.  I am very glad the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, has today clarified that there is absolutely no issue in terms of school funding.  The &quot;No&quot; side has been scaremongering somewhat about this.  There is absolutely no danger to funding for schools that hold an ethical position that is against the idea of marriage equality for same-sex couples.  I am glad that issue has been clarified and hope we will see red herrings like this and the conscientious objection clause being dealt with in the course of the debate.</p></speech>

The Leader told me the report would be published this week, which it was.  It is time for us to have a debate on this because those of us who took an active part in arguing against the abolition of the Seanad made a number of proposals, many of which are being included in the proposals of the Government or, at least, those being put together by former Members of this House.  The Government plans to introduce legislation to do something about this but I do not know whether this will happen immediately.  If we are to have an election before April of next year, it will be interesting to see how quickly the Government can actually move on Seanad reform.</p><p>I ask the Leader to find time to debate the concerns Age Action highlighted this week about the possible increase in nursing home charges.  It claims the proposal targets the sickest of older people and is fundamentally unfair because it is increasing the cost for those who cannot do anything about it.  This issue was mentioned on &quot;Prime Time&quot; last week.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Feargal Quinn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1972"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1972&amp;amp;pid=FergalQuinn&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It has not received any publicity but it is the sort of topic we should debate in the House.  If we are to conclude that residents of nursing homes will have to pay more, it seems the Government is once again singling out the weakest and those in the most difficult position.  To use the words of Age Action Ireland, it is fundamentally unfair.  We should debate the matter soon.</p></speech>

I also compliment the personnel from the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Irish Air Corps for the very many hours they gave to the matter.  It had a Bambi Bucket that was capable of holding 1,000 litres of water with each trip from Killarney lakes.  These fire outbreaks were very serious, and during the few days in which they raged, they seriously threatened people and neighbouring areas.  They are a reminder to everybody that they should protect themselves and have regard for neighbours and other households in the vicinity.  Lighting fires in the open is extremely dangerous, as we know, and they are a very serious threat to the environment and wildlife.  Those fires are prohibited under wildlife legislation.</p> <p>Anybody who wishes to burn gorse and scrub in the open should do so only within permitted timescales.  They should also advise the fire services and, in cases like this, the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the intentions, including the time and location.  If these fires had taken hold, they could have wiped out much of the 26,000 acres in our foremost national park.  We can imagine what kind of a disaster that would have been.  I again compliment the personnel from the fire services, the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Irish Air Corps on their tremendous work.</p></speech>

I also raise the debacle of the launch of Ireland's Ancient East initiative by the Government yesterday morning.  In attempting to promote tourism in the east of the country and giving some alternative to the Wild Atlantic Way, it has botched the job, so the Minister should come here to explain himself.  There is no mention of Monasterboice and the only mention of Kells in County Meath relates to car parking facilities and the Hay Festival, which has nothing to do with the Government.  It is run by a voluntary group in Kells that has put  a great effort into it with very little funding or support from any outside body.  One can park a car in Kells but one would not find out about Monasterboice if taking this tour.  It is outrageous.  Kells was the centre of the ancient Christian world in this country in the medieval period.  The Book of Kells was probably written there and was certainly kept there for a number of centuries.  It is a fantastic ancient monastic centre.  The same applies to Monasterboice but I cannot find mention of it in the document.</p> <p>This is a debacle and whatever geniuses are responsible for drawing it up do not seem to know what they are talking about and the exact history of these areas.  They seem to have picked what they felt were the most high-profile sites.  The hill of Slane is given in a footnote at the end.  These are some of the most important ancient sites, and particularly the ancient Christian sites, which are referenced in a full section of the document in dealing with ancient Christian Ireland.  Monasterboice, Kells and the hill of Slane in particular are some of the most important ancient early Christian sites in Ireland.  They have not been given due regard.</p> <p>We are fighting as best we can to achieve a tourism product as there is a great deal of heritage in our area.  There is a significant range of sites that may be visited, history to be learned and buildings that can be appreciated.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Thomas Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2203"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2203&amp;amp;pid=ThomasByrne&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and this Government have done very little for that.</p></speech>

The reductions in variable mortgage interest rates have not been passed on to its customers.  I call on the Leader to invite the Minister for Finance to the House to tell us what progress he is making on the matter.  Some 320,000 people are affected by this.  Mr. Brian Hayes, MEP, has already said on the record that this should be investigated.  It is outrageous that when mortgage interest rates go down the bank can decide not to pass it on to its customers, but when mortgage interest rates increase that becomes effective from the following day.</p> <p>Second, can we invite the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to the House to address a range of problematic farming issues?  The issue of the young old farmers has not been resolved.  The Department would probably consider them to be old young farmers.  These are young farmers who have put big investments into their farms without any State support.  There is also the problematic issue of digital mapping in rural areas.  In some cases, the digital mapping shows rocky areas on the maps and farmers are being penalised as a result, yet if the inspectors arrive to inspect the area there are sheep grazing on it.  If the farmers decide to appeal the decisions made by the Department, they could wait 12 months to get their single farm payment.  That is wrong.  It is a rural Ireland issue and it is important that the Minister come to the House to deal with these matters.</p></speech>

Figures released by the Health Service Executive, HSE, to Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, the Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson on health, show that from 2009, when there were 7,850 fair deal beds, the number had dropped to 5,290 in December 2014.  When the figures are broken down on a constituency basis, many counties have seen a very significant drop in the availability of beds under the scheme.  Obviously, there is a problem and I ask that the Minister for Health be invited to the House to discuss it.  There is also the situation of over 400,000 people waiting on hospital waiting lists.  Many are waiting well over 12 months, even though the Government promised that outpatients would be seen in less than 12 months.  One can see that some departments in hospitals across the State are worse than others, but the figures released recently by the HSE show that a significant number of people are waiting longer than the 12 months that was promised by the Government.  I would appreciate if the Leader would arrange for the Minister for Health to come to the House to hear statements on these important matters.</p></speech>

There are 22,000 beds and it is costing &euro;970 million per year.  They are the figures.  The Senator has incorrect figures so he should check them.  That is the first point.</p> <p>Second, with regard to the fair deal scheme, it is interesting to note that the scheme involves 80% of people's income and 7.5% of people's assets, to a maximum cap of three years.  My understanding is that the amount of money recovered from estates, and the fair deal scheme has been up and running since 2009, is approximately &euro;7.5 million over a 12 month period.  That is &euro;7.5 million recovered out of a total of &euro;970 million spent.  I refer to assets, not income.  The issue that must be raised here is what level of security the HSE is putting in place in respect of recovering that part of the funding under the scheme.</p> <p>The other issue I wish to raise is the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, agreement with the Department.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colm Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2353"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I welcome the agreement and I think it is the first step in the reform of the health system insofar as it concerns GPs.  It is a welcome development.  GPs make a huge contribution to health care but we need to take another step.  A pilot study that was recently carried out on accident and emergency units indicated that 30% of people who attended over the weekend could have been adequately treated by GPs rather than attending the accident and emergency unit.  The Department and HSE should examine how to work with GPs to ensure that more people attend their clinics rather than accident and emergency units.  There were over 1.1 million attendances at accident and emergency unit last year, and we must work to reduce pressure on the hospital service.  One way of doing so is to work closely with GPs, which we could deal with in a debate on the next occasion the Minister is in the Chamber.  It is a debate to which we should give serious consideration.</p></speech>

He was arrested in August 2013 and has been in prison for over 600 days.  His life is possibly in danger because there are 450 other prisoners held in that prison in Cairo.  Amnesty International is campaigning for his release.  The Government is aware of the situation and the Taoiseach has been contacted.  He is an Irish citizen who was 17 years of age in 2013 and is now 19.  I met his sister campaigning for his release outside Leinster House this morning.  His two sisters, who were in Cairo with him, were released in 2013.  His family are worried and concerned.  I would like to use the good offices of Seanad &Eacute;ireann to appeal to the Egyptian ambassador and the Government in Egypt to release an Irish citizen.

I am less sure about limiting to 10% the places reserved for children of past pupils.  The proposal that applications can only be accepted one year in advance needs to be discussed.  However, I am sure the matters can be ironed out in the course of the Bill going through the House.  In any event, it would be great if we could have the Minister in the Chamber in the next week to outline her position on the matter and, more generally, to debate that and other topical issues in education, particularly in the wake of the teacher conferences held during the Easter break.</p></speech>

He gave a public interview about them and suddenly found himself suspended.  I believe he has now been reinstated, but it is very troubling to me that the HSE elected that this gentleman be suspended from his duties pending an investigation.  I believe the decision was taken by the HSE and not at local level.</p> <p>I personally believe that people who work in the health services should have an absolute right to involve the public in debate about critical issues of policy.  An assumption is sometimes made by officials who run the health service that they are the only non-self-interested party in the entire portfolio of people who have opinions and power in the development of the health service.  I believe this is very sinister.  At the time of the Harney consulting contracts - I am sorry, am I allowed to say "Harney"?  At the time of the Harney consulting contracts ten years ago, I voiced grave concerns about the possibility of a gagging clause in the consultants' contract.  More recently, we successfully prevented any gagging clause from being inserted into the new GP contract.  I would be very troubled indeed if our nursing colleagues were being silenced or gagged, especially when they have representative positions.</p> <p>I want to take a moment to compliment the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, on addressing the law relating to sentencing for burglaries.  I ask her to consider redesignating the crime of breaking into and entering an occupied house as a crime against the person rather than a crime against property.  The act of breaking into a house where there may be a family, children or an old person should be regarded as a form of assault, even if no physical assault occurs because circumstances intervene.</p> <p>A few weeks ago I asked a question of the Leader which he was unfortunately unable to answer because he developed a very dry throat.  He had a coughing attack and was not able to give his usual very full and comprehensive answer to questions.  I hope he is feeling better.  I asked if the Government would consider the possibility, in view of the highly intimidatory, extra-judicial and extra-jurisdictional attempt by international tobacco companies to prevent our Government from exercising its right and duty to protect the health of its own citizens by introducing appropriate tobacco control legislation, of proscribing any company which seeks to subvert our democracy, legally or in any other way, as an illegal organisation in the same way it proscribed the organisations that murdered so many of our citizens during the conflict in Northern Ireland.  Would the Minister consider the possibility of introducing a referendum to make a very simple amendment to our Constitution to include a statement to the effect that the Constitution does not protect the right to tobacco commerce?  Tobacco companies would then exist at the pleasure of the elected legislature.</p></speech>

We have called on the Minister to tackle the problem of rising rents, in particular.  While the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection has promised increased spending on social housing, it takes time to come through the system.  Last year rents in Galway rose every quarter, amounting to a 7% increase over the year.  The result is that the monthly rental cost of a three-bedroom house in the city is in the region of &euro;853.  In addition to rising rents, particularly in east Galway, there is the problem of the lack of suitable rental accommodation for families.  There are rooms or a small flat here and there to rent but increasingly fewer suitable family homes.  A few days ago I met a young mother in Athenry who burst into tears at her conundrum which is that she and her family have been given notice, and after trying many estate agents, they could not find suitable accommodation.  These are people who are willing to pay good money for accommodation.  As the family have a little dog, she is worried they might have a difficulty in getting accommodation.  This may appear to be a small problem from a distance but upfront it is a real stress in people's lives.  The lady, if lucky to find accommodation, will certainly face a rent increase.  She would not mind that if only she could get accommodation.</p> <p>Galway County Council estimated in 2014 that there are 50 or so unfinished estates located in various towns throughout the county.  Happily, work has commenced on finishing some of the partially completed properties.  The owners of these estates are either the banks or, more commonly, NAMA.  The banks and NAMA are seeking to sell the properties-----</p></speech>

Ultimately they will be sold but in the short term we must seek to find ways to alleviate the crisis in the rental market.  That is the very least we should expect from a Government taking a co-ordinated approach to the problem.</p></speech>

I know of one individual who is going to court for the third time in 12 months with a view to getting his case heard.  He has had at least four years preparation going to court and at least another year to have his case heard.  The cost in terms of taking time off work and engaging solicitors and so on is significant.  While I understand the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, has committed to reviewing the personal injuries board to ensure greater efficiency, will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, to come to the House to debate the issue of the personal injuries list?  Too many cases are listed at every sitting.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Hildegarde Naughton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2395"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2395&amp;amp;pid=HildegardeNaughton&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The fact is that a large number of them are actually settled on the steps of the courthouse.  That creates a huge backlog of people waiting for their cases to be heard and there are costs involved in that.  There is no incentive to have these cases settled in advance.  The people of Galway and elsewhere are greatly disadvantaged by these waiting lists.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister here to review the personal injuries list to ensure it is better managed and that we have a more efficient process going through our courts.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-04-15a.73" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1165" speakername="Eamonn Coghlan" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015041500002#V00200"><p>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh.  I wish to pay tribute to two great Dubs.  One is the Irish soccer legend Ray Treacy who sadly passed away over the weekend after a short illness.  He was a great legend in Irish soccer and was capped 42 times.  He played with Shamrock Rovers and with Home Farm in Dublin.  We have also had the sad and sudden passing this afternoon of Dave Billings who won an all-Ireland senior football medal with Dublin in 1974.  He made great contributions to GAA with Dublin, with St. Vincent's and with UCD.</p> <p>I would like to echo my support for the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, bringing a memo to the Cabinet to change legislation and crack down on burglaries.  We need tougher measures.  For too long, those who have had two or more charges have been able to get released on bail.  Times are changed now.  They cannot just serve concurrent sentences, these sentences must be consecutive.  The Minister is demanding action but more importantly the people are demanding action on this and will have the support of the House.  </p> <p>Over the Easter break I had the pleasure of looking at a drone in action around the Liffey Valley Park.  We know drones do surveillance work and we see them in war situations, but now we are seeing them more in pleasure pursuits.  While this drone flew across the Liffey Valley, under the M50 bridge, I was able to view it on an i-Pad.  The views it captured were quite incredible.  I asked the person qualified to fly this drone how far it could travel? I was told it could go in a 2 km radius north, south, east or  west.  I asked about vertical distance.  He replied that it could also go 2 km up into the sky.  This could present serious problems for aircraft in the area, either a helicopter or a low-flying plane going in to Weston Aerodrome.  If the drone was to become caught in the engines of a plane there would be serious trouble.  I understand there are air-traffic control restrictions on heights that things can fly, but while one needs skill to fly a drone there is no reason I would not be refused if I went online or into a shop to buy a drone.  We need to give serious consideration to and debate the danger these drones can pose for air traffic.  It needs to be brought to the attention of the appropriate Department to establish what restrictions can be put in place when purchasing these drones which are very dangerous if misused.</p></speech>

The Government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade are doing everything possible behind the scenes to secure his release.  I pay tribute to the ambassador and the staff at the Irish Embassy in Cairo for their work in trying to secure Mr. Halawa's release.  It is a traumatic time for the family and we all want to see him released as a matter of urgency.</p> <p>I welcome the Government's approval for the criminal justice (burglary of dwellings) Bill, brought forward by Minister for Justice, Deputy Fitzgerald.  The draft Bill will now go to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality for pre-legislative scrutiny.  I ask the Leader to arrange a discussion with the Minister in this House before the Bill is published.  The Bill recognises that the home of every citizen is sacred.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael Mullins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2368"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2368&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMullins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is where we should all feel safe.  Burglary is particularly traumatic for the victim and in many instances, as Senator Crown has said, it can result in serious injury and even death to our citizens.  Many of these burglaries are carried out by serial offenders.  Significant deterrents must be put in place.  The issue of bail for repeat offenders must be addressed, as must the short sentences that are being handed out in many cases when a significant number of repeat offences are being taken into consideration.  This issue is quite complex.  There is a strong demand from the public that we would ensure, in so far as possible, that every citizen's home is safe and that people who are offending regularly, breaking into people's homes and terrifying citizens are dealt with in a strong and determined fashion.  I compliment the Minister on the work she has done to date, but we all need to assist her in making this legislation as strong as possible.</p></speech>

It is badly needed to make the public feel more secure in their homes.  It is an issue I have encountered on many occasions, especially among elderly people who do not necessarily feel in any way safe in their homes when there are repeat offenders, such as those who have been mentioned, burgling homes regularly.  I am glad to see this legislation will deal with that in a particular way.</p> <p>I was disgusted by the blatant sexist abuse the Minister for Education, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, was subjected to on the "We Won't Pay the Water Tax - Limerick" Facebook page recently.  The person who published the post also expressed a wish to throw her under a bus and there has been an alarming rise in the sexist online abuse several female politicians have been subjected to in recent times, including Senators Higgins and O'Donnell and myself, and probably others.  I recently had a threat of sexual violence made against me.  We are living in a society that rightly abhors racist abuse, online or otherwise.  The same level of abhorrence must be fostered against online sexist abuse against female politicians, which has risen exponentially in recent months.  A debate in this area, not just on sexist abuse against women online but also online abuse in general, would be useful.</p></speech>

She complimented the city council and all involved in that event over the Easter period and called for further debate on the Government programme for commemorations.  I am sure the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Humphreys, would be quite willing to come to the House to have that debate with us.</p> <p>Senator Bacik and others, especially Senators Mullins and Noone, spoke about the laws the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, intends to bring to the House, in particular the criminal justice (burglary of dwellings) Bill.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maurice Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2003"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2003&amp;amp;pid=MauriceCummins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It will target repeat offenders.

It may be as soon as that.  Certainly, we will be arranging the debate and I hope to have it, possibly, on 5 May.  I have not arranged it yet but perhaps the debate can take place before then.  Anyway, we will have the debate and I urge people to examine the proposals.  These are comprehensive proposals, mainly to do with the election of Seanad &Eacute;ireann rather than what goes on in the House, although there are some references to that as well.  Dr. Manning and other members of the group will be quite willing to come to the House.  I imagine we will welcome him to the House and that we will hold a comprehensive debate on the proposals in early course.</p> <p>Senator Quinn also raised the question of Age Action Ireland concerns about nursing homes changes.  My information is that currently there are no plans before the Government on this issue.  The question of the fair deal scheme has been raised by Senator Cullinane and Senator Burke.  I do not know where Senator Cullinane got his figures - he referred to 7,850 people.  As Senator Burke mentioned, a total of 22,000 people are in under the fair deal scheme currently, costing &euro;970 million.  Senator Burke made a good point on the assets that have been recovered to date since 2009, amounting to only &euro;7.5 million.  Certainly, that will have to be looked at in the context of funding.  I imagine this is something we can debate with the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, and I am sure she would be willing to come to the House.</p> <p>Senator Paul Coghlan spoke on the major fire in Killarney National Park.  He complimented the fire services, Air Corps and the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  He emphasised the need to be vigilant at all times in respect of fire.</p> <p>Senator Byrne commented on the Ireland's ancient east proposal announced by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Donohoe.  This is an exciting project similar to the Wild Atlantic Way.  I am informed that F&aacute;ilte Ireland has spent the past year, in consultation with the key stakeholders, working to develop the initiative, which is to include tourism attractions and businesses throughout the region.  Following much consultation and deliberation Ireland's ancient east will be crafted along four distinct thematic pillars: ancient Ireland; early Christian Ireland; medieval Ireland; and Anglo Ireland, including Ireland's great houses and gardens.</p> <p>All the area in the east and down in the south east will be covered under this initiative.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland's research suggests that an initiative along these thematic lines has the potential to deliver an extra 600,000 overseas visitors, tourism growth of over 20% in the region and an increase in visitor revenue of almost 25%, or &euro;950 million, in total by 2020.  It is an exciting project and I imagine it will have the same success that we witnessed with the Wild Atlantic Way.  I compliment everyone involved in launching this project.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maurice Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2003"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2003&amp;amp;pid=MauriceCummins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Senator Kelly called for further debate and an update from the Minister for Finance on mortgage interest rates.  He also called for a debate with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine on young old farmers and digital mapping.  I am sure the Minister will be quite willing to come to the House to discuss these issues.  He has dealt with old young farmers, as they are called, in the budget and Finance Act.  </p><p>I have dealt with the matters raised by Senators Cullinane and Burke.  Senator Burke welcomed the IMO agreement with the Department for GP treatment for children aged under six years.  This will be of great benefit to many hard-pressed families and has been welcomed by the vast majority of GPs.</p><p>Senators Leyden and Mullins referred to the Ibrahim Halawa case.  I gave a very comprehensive reply on the matter before the break.  The Irish ambassador in Cairo is monitoring the situation closely and representations have been made to the Egyptian ambassador and authorities on this case.  I can assure the Senators that the Government is doing everything possible to secure the release of the Irish citizen concerned.  </p><p>Senator Jim D'Arcy referred to the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill.  He welcomed many of its proposals while disagreeing with others.  He called on the Minister for Education and Skills to come to the House.  I can inform him that the Minister will come before the House next Wednesday to discuss the NCSE inclusion support services.  There will be an opportunity at that time and later to discuss matters with her.</p><p>It is obvious that Senator Crown enjoyed the break because he has raised five or six matters.  There was disagreement on psychiatric services between the gentleman in question and the HSE.  He was suspended, but has been reinstated.  I understand the dispute concerned staffing in a brand new state-of-the-art facility in Cork.  I am glad he has been reinstated and I hope any differences will be ironed out as a matter of urgency.</p><p>Senator Crown also referred to burglaries, which I addressed, and asked for them to be classified as crimes against a person rather than property.  They are matters we can discuss with the Minister if she comes before the House to deal with the draft Bill.</p><p>On international tobacco companies taking the Government to court regarding the laws we passed on tobacco, the Senator has novel ideas on proscribing such companies.  I am sure all avenues will be addressed and examined by the State in order to defend against such companies.  </p><p>Senator Sheahan referred to EU moneys and single farm payments that are paid to men and women with herd numbers.  Their names and addresses are being published and he feels it is a dangerous precedent.  I see his point, especially as we have discussed burglaries in many parts of the country.  I will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and see whether anything can be done.  </p><p>Senator Mullen referred to problems in the rental sector and the availability of suitable housing.  That is the reason the Government is putting &euro;1.5 billion into social housing over the next couple of years.  Major progress has been made on unfinished estates throughout the country.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maurice Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2003"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2003&amp;amp;pid=MauriceCummins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There will be an opportunity for local authorities under the new scheme that is in place to purchase and maybe complete these unfinished estates and use them for social housing.  A myriad of areas that were not available previously are now open to local authorities as they try to tackle the housing problems that exist in some parts of the country.  Unfortunately, we have an over-supply of houses in some other parts of the country.  I suppose it is contradictory to have major problems in major cities like Galway, Cork and Dublin at a time when there is an over-supply in many rural areas.  Unfortunately, during the boom houses were built in areas where nobody would go and live.</p><p>Senator Naughton spoke about the High Court backlog in Galway, especially in relation to personal injuries cases.  She called for more efficient management of these services.  While that is a matter for the Courts Service, I will certainly bring it to the attention of the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p><p>Senator Eamonn Coghlan mentioned two sportsmen who passed away recently.  Ray Treacy was a great international footballer.  I had the pleasure of seeing him score many goals for Ireland.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-04-15a.109" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1033" speakername="Kevin Humphreys" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015041500002#DD00400"><p>The main purpose of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2015 is to provide for the introduction of the new back-to-work family dividend to help jobseekers with families and lone parents to return to work or to increase the number of hours worked.  This measure will complete the implementation of the budget 2015 package of social protection improvements, which also included increases in child benefit and the living alone allowance which came into effect from the beginning of the year.  This Bill also provides for an extension of the one-parent family payment to lone parents who are eligible for the carer's allowance until their youngest child reaches 16 years of age and an extension of the jobseeker's allowance transitional arrangements to apply to all lone parents where the youngest child is between the ages of 7 and 13 years.</p> <p>All of these improvements have been made possible as a result of the many sacrifices that have been made by the Irish people and the difficult choices that have been made by the Government to successfully tackle the unprecedented economic and banking crisis.  This has delivered an economic recovery that is gaining real momentum, and we are now seeing the benefits of this.</p> <p>The Exchequer statement for the first quarter of the year confirms the progress that has been made in restoring order to the public finances.  With tax revenues nearly 5.5% ahead of target, this is real evidence of the increase in the number of jobs being created.</p> <p>The Central Bank has estimated GDP growth of 4.8% last year, with a further increase of 3.8% this year.  The recovery in the economy has become more balanced over the past year, with the beginning of a recovery in consumer spending, which is showing signs of gradually strengthening.</p> <p>The quarterly national household survey figures published earlier in the year show that the number of people in work has increased by 90,000 since we introduced our strategies to create jobs and reduce unemployment.  A particularly welcome aspect of this increase in employment is that it is largely made up of full-time work.  There was an increase of almost 40,000 people working full time last year alone.  Total employment now stands at well over 1.9 million, the highest level in five years.</p> <p>The latest live register figures for March show a continued decline in the number of people out of work, as the unemployment rate fell to 10%.  This represents the lowest number of people signing on since February 2009.  Most encouragingly, the latest figures show that the number of long-term unemployed has fallen to just over 160,000, a reduction of nearly 11% in the past year.  However, unemployment remains too high and we still have progress to make in getting people back into employment.</p> <p>Helping people return to work is probably the key goal driving everybody in this House.  Having a job is the best protector against poverty and I am particularly encouraged by the fact that the vast majority of people returning to work are returning to full-time jobs.  The longer one is out of work, the harder it is to get back into the workforce.  Every new job for someone who has been out of work is a new future for his or her family and a boost to the community.  The recent quarterly national household survey figures clearly demonstrate the continuing success of the Government's twin-track approach to creating jobs and helping people return to work.</p> <p>Pathways to Work is ensuring that as many as possible of those newly-created jobs go to those on the live register, especially those who are long-term unemployed or at risk of becoming long-term unemployed.  Through the provision of return-to-work supports, training and education, those on the live register are ready to avail of the growing number of jobs being created every month.  The Action Plan for Jobs is helping accelerate that transition to a sustainable, jobs-rich economy.</p> <p>The Pathways to Work strategy sets out a comprehensive reform of the State's approach to helping unemployed jobseekers return to work.  Since its inception in 2012, the Pathways to Work strategy has seen the State's employment and entitlement services being brought together into one-stop shop Intreo centres.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Kevin Humphreys:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2289"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Group information sessions and individual profiling are fully operational in all of the Department's offices.  Last year, the Department provided group information sessions to 186,000 jobseekers, including 56,000 long-term unemployed jobseekers.  It also conducted initial one-to-one guidance interviews with 169,000 jobseekers.</p><p>In addition, we have introduced and enhanced a range of schemes and programmes in recent years to assist those out of work.  These include the introduction of the JobsPlus and Gateway programmes, as well as the development of the First Steps youth development initiative and JobsPlus youth programmes which are specifically tailored for young unemployed people.  Since 2012, 62,000 long-term unemployed jobseekers have moved into employment and we are on track to reach our 2015 target of 75,000.</p><p>As Minister of State with responsibility for employment, community and social support, I have a particular focus on reducing the number of people out of work for over a year.  In this regard, my Department continually reviews its supports for jobseekers to ensure they do not act as a disincentive to taking up work or increasing the number of hours worked.  The Department's engagement in this area has clearly demonstrated the great majority of social welfare recipients have a strong financial incentive to take up employment, disproving the misconception that one is not financially rewarded for going back to work.  These findings are supported by the work of the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, which confirms that work pays more than welfare for almost six out of seven unemployed people.  These findings hold true even when in-work costs such as child care and travel to work are taken into account.  This evidence clearly shows if we can create jobs, people will leave the welfare system to take up work.</p><p>However, it is reasonable that families who have been struggling while out of work for long periods will be concerned about the potential implications of moving from welfare to work, particularly when they have children.  This is where the back-to-work family dividend comes in.  Put simply, the scheme will allow a family returning to work to retain the child related element of their welfare payment, known as the qualified child increase, for two years.  The dividend will be paid at a standard weekly rate of &euro;29.80 per child, subject to a maximum overall weekly payment of &euro;119.20 per week in the first year.  The rate payable in the second year will be half the rate payable in the first year, subject to a maximum overall weekly payment of &euro;59.60.  Accordingly, over the two-year payment period, the dividend will be worth &euro;2,324 in the case of a one-child family, &euro;4,649 in the case of a two-child family, &euro;6,973 in the case of a three-child family and &euro;9,298 in the case of a family with four or more children.</p><p>This will mean, for example, that with the support provided through the family income supplement and the back-to-work family dividend, a person with a partner and four children who gets a job paying the minimum wage will be better off by some &euro;304 a week, or &euro;15,790 a year, by moving from jobseeker's allowance into employment.  This is a highly progressive policy.  The back-to-work family dividend scheme will operate during the period of economic recovery and will cease to operate with effect from 1 April 2021.  The dividend will be tax free and will be payable in addition to any family income supplement entitlement that the person may have.</p><p>Two improvements will be introduced in this Bill to enhance the supports available to lone parents.  The first improvement will extend entitlement to the one-parent family payment to lone parents who are also eligible for the half-rate carer's allowance payment until their youngest child reaches 16 years of age.  This measure acknowledges the special situation and, in particular, the commitment of lone parents who are caring for people other than their own child such as a parent or sibling who requires full-time care and attention.  The one-parent family payment scheme already provides for lone parents who are caring for children under 16 years of age and who are in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Kevin Humphreys :</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2289"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This entitlement is not affected by the ongoing changes to the one-parent family payment scheme.  The amendment that is now being proposed will mean that the same level of support will be provided to those caring for someone other than their own child.</p><p>This measure is expected to impact positively on approximately 1,800 people, including the 800 individuals who were due to lose entitlement to one-parent family payment and half-rate carer's allowance from 2 July this year.  The balance is made up of those who have lost entitlement since July 2013, as well as lone parents who will qualify for one-parent family payment for the first time when their youngest child is seven years of age or older and who are in receipt of carer's allowance.</p><p>The second improvement provides for an extension of the jobseeker's allowance transitional arrangements, which were introduced in July 2013.  These transitional arrangements currently apply to lone parents who have been in receipt of one-parent family payment within the last three years and where their youngest child is aged between seven and 13 years.  Under the transitional arrangements, which apply until the youngest child reaches 14 years of age, such lone parents are exempt from a number of the conditions applying to the jobseeker's allowance scheme, such as the requirement to be available for and genuinely seeking full-time employment.  The measure being provided for in this Bill will extend eligibility for the jobseeker's allowance transitional arrangements to all lone parents where their youngest child is aged between seven and 13 years, whether or not that person has been in receipt of one-parent family payment.  The jobseeker's allowance transitional arrangements allow lone parents with children aged under 14 years to balance their caring responsibilities and, significantly, this reduces their requirement for child care.</p><p>This Second Stage debate of the Bill will be followed immediately by Private Members' business dealing with the changes to the one-parent family payment that were introduced in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2012.  While I do not want to pre-empt that debate, I would like to say a few words about the operation of the one-parent family payment scheme and the reforms that have been introduced.  Despite significant levels of investment, the one-parent family payment scheme has not been successful in preventing lone parents from being significantly more at risk of consistent poverty than the population as a whole.  For instance, in 2004, during the height of the boom and when the economy was doing particularly well, lone parents were more than 4.5 times more likely to be at risk of consistent poverty than the population as a whole.  A significant reason for this was the passive nature of the one-parent family payment and the limited engagement by the State with recipients.  For many lone parents, this has meant long-term social welfare dependency and associated poverty and social exclusion for both themselves and their children.</p><p>Social transfers have certainly provided an important buffer in reducing poverty and social exclusion among lone parents.  Despite the strong level of income support provided to lone parents over the years, they have remained especially at risk of poverty.  This is why I believe that the reforms to the one-parent family payment scheme are much needed.  The best route out of poverty and social exclusion is through adequate and fairly paid employment.  I want to end the expectation that lone parents may remain outside of the workforce indefinitely.  As their children grow older, the focus must be placed on providing lone parents with the education, training and employment supports that will enable them to reach their full potential.  The primary aim of the one-parent family payment scheme reforms is to reduce long-term welfare dependency and to improve lone parents' access to education, training and employment supports.  Improved access to these supports will enhance their skillset and job readiness, which in turn will assist them with their transition to the workforce and their subsequent attainment of sustainable financial independence.</p><p>I have outlined the significant changes in the Bill.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-04-15a.112" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1139" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015041500002#FF00400"><p>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for outlining the rationale for some of the changes in the Bill.  We will not support the Bill.  While we are not opposed to the back-to-work family dividend as a key measure of the Bill where families will retain the full qualified child increase, it is important to note that the Government has not gone far enough in some of the measures to row back on previous cuts to lone-parent payments.  We will oppose the Bill but we will table amendment on Committee Stage with a view to improving the Bill.</p><p>The Minister of State has outlined the activation measures and we all want to ensure that all parents, but lone parents in particular, get an opportunity to go back to work.  However, the changes to eligibility introduced by the Minister for Social Protection in the past three social welfare Bills that were enacted targeted this sector for cuts, with significant decreases in lone-parent payments.  While the proposed changes are welcome, they will affect about 800 families, but another 10,000 families have been negatively affected under previous legislation because of changes in eligibility.  More than 10,000 families are already working and are due to lose a substantial portion of their income - about 25% of income for a lone parent working 20 hours on the minimum wage.  The Minister wants to give other lone parents the opportunity to get back into the workforce, and I agree with that, but why penalise those who have already gone back to work by cutting their payments?</p><p>The Minister has failed to address the plight of lone parents who are in the middle of studying who, from July 2015, will lose their entitlement to a grant awarded by SUSI, with losses ranging from &euro;45 to &euro;113 per week.  At the time of their introduction in April 2012<b>,</b>the Minister, Deputy Burton, referring to the changes as reforms, said they were introduced to encourage the activation of lone parents into employment and education.  Again she failed to explain why these reforms punish only those lone parents who are already fulfilling that objective, that is, those who are already working.  She said she would not proceed with these changes until they were accompanied by what she termed the Scandinavian child care model, which we do not have.  There have been no additional child care supports and the Minister is proceeding with the changes.</p><p>We have no difficulty with some parts of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill but we have to take a stand against the changes that have been made already.  The Minister of State mentioned figures going back to 2004, showing that lone parents were more at risk of deprivation, but from the research that groups such as One Family and SPARK have done, more than 60% of lone parents, and by extension their children, are experiencing deprivation and poverty now.  The measures in the Bill are a way of rowing back on some of the cuts that have been introduced in the past four years.  At the time I could not understand the reason the Department of Social Protection focused specifically on lone parents, cutting the benefits repeatedly, changing the criteria for eligibility as well as reducing the age of children who will be eligible.  The changes from July are way out of kilter with many other cuts that have been brought in by the Government.The Minister refers to them as reform, and while I agree with him on one point, that everybody should be given the opportunity to work, why change the existing payments for those who are already working and are doing what the Department wants?</p><p>We will be tabling a significant number of amendments on Committee Stage and we will debate them at that stage.  Before the pervious budget, we made a very strong pre-budget submission in order to help ease the transition of people who are long term unemployed and face losing their benefits on returning to work.  We proposed allowing persons in receipt of jobseeker's allowance for more than one year to retain increases in respect of qualified children for a period of a year following their return to employment.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Darragh O'Brien:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2178"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have put forward proposals which I intend to put forward, with my colleagues, on Committee Stage.

The need for this scheme was highlighted in 2011 in an academic study compiled by Hugh Frazer and Maurice Devlin from NUI Maynooth.</p><p>One of the findings to emerge most strongly from recent EU work on child poverty is that the work intensity of households is a key factor in explaining Ireland's level of children at risk of poverty.  For instance, the social protection committee report showed that in 2006, 42% of children at risk of poverty in Ireland lived in households where no one was working.  This compared with an EU average of 26%.  The risk of poverty for this group of children was 74%.  There was also a 52% risk of poverty for children living in households where the work intensity was 0&ndash;0.5.</p><p>The TARKI 2010 research showed that the Irish child poverty rate was high when both parents in a couple were jobless, and this group constituted 21% of all poor children.  While the risk was much lower where one partner worked full time and one was jobless, they made up 23% of all children who were poor.  By contrast, it was striking that when both parents worked full time the risk of poverty for children fell to 3%, and when a lone parent worked full time it fell to 8%.  However, when both partners worked part time or a lone parent worked part time the poverty risk for children was quite high.  </p><p>The role of unemployment or low work intensity in child poverty is reinforced by earlier Irish research, Layte <i>et al</i>in 2006.  The study demonstrated that children in households where parents were unemployed or inactive in the labour force had a higher risk of spending time in poverty than children in households where two parents were employed.  Analysis over an eight-year period showed that where neither parent was employed, nearly all children spent some time in income poverty.  Where both parents were employed, children spent no time in poverty.</p><p>While the figures contained in those studies might have changed slightly over the past few years, they are still startling.  It is simply the case, in poverty eradication terms, that employment is everything.  Even during times of supposed full employment this country suffered from very high levels of jobless households and consistent child poverty.  </p><p>Recent studies have shown that households with no employment suffer significant rates of consistent poverty and more so in households with children.  The difficulty is that those children are very much at risk of intergenerational child poverty.  This phenomenon has been present in Irish society for generations and it must be tackled.  Innovative ideas are needed to ensure that the cycle of intergenerational unemployment, poverty and poor life outcomes is not continued into the future.  In that light, this initiative is to be very much welcomed.  </p><p>During the so-called boom the amount of social welfare expenditure multiplied at vastly greater rates than our inflation rate.  What did that achieve?  It helped to create a cycle of welfare dependency and poverty, thus ensuring that work simply did not pay.  While throwing money at problems has long been a hallmark of previous Governments, this Government cannot afford fiscally or morally to continue the cycle.</p><p>In the 2013 and 2014 budgets this Government gave assistance to lone parents to re-enter the workforce with the afterschool child care scheme and the community employment child care programme.  The absence of affordable child care is still a huge issue for families right across this country.  I would welcome any measures in the forthcoming budget that would address this matter.  The solution to ending intergenerational poverty is employment and ensuring that work pays.</p></speech>

I would prefer if we could go further with payments and restore them to the fullest extent.</p> <p>We shall debate a motion later in this House and, therefore, I shall mainly deal with my issues regarding lone parents later on.  However, there are issues around child care, other supports and the difficulties of knowing what is and is not within the remit of the Department.  As we know, children do not live in any one Department or under any one remit but interconnectiveness is important.  I must reiterate, and we have already dealt with the following in the House, that at the first sign of the economy turning we increased child benefit.  Why was that funding not invested in child care services?  When the cuts were made we were told that just increasing transfer payments was not the answer and we needed to invest in services.  What are the priorities?  How will we ensure that they are prioritised?</p> <p>In regard to the back to work family dividend, Senator Naughton has eloquently outlined the importance of work.  She outlined the links between jobless households and child poverty and how both factors are interrelated.  I echo and agree with everything that she has said.  Part of me does wonder, but again this matter is outside the remit of the Department, why Ireland is exceptional in not allowing those in direct provision to work?  I do not understand such a policy, particularly as Senator Naughton has clearly outlined the importance of work.  Even the discipline of work provides a role model for a child.  Being part of a family and children seeing people going out to work is critically important.  The Senator also mentioned the generational outcomes and how work feeds that path.  </p> <p>I am also concerned about supports.  Perhaps we will deal with the issue more later when we discuss the motion on lone parents.  I am also concerned about the lack of regulation and guidance for afterschool child care.  It is good that there is a scheme but I do not want the same thing to happen when early years education was introduced.  Following talk about early years education a scheme evolved but now we are trying to unpick it and re-channel energies.  I hope, in this instance, that we could sit down and draft clear regulations.  </p> <p>I wish to raise an issue that relates to the Gender Recognition Bill introduced by the Department of Social Protection in this House.  As the Minister of State will recall, when it came through the House in January and February, and particularly in February, I raised issues concerning the silent treatment of trans and intersex children and young people in the Bill.  I stated in my correspondence sent to the Minister of State and the T&aacute;naiste, that I would return to the issue when we debate the next Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill and stipulated a timeline of three months.  The period has not elapsed so I shall not raise the issue but just note it and put down a marker.  The Minister of State may recall that I offered to engage constructively with the Department's officials.  There must be a workable legislative solution.  Malta has brought in laws to deal with the issue.  We have a lacuna because the Bill does not provide the mechanism for legal, even temporary, recognition of the gender for trans and intersex children under 16 years even though  all parties are in agreement that it would be in the best interests of the child.</p> <p>I was encouraged and heartened to see by the D&aacute;il debate on the issue.  Deputies right across the House raised similar issues which were echoed in the debate.  It is firmly incumbent on us, the Legislature, to ensure we have proper provisions that uphold the rights of trans and intersex children and prioritises their best interest, and that we do not put the issue on the long finger.  I ask the Minister of State to give us an update on the matter given that I plan to raise it when we debate the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.</p></speech>

I always feel that when he attends here he takes on board what we say.  He has the good trait of listening attentively to what all Senators have to say.</p> <p>The Bill contains some positive proposals which I welcome.  On the other hand, there are a number of proposals that I wish to discuss in further detail with the Minister of State.  </p> <p>One of the most positive aspects of the Bill is the introduction of the back to work family dividend scheme which was announced in budget 2015.  The introduction of the scheme will create an incentive for people to move from welfare to work.  It will also widen the gap between an individual's disposable income when working as opposed to income received while he or she is on social welfare.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie Moloney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2356"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2356&amp;amp;pid=MarieMoloney&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I have said many times in social welfare debates that nobody should be better off unemployed than working.  We must always incentivise people to return to work, and the introduction of the back to work family dividend scheme is a step in the right direction.  However, I ask the Minister of State to explain why it has been decided to limit the back to work dividend to four children.  There are many families with more than four children, yet they can only claim it for up to four children.  I do not understand the thinking behind this and ask the Minister of State for his thoughts on this matter.</p><p>It is a well known that many people struggle with the decision of whether to take up a job, if it will be worthwhile and if they will they lose benefits, such as the fuel allowance, rent supplement or, for many, most importantly, their medical card.  If they lose the medical card, they are anxious because they may not be able to afford health care and if they live in the country they will lose their entitlement to free school transport.  I have never believed that school transport should be free just because one has a medical card.  It should be free to those who simply cannot afford to pay for it, and it should come under the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport or the Department of Education and Skills, not the Department of Social Protection or the Department of Health.  This is of great concern to people and one can understand the reason.</p><p>The Bill also puts in place jobseeker's allowance transitional arrangements for those who are on the one parent family payment and whose youngest child has reached the age of seven years.  We will be discussing this issue in much more detail in the Private Members' motion this evening.  However, I welcome the fact that people who are parenting alone and who are transferring to jobseeker's allowance do not have to satisfy the full-time availability for work clause and need only be available for work during school hours until their child reaches the age of 13 years.  I also welcome the Minister's decision to allow those on the one parent family payment, who are in receipt of half-rate carer's payment, to retain the one parent family payment and the half-rate carer's payment until their youngest child reaches the age of 16 years.  I was very concerned about this when the changes to the one parent family payment were introduced.  I thank the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, for addressing the issue, which I have discussed with the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, on numerous occasions and also at the Oireachtas committee.  It is welcome that this will impact on those who lost entitlements since 2013.  Will the Minister of State clarify if they will be backdated or reinstated from the date of passage of the Bill?</p><p>Another matter I have discussed with the Minister is the issue of those on the jobseeker's allowance transitional arrangement who are currently in education, or wish to take up education, and if she would consider the introduction of what I call a back to education allowance transitional arrangement, which would allow them to claim the registration fee and maintenance under the third level grant scheme.  When in receipt of the one parent family payment, they were eligible to claim it but when they transfer to jobseekers transition allowance, they are no longer eligible and will go on to the back to education allowance.  I am aware the Minister is working on this issue but I ask that it be dealt with as quickly as possible for the new school year.</p><p>I welcome the introduction of additional medical assessors for the Department.  Invariably people who apply for carer's, invalidity and disability allowance wait a considerable time before the medical assessor deals with the application.  This waiting causes a lot of stress for people along with the uncertainty as to whether their application will be successful.</p><p>Section 4 deals with the operation of the carer's benefit, allowance and respite care schemes.  It was my opinion that all of these schemes were always assessed on the criteria that the person being cared for needed full-time care and attention from the carer and that the caree required continual supervision and frequent assistance throughout the day in connection with normal bodily functions or continual supervision in order to avoid danger to himself or herself.  However, a carer does a lot more than just supervising a person's medication or helping with bodily functions.  Most carers do everything from supervising the person to bathing, assisting with toileting, shaving, and helping the caree to live safely and comfortably in the community rather than having to live in residential care.  That entails much more than just seeing to their bodily functions.  A carer can come in and shower or bathe a caree, and assist them to the bathroom and then leave the house, but that does not mean the person can live on his or her own.  They need help with everyday things such as collecting prescriptions, attending doctor or hospital appointments, cooking, cleaning, putting down the fire or changing beds, all of which takes time.  They really do need someone to help them.  As we are all aware, home help hours have been cut so much that this kind of work no longer comes under the criteria of home helps.  It is all about personal care now, so if people wish to continue living at home in their community and in the environment where they have always lived, many need a carer.  If caring is restricted to normal bodily functions or continual supervision in order to avoid danger to himself or herself, many people will not be eligible for a carer and a nursing home subvention or the fair deal is a far more expensive option for the Exchequer.</p><p>I note that the current legislative provision is that a person will be regarded as requiring full-time care and attention where the nature and extent of his or her disability or incapacity has been certified by a registered medical practitioner. To be honest, I wish that really was the case, because I have just gone through numerous appeals for people whose medical practitioner says that they are in need of a carer and yet the Department will not accept that.  We spend weeks and weeks fighting their cases with reviews, appeals and oral hearings.  We are successful with some but not others.  It certainly does not come down to a GP or medical practitioner saying the person has a disability and needs a carer.  There is much more to it than that.  I was of the opinion that the deciding officer always had a say in it.  I do not think this legislation is going to change that because it is already happening.  I trust that this deciding officer will be a medical officer who will know when the person, medically, needs help.</p><p>I commend the Minister of State on the crackdown in fraud within social welfare which has resulted in millions of euro being saved and that the social welfare spend has been reduced by &euro;83 million as a result.  I welcome this as it means there is more money to go around and it can be targeted at those who need it and not those who are fraudulently claiming from the Department.  The only negative point I have to make is that the Department is requesting an excessive amount in repayments in many cases.  While I agree the money has to be repaid, sometimes people just cannot afford to repay the amount demanded by the Department.  Even though one appeals it, the Department still insists that they pay it.  If a recall correctly, a social welfare Bill provided that the amount of the repayment would be around &euro;28 per week but in many cases the Department is demanding in excess of that amount.</p><p>Overall, I welcome the Bill.  As I said, we will speak in more detail about one parent families during the debate on the Private Members' motion which follows.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-04-15a.118" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1115" speakername="Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015041500002#HH00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State.  It is evident in any discussion we have today about any change that there are two issues involved.  One is that because we do not have the money to do what we would like to do, how can that money be best used, while the other is how we can improve the lot of people.  This is what is important because at the end of the day we have to find a balance between those two positions.  Any person who is genuinely involved in this debate will have to start it in that way.</p> <p>Most of us live at the coalface when it comes to single parent families.  We all know the challenges for such families and also for those parents.  It is not easy at any stage.  There is a major responsibility on them.  At times we feel exceptionally inspired by those people.  Clearly, the income to the house has been eroded over a period, putting significant stress on those households, including the children.  It was difficult enough when things were reasonably good but then families find themselves in a competitive situation.  Children have to go out and meet their own peer groups and those who are better off in life as against those who now find themselves exceptionally distressed.  It is no secret that the stress often causes terrible depression for families that extends from the parent to the children.  The children who should be protected, nourished, cultivated and helped have an added challenge.  We often see the results of this in society.  One wonders whether we are making savings in the long run by eroding family income and adding those extra pressures when we see what comes out at the other end and the expenditure which is often involved in looking after the traumatic cases.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1968"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1968&amp;amp;pid=LabhrasOMurchu&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In addition, the principle of what is work and what it means to be in employment is important.  For a while we said that a parent at home rearing children had a passive and not an active life, but that is not true.  I cannot think of any more important work than looking after children, particularly in the case of a lone parent, and what a lone parent does is definitely work.  A lone parent has more to do than a couple, although a couple also has difficulties.  It is work which is also beneficial to society and to the State coffers because parents who stay at home ensure responsibility does not pass on to an agency of the State, which would have to pay an amount way above the money involved in what a parent does.</p><p>We often misrepresent the carer in this matter.  All of us have seen the work of carers and what they have to do is absolutely mind-boggling.  We have seen television programmes about their work and it is very deflating to see what a carer in a household has to do for 24 hours a day.  It is not as simple as counting out tablets in that very often these people give up their own lives to look after somebody in the household.  I speak in generalities because sometimes the generalities are lost in the specifics.  </p><p>The second thing I have noticed in cases that have come to public attention and have been shown on television is how magnanimous these people are.  The manner in which they accept their responsibilities and duties is inspiring.   I often try to imagine how I would be if I found myself in that position.  I wonder if I would have the tenacity those people display.  We have to make their lives as easy as possible.</p><p>The idea of easing a single woman or single man back into employment is laudable in itself but we also have to be very careful to consider what will happen to children.  The idea of a seven-year cut-off point for a child will not convince many of us as not much changes between the ages of six and seven, or even eight for that matter.  However, that is the yardstick we are using so it is important to ask if it is practicable and if it will continue to ensure children are looked after.  Even if a single parent is eased back into employment, many extra costs come back onto the household for numerous reasons, because children do not have their parent for X number of hours every day.  </p><p>I am involved in a centre in Cashel where we have had the benefit of community employment.  In better days when they were able to maximise their income, single parents came in and I could see what it meant to them.  It obviously gave them a sense of worth but, above all, it gave them a certain amount of ease as it got them away from the pressures in the home.  A lot of that has changed and I wonder if society will be the loser in the long-term.   </p><p>The reason we must consider and debate legislation like this is because the money which used to be there is no longer there.  Therefore, we must decide what we prioritise.  It would be very easy if we opposed every debate on economic issues just for the sake of it, but that is not what I am doing.  I am talking about what the priorities are and which people should be privileged when money is being expended.  I say that lone parents and children, who are more vulnerable than in normal circumstances, should be the priority and should have privilege but others should also get priority and privilege.  </p><p>I will not open the debate now but there is a proposal to give free GP care for those under the age of six, even if the parents are millionaires.  I do not take a position on that particular case but we need to take care on where the priority should be.</p></speech>

A lot of work has clearly been done on social welfare reform and this is yet another step on the journey.  I welcome the Bill, particularly in the context of the Fine Gael making work pay policy, which was recently published.</p><p>When considering this Bill we must also consider the backdrop against which it is set.  There is no question that, even during the years when we had full employment and rapid economic growth before the economic implosion, Ireland has suffered from high levels of jobless households and consistent child poverty.  The long-term unemployed, one-parent families, those with disabilities and others who found it difficult to access work were simply abandoned on the dole queues until this Government started to overhaul the social welfare system.</p><p>There can be no question that the prioritisation of benefits over services has resulted in a culture that has locked in consistent poverty and poor outcomes for people.  For example, Ireland pays out one of the highest rates of child benefit in the developed world yet still has one of the highest rates of child poverty.  How can this be?  Why do some want to maintain the <i>status quo</i>?  We should be working to create a society in which work pays for families.  Recent research has revealed that households with someone at work make up 9% of all those who are categorised as being in consistent poverty.  This is not acceptable and it is vital we all ensure that work always pays.  In that context the main purpose of this Bill is to provide for the introduction of the back-to-work family dividend scheme, announced in budget 2015 and discussed by other Senators, in order to help jobseekers with families and lone parents return to work.  </p><p>The provisions in the Bill which are attracting most attention deal with the introduction of the new back-to-work family dividends.  The rationale behind this is to ensure that families getting back to work do not find themselves financially at a disadvantage in the short-term.  As such, the back-to-work family dividend will help jobseekers with families and lone parents to return to work by allowing them to retain the element of the social welfare payment which they receive for their children for up to two years.  These payments can vary over a two-year term and could be worth &euro;2,324 in the case of a one-child family, &euro;4,649 in the case of a two-child family and so on.  Nevertheless, the intent is clear - to ensure no family is at a disadvantage as a consequence of going back to work.</p><p>The authentication and verification of a person's identity when they appear to collect their payment is something that has been brought up regularly during the last decade and this Bill seeks to address it.  This has been perceived as a significant issue in recent years and I am satisfied that this Bill seeks to remedy some of the weaknesses.  For example, it will distinguish a person presenting at a post office for payment on his or her own behalf from a person who has been nominated to collect a social welfare payment on behalf of another person and a person who has been appointed to act on behalf of another person who has been certified by a registered medical practitioner as being unable to manage his or her own financial affairs.  From now on, where a person presents for payment on his or her own behalf, that person must provide identification at the post office in the form of a valid passport, current driving licence or other identity validation document.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Catherine Noone:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2354"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2354&amp;amp;pid=CatherineNoone&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is a worthwhile provision and, in addition, where a person has been nominated to collect a social welfare payment on behalf of another person, the person presenting for such a payment must provide evidence that he or she has been nominated to receive the payment on behalf of that other person, while also being subject to the requirement to provide the public service card and other relevant documentation.  The Bill is well thought out legislation that will modernise our social welfare system.  The long overdue transformation of the social welfare system into a modern work activation service is a good thing.  All jobseekers should have access to the best available support to aid their return to work.  The Bill accomplishes it and I am happy to support it.</p></speech>

He has had a long day in the Seanad.  I also welcome the Bill.  The primary purpose of it is to make provision for the new back to work family support.  This is a welcome measure as it allows those moving off social welfare payments to hang on to child-specific portions of social welfare payments for one year and half of it for a further year.  After four years of harsh social welfare cuts, with indirect costs to many social welfare payments and cuts from the previous Government, it is some acknowledgement by this Government of the cost of engaging in work and the poor quality and low-paying nature of many jobs.  Many in-work poverty traps are known about and must be dealt with.  This is a small, but welcome, measure.  From the establishment of the Low Pay Commission and all the reports published by EUROSTAT, the OECD, TASC and others, we know we have a problem with low pay.  There is a difficulty with people on low pay moving from unemployment to employment.  The lack of access to public services, whether it is health care, education or supports for children of workers and child care, creates problems for people on low pay.  There are many such people.</p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; correctly said that as we bear the fruits of any upturn, we must spend the money wisely and ensure the extra revenue available to the State is used in a way that makes sure we deal with poverty and inequality rather than going off on political tangents and engaging in auction politics with tax cut promises that seem attractive in an election.  In reality, we must make sure we put money back into these supports and, critically, areas of public service provision where it is necessary to lift people out of poverty.</p> <p>Ireland has one of the highest rates of low pay in Europe and the number of people in part-time work continues to increase, with 13% more workers employed on a part-time basis since 2007.  According to the OECD, we have the third highest rate of underemployment in the EU-28 and over one third of workers will earn &euro;20,000 or less in 2015, yet the Government has taken no serious action to tackle the prevalence of low pay.  Quite late in the day, the Low Pay Commission was set up but it is narrow in scope and does not deal with the contributing factors that create in-work poverty.  Wages are only one element of it and the minimum wage, while only one small element, affects only 5% of the workforce.  Many people above the minimum wage but on low pay must also be supported.  We know the problem with precarious work and low-hour contracts.  The Minister of State is supportive of doing something about it and there will be a debate in the D&aacute;il during Private Members' business based on a motion tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in.  It is a concrete, practical, realistic and deliverable proposal supported by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and will help workers who want to work more to go from part-time to full-time work to end the exploitative nature of many of these low-hour contracts where we have profitable companies paying their workers low wages on low-hour contracts.  In the case of some retailers, 70% or 80% of workers are on low-hour contracts for years.  This is clearly exploiting workers.</p> <p>Much more needs to be done, even in terms of labour activation measures.  We must look seriously at what works and what does not work.  JobBridge is not working is and it is a clearly exploitative scheme.  I welcome the call by IMPACT to scrap it.  Sinn F&eacute;in has also published proposals.  While I criticise JobBridge, I commend the Government on introducing JobsPlus, which is a much better scheme and is work-related.  It is of great benefit and we welcomed its introduction and expansion in recent times.  It involves real jobs, real pay and terms and conditions.  The Minister of State shook his head when I referred to JobBridge and the Government is very defensive about it.  I have a difficulty with it and some of my family members have gone through it and were critical of it.  I have spoken to many people in the constituency I live in who have not had a good experience, although some have.  If there is room for employers to exploit it, they will do so.  A survey by Indecon showed 30% of employers who used the scheme said that, in the absence of the scheme, they would have taken on someone.  That is a high figure.</p> <p>One of the provisions of the Bill which is an area of concern for us, and has been raised by other Senators, is section 3 concerning the eligibility of caring payments.  I am concerned at the section of the Bill in respect of family carers.  In the submission on the Bill, the Free Legal Advice Centre, FLAC, and Community Law &amp;amp; Mediation called for the deletion of the section, arguing that it does nothing but make it more difficult for carers to access income supports.  They describe section 3 as negative law making, introducing a presumption of ineligibility for the payment, which the applicant must overcome.  At present, the applicant must demonstrate an entitlement and the deciding officer then makes a decision from a position of neutrality and objectivity.  The submission notes that the outworking of the change will see more eligible applicants having to go to the appeals office to secure their entitlements.  Our vast experience of dealing with people who must appeal social welfare or benefit claim is that it can take a long time.  If we can prevent appeals having to be made in the first place, it is better for those who benefit from it.  I welcome the provisions of the Bill and I look forward to supporting it.</p></speech>

In this Bill, we are providing further help for welfare dependent families through the introduction of the back to work family dividend to help jobseekers with families and lone parents return to work or increase their number of hours.  We are also enhancing the support for lone parents through the extension of the eligibility for jobseekers allowance transition arrangements and the changes in eligibility for one parent family payments, where lone parents are also providing full-time care and attention to another person.  All of these improvements have been made possible as a result of the many sacrifices the Irish citizen has made.</p> <p>I would like to respond to some of the specific points because we will debate the provisions in detail on Committee Stage.  Senator Darragh O'Brien welcomes the back to work family dividend and I acknowledge that.  He and Senator Moloney raised the SUSI grant.  We will work through that and I will provide further information on Committee Stage.  Senator Naughton referred to jobless households, which is one of the most disappointing elements in the area.  Through the Celtic tiger, households with no one employed were continually caught in the spiral of poverty.  Money was thrown at it but there was no improved outcome.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Kevin Humphreys:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2289"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Government, with limited resources, has been trying to realign the social welfare system into a positive engagement process that will help people back into employment.</p><p>Senator van Turnhout referred to the gender recognition legislation which I brought through the House in February.  I approached it in many ways as possible and listened to the various issues raised in the debates on the Bill.  I tried to amend and adjust the legislation accordingly.  That is why I took on the whole idea in the Seanad of the two-year review of the legislation.  The role of general practitioners and how it should operate in the system was also expressed strongly here and in the other House.  We received correspondence from the Royal College of Physicians when the Bill was taken in the D&aacute;il.  I thought it was right of me to hold back before it went to Committee Stage to discuss the issues raised with the college.  That has happened and correspondence has been exchanged.  I hope to make progress on this matter in the near future.</p><p>I know the matter deeply concerns Senator van Turnhout and she explained the lack of research and information available on how children are affected by gender recognition.  From that, we have organised an initial meeting on 28 April with interest groups such as TENI, Transgender Equality Network Ireland, the Minister for Education and Skills and other education stakeholders including boards of management, principals and, hopefully, parents.  I have done some research on the matter and listened to alternative views.  Everyone wants to do the right thing for the children in question.  The first approach is to engage with the education stakeholders to ensure the children's experience in the education system is good.  This consultation must go on for some time to be built into a substantial proposal.  Above all, we need to get this right.  There is a need for research into this area.  I am at the beginning of this path and I hope I can help to advance it.</p><p>Senator Moloney asked why the back to work dividend stops at the fourth child.  There is an element of resources and costs of the scheme.  While we have made significant progress and turned the economy around, as Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; said, we are still quite constrained.  These are choices that Governments find they have to make, resulting in them having to put in a qualification basis.  There have been changes to how medical card eligibility is assessed for those going back to work which the Department and the Health Service Executive can explain further to the Senator.</p><p>Changes contained in section 4 will have no impact on how these schemes are currently operated or on how eligibility for these schemes is determined.  Much of this is about resolving issues around the language used in previous Bills and rectifying other changes.</p><p>I acknowledge Senator Noone&rsquo;s contribution.  These Bills have been introduced against the backdrop of the economic crisis and emergency with which the Government had to deal.   We have been able to make much progress in this area and in reforming social welfare schemes.  This is the first budget in which we are giving money back to taxpayers to keep economic growth.</p><p>Senator Cullinane made many remarks on the Government&rsquo;s policies.  It must be remembered the Government&rsquo;s first action in the middle of an economic crisis was to reinstate &euro;1 to the minimum wage that had previously been taken away.  Senator Cullinane referred to various reports but one report he did not mention was the ESRI one that showed the Government&rsquo;s social welfare policies and social transfers have prevented many people from falling into poverty and that the safety net worked.  There were many people in distress who were not on social welfare but by keeping the core social welfare rates in place the safety net worked.  It was difficult for everybody.</p><p>Senator Cullinane referred to IMPACT&rsquo;s report on JobBridge.  I was at the launch of that report and spoke at it.  Dr. Mary Murphy did acknowledge in the report that JobBridge helped many.  The Indecon report on the scheme contacted over 4,000 participants of which over 53% responded.  Over 60% of those who participated in JobBridge moved into employment subsequently.  It is extremely important that we were able to help people back into employment.  If we had to wait to get the scheme perfect, we would still be waiting, as would the 60% of participants who have moved into further employment.  One cannot wait until one gets the perfect scheme.  JobBridge has operated well.  With the economy recovering and changing, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection believes it is time to revisit and review the scheme to see if it can be improved.  I will be talking to the many stakeholders including IMPACT about this matter.  Figures are always thrown about but the Indecon report showed the scheme caused displacement.  However, this was only 4%.  When one considers that 30,000 people got an opportunity in the scheme, then 4% is a tiny marginal effect.</p><p>I thank Senator Cullinane for his remarks on JobsPlus.  This has been an extremely good initiative from the Government, already helping 5,000 people back into employment by this quarter.  Up to 60% of these were unemployed for two years.  It is doing exactly what it says on the tin.  The reason it has worked so well is that it is simple for the jobseeker and for the employer to draw down the money.  We will be promoting this scheme further.  The Government is determined that those who have been on the live register the longest will have the best opportunities to get back into employment.  JobsPlus is serving the State well and is working very well.</p></speech>

It is timely to debate these issues now as the Government puts the final touches on its much-anticipated spring statement and when all people, especially those whose boat has not yet lifted with the upward swell of the economy, await their chance for prosperity, well-being and equal participation in building a new Ireland.</p><p>I have proposed this motion along with my Independent colleagues because we believe the changes in one-parent family policies have not been effective in achieving the stated objective of encouraging single parents into job activation and education.  Equally significant, we believe the underlying rationale for the policy changes is not correct.  The rationale is that single parents should be compelled to work full-time once their youngest child reaches the age of 14.  The State does not compel two-parent families to do so.</p><p>Before I lay out our case, I must acknowledge the T&aacute;naiste's commitment to social welfare reform and getting the reform right.  That is why our motion welcomes and notes a number of her decisions to amend the policies announced since 2011, and also the leadership and extensive work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection to support these positive amendments.  I acknowledge also the ambition and commitment of single parents themselves to reach for higher education and employment that pays while balancing their parental responsibilities of care.  They are actively dismantling the stereotype of long-term welfare dependency.  That is why I held a civic forum with many of them in Leinster House yesterday and why we concentrated on proposing positive recommendations for change, some of which I will mention this evening, and all of which will be compiled into a report that we will submit to the Government and joint committee for consideration.  I appreciate the expert assistance of Dr. Mary Murphy in this regard, in addition to the assistance of the advocates for one-parent families, some of whom are with us this evening, including One Family, the National Women's Council of Ireland, the Union of Students in Ireland, SPARK and Trinity College Dublin Students' Union.</p><p>While public policies in the 1990s supported a mother worker regime where part-time work was facilitated alongside parental caring responsibilities, as exemplified by the higher income disregards that supported child care costs, the latest changes from the mid-2000s are such that single parent policy shifted towards an adult worker regime in which the adult is expected to work full-time with care, in theory, provided by a public service or purchased in the marketplace.  The ideal should instead be a carer-earner model - with appropriate incentives and support for higher education - that facilitates an adequate level of labour market participation while also accommodating care choices.  This is unlikely to be facilitated by a system that privileges or insists on full-time employment.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Katherine Zappone:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2392"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2392&amp;amp;pid=KatherineZappone&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We think that this is unlikely to be facilitated by a system that privileges or insists on full-time employment.  Government policies are rooted in the assumption that the way out of poverty is a job.  We say that the way out of poverty for one-parent families is education and a job that can balance caring responsibilities.</p><p>Let us consider some of the evidence that we have to date, subsequent to the changes in one-parent family policies.  In 2013 the survey in living conditions cited that the consistent poverty rate for the Irish population was 8.2% but that the rate was 23% for one-parent families.  It also recorded that over 30% of the population experienced two or more types of enforced deprivation but that 63% of those living in one-parent households experienced deprivation.  Senator van Turnhout will speak on the impact that such poverty and deprivation has had on the children of one-parent families.</p><p>With regard to employment, Department of Social Protection figures for 2011 show that 49% of recipients of the one-parent family payment were in employment.  This decreased in 2013 to 36%.  It increased again in 2014 and 2015 but at the end of January 2015 45% of recipients were in employment, which is still under the 49% figure.  There are a number of reasons for the fluctuations, the main one being of course the economic crisis which affected everyone, including single parents in employment.</p><p>Many single parents lost employment, but another key factor is what happened at the beginning of 2012.  Previously, recipients of the one-parent family payment could participate on a community employment scheme, receive their one-parent family payment and also get a payment of the community employment allowance.  As the T&aacute;naiste knows, this was stopped.  A direct result of this was significant decline in the number of single parents in community employment.</p><p>The T&aacute;naiste is also aware of the various calculations that have been put forward indicating that, when 30,200 single parents transition on 2 July 2015, just as school holidays cause child care costs to increase, this change will impact negatively on thousands of working parents who will be financially worse off.  The Department of Social Protection estimates that two-thirds will transfer to the jobseeker's transition allowance and our motion has welcomed the establishment of this scheme as a better option than jobseeker's allowance.</p><p>However, the  jobseeker's transition allowance has a lower income disregard than the one-parent family payment and hence, for example, a worker earning &euro;200 will lose &euro;29 a week after the transition.  Those parents who have no child under 14 years will transfer onto the jobseeker's allowance and there are concerns that many of them will have to give up their part-time employment due to the jobseeker's allowance conditionality requirements.  Those single parents who are in paid employment of sufficient hours to qualify for the in-work benefit FIS as a top-up to their one-parent family payment will transfer to the FIS scheme exclusively, which will provide a lower level of income support than they currently receive, even with the back-to-work family dividend payment.</p><p>There is also great concern regarding lone parents' access to education, especially for those whose youngest child is over 14 and those who wish to pursue education goals in the future.  We have welcomed that the Government has revised its policy regarding lone parents currently in full-time education and whose youngest child is under 14.  One-parent family payment recipients in full-time education can remain on the payment until their course is completed but this arrangement is for recipients coming off one-parent family payment up to 2 July 2015 only.</p><p>Those who exit one-parent family payment after this date will have to opt for the jobseeker's transition allowance or the back-to-education allowance.  If one qualifies for jobseeker's transition allowance, one will be eligible to receive the SUSI maintenance grant, which is crucial for child support.  However, a parent whose youngest child is 14 years or above will be treated the same as if he or she had no dependants and will only be able to access the back-to-education allowance without any maintenance support for child care and travel.</p><p>As was pointed out yesterday in our civic forum, it is considerably less costly to the Exchequer to support single parents through higher level education than it is to support them on welfare for the entirety of their lives.  For these reasons, and others allied to them, the motion calls for a comprehensive review of the policy decision to compel single parents to work full-time and asks if this policy is consistent with a child's right to parenting and is consistent with the equality of family status.</p><p>Some of the positive recommendations coming from the civic forum include the following.  Single parents in or wishing to access full-time education and those in part-time employment should be able to access one-parent family payment support until their youngest child is 18.  The State should recognise that all citizens under 18 years of age are children and thus still dependent on parental support.  If lone parents are already in employment or education, they do not need the removal of the payment to activate them.  Further, how is it that one parent in a two-parent household can be classified as a dependant, in our social welfare policy, yet a child between the ages of 14 and 18 in a one-parent household is not recognised as a dependant?</p><p>Another recommendation is that if the State insists on a transition to jobseeker status after the youngest child reaches seven, we should bring back the higher levels of income disregards for those on jobseeker's transition allowance, by way of supporting the caring responsibilities of lone parents, given there does not yet exist adequate public locally-based child care services that do school collections from their child's school.</p><p>There are many more recommendations, including the need for quality part-time options, such as work, training and education, to be recognised.  It is not easy for single parents to negotiate increases in part-time hours within a context of mini-jobs, zero contract hours and the idea of bundling slivers of time.  It would be helpful if the Organisation of Working Time Act was amended from a 15-hour minimum threshold to a 20-hour minimum threshold.</p><p>We think these are better ways for single parents to reduce long-term social welfare dependency, to balance their ambitions to learn, earn and care, and eventually to achieve financial independence and well-being for themselves and their children.  This is why we call on the Government to engage in a comprehensive review.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-04-15a.134" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1171" speakername="Jillian van Turnhout" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015041500002#RR00200"><p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste.  It is with pride that I second the motion.  The result of inadequate income for many one-parent families is food poverty, fuel poverty, over-indebtedness, difficulty with education-related costs, cutting out extra-curricular activities and children's hobbies, living in poor quality housing, risk of homelessness, and homelessness.  The latest SILC data for 2013 revealed that in lone parent households, the at-risk-of-poverty rate was 31.7%, the deprivation rate was 63.2% and the consistent poverty rate was 23%.</p> <p>The particular and distinct vulnerability of this group is further shown by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul which has confirmed that one-parent families constitute one of the major groups to which it provides services.  The financial assistance the Society of St. Vincent de Paul provides is connected with their low and inadequate incomes, particularly those in receipt of one-parent family payment.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul has advised that despite incredibly careful budgeting, there simply is not enough money in the house, and they find they need a payment to buy food or meet the costs of school, energy and housing.</p> <p>Parents who work part-time find that their pay is low and unlikely to rise significantly as they often have low educational levels because of the situation they are in.  Child care is an issue in terms of cost of child care and the salaries for those working in child care because all too often jobs that are considered to be women's work get lower rates of pay.</p> <p>The Society of St. Vincent de Paul also supports both two and one-parent homeless families that are in emergency hotel accommodation, in the majority of cases because of the major shortage in social housing or having been pushed out of the unregulated monopolistic private rental sector where market rate far exceeds rent supplement caps and where the housing assistance payment is only available from selected housing authorities.  That is an issue that differs around the country.</p> <p>Society of St. Vincent de Paul volunteers report that their members are finding that the move from one-parent family payment to the jobseeker's transition allowance is causing them considerable uncertainty and fear, particularly among those who have received the letter from the Department.  This is something I found repeatedly as I talked to groups in preparation for this debate.</p> <p>The proposed changes regarding the one-parent family payment have also caused considerable stress, upset and confusion with Doras Bu&iacute;, a community-development organisation centre that provides high quality supports and services to one-parent families living in the Coolock area of Dublin.  That organisation outlined some of its concerns.  Obviously a major cause of concern is the provision of adequate, quality and affordable child care in that area.  It claims that the provision of the after-school subvention scheme is not adequate.  First, not all private child care providers have taken up this scheme and many parents are unable to find a provider to collect their child from their school.  It is great to say that one has the scheme in one place and the child somewhere else, but how is the child supposed to get to the scheme?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jillian van Turnhout:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2391"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2391&amp;amp;pid=JillianVanTurnhout&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Second, the subsidised scheme only lasts for 52 weeks.  What are parents to do after the first year of the scheme finishes?  The Department has advised parents to contact their child care committee after this time.<br/><br/>Many parents have expressed concerns regarding their current working arrangements and qualifying conditions for jobseeker's allowance.  Some are working ten to 15 hours per week, broken down to two to three hours per day for five days, in order to fit around child care arrangements.  While working these hours, they do not qualify for jobseeker's allowance because they work for more than three days per week.  Many parents and their employers are not in a position to increase working hours to at least 19 hours, which would allow parents to be eligible for FIS and the back to work dividend.  Another example has been clearly illustrated by the Dunnes Stores workers who work 15 hours per week.  We see the precarious position they have been put in.  A person may be called in to work thinking they might have five hours, and organise child care on that basis, only to go in to find out they have one hour of work.  <br/><br/>Due to the current housing crisis and the lack of social housing, many lone parents are in receipt of rent supplement.  Under the conditions of rent allowance a recipient cannot work more than 30 hours per week, so we are moving up the scale.  If they do, they lose their rent supplement, so parents are left with a choice between working full time and keeping their home.<br/><br/>While there are child care education and training support programmes available for parents who are studying a FETAC level 5 course to help towards the cost of further education, there is no such funding for parents who want to go to degree level.  This is limiting their education choices, which in turn limits their ability to gain full-time well paid employment.<br/><br/>I will end by mentioning a lone parent involved in Doras Bu&iacute; who asked me to share her story with the House.  Her name is Leanne and she is a single mother of one.  She says:<blockquote>The new changes in the One Parent Family Payment will really affect me in a bad way.  My son turns 7 years old on the 14th of July, so this will affect me immediately.  My son has been diagnosed with ADHD and Oppositional Defiant Disorder and takes daily medication.  I attend monthly and sometimes weekly appointments in the Mater CAMHS hospital.  I am currently working part time and I face a drop of 70/80 euro a week, basically between 280/320 a month.  This is a huge stress on a lone parent like me, trying to better myself for my son by getting out and working part time and this strain is unbelievable.  I attend counselling over these stresses.  I cannot work full time as I don't have a minder for my child and with these changes I won't be able to afford one any time soon.</blockquote>This really illustrates how a number of factors that I have tried to demonstrate come together and compound this downward spiral at a time when we should be supporting and lifting up lone parents and giving them the opportunities we say we wish to give them.  I cannot see the evidence of investment in child care and after-school care.  There has been investment, but there are no guidelines, no clear structures and no regulations, so the reality is that when people try to access services, be they housing or employment, all these obstacles are in the way.  We really need to tackle this issue to lift lone parents and their children out of poverty.</p></speech>

Since the scheme was introduced in 1997 until the end of 2010, recipient numbers have increased by half and annual expenditure has increased by over &euro;750 million.  The total figure was in excess of &euro;1 billion per year from 2008 to 2012.  Throwing money at the problem clearly has not worked.  As far back as 2004, lone parents were more than four and a half times more at risk of consistent poverty compared to the population as a whole.  This was when the economy was booming and the previous Government showered every problem with available cash.  </p><p>Before the changes, lone parents could have been on the scheme until their youngest child turned 18 or 22 if they were in full-time education.  Those criteria are also very much outside the norm internationally.  What does this say?  It says that the State is happy for someone to be on welfare until their child is an adult.  That is not the way to ease poverty and help families.  Additionally, the State pays one of the highest rates of child benefit in the developed world, yet it has one of the highest rates of child poverty in the developed world.  All the evidence at home and internationally points to employment as the solution to poverty and exclusion.  I believe this is the only solution.  In its most recent report on employment and social developments in Europe, the European Commission indicated that there is a strong link between poverty and social exclusion on the one hand and the labour market on the other hand.  It presents evidence that countries with high employment rates display lower rates of poverty or exclusion.  When I say &quot;employment&quot;, I do not mean any old job.  I mean employment that enables someone to earn a living.  Employment does not automatically lead to the eradication of poverty.  The quality of the employment and the active engagement of the person with the job market throughout a lifetime are essential.  There must also be personalised approaches and counselling to ensure that people take up high-quality and sustainable jobs.  Public investment in job creation is vital and has been at the core of this Government's jobs strategy, particularly in sustainable, high-quality jobs.  In order to address poverty, these jobs need to be accessible to people experiencing poverty.  </p><p>I, like Senators Zappone and van Turnhout, worry wholeheartedly about the levels of poverty and deprivation experienced by one-parent families in Ireland.  I agree that their levels of poverty are much higher than the incidence in the general population.  I also fully support Senator Zappone in her views on the child care element of the issue, which were very practical.  I sincerely hope that there will be moves in the forthcoming budget to address this.  I also agree with Senator Zappone that it is unacceptable that we still have such levels of poverty and deprivation in this day and age. </p><p>I would also point out that none of these things are new.  We have been living with the same situation for generations.  The approach we are discussing is an attempt to address that.  I do not get a sense from the Senator's contribution that she has a principled objection to work activation measures or a move from a system that discourages welfare dependency.  However, I think the Senator is right to point out that some people have genuinely held worries about what might be called the possible unintentional consequences of the changes to the scheme.  In that light, I think it would be appropriate to review the scheme's operation after a given period to test its effectiveness.</p></speech>

The ability of Senators to work together and put forward a proposal in the House to which the T&aacute;naiste has listened proves how useful the Seanad is.  Fianna F&aacute;il is happy to support the motion.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Terry Leyden:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=636"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=636&amp;amp;pid=TerryLeyden&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This week marks the third anniversary of the promise made by the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Burton, not to proceed with these one-parent family payment cuts unless appropriate child care supports were in place.  This is a commitment the T&aacute;naiste has failed to honour and the consequences of her ill-thought-out policy continue to have devastating effects on one-parent families.  The cuts imposed by the T&aacute;naiste have led to huge financial losses for working lone parents and have increased the obstacles to lone parents seeking access to third level education.  The cumulative effect of these changes is now clear. A lone parent working 20 hours per week on a minimum wage has lost &euro;108 per week as a result of these so-called reforms, and in the absence of child care, work will no longer pay for many parents.  These weekly losses are made up of a loss of &euro;28 due to a reduction in income disregard, a loss of &euro;50 in 2015 on cessation of one-parent family allowance and an additional loss of &euro;30 in 2017 when the back-to-work family dividend will end.  There has been a drop in the number of lone parents in paid employment and a drop in the number of applications to the Central Applications Office by lone parents.  Moreover, while the European Union survey on income and living conditions, EU-SILC, report of 2013 showed there was no significant increase in consistent poverty in the general population, which increased from 7.7% to 8.2%, there was a shocking 32% increase in consistent poverty among one-parent families, the rate of which increased from 17.4% to 23% and is almost three times higher than that of the general population.</p><p>I look forward to the T&aacute;naiste's response to this motion because the Senators have put forward a well worked out and researched document.  On looking through it and on foot of the advice I have received from the Fianna F&aacute;il research office, which has considered the points put forward by the Senators and has found nothing in the motion with which it can disagree, Fianna F&aacute;il's response is we have considered and fully support the motion.  I revert to and reiterate the point on the proposed major reform of this House, about which I have strong reservations.  This is because the concerns Members have expressed and which the T&aacute;naiste represents could not be represented by a well-off representative in New York who might be elected to this House.  Such representatives would not have the interest, the concern or the effect the Members present have.  This is a small second House of Parliament and it strikes me that while one seeks more representations from different outlets and outlooks, this time the Government appointed a wide range of people, who have been joined by Senator Craughwell after the by-election.  Therefore, there is a broad range of views in this House and that is why this motion is particularly appropriate and important.  It is something Deputy Burton should act on as T&aacute;naiste and as leader of the Labour Party, which places her in an onerous position as someone who retained the Ministry of Social Protection.  This was a brave decision on her part as it would have been easier for the T&aacute;naiste to have taken on another portfolio that might have been easier to manage.  This is a difficult portfolio.  I believe it is the second highest spending Department in the State, and it is extremely important to the most deprived people in society.</p><p>If one looks back on Fianna F&aacute;il's last time in government, it put funds into child care and into cr&egrave;che developments throughout Ireland, which incidentally has never been recognised.  In addition, Fianna F&aacute;il also gave the first full free preschool year.  I hope the T&aacute;naiste will be able to bring about a second preschool year and that such a proposal might appear in the next manifestos.  It was a great support to and help for families that they could have one free year of preschool facilities.  Moreover, the buildings that were constructed and provided throughout the countryside are really top-class buildings of quality.  When one analyses the position put forward by the Senators, the T&aacute;naiste will see that any effect it will have on a low income base is devastating.  My daughter is a councillor who is working with parents who are under terrible pressure at present.  They are trying to hold on to their houses, to local authority houses, and are trying to rear a family.  They are finding it very difficult to get child care, which has become out of the price range of anyone who seeks to return to work.  In most cases, such people do not receive income that is adequate to pay for a child in child care.</p><p>These are all areas in which, as T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, the T&aacute;naiste can consider the individual effect this measure has.  She can ask whether this has a major effect on the recipients.  As it has, the T&aacute;naiste has a duty and responsibility to examine the situation and tell her Government colleagues that this is not acceptable.  She should do this in her extremely influential position as T&aacute;naiste, that is, supporting and being part of the Government as Deputy Prime Minister, as well as the Minister with responsibility for this sensitive portfolio.  I must state she has done her utmost in that Department, in so far as possible, in trying to protect the rates of allowances in difficult circumstances.  The elderly have been affected badly by the removal of free services that were in place, such as free telephones and painful decisions were made.  I note they were more painful for those who actually were deprived of those services.  While the T&aacute;naiste retained the free travel system, which is appreciated, other facilities have been withdrawn from people, which is not welcome.  The T&aacute;naiste should consider this motion to ascertain whether she can agree to defer this measure.  I do not believe it is a question of voting and, if possible, this motion should not be put to a vote.  The proposal should be examined by the T&aacute;naiste.  While the Government more or less has the numbers in this House, perhaps that is not true in this case and the T&aacute;naiste may find that this motion will be approved.  All 14 Fianna F&aacute;il Members are supporting this motion 100%, as will other Members.  Perhaps it would be advisable to review the Government amendment to this proposal and to revert to Members with concrete proposals to alleviate the concerns expressed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-04-15a.139" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015041500002#TT00200"><p>At the outset, I thank Senators Zappone, van Turnhout, Mary Ann O'Brien and Mac Conghail for raising this important issue.  The one-parent family payment scheme has played an important role in providing income support to lone parents since its introduction in its present form in 1997.  The period from 1997 to 2010 saw the number of recipients increase by 50% and the annual expenditure increase by approximately 330% or &euro;770 million.  However, despite significant levels of investment, in which the State spent in excess of &euro;1 billion per annum for a five-year period from 2008 to 2012 and notwithstanding the good points on which everyone agrees, the scheme has consistently failed to prevent lone parents being significantly more at risk of consistent poverty than the population as a whole.  This means the outcomes for lone parents and in particular for their children are significantly worse than for other people in the population.</p> <p>According to the most recent survey on income and living conditions, 23% of lone parents are at risk of consistent poverty.  This is 2.5 times greater than the population as a whole and this figure is simply not acceptable.  This is not a new phenomenon, however, and it has been a feature of the scheme since its inception.  In 2004, at the height of the boom, lone parents were more than 4.5 times at risk of consistent poverty than the population as a whole.  We cannot afford to keep doing the same things and expect a different outcome.  Previous to the reforms to the scheme, Ireland was on its own in how we supported lone parents.  Lone parents could have been on the one-parent family payment scheme until their youngest child turned 18, or 22 if they were in full-time education.  Other countries have moved away from providing long-duration income support towards a shorter, more active engagement approach with more support.  For example, in New Zealand, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the North of Ireland, the equivalent supports for lone parents cease when the youngest child reaches the age of five.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Joan Burton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=133"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=133&amp;amp;pid=JoanBurtonLAB&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I acknowledge and commend the many lone parents who have engaged in employment in order to improve the outcomes for their families.  However, as somebody who works extensively with lone parents and organisations dealing with lone parents, I constantly meet lone parents, particularly women, who may have left education, training and work until they were in their late 40s or early 50s and then found, as has been described eloquently by Senators Zappone and van Turnhout, that they could not get well paid employment.  That is the crux of the matter.  If one does not get into education, training and work experience, followed by employment, before one's late 40s or 50s, it is very difficult to do so subsequently.  So many say to me that they only wish they had gone back to school and got training and qualifications at a much earlier stage in their life.  On that important fact, there is considerable agreement on both sides of this House.</p><p>Not all lone parents were in a position to get back into employment.  Many have been in receipt of one-parent family payment for 18 or 22 years - maybe another ten years if they have two or three children with more than a ten-year gap between them - without ever working or engaging in education or training.  This represents a significant portion of anyone's working life, and in many instances it creates a welfare trap for those who are just as bright, industrious and hardworking, and, indeed, intelligent, as anyone else in the country.  They deserve the best of opportunities in getting into education, training and well paid employment.  Since I became involved in this area, which was 20 years ago, that has always been my approach.  I have seen the impact on those who have not been able to be involved in education, training and bettering their life opportunities.  It meant that lone parents in that situation were so distant from the labour force that they found it impossible to secure well paid employment when their payments ceased as their children went into adulthood.  By not proactively engaging with lone parents, the State, in effect, is consigning these individuals and their families to a life of welfare dependency and putting them at an increased risk of poverty.  Put simply, the one-parent family payment in its previous guise has to a certain extent failed lone parents and their families.  It has provided income support to lone-parent families, but it also has ensured that some of these families are more likely to suffer from consistent poverty than the population as a whole.  That is why we had to change our approach to supporting lone parents.</p><p>As T&aacute;naiste and Labour Party leader, I have always believed that the best protection against poverty is secure and fairly paid work, and there is no doubt that the road to that is through education, training and work experience.  The Labour Party in government is focused on providing opportunities for all people.  We need to provide for greater levels of opportunity for lone parents and their children.  We need to have a more active engagement to offer them the supports and services they need so that they can secure economic independence and build a better future for their families.</p><p>The genesis of the current reforms to the one-parent family payment was contained in the 2006 report "Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents".  This report recommended that a time limit for receipt of the payment should be put in place.  The report also advocated that lone parents should be engaged with in a systematic manner in terms of facilitating their movement to education, training and employment supports.  This is the critical issue.  If one leaves doing that until late in people's lives, it is difficult for them to achieve their goals.</p><p>The reforms reduce the age of the youngest child for receipt of one-parent family payment on a phased basis over a long phasing.  The final phase will see the age of the youngest child at which payment ceases being reduced to seven years for all recipients from 2 July 2015 onwards.  It is expected that approximately 30,000 lone parents will transition from the one-parent family payment on that date.  This is in addition to 16,000 lone parents who have already made the transition since the reforms commenced in 2013.</p><p>The aim of these reforms is to reduce long-term welfare dependency by providing lone parents with enhanced access to the Department's range of education, training and employment supports, and to further assist in the provision of appropriate supports to lone parents.  The Department is sponsoring research by Dr. Michelle Millar whose aim is to identify best practice in how to assist lone parents in improving their access to education and employment to ensure they have greater levels of opportunity for themselves and their families.</p><p>To ease the transition of lone parents from the one-parent family payment, I have introduced a wide range of measures.  These measures, depending on the individual circumstances of the lone parent, aim to extend his or her eligibility to the one-parent family payment, remove conditionality, improve the financial incentive to take up employment or offer increased support for lone parents to engage in education and training.  Lone parents who are recently bereaved are exempted from the reform.  These reforms do not affect lone parents who are carers, but such lone parents, if they have any time, are free to become involved in the education and training and any other scheme that may be of interest to them.</p><p>In order to help lone parents with young children who are affected by this reform, I introduced the jobseeker's allowance transitional arrangement.  Under this arrangement, lone parents whose youngest child is between seven and 13 years of age are exempt from the requirements of being available for and genuinely seeking full-time employment.  This means that no lone parent with a youngest child under 14 years of age will be required to take up employment in order to receive income support from the Department.  That is their choice in accordance with how they wish to arrange their affairs.  There is no compulsion whatsoever involved.  What is on offer is a series of opportunities that lone parents, as they see fit, may wish to take up.</p><p>All of the lone parent customers will have access to the new Intreo service.  They will have for the first time the opportunity to access a case officer on a one-to-one basis in order to agree their own personal development plan.  This will enhance their access, whether to education, training or employment.  We will be giving those lone parents all the support we can to achieve their ambitions and goals.  Individuals on the jobseeker's allowance transitional arrangement can move into employment, including, if they wish, part-time employment, but this is not a prerequisite for payment.  The transitional arrangement thereby allows such lone parents to balance their caring responsibilities and significantly reduces their requirement for child care.</p><p>For lone parents who are already in employment and in receipt of family income supplement, FIS, we have for the first time introduced automatic increases in their family income supplement entitlement - Senators will be aware that many lone parents will receive significant increases.  This ensures that their income will increase to partially compensate them when they transition from the one-parent family payment.  To further encourage lone parents to take up employment or to increase their hours of employment, departmental staff are actively promoting the family income supplement scheme as the best financial option available to lone parents.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Joan Burton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=133"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=133&amp;amp;pid=JoanBurtonLAB&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Departmental staff are actively promoting the family income supplement scheme as the best financial option available to lone parents.  Lone parents who can increase the number of hours they can work to 19 hours per week will be significantly better off than if only in receipt of the one-parent family payment.  On foot of the age reforms over the past two years, the evidence shows more lone parents than expected increased their working hours and claimed FIS for the first time.  I expect this trend to continue with this year's reforms.  To further assist, I have asked the Labour Market Council to specifically examine the issue of how employers nationwide can assist lone parents in increasing their hours of work to enable them to qualify for the FIS payment.  In addition to the FIS, lone parents who transition off welfare and into employment are eligible for the new back-to-work family dividend payment which is also contained in the Social Welfare Bill 2015.  This payment allows lone parents and jobseekers to retain their child proportion, roughly &euro;30 per week per child, of their social welfare payment when they move into employment.  As the dividend has no impact on a family's FIS entitlement, it offers an additional and significant incentive for lone parents who are moving into a greater level of work of &euro;30 per child per week for the first year and half of this for the second year.</p><p>The Government is committed to improving the provision of child care, including the supports available for lone parents.  We have introduced the after school child care scheme and the community employment child care scheme, both of which offer heavily subsidised child care places and aim to assist lone parents to access either a community employment place or to take up employment.  Both these schemes build on the existing 25,000 subsidised child care places which the State provides to low income parents in order to facilitate their movement into employment.  This is a significant and vital investment and the Government is keen to build on the existing supports.  For this reason, my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Reilly, has established an interdepartmental group to carry out an economic and cost benefit analysis of policies and future options for increasing the supply, accessibility and affordability of quality child care.  My Department is involved in, and represented on, this group.  My officials are feeding the group's deliberations on the child care requirements of lone parents and jobseekers to enable them take up employment opportunities.</p><p>I am pleased to say that in accordance with the aim of the reforms, any recipient of the one-parent family payment who is already undertaking an education course and is in receipt of a SUSI maintenance grant will be allowed to retain the one-parent family payment until completion of the course of education.  In addition, there are no restrictions on a recipient of jobseeker's allowance transitional arrangement to undertake a full-time education course and such person will also be able to receive a SUSI maintenance during that time.  The reforms of the one-parent family payment are essential to the creation of a new, more active engagement process for lone parents.  I know from meeting constantly with people who have moved into education and training that the transition towards paid employment, combined with family income supplement or other income supports, offers serious job and career prospects to lone parents as their children grow up.  The feedback to the Department in relation to the changes has been extremely positive, particularly from the parents who have taken up the opportunities, starting in most cases with education and training over a prolonged period.  </p><p>I thank Senators for raising this issue, particularly those who spoke on the motion.  We all share a common vision and ambition in that we want to see people supported by a strong and good social welfare system.  Ireland's social welfare system is among the best in Europe.  For example, our rates are hugely in excess of the rates in the North of Ireland and in almost every other country of the European Union.  Notwithstanding the economic difficulties of this country, we have been able to maintain that.  However, as I said, we must continue to work to assist and make available the talents, intelligence and desire of lone parents to be involved in work, to start their own businesses and have good careers that will assist themselves and their children to financial independence.  </p><p>I know there are some people for whom this may not be an immediate objective.  For example, approximately 20,000 lone parents are not involved in education or employment.  By choice, they are involved in the full time care of their children.  I want to stress that there is no change of any kind to their payment.  As stated by Senator Zappone, the key and road to positive developments is education and training, which is precisely the Department's desire for lone parents.  The reason we have contacted lone parents is to give them the opportunity to engage with departmental officials in regard to the building of a career plan, which if it is not possible for them to undertake this year can be undertaken in three or four years' time.  There is too much talent there and it must not be left in a kind of poverty and welfare trap, which is what this debate is about.  I again thank those who contributed.</p></speech>

We are all well aware that the one-parent family payment scheme has played an important role in providing income support to parents who are parenting alone.  However, even with this support lone parents still tend to experience high rates of consistent poverty, which makes it evident that the one-parent family payment only is not sufficient to lift people out of poverty.  Throughout the Celtic tiger period lone parents still suffered a high rate of poverty.  As stated by the Minister, the figure in this regard was four and half times that of the population as a whole.</p><p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, back to the House.  None of us would argue with the fact that the best route out of poverty and social exclusion is through employment and education.  There is no doubt but that education is the key to well paid employment, which is the reason when I spoke earlier today, I raised with the Minister of State, Deputy Humphreys, the introduction of back-to-education transitional arrangements in conjunction with the jobseeker's allowance transitional arrangement for those wishing to return to education.  As I outlined earlier today, a lone parent in receipt of the one-parent family payment who chooses to return to education is eligible for a third level registration and maintenance grant.  However, if such person transfers to the back-to-education allowance he or she while eligible for a grant in respect of the registration fee is not eligible for a maintenance grant, which would be essential to their continuing in education.  I am delighted to note from the Minister's speech that this matter has been addressed and there is no restriction on people on the jobseeker's transitional arrangement accessing a full third level grant to cover registration and maintenance fees. </p><p>It is true that rearing children on one's own is far more difficult than rearing children with a partner or husband.  Even in situations where there are two parents involved it is a constant struggle to provide child care, with often one parent working while the other cares for the children.  In some cases, one parent goes out to work when the other comes home so that at all stages there is somebody in the family home to care for the children.  This is an impossibility for those parenting alone, be such person a single parent, separated parent, a widow or a widower.  The perception of some people is that a lone parent is a young girl who became pregnant and was left to bring up a child on her own.  This is not always the case.  In many cases, couples are happily married only for something to go wrong and the marriage breaks down, leaving one parent to rear the children on his or her own.  In other cases, a parent dies and again the other parent has to rear the children on his or her own.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie Moloney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2356"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2356&amp;amp;pid=MarieMoloney&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I welcome the fact a general move has been made towards helping lone parents through activation because while on the OPFP, they do not receive the help and support someone who is unemployed gets, that is, incentives and encouragement to take up employment.  Many lone parents have returned to work through necessity to have a higher income coming into the house but it was never through being encouraged by the Department or through any activation measures supplied or supported by the Department.  I am glad the Minister is recognising the needs of lone parents and the Department is offering them the same service available to others in receipt of unemployment payments.</p><p>All the new arrangements being put in place to transfer lone parents to the jobseeker's allowance and, for the first time, to devise a personal development plan with the Intreo office are welcome.  These will be of great benefit to those who are unemployed.  However, some of those who are currently employed will, unfortunately, by hit financially, as the disregard will no longer be in place, which means they will have a lower income.  We should examine ways to help this cohort of lone parents in order that they will not be worse off financially.  They activated themselves and found work and then balanced work and family life.  It is important that lone parents in receipt of FIS and who may not be due for renewal of their payment until perhaps December this year or early next year be reviewed with immediate effect following the changes with a view to increasing their FIS payment due to loss of income.</p><p>The transition to jobseeker's allowance has been taking place over the past year or two years and many lone parents have transitioned.  Will the Minister clarify whether there is a follow up on maintenance once they transfer?  Over the past number of weeks while we debated the Child and Family Relationships Bill in the House, much emphasis was placed on the fact that it is better to have two parents to raise a child, that is, a mother and a father.  However, I have heard no mention of the other parent during this debate, which could be either the father or the mother, otherwise known as the liable relative, although this is predominantly the father.  I received figures from the CSO which highlight that 87% of lone parents are mothers.  Time after time in discussions I have with the public, the issue of the father comes up and his responsibility to his child or, in most cases, his lack of responsibility.  It is easy for a man to walk away from his responsibility and leave the woman holding the baby.  I acknowledge a percentage of men are exceptionally good and they are greatly involved in their children's upbringing and financially support them but, unfortunately, they are in a minority.  Will the Minister clarify if having transferred to the jobseeker's transitional arrangement that the Department will pursue the liable relative for maintenance, as the other parent has a duty of care to his or her child or children both physically and financially?</p><p>The underlying factor in lone parents remaining in the poverty trap is the lack of accessibility to affordable child care.  Child care costs are so high that it is not an option for these parents.  Lone parents who work are more likely to be in low paid jobs, partly as a result of a lack of qualifications and partly because of the difficulty in accessing affordable child care.  We need to give more than just a social welfare payment to them.  We should put in place supports to help them to get out of the poverty trap.  For the past four years while we have been in government, funding has been a major issue for us in trying to do everything we would like to do.  The provision of child care has been one of the victims of the recession but, as the economy improves, we must seriously consider this issue not just for lone parents but also for those who we all now recognise as the squeezed middle.</p><p>People are struggling to pay for child care, with some even giving up work because it is cheaper.  I welcome the &euro;14 million in funding the Minister has provided for the after school child care scheme.  Unfortunately, there was a low uptake but the only place this care can be provided for those living in rural Ireland is in local schools because it is impossible for a parent to get from town to the school and take the child to the after school care provider before returning to work.  An incentive should be in place for employers to operate a programme similar to JobsPlus, which would be centred on lone parents.  It would revolve around school hours for lone parents.  Family-friendly work arrangements are difficult to come by and I commend Marks &amp;amp; Spencer on the programme it runs, which accommodate lone parents to work flexible hours.  If more companies did this, it would be fantastic.  We need concrete, workable plans, which would make it easier for lone parents to join the workforce in order that they can avail of a better quality of life and move from welfare dependency.</p></speech>

I am trying to remain as calm as I can because the OPFP is nothing more than a great big stick with which to beat lone parents and make them crawl for the miserable shillings they get.  Have the officials who wrote the Minister's script ever known a day's poverty in their lives?  Do they honestly believe that somebody wants to sit at home as a single parent with no opportunity to work?  The officials want these people to do 19 hours work a week.  Will they do this in Dunnes Stores or somewhere else where they will be exploited to the last?  If the Department wants to provide financial incentives for people to take up work, a State-funded cr&egrave;che should be set up in every town and village where their child can be looked after.  I recently became a grandfather and I heard my son and daughter-in-law talking about the cost of child care.  It will cost them thousands of euro every month and they both work.  Where will a single parent find that money?</p><p>As an educator, I have heard references to personal development plans for years with the belief being that if a personal development plan is put in place everything will be fine.  I agree wholeheartedly that education is the way out of poverty.  I ought to know because I returned to education when I was 35 years old.  However, I had a wife who stayed at home and looked after my family.  She was ignored by me for the best part of four years because I spent my time studying.  I used to go home for a nap in the evening and wake up late to study into the middle of the night.  I know that education pays but I watched as a teacher lone parent after lone parent taking up PLC courses and having to withdraw because of family commitments.  I am saddened by this, particularly when cr&egrave;ches are closed or their funding is cut.  If we are serious about providing educational opportunities - and I believe the Minister of State is - then we must open cr&egrave;ches in every college and further education centre.  We must provide child care facilities to enable people to attain educational qualifications.  The new president of TCD's students' union is in second chance education and she is an inspiration to us all.</p><p>Flexible education must be provided.  I recall visiting a centre in Finglas some years ago where the same syllabus was run three times a day and arrangements were made to enable lone parents to do the course at different times of the day.  That worked and such arrangements need to be incentivised in order that those who want to return to education can do so.  Let us stop talking about work.  Young lone parents probably lack educational qualifications and skills to secure decent, well paid work and, therefore, we should concentrate a little more on education and training to enable them to return to the workforce and earn a salary that will make it possible for them to look after their children.</p><p>It cuts me to the quick to hear people talking about lone parents starting up businesses.  Where are they to find the few shillings to do this?  I watched a lone parent on television the other night who had been left stuck for &euro;180,000 after her husband took off.  Where will she get money?  The Minister of State is a good guy and the Department does a good job overall but let us not try to put a positive spin on the OPFP and the incentives that go with it.  It is about forcing lone parents to find a goddamned job and to stop living off the State.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-04-15a.146" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1166" speakername="Jim D'Arcy" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015041500002#XX00200"><p>I welcome this discussion on lone parents and note that one in four families with children in Ireland is a lone-parent family, including my own, I might add.  I know what it is like to try to raise children on one's own.  Lone parents need and are entitled to every possible support.  The vast majority of lone parents whom I deal with continually do an excellent job in child rearing, often in very difficult circumstances.</p> <p>I got an e-mail today from somebody who was giving out to me, anticipating that I was going to vote for marriage equality, which I am, and saying that the family with the father and the mother is the best family in the world, there is no family that comes near it and it is the one to go for.  I know most two-parent families with the father and the mother are great families but a lot happened in dark Ireland in the 1950s and around that time in some of these supposedly wonderful families.</p> <p>My youngest daughter was in "Juno and the Paycock" the other night, where she was playing Mrs. Tancred.  In the last lines of that play, the wee girl asks her mother, Juno, what the child will do without a dad.  Juno replies, "It'll have what's far better- it'll have two mothers".  That might be a good thing for the coming referendum.</p> <p>We recognise that despite significant levels of investment, including an estimated &euro;607 million in 2015, the one-parent family scheme has not been successful in preventing lone parents from being significantly more at risk of poverty than the population as a whole.  Support for lone parents needs to be updated in order to provide greater levels of opportunity for them and their children.  Things are not perfect but nothing can be taken in isolation.  The shocking economic circumstances of recent years have meant that while social transfers were maintained at 2007 levels, despite adjustments in other areas, it was not possible to add as much value as wished.  Now the situation is improving, with the efforts of the Government and the people, and more jobs are being created, things are coming back on the right track and we can begin to look forward.</p> <p>I hear talk of a second free child care year, which I would welcome very much.  The Government has taken several steps to ease the transition of affected lone parents from one-parent family payment, including the introduction of the jobseeker's allowance transitional payment, creating for the first time the opportunity for lone parents to have access to a case officer on a one-to-one basis to agree their own personal development plan.  The personal development plans for children in schools have had a major and positive effect on the education of children.  They have stopped them from being isolated in the classroom and have given them a focus and a way forward.</p> <p>My daughter is not working in Dunnes Stores but she is working in Mace and she is very happy with her 20 to 25 hours.  She gets enough to do her.  If she handed up a wee bit more, I would be even happier.  I keep telling her to hand it all up and she will get it all back, like my mother used to tell me, but it does not work these days.</p> <p>We have to look at new ways in education.  The Acting Chairman knows one of the CEOs of the new education and training boards, Mr. Martin O'Brien, who is amazing at coming forward with flexible forms of education.  I am sure that is the same in most of the ETBs.</p> <p>I recognise the great work the Government is doing and has done in difficult circumstances and the moves forward we have made.  There is work to be done and that work should focus on enhancing not just the economic status but also the self-esteem of lone parents, particularly young lone parents.  I quite often deal with young lone parents in regard to housing and other issues.  We must value them as people and give them a way forward.  I urge the Minister and the Government to continue to enhance their work in that regard.</p></speech>

It is not often I disagree with Senator D'Arcy and it is not often I criticise him in this House, but I have to say I found his remarks in regard to the Dunnes Stores workers to be quite flippant.  The reality is that those workers are at the moment being exploited by an employer and there are many people on low-hours contracts who do not want to be on them and who should be working full-time.  I do not think we should be flippant about it.  It is not just the Dunnes Stores workers.  There are many workers in the hospitality sector, the tourism sector and in other sectors, such as administration and child care, who work for low pay.  It is interesting that the majority of those who are working in low-paid jobs are women.  We see from the EUROSTAT figures and its report, from the OECD report, from the TASC report and from all of the reports which look at low pay that the majority of those workers are women.</p> <p>It is difficult to congratulate this Government on anything it has done for lone parents.  What we have seen from this Government since it came into office have been cruel and savage cuts to the most vulnerable in society, in particular lone parents but also their children.  It is also impossible not to be cynical about its crude and dysfunctional so-called activation measures which brutally compel lone parents to seek employment.  Budget after budget, from the moment this Government took office, it has targeted lone-parent families.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Cullinane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2357"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2357&amp;amp;pid=DavidCullinane&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I sat in this Chamber when the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, talked about changes to lone parent payments whereby the payment would cease when the child was aged over seven years.  I was here when she said she would not follow through on the proposal unless there was serious investment in child care to provide proper, affordable and accessible child care for all citizens.  She went ahead anyway, although we have had nothing like the investment in child care that we need.  Child care is the most significant barrier for many lone parents, particularly women but some men also.  Although it is one of the most serious issues, the Government has done little to deal with it.  The Minister disallowed lone parents on community employment schemes from retaining a partial payment from the one-parent family scheme.  She eliminated the half-rate payments lone parents had been able to receive on certain social insurance schemes.  She abolished the six-month transitional OPF payment and ended the disregard for income in respect of home help, which was work in which many lone parents engaged.  She cut the earnings disregard for lone parents in low-paid employment from &euro;146.50 to &euro;90.  Lone parents were also hit by her cuts to the fuel allowance, the hike in the contribution towards rent supplement, and cuts to the back to school clothing and footwear allowance and child benefit.</p><p>Almost all the secondary benefit cuts the Government has made have primarily hit women and lone parents.  In budget after budget and cut after cut, those who had the least to give and had nothing to do with causing the economic crisis were hit.  Lone parents are a very good example of this.  The T&aacute;naiste has continued to reduce the cut-off age for the OPF payment scheme and intends dropping it to just seven years in July.  The reduction in the cut-off age to seven years will see almost 12,000 lone parents suffer a financial loss of up to &euro;86 per week, which is a huge amount of money for lone parents, which they cannot afford to lose.  Some 6,400 lone parents will lose up to &euro;36.50 per week, 4,500 lone parents will lose up to &euro;57 per week and 800 lone parents who are also carers will lose a staggering &euro;86 per week.  The only lone parents who will suffer an immediate financial loss from the move are those who are already in work.</p><p>Although the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection is aware of all this, she continues to pretend that the reason for her crusade against lone parents is that she wants them to move into work.  This is a very crude way for the Minister to go about it.  Although many lone parents would love to be able to work and want to get back into employment, the jobs are not there.  They are the very people who go into low-paid jobs.  There is a huge amount of in-work poverty and many poverty traps, about which we spoke earlier today.  When they return to work, they lose many of the benefits and social security supports they had, and it does not pay.  There was a time when getting a job was the best route out of poverty.  However, a recent OECD report showed that 20% of workers in the State are in low-paid jobs, and 14% of workers, mainly women, suffer from multiple deprivation and in-work poverty.  These are staggering figures.</p><p>Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy talked about looking forward, and we hear from the Government about economic recovery.  We should celebrate economic recovery, which we all want.  We want as much wealth as possible.  There is no quarrel about it.  The quarrel is about what we do with the money when we have it.  In the previous budget, the Government cut the top rate of tax by 1% for those who needed it least, while doing precious little for those who have borne the brunt of savage cut after cut.  This is the unfairness many people see in the Government&rsquo;s policy choices.</p><p>Although it gives nobody any pleasure to criticise the Government, it is very difficult to commend the Government or say anything good about what it has done for lone parents when the reality is the opposite.  Lone parents have been targeted and penalised, and have suffered and borne the brunt of cut after cut by the Government.  If we are to have a recovery and celebrate it, and if the Government wants people to feel the effects of it, we could target lone parents, lift them out of poverty and put in place measures that deal with the reality of their lives.  I suggest the Government do this in the next budget as a priority.</p></speech>

I commend the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, on the reform measures she has introduced.  I second the amendment to the motion, if that is necessary.  Senator Moloney, who has a long track record of working on the issue, has already spoken on behalf of the Labour Party group in the House.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection, under the chairmanship of Deputy Tuffy, has done a great deal of work on the issue.  Given that there has been much empty rhetoric in the House, I will make three key points on which we can all agree.</p> <p>First, it is important to acknowledge the diversity of lone parents.  They are not a homogenous group and it is important that we do not stigmatise or stereotype lone parents by referring to all lone parents as poverty-stricken or stuck for a few shillings.  Census figures tell us that more than 200,000 family units with children are headed by lone parents, comprising over 18% of family units and 25% of family units with children.  As of January 2015, there are 69,773 recipients of the lone family payment.  According to the data available, 42% of lone parents are at work, and this is the principal economic status of lone parents.  It is important to point out that there is a very broad diversity of lone parents and that we should not stereotype or stigmatise them in any way.</p> <p>Everybody who has spoken agrees that the current system of payment is not working.  The system was introduced in 1997 to replace what had previously been the unmarried mothers&rsquo; allowance.  The unmarried mothers&rsquo; allowance was very progressive when it was originally introduced to bring single mothers out of the poverty trap, enable them to rear children alone and replace the appalling situation for lone parents which involved mother and baby homes, women being forced to give babies up for adoption, women travelling to England to have babies there and the dreadful stigmatising of lone parents that took place right up until the 1980s.  The genesis of the lone parent allowance has been very progressive.  However, everybody acknowledges that the current one-parent family payment has not succeeded in bringing single-parent families out of the poverty trap.  Everybody has pointed out that unacceptable levels of poverty remain among lone-parent families.  Even during the height of the economic boom, lone-parent families were at much more risk of consistent poverty than the population as a whole, and we must acknowledge this.  Reform was necessary, and was recommended in the 2006 report on proposals for supporting lone parents, five years before the Government took office.  The report recommended a time limit for receipt of payments and that lone parents should be engaged with in a systematic manner to facilitate movement to education, training and employment.</p> <p>We can all agree on my third point, which is, as Senator Moloney put it so succinctly, that the best way out of poverty and social exclusion is through education and employment and that keeping people out of the labour force and away from employment opportunities for long periods of time is no more than a welfare and poverty trap.  The aim of these reforms is to reduce long-term welfare dependency for lone-parent families by ending the expectation that lone parents will remain outside the workforce for ten or more years.  This is very important for all of us.  We are all conscious, from our personal and family experience, of the vital importance of education and employment opportunities in order to enable people to escape poverty and welfare traps.</p> <p>It is difficult to listen to Sinn F&eacute;in's views on the issue given that the party is in government in Northern Ireland and that similar reforms were introduced across the UK some time ago.  Income support for lone parents in the UK ceases when the youngest child reaches the age of five.  There has been a general move across Europe away from long-term and unconditional support towards more active engagement and work activation measures of the sort that have been introduced here.  We must all agree with it in principle.  I cannot see how anybody could support the current system without some measure of reform.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We know the reforms began to be introduced on a phased basis before the Government took office.  I pay tribute to the Minister and the Oireachtas committee for seeking to ensure the reforms were impacted in a way that was positive and did not lead to income loss.  Two issues have been raised and there is a critique of the reforms.  The first is access to child care and the Government has put a very significant amount of money in place to ensure there is support for child care programmes but there is not sufficient affordability and accessibility of child care.  I speak as a parent of young children and a user of child care services.  I know the cost of child care and it is a major issue the Government must do more on.  I am hopeful the Government will do more on this during the year to come.</p><p>The other issue raised was the minority of lone parents affected by the loss of income in July because they are already on the family income supplement and have reached the cut-off age for the one parent family payment.  Deputy Joanna Tuffy has engaged with this issue through the committee she chairs and has pointed out that all those transitioning to the jobseeker's transitional allowance, who are working fewer than 19 hours, are in the group about whom there should be most concern and with whom there should be the greatest engagement.  Deputy Tuffy pointed out on that lone parents currently on the one parent family payment can improve their access to income if working hours are increased to 19 hours.  Deputy Tuffy has provided an example of a lone parent of three children who, if she increased her hours from 15 hours to 19 and moved from the jobseeker's transitional payment to the family income supplement and the back to work dividend, she would be better off by up to &euro;200 per week.  It is important there is engagement with those most affected.  The reforms brought forward envisage extensive engagement, increased opportunity to engage with education, training and employment supports and services and aim to develop the skill set of lone parents with the aim of securing access to employment in the first place.  Others have pointed out the need for access to education and training in the first place, which is also very important.</p><p>The role of employers is very important and Senator Moloney referred to providing incentives for employers to provide school hours employment.  The level of school hours employment, of 20 hours, covers the time when children above seven years are in school and this is the kind of employment we are looking at.  Marks &amp;amp; Spencer's does this and it is also possible in the Civil Service.  We must examine ways of doing this.</p><p>We should also provide for cr&egrave;ches in workplaces.  Trinity College Dublin is a good example of a workplace that has provided a cr&egrave;che for a long time and others paid tribute to the incoming president of Trinity College Dublin student union, Lynn Ruane, who is returning to education.  Across third level, we see a strong commitment to provide child care facilities but it must be supported further and more strongly by the Government.</p></speech>

I welcome some lone parents and some children to the Gallery.  Bringing in children shows that child care is important.  It is amazing that reforms meant to do such good have raised such public debate and fear among lone parents.  When putting in place reform, it is important to spell out why it is being done.  According to the media, it is all about cutting money from lone parents.  The benefits of what this is supposed to do, what it hopefully will do, are not being enunciated.  I hope the debate today will ensure the Minister of State gets what needs to be done, clarified and changed.  The aims of the reform were to provide the necessary support to help lone parents gain the necessary training, education and employment and to develop their skills.  Any lone parent has no objection to that objective because that is what people want for themselves.  If their children are gone back to school and are not babies, most lone parents I know would love to go back to training and education and to be helped to do so.  That is the objective of this.  Perhaps the wrong message is going out.</p><p>The reform should also reduce long-term social welfare dependency.  No parent wants to be that way but the current system helps them to be that way and to be unemployed and on long-term payments for so long.  The figures show that this is not working.  The current system is not working for parents and they are the most important element, as are the children.  Significant investment has been put in, including &euro;1 billion per year from 2008 but has failed to prevent lone parents from being in consistent poverty.  We saw the poverty rating two weeks ago, with lone parents working out much worse than anyone else.  This particularly applies to women and 87% of lone parents are women.  That is a debate that another Senator raised.  In 2004, lone parents were four and a half times more at risk of consistent poverty compared to the population as a whole.  They must be helped out of poverty.  We must help everyone out of poverty but lone parents in particular because they are vulnerable and the children are vulnerable.</p><p>Looking at examples from across the globe, we see New Zealand, the Netherlands and United Kingdom, where the equivalent of lone parent support ceases when the youngest child is aged five.  There is an important caveat, which is child care.  I hope the Minister of State, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Joan Burton, and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly, are listening.  I have spoken about child care <i>ad infinitum</i>.  Some 20 years ago, when I was on South Dublin County Council, I set up the first cr&egrave;che in a local authority in Ireland.  If we do not have child care, we will not facilitate people going back to work.  The cr&egrave;che was subsidised to get people, particularly women, into work and it was the first in Ireland.  There are now a few of them.  If there is not someone to mind their children, people cannot go back to work.  We cannot put the cart before the horse and must provide for child care.  Every Department must row in behind the idea and get child care in order.  There are subsidies in place and I am sure the Minister of State will say that, with this reform, comes extended child care benefits for people on the family income supplement and the back to education allowance.  We must acknowledge that the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Joan Burton, has done this and more subsidised places and funding are available.</p><p>The family income supplement is reviewed annually and the Department recently amended the regulations allowing family income supplement to increase automatically to offset the loss from the one parent family payment.  Until I researched further, I did not realise that because it was not stated often.  Parents thinking about transitioning from one scheme to the other and considering going back to education should have this made more clear to them.  Parents are hearing that they will be worse off by a certain amount, regardless of the fact that 20,000 lone parents will experience no change and some will experience an increase.  One example, which Senator Bacik referred to, is a person with three children earning &euro;20 an hour.  By increasing the number of hours worked from 15 to 19 and moving from the one parent family payment to the back to education allowance, the person will be better off by &euro;185 per week.  That is by increasing part-time employment by four hours and the child of seven years is in school so the parent does not need child care.  The parent will be home from work at the time the child is home from school.  We must examine the cohort of families with children who must be held to go back to work if they want to.  No one will be forced and that is an important point.  With regard to child care, parents in the home should be facilitated to make a choice.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator C&aacute;it Keane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2359"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2359&amp;amp;pid=CaitKeane&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I know the Minister, Deputy Reilly, is working on the question of whether the best place for children under one year of age is in child care or with their parents at home.  The whole thing has to work together for the benefit of the everyone.  As it stands, it is not working for anybody.  It is not working for lone parents at all and they are the most important people.  Money is being put into this area.  The current state of poverty of lone parents means they need to be helped.  That is our objective and I hope we will achieve it.  I hope that by working with the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister, Deputy Reilly, we can ensure a better system of child care is in place by the end of this year to help lone parents and everybody else who is facing this dilemma.  The back to education scheme is also important.  As another Senator said, education is the most important thing for lone parents.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-04-15a.156" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1176" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015041500002#AAA00200"><p>This has been a very good debate.  I thank the T&aacute;naiste for her passionate and systematic outline of what she is doing and why she is doing it.  I am also grateful to the Senators who spoke during the debate.  We have demonstrated our common passion and respect for single parents.  It is great to hear that coming from the Seanad.  We accept that the reforms initiated by the Government are based on passion and respect for single parents.  Our criticisms of some of those policies and our recommendations for change are also based on that.  We do not think the Government has got it right yet.  It has moved back from some of the changes it initiated.  We think the Government needs to move back from more of them.</p><p>Government Senators, in particular, put forward views during the debate about some of the things the Government is doing, but unfortunately those things do not really bridge the gaps we have identified.  They are not putting food on the table or fuel in the tank.  They are not ensuring quality child care is accessible.  We will continue to argue that more needs to be done, particularly with regard to raising the rationale that underlies much of the policy.  Many of us spoke about the importance of education and employment in terms of enabling people to get out of poverty.  We mentioned the failure to provide for the child care that needs to be in place in order to support that.  We will continue to say there is a need not only for education and jobs, but also for an acknowledgement that parental responsibility of care in a one-parent family is equivalent to that in a two-parent family.  We do not believe lone parents should be compelled to go into full-time work after their youngest child has reached the age of 14, particularly in the absence of adequate and affordable quality child care supports.  This is an example of where current Government policy is neither sufficient nor acceptable.</p><p>I suppose we question some of the policies that are currently in place and have not been changed.  While we acknowledge the decision to establish the jobseeker's allowance transition payment in recognition of the care duties of those parenting alone whose children are between the ages of seven and 13, we believe the care duties of those parenting alone whose children are aged 14 and over are not recognised.  This means the need and ability of each parent to balance care and work or education, and his or her freedom to make appropriate parenting choices, particularly in one-parent families, is not properly recognised.  It is for that reason that we believe there is no equality of family status in this regard.  We accept that the jobseeker's allowance transition payment has been introduced, but it is important to remember that the income disregard which was put in place within that structure to facilitate additional child care costs is still lower than that which applies under the one-parent family payment.  Some families will lose income as a result.</p><p>We have based many of our arguments on the figures that we have drawn from our research.  Those figures suggest that the lone parents who are losing out financially as a result of the way these changes are operating do not represent a small minority.  This is affecting more than a small minority, particularly because we still do not have enough affordable and accessible child care arrangements for the parents of one-parent families.  We accept and welcome that provision has been made for access to Intreo and to personal case officers, but we do not think there is any justification for cutting the income of working lone parents to pay for this.  They already constitute the poorest group.  There is less of a financial incentive for a lone parent to work because of child care costs.  The only people who can avail of the back to work family dividend are those who can get their employers to agree to guaranteed contracts.  Many lone parents work in the retail industry and are therefore caught in a trap of lower hours.  We have already spoken about after-school places.  Many speakers indicated that while they welcome the establishment of such initiatives, there has been poor take-up in some cases because they were not designed around parents' needs.</p><p>I would like to speak about the issue of education with specific reference to parents staying in full-time higher education.  While there has been a move back from some of the changes that were made, it should be noted that those single parents who moved to the back to education allowance, as distinct from the jobseeker's allowance transition payment, will not get a maintenance grant.  We are concerned that access to education, especially higher education, for lone parents in the future may not be guaranteed for one-parent families.  An active inclusion approach is welcome.  We are welcoming that.  However, we think that a failure to recognise adequately the responsibility of care for one-parent families is continuing to underlie all of the Government's policies.  It is being recognised in words, but not necessarily in terms of the actions that are required to acknowledge the caring responsibility of one-parent families.  That is not happening yet.  For example, we do not understand why it has been decided that 14 is the appropriate age at which payment transition should happen.  We have heard the argument that the more time a single parent spends in part-time work, the less time it might take him or her to move out of poverty.  We do not feel that the other side of our responsibility to one-parent families, in relation to their care, has been sufficiently acknowledged.</p><p>I have reviewed the Government amendment carefully but I have not seen any statement that there will be any kind of review of policies.  Our motion concluded by calling on the Government to &quot;engage in a comprehensive review&quot; in light of the concerns we have.  I note and welcome the reference in the T&aacute;naiste's speech to two reviews that will be going on.  The first review, to be carried out by Dr. Michelle Millar, will identify best practice in how to assist lone parents to improve their access to education and employment - we believe housing should also be included in this context - to ensure they have greater opportunities for their families.  It seems that a second review will stem from her request to the Labour Market Council to specifically examine how employers can assist lone parents to increase their hours, thereby enabling them to qualify for family income supplement.  My colleague with whom I have consulted and I share the hope that these two significant reviews will include a questioning of some of the fundamental assumptions which, as we have tried to point out, have been underlying the policies that have been adopted to date.  Indeed, some of the changes brought about by this Government may to a certain extent have represented an acceptance of the incorrectness of those assumptions.</p><p>I have decided that I will not push this to a vote.  I assume the Government will agree that we can feed into those reviews and into the work of the joint committee, which has been mentioned by Senator Bacik and which I acknowledged in my earlier remarks, some of the more extensive recommendations that have come from working with lone parents and their families, particularly at the civic forum.  This has been a fine debate.  I am grateful and delighted to hear that there is a commitment to common respect for one-parent families, particularly single parents who have ambitions to earn, care and learn.  As I said at the outset, this is necessary to enable them to participate in, and find their place in, the building of the Ireland that all the rest of us hope to have an opportunity to build.</p></speech>
