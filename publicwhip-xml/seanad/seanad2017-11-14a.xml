Today I raise the matter of having the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme, known as TAMS II, include the generation capacity that is required for farmyards.  As the Minister of State is aware, TAMS II has been a very successful scheme.  It provided important funding for farm equipment in order to ensure expansion.  Under the dairy equipment scheme, TAMS II has funded milking parlours, milk cooling equipment, water heating, and also in-parlour feeding systems.  The anomaly in the system, unfortunately, is generation capacity, which is required when or if there is an outage of power.</p><p>In the middle of October this year, we had a weather event which was amazing in so many ways.  The south west of Ireland was greatly affected.  At one stage, 385,000 were without power.  This included farms, businesses and the wider members of the public.  The knock-on effect that had on the agricultural community was immense.  There has been a large expansion in agriculture, particularly in the dairy herd.  Over the last four years the number of dairy cows has increased by 300,000 to 1.4 million.  With such a large expansion, there has been a major increase in plant size and capacity.  Milking parlours and bulk tanks have all been expanded.  At the back of that, the one thing that has not increased is the generating capacity.  The hardship that farmers and animals went through during this unfortunate weather event was immense.  It took ten days for some of these areas to have power again.  </p><p>In many ways, for those of us that were affected, it is very hard to describe.  There were situations where generators were being moved continuously in order that cows could be milked at least once a day.  There was an article in the <i>Southern Star</i>a few weeks ago describing how one man milked 1,200 cows, moving a generator seven times in a 24-hour period.  That was the level of work required to ensure that his cows, or the cows in his community were milked.  People worked together. </p><p>What I am seeking here today is that TAMS II should be amended to include generators.  Generators are a huge part of the industry.  We have seen a deficit in generating capacity.  TAMS II allows for so many things to help the agriculture industry to expand.  I have mentioned milking parlours, cooling systems, store equipment, water heating and in-parlour feeding systems.  It is certain that the anomaly is the lack of generation.  We need to include that as an important part, so that the industry that is worth billions to us and to this economy can develop.  It is, in many ways, the last piece of the jigsaw.  I hope today that we can put on the agenda that the Minister of State can review TAMS II, to ensure the anomaly can be addressed, and that the generating capacity shortfall in the dairy industry, that unfortunately we have all seen, can be addressed as well.  I thank the Minister of State.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-11-14a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1356" speakername="Andrew Doyle" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017111400002#C00200"><p>I thank Senator Lombard for raising this matter and welcome the opportunity to outline the position regarding TAMS, known as TAMS II.</p> <p>During 2015, a suite of six measures were announced under TAMS II.  These measures were launched under the Rural Development Programme 2014 to 2020 and are co-funded under the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, EAFRD.  The measures provide grants for capital investment in physical assets to assist the Irish agriculture sector to respond to a range of policy challenges.  The six measures initially launched were: the young farmers capital investment scheme; the dairy equipment scheme, the organic capital investment scheme, the animal welfare, safety and nutrient storage scheme; the low emission slurry spreading scheme, and the pig and poultry investment scheme.</p> <p>Among the objectives of the scheme are to enable growth and competitiveness in the sector, addressing environmental and climate change issues, supporting the increased efficiency on holdings and improving animal health and welfare.</p> <p>In addition to these objectives, the young farmers capital investment scheme aims to address one of the key structural issues in the sector by specifically targeting support at young trained farmers by offering them a higher rate of grant aid of 60% compared to the standard rate of 40%.  In March of this year an additional measure, the tillage capital investment scheme, was added to the list of measures.  One of the objectives of this scheme is to facilitate the tillage sector to develop a targeted and precise approach focusing on environmental dividends, efficiency and growth.</p> <p>There is a huge variety of items available under the suite of seven TAMS II measures.   As in all measures, applications and payment claims must be made online, either by the farmer or by an adviser authorised to act on their behalf.  The financial allocation in respect of TAMS Il for the full Rural Development Plan period will be in the region of &euro;395 million.  In order to encourage the drawdown of funding, provide increased budget certainty and to ensure that all farmers can avail of funding over the entire period of the Rural Development Programme, the length of time in which to undertake the works approved under the sixth tranche onwards was reduced from the three year period in previous tranches to six months for mobile equipment and twelve months for fixed building works.  The period for the completion of works approved or to be approved under previous tranches remains unchanged.</p> <p>I am delighted that the scheme has proved to be so popular with Irish farmers with over 15,000 applications submitted to date.  Of these, over 11,500 or over 75% have been approved to commence work.  Approvals issue on an ongoing basis with approvals under the most recent tranche due to commence shortly.  The figures are much lower, however, when it comes to submission of payment claims by farmers.  It is open to approved applicants to submit an online payment claim as soon as they are in a position to do so.  The timing of the submission of a payment claim, within the approved deadline, is entirely a matter for the individual farmer and it is up to them when they carry out the approved works.  To date, only 2,670 payment claims have been submitted.  The Department has actively encouraged all approved applicants to submit payment claims, including by contacting approved applicants individually by text message.  I would urge all approved applicants who have completed their works to submit a payment claim as soon as they are in a position to do so. </p> <p>To date, payments have issued to just under 2,000 cases amounting to over &euro;27.8 million.  Payment claims submitted are examined and paid as soon as possible after they have been submitted.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Andrew Doyle:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2170"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2170&amp;amp;pid=AndrewDoyle&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Where issues arise with a payment claim the applicant concerned is contacted directly by the Department to resolve outstanding issues.  All 11,500 approvals issued represent potential outstanding liabilities for the Department.  As regards the addition of generators or any other investment, it is simply the case that until the existing approvals mature to payment stage or the timeframe of the approval expires, then we must wait and maintain a budgetary provision to make payments.  There is a commitment which we have made to farmers under the scheme and it is our full intention to honour this commitment.</p><p>At this point in time I am not in a position to add generators to the comprehensive list of investment items already approved under the suite of seven existing TAMS measures.  I do appreciate the logic behind the Senator's case but I hope he will appreciate that until we know where we stand with the budget commitments, it is very difficult to commit to anything further.</p></speech>

It is amazing that out of 11,500 applications only 2,650 have submitted payment claims and only 2,000 have been paid.  That suggests to me that by the end of the scheme not all of the 11,500 applicants might be looking for payment as they might not go ahead with the work as they could have changed their mind due to finance or a myriad of issues.  In that scenario would the Minister consider adding generators?  A suite of measures has been granted but there has been a failure to grant the back-up measure which is key to ensuring that the industry which is so vital can develop.</p></speech>

Senator Lombard has seen for himself the very low rate of claims for payments submitted so far amounting to &euro;27.8 million, which is less than 10% of the full allocation.  The reason for changing from three years to one year was to try to speed it up so that there would be a more real-time assessment.  Until we get to that point it will be difficult to commit but it is intended that the money will be spent.  In future, there may well be an opportunity to revise the scheme further.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State, Deputy John Paul Phelan.  He is very welcome to the House.  I thank him for his presence.  I wish to raise with him the Milltown group sewerage scheme which is located outside Monaghan town.  I raised the issue with his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy English, earlier in the year.  We were hopeful the announcement would be made before the end of the current year, 2017.  Milltown was one of six schemes identified for funding under the multi-annual programme 2016 to 2018.  What we are dealing with here is a cluster of approximately 30 septic tanks that are causing some environmental issues and are a cause of concern.  The case has been proven and it has been submitted to the Department, which is fully aware of the situation.  In order for the scheme to proceed it is vital that 90% funding is secured.  Otherwise, the scheme will not go ahead.  Earlier in the year the Minister of State, Deputy English, gave a verbal commitment when he was in the House that that would be the case.</p> <p>I commend the residents of the Milltown area on the significant work they have put into getting to this point.  The work they had to do was exhausting and onerous.  I acknowledge the contribution of Monaghan County Council in that regard also.  What we are seeking this afternoon is an announcement from the Minister of State that the 90% funding has been ring-fenced and secured for this project and that the work will commence in 2018.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Robbie Gallagher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2471"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> There are two other issues on which I would like the Minister of State to comment briefly, if he does not mind.  First, could he or his Department indicate when the next scheme will commence?  The current one expires in 2018.  Has he any proposal to announce a new one for 2018 onwards?  I hope there will be an increase in the number of successful applicants.  As he knows, only six schemes have been funded in the entire State over the past three years.  This is a very low number.  We are all conscious of the issues that septic tanks can cause for the environment.</p><p>Second, the scheme is very onerous on residents and communities.  A considerable amount of work is involved for them in submitting an application.  Those concerned have to form companies, become company directors and hire engineers.  It is very onerous and unfair on people whose skills might not lie in this area.  I would like to believe that, in the future, the relevant local authority will be funded and that it will manage the entire project from start to finish.</p></speech>

I am answering on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  With regard to his two final points, on a new scheme and the make-up of the current one, there are no firm proposals yet but the Department will be considering how the scheme worked and examining factors that the Senator mentioned, such as the workload for local communities before making any announcement on whether there will be a renewal.</p> <p>The Department's new multi-annual rural water programme for the period 2016 to 2018 includes funding of group sewerage schemes through measure 4(d) where clustering of households on individual septic tanks is not a viable option, particularly from an environmental perspective.  In 2015, the Department received sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to increase the maximum grant per household to &euro;6,750, up from &euro;6,500, to cover a limited number of new demonstration group sewerage schemes &mdash; two per year.  In addition, sanction was given for these new demonstration group sewerage schemes in exceptional circumstances to avail of a supplemental grant subject to the Department's approval where the project represents the most economically advantageous option.  Where a supplemental grant is approved, the overall funding from the rural water programme is limited to 90% of the cost per house, subject to a minimum contribution of &euro;2,250 per house.</p> <p>In January 2016, local authorities were invited to submit bids for consideration by the Department under the new multi-annual water programme for the period 2016 to 2018.  In total, 83 bids were received from 17 local authorities for funding under measure 4(d) of the new programme.  The proposed Milltown group sewerage scheme was included by Monaghan County Council in its funding bids under the new measure.  The proposed scheme, with a then estimated cost of &euro;280,000, was expected to cover 32 houses and have a unit cost of &euro;8,750 per house.  I understand that the Milltown group sewerage scheme proceeded to tender stage in 2016, with an estimated overall cost of &euro;358,000, to cover 30 houses, giving a unit cost of &euro;11,933 per house.</p> <p>Under the new multi-annual funding framework, an expert panel was convened by the Department to examine the 2016 bids from local authorities for projects under a number of the programme's measures, including measure 4(d), and to make recommendations to the Department on funding.  The panel recommended a priority list to the Department under this measure, including the Milltown scheme, at priority 5.  The Department accepted the recommendations in full when approving schemes under the new programme and making funding allocations for 2016.  As only two demonstration group sewerage schemes can be advanced in any given year, funding was not available to Monaghan County Council for the Milltown scheme in 2016 or 2017.  The Department intends to make funding allocations under the programme to local authorities for 2018 early in the new year.  Monaghan County Council will be advised on funding for the Milltown scheme at that point.</p></speech>

At a time when Irish Water is actively informing all those who are due refunds, there is little detail available regarding how equality for other water users can be achieved.  I am hosting a public meeting later this week in Mayo on the issue which reflects the frustration of those who do not yet know how their access to water will be provided and how it will be funded into the future.  Even when the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, was introducing the Water Services Bill in the D&aacute;il, he noted that the legislation provides clarity on public water and wastewater services but that there is still some distance to go in achieving clarity for the group water schemes.</p> <p>As the Minister of State will be aware, the Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services reported earlier this year and stated that the committee recommends that the principles of equity of treatment and equivalent financial support should be applied equally between households on public water supplies and those on group water schemes, group sewerage schemes and those using domestic wastewater treatment systems and individual domestic water supplies.  It is not good enough that many low-income households in rural Ireland have to continue to pay twice for water as matters currently stand.  I ask why such a key recommendation of both the expert report and the Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services has not yet been implemented.  The legislation being put forward at present should have included, as my colleague, Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin, stated, provision for group water schemes.</p> <p>The key difference is that group water schemes receive an annual subsidy of &euro;70 per household but it does not cover the full annual cost of accessing the water supply.  Those connected to a public water supply who are currently customers of Irish Water do not pay an annual charge for accessing that supply and equity would mean that the State would cover the full annual cost of the group water scheme users accessing the water supply.</p> <p>The submission of the National Federation of Group Water Schemes to the special committee showed the experience and extraordinary voluntary effort that goes into every scheme and this is often neglected in the debate around the water supply.  These are friends and neighbours.  They are not debt collectors.  They have all of their own issues, their own household bills, their own health concerns, etc.  These are volunteers and they find it increasingly difficult to collect payment for what is an essential service which should be supplied.</p> <p>Another important matter is the need for a proper timely programme to be put in place to facilitate the takeover of schemes.  This currently takes far too long and the schemes are left in doubt as to when the necessary upgrades and takeovers will happen.  There is a need for clarity around that as well.</p> <p>How far progressed is the review process on the subsidy and will the Exchequer funding in the form of subsidy payments be reflected in the provision of water to households on group water schemes in the same manner as the rest of the country out of general taxation?  If the only clarity to come out of the Water Services Bill is that water is now paid for through general taxation, it is only fair to ask for the same regime to apply right across the State.</p></speech>

My late father was a founder member of the group scheme in our area, along with another local man.  Both have gone to their eternal reward at this stage.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy John Paul Phelan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2004"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2004&amp;amp;pid=JohnPaulPhelan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->  In regard to the specific question asked, in recommendation 6.1 of its report the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services recommended that the principles of equity of treatment and equivalent financial support should be applied equally between households on public water supplies and those in group water schemes and group sewerage schemes, those using domestic wastewater treatment systems and those using individual water supplies.  It also recommended that the Department conduct a review, in co-ordination with the National Federation of Group Water Schemes and other relevant stakeholders, to quantify what additional investment will be required to equalise treatment between those availing of domestic water services and those availing of private services.  It recommended that, following this review, identified investment should be provided.</p><p>I am happy to inform the Senator that the Department has already engaged informally with the National Federation of Group Water Schemes regarding the committee&rsquo;s recommendation for equal treatment for households on group schemes.  The Water Services Bill 2017 is currently being considered by this House.  Once the Bill is enacted, a working group involving the National Federation of Group Water Schemes and other relevant stakeholders will be formally established to advance the recommendation of the joint Oireachtas committee.</p><p>The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is committed to holding this review and to ensuring we have a vibrant, sustainable future for the group water sector.  The Minister assured the National Federation of Group Water Schemes of this when he recently met it and also when he addressed the recent rural water services conference.  It is also worth highlighting that since domestic water charges for Irish Water customers were suspended, the operational subsidy provided by the Department to group water schemes has been restored to pre-2015 levels.</p><p>It is important to note that funding is currently provided to the group water schemes either through subsidy or capital grant, and this is provided for by section 16 of the Water Services Act 2007.  Within this framework, the precise subsidy and grant arrangements, and associated eligibility, are set out in departmental circulars.  Therefore, no legislation is required to change either the subsidy arrangements or the grant provisions.</p><p>To ensure a vibrant future, the rural water sector requires clear funding and governance structures and it was for this reason that the Government reformed the way it funds the sector.  The aim of the new multiannual rural water programme 2016-18, with its more scheme-based or project-based approach, is to provide enhanced funding certainty for priority investment needs in the sector.  This year, the Department allocated &euro;17.8 million in funding for the rural water programme.  In addition to this capital investment, the Department is providing operational subsidies to the group water sector and an amount of some &euro;20.5 million is being provided in 2017.  The Department is also engaging with the sector on an ongoing basis on a range of other issues, including improving water quality, supporting a viable future for the sector and facilitating a strong voice for the sector in the national dialogue on water issues.  I can assure the Senator that this active engagement with the sector will continue into the future.</p></speech>

I welcome the initiatives that are being taken in terms of the discussions that are ongoing and the formal group that will be set up.  It is very important there is ongoing communication with the volunteers on the group water schemes so they know what is happening and that there is also a line of information to the local authorities so they are able, in particular, to facilitate those schemes that want a takeover and to ensure the investment is available.</p> <p>I am glad to know that a change in legislation is not required and that, therefore, all it takes is a budget allocation or an allocation to make sure the funding is there for the schemes that needed to be upgraded, so they can be taken over in a timely manner.  I ask that the Minister of State keeps this front and centre of all the discussions around water so people in rural Ireland have equity around this very important issue.</p></speech>

While this facility is not in my own area of Cork North-Central, it does in fact accommodate some patients from that area for respite care.  I understand that there are nine respite beds available in the hospital but that difficulties have arisen around GP cover there.  I know that the hospital and the HSE have done everything possible to get new GPs on board, but what seems to have happened is that GPs who had been providing back-up support in the hospital have since retired.</p> <p>The availability of respite care is extremely important both for elderly people and for families who are providing care at home and who need a break from this work that they are doing on a voluntary basis.  I understand that a restriction was placed on the use of the facility and I would like to hear what efforts are being made to bring it back into full use and make the services there fully available to the people of Cork East and indeed of parts of Cork North-Central.</p></speech>

I am taking this matter on behalf on my colleague, Deputy Jim Daly, Minister of State with special responsibility for mental health and older people.  The overarching policy of the Government is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  This is clearly what older people want and only those in genuine need of residential care should go down that route.  Short-term beds including respite and rehabilitation beds contribute to the provision of an integrated model of care for older people enabling them to return home following a period of hospital care or postponing admission to long-stay residential care.</p> <p>The Health Service Executive is responsible for the delivery of health and personal social services, including those at facilities such as St. Patrick&rsquo;s Community Hospital, Fermoy.  St Patrick&rsquo;s provides long-term, respite, convalescent and palliative care.  It was registered with the Health Information and Quality Authority on 28 June 2015 for a period of three years.  The hospital normally caters for people over 65 years of age but also provides care to a number of young chronically ill sick patients and palliative care to adults.  These are important services.</p> <p>The Senator will be aware that the five-year capital programme announced last year includes refurbishment works at St. Patrick&rsquo;s Community Hospital.  Challenges have emerged in the last few months, however, in respect of medical cover at the hospital which is provided by three local GP practices.  One practice provides this service three days a week.  The remaining two practices provide the service on the fourth and fifth days.  Following the resignation of a medical officer in 2017, the Health Service Executive managed, with great difficulty, to engage another GP to provide the service.  However, in September 2017 a second medical officer retired.  Despite strenuous efforts to engage another GP in the area the HSE, unfortunately, has been unable to source GP cover for the fifth day.  This is the core problem.   Contact was made with GPs in and around Fermoy and as far as Glanmire and a general email to all GPs in the GP training scheme was also sent out through UCC.  To date, no GP has expressed an interest in the post as they are unable to commit to the time involved due to the demands in their own practices.  Nor has the HSE been able to get agency cover.  </p> <p>The HSE has assured the Department of Health that efforts are continuing to source a GP.  In order to protect the 54 long-stay beds, respite service affecting nine beds in Fermoy has been curtailed for the moment.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Finian McGrath:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1822"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1822&amp;amp;pid=FinianMcGrath&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This service is now being provided by local nursing homes.  The local public health nurse is liaising with families to accommodate their relatives in alternative facilities while efforts are ongoing to source GP cover.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, has asked me to reassure Senator Burke that the officials from the Department will continue to monitor this position carefully and I have asked the HSE to keep me updated on progress.  I will bring the Senator's concerns back to the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, as well.</p></speech>

This is a major challenge.  There are nine respite beds not in full use.  I am not clear about it but I know some people have had to transfer to Mallow and other areas for respite care.  It must be prioritised.  We are facing into the winter season and families face major challenges now.  It is important that the respite facility that was there is restored.  Is whatever is being offered to GPs to provide that cover adequate?  Perhaps we should review why we can only get GPs for five days and how we can cover the final two days.  It must be given priority because we cannot afford for this service to be curtailed in any way, especially with the large number of elderly people in the area, right up to Cork city.  People are being looked after by their own families and they need a level of support.  It is very important that we prioritise this.</p></speech>

We must consider this matter in Fermoy seriously.  The Senator raised the point about respite care, and that is something the Government must prioritise, particularly in the severe and cold winter months.  I reassure the Senator that while there is a crisis, cover comes from local nursing homes.  I agree that we must examine this as a priority.</p> <p>I will bring the Senator's other point back to the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly.  It considers why it is difficult to get GPs, particularly on the fifth day.  We must think about this as there is a broader debate in my Department about social care workers; I want to ensure there are well-paid, high-quality social care personnel working with people with disabilities.  The same idea applies here.  Is there an issue with payments or cover?  I do not know the details but we must find out and see if the position can be improved.  On a positive note, the local health nurse will work very closely with families in the local area to try to accommodate people and bring up alternative facilities.  In the meantime, I will bring the Senator's concerns straight to the Minister of State.</p></speech>

It was one of the largest earthquakes to hit the region in the recent years measuring 7.3 on the Richter scale.  It is a major humanitarian crisis for the area and it will leave many sleeping out in the cold for another night.  Their homes have been absolutely destroyed and many of their relatives have been killed or severely injured.  Our thoughts are with the Iranians and Iraqis at this time.</p><p>The main issue I wish to raise today relates to rising rents and house prices.  A report from <i>daft.ie</i>shows rents have risen by 11% so far this year.  We know that up to 55% of people's monthly income goes on rent, a vast amount of money.  We see house prices increasing by up to 20% and it is difficult to see how people can save fast enough or as fast as houses are going up in value.  Ultimately, the big issue is the supply of housing and how we ensure supply is increased.  We speak about this issue almost every day in the Seanad, yet we have not really seen a solution.  We have seen homeless figures increase dramatically, yet the Government does not seem to be taking this seriously.  We need to see a proper affordable housing scheme, like the scheme Dublin City Council has provided in Poppintree.  However, that has not been forthcoming.</p><p>I know the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government is coming to the House later today and there will be a wider discussion on the matter but I wish to put on record that it is absolutely unacceptable that we have continued like this.  Every meeting that I have attended, whether at Dublin City Council or in the Seanad, has related to housing, yet nothing has been done.</p><p>I wish Martin O'Neill and the Irish team the best of luck tonight.

I will explain how I came in contact with him first.  He was a brave young journalist who, 25 years ago, first broke the story in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i>relating to the drug trials on children in State institutions when no other newspaper would touch the article and no national broadcaster would touch the issue.  At that stage, it was denounced and people thought it was all a fixation of his imagination and the imagination of others.  We know there was a subsequent tribunal of inquiry and that everything he said was correct.</p><p>It is important that we mark the passing of this man.  He had a 35-year career in print and broadcasting.  He was a freelance journalist who worked initially for <i>Magill</i>and then the <i>Sunday Press</i>, <i>The Irish Times</i>, <i>Irish Independent</i>, <i>Sunday Independent</i>, <i>Sunday Tribune</i>, <i>Sunday Business Post</i>and RT&Eacute;.  I wish to convey my sympathies to his family, especially his wife, Brian&oacute;g, and his children, Colm and Anna.</p><p>We saw in him an outstanding, exceptionally brave and courageous journalist.  He was an exceptional man who really epitomised everything that is exemplary in public life, broadcasting and commentary in terms of political and social affairs.  I wish to remember him today.  May he rest in peace.</p><p>I wish to thank all the people involved &ndash; I know this involved all Senators across the House &ndash; who campaigned for better pay and conditions for county councillors.  This has been to and fro with various people.  In particular, I wish to acknowledge the Minister and Minister of State in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  I wish to acknowledge the work of the Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, who advocated greatly for the PRSI improvements and the small improvement of an additional allowance in expenses.  I wish to acknowledge this on behalf of all sides of the House.  A committee of the House worked well on this matter.

This applies particularly to students repeating their leaving certificate who do not know their exam results until after the deadline for the school transport application.  I know people who have decided to repeat their leaving certificate, and well done to them, but who cannot get a seat on the bus.  I do not know what the school transport system is in North Korea but the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, should consider this because cases are going from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to the Department of Education and Skills and back again.  In the meantime young people who are trying to access education in rural areas cannot get the transport they are told they are eligible for.  It is not because a bigger bus is not available because it is, but because it is too costly to use for the children who are eligible.</p> <p>I ask that Deputy Halligan come to the House for another debate on school transport to examine these anomalies which deprive students of transport and access to schools.  It not only affects the student but the whole family.  In some cases the students' siblings are on the bus but they are not allowed on the bus.  Mothers or fathers then have to give up their jobs in order to drive their children to school.  This is a very serious issue in rural areas and I would like it to be addressed immediately.  I ask that, as a matter of urgency, the Minister of State come in here and answer some of these questions to save parents being sent from Billy to Jack without getting any answers.</p></speech>

The Data Protection Commissioner is conducting an investigation into the legality of how the public service card has been rolled out.  Can we have a moratorium on requirements being increased for presentation of a public service card when we do not know whether the system being introduced is fit for purpose and properly designed?</p> <p>I share the concerns of many on seeing the issue of housing in Ireland being diminished by suggestions that our figures are less than some, more than others, are average.  There has been concern at the expressions used not simply by the Government but by a former head of the Housing Authority, which is very serious, like the poor are always with us.</p> <p>There is another level to that concern.  In the past week some Ministers have spoken of how we need to be very careful about our refugee issues and other areas, such as health and housing.  The urgency of the housing issue is given as the reason that we cannot perform other good, necessary and moral actions needed in our society and at the same time we are told housing is not a problem.  I am concerned, first, at the diminishing of this issue and, second, at the idea that it be maintained in some way at some level where it can be used against others.  We have heard a lot of talk in recent months about this group versus that group.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Which do we want?  We have to make these hard choices.  It always seems to be vulnerable groups which are being set against others when these hard choices are being made.  We do not tend to drag in, for example, the massive tax relief systems.  If we are having a positive narrative, it is important that we be honest about problems and own them and that we ensure we never use a problem in one area of society to diminish progress in another.  I say this having come from the World Forum for Democracy, at which I spoke last week.  We can see the very dangerous consequences when groups which are marginalised within society are, in any sense, set against each other or encouraged to take the perspective that they are competing.  I say this to the Leader knowing that he is very committed in dealing with all of these issues.  Can we be very careful about our political narrative?  We are at a dangerous time and what might seem like an easy way to dismiss a problem now will store up greater problems.  We have seen the fascists on the streets of Poland this week.  It is of major concern to everyone across Europe.  We need to lead by providing a responsible political narrative.  I appeal to the House and the Minister via the Leader in that regard.</p></speech>

I understand more than 400 people were killed and about 7,000 injured.  It was an horrific earthquake.  I also join Senator Victor Boyhan in expressing sympathy to the family of the late Kevin Dawson who was a pioneering journalist.</p> <p>I ask for a debate on the issue of gender equality in the workplace, in the light of a number of recent developments.  On Friday we marked Equal Pay Day when the National Women's Council, IMPACT and others noted that women in Ireland worked for free on a Friday, given that, on average, they earned 14% less than their male colleagues.  Last Friday was designated as Equal Pay Day across Ireland.  It would be worth having a debate on the issue.  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton, who dealt with the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (Gender Pay Gap Information) Bill introduced by the Labour Party.  He said the Government would accept the Bill.  The Taoiseach also mentioned it in his speech on Friday.  I am delighted to see-----</p></speech>

Gender equality in the workplace goes beyond equal pay.  In recent weeks there has been momentum on issues to do with sexual harassment in the workplace.  I commend Grace Dyas, a brave young woman, for coming forward to highlight issues to do with sexual harassment in Irish theatre, most notably the Gate Theatre, to which the issue is not confined.  Since her actions, other women have come forward to talk about harassment in other spheres across the arts and other sectors.  Some years ago a law study showed that this was an issue across the legal profession.  The Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton, rather than the Minister of State, Deputy John Halligan, is probably the appropriate Minister of State to come to the House to discuss equality in the workplace, including gender equality, and how we can combat the problems, given the recent decision of the Workplace Relations Commission.  Today we published a toolkit, a resource for those experiencing harassment in the workplace, to inform them of their legal rights.  A number of us worked on it.  We need to inform those who are experiencing sexual harassment and other forms of bullying in the workplace of such toolkits.  </p> <p>I welcome the decision of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, to allow family reunification which involves, I understand, 430 persons, in the light of the defeat of the Government last week in the Seanad on the Civil Engagement Group's Bill.  However, it does not go far enough.  More needs to be done to ensure people can have close family members join them, in particular those who have fled the conflict in Syria. </p> <p>I join others in wishing the Irish team well in the crucial match against Denmark.</p></speech>

The data show, too, that the capital has benefited disproportionately from the upturn in the economy, while small rural towns have felt the worst effects of the recession in the years since it ended.  I refer, in particular, to the retail sector in rural towns.  My local newspaper, the <i>Meath Chronicle</i>, reports that there are 95 vacant units in Navan town which has a population of 30,000 people.  The reasons for this pressure on retailers include paid parking, an out-of-town shopping centre and the new show in town, rates revaluations.  In other counties the majority of small businesses have seen an increase in rates of 16%.  These are the people to whom we should have given a medal for staying open during the recession.  In many cases, they did not pay themselves a wage in an effort to keep their businesses going, but they are being submitted to these revaluations.  If more small shops are lost in rural locations, we will have no communities.  We know what has happened in the United Kingdom, where people have to travel several kilometres to purchase the basics such as milk and sugar.  The civil servants in Dublin must be told that we need a plan of action for rural Ireland.  Will the Minister for Rural and Community Development come to the House and put forward his ideas for action in that regard?  When we see a town like Navan in which there are 95 retail units vacant, we can only wonder what the situation is in smaller towns in more rural areas.  The Minister must tell us what plan of action he proposes to implement to assist the retail sector in rural areas.</p></speech>

A wonderful commemorative event took place last week when marvellous speeches were made by people like Mr. Seamus Mallon, Mr. David Trimble and my neighbour, Mr. Dick Spring.  The late Albert Reynolds was, of course, notable by his absence.  It was a great and joyous occasion but also an extremely sad one.  Most of us thought when the Agreement was signed that we would see a shift in behaviour and politics in the North of Ireland that would bring the two communities closer together and see a dismantling of the walls of bitterness and division between nationalist and unionist, Catholic and Protestant, but the sad news is that we have actually gone into reverse.  The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. James Brokenshire, is today introducing in the House of Commons a budget for Northern Ireland.  There will not be a single Irish nationalist voice taking part in that debate, which is a huge backward step.  The proud tradition of nationalist parliamentary involvement in the House of Commons dates back to the time of Daniel O'Connell and includes the great Parnell, Redmond, Dillon and all of the other parliamentarians who engaged in a constant grind to achieve more independence, including Home Rule, for the Irish, but now it has come to a shuddering halt.  Is it only a matter of time before we see a Cabinet of British Ministers appointed to administer matters in Northern Ireland?  It seems inevitable, unless politicians on all sides in the North - I am pointing the finger at no one - see sense and work together to tear down the so-called peace walls, come out of their ghettos, engage with each other and behave as elective representatives are meant to do to get good deals for the people who voted them into power.  The two major parties have huge mandates, but it seems those mandates are not being respected.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ned O'Sullivan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2233"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2233&amp;amp;pid=NedOSullivan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->All of us here in the Irish nationalist tradition have a lot to be worried about today as we have seen ourselves moving from an ever-constant grinding down of British rule and British authority on this island being dramatically reversed while all the good work of those great people I have mentioned looks it is turning to ashes.  I am from Kerry, which is a long way from the North but I have as much feeling for the North of Ireland as anybody in this country.  I appeal from my heart to the politicians in the North to get together and to work out a deal, like Martin McGuinness or Peter Robinson were able to do.  It is not beyond them.</p></speech>

This weekend I learnt to my disgust the treatment by the Department of Defence of the Jadotville heroes who are to be awarded their medal on 2 December.  They are to be denied a proper military service or military parade.</p> <p>A daughter of one of the Jadotville heroes wrote to me today.  She said her father was a man who believed in justice and equality.  She said he knew what it was like to feel segregated long before the Congo; that he knew what injustice was and how it felt to be treated unfairly by some locals and outsiders.  She wrote that he knew that from a very young age, because even though he was born on Irish soil he could have joined the British army but instead decided to join the Irish Army, but what a mistake that was, as once again he was segregated, treated like dirt and left to die, not by the people of the Congo but by his own.  The letter goes on to say that when he returned home he was called a coward, again by his own comrades, Government and Defence Forces.  She said that he also died in the care of the Defence Forces and left a young wife and five children, one of whom never got to know him.  She wrote that when his friends asked what happened to him, they were told to keep their mouth shut or their career would be on the line.  She wondered why.  She said she does not need the words "bravery", "honour" or "hero" written on a piece of paper or engraved on a plaque to tell her who or what that great man was because she already knows.  She described him as the man who held her when she was sick as a child; the man who sat and held her in his big strong arms and told her she would be all right.  She said he was the man who gave her little surprises on pay day.  However, in the blink of an eye he was the man that was there no more.  She wrote that no one cared then or now.</p> <p>I beg the Leader to go to the Taoiseach today and ask him to reverse the awful decision by the Department of Defence.  It is wrong in every way.  Those heroes are entitled to have their comrades stand by them when they receive a medal that is 56 years overdue.  I served with those men and never knew they were in Jadotville.  I knew nothing about it because it was hidden.  There is no disgrace in what they did.  They are heroes.  They deserve to be given their medal in front of their former colleagues and with a full military parade.</p></speech>

Having survived that, to be faced now with what looks to be an increase in rates is very worrying for people, especially in towns such as Balbriggan and Rush which have struggled through the recession but are coming out of it.</p> <p>The reason I rise here today is to commend Fingal County Council on good news.  The council yesterday voted to allow the CEO of the council, Paul Reid, to enter into negotiations with the European Investment Bank to seek up to &euro;70 million, which could be matched by Government funds.  I will strongly support that and I will lobby the Government to make sure that happens.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator James Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2180"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I congratulate the council because I believe it is the first mover on this issue.  The European Investment Bank exists to offer affordable loans to allow infrastructure to be developed.  In an area such as Fingal, the obvious part of Dublin that will allow for the expansion of the population and badly needed housing, it seems opportune to invest in advance in the infrastructure people need.  For once in our history we will have the infrastructure in place before the housing is built and families arrive.  This includes important infrastructure such as the greenway, which is a no-brainer in terms of the jobs created and tourism generated, an issue about which I have spoken in the House before.  I refer also to connectivity, including roads, particularly near Dublin Airport where planning permission was recently refused for five tower blocks for offices only on the grounds that there was inferior and insufficient road connectivity.  The lands have been zoned.  We need to develop these things.</p><p>There is a possibility to be a leader in other areas.  A former major waste disposal area for Dublin city, Balleally dump, had a huge amount of work done on it.  It now has the potential to be a wonderful community park, with fabulous views from the top of the man-made mountain.  There are many other areas in which there could be investment to improve the lives and well-being of the locals.  Swimming pools, for example, could be constructed.  Fingal, Swords and Balbriggan should seriously consider developing swimming pools for their populations.</p><p>I really believe it is important to acknowledge this opportunity and that we acknowledge Fingal County Council for its forward thinking.  I wish it well in its negotiations with the European Investment Bank and, subsequently, the Government.  I hope there will be a successful outcome some time in December and that we will be able to look forward to investing in projects and infrastructure, including parks, for our ever-increasing population and the youngest in the country.  In other parts of Europe the European Investment Bank has also invested in hospitals.</p></speech>

My party has been extremely active on this topic, about which I am seriously concerned.  The Department of Justice and Equality has a plan for a gambling control Bill, although it is fair to say and everyone agrees that it is long overdue at this stage, especially as it will include some provisions aimed at child protection.  I have outstanding concerns about free games which are targeted at children online and encourage risk-taking and gambling within them.  The outcomes of such games set the perfect landscape on which monetary gambling may take hold in early adulthood.  At least in the United Kingdom there has been action following a report or research last year which indicated that 500,000 children from four years and upwards were gambling.  The story is similar here.  The Gambling Commission in the United Kingdom has acted swiftly and recently ordered over 550 gambling sites to be removed immediately to remove the cute, cuddly games targeted at and designed exclusively for children.  There is the deliberate design of child-oriented games which are free to play.  It is an effective sales pitch to sell children the concept of gambling.  If the Leader was to clarify how the Government planned to address the issue, I would appreciate it.</p> <p>Come on, you boys in green.</p></speech>

Today we read that rents in Dublin, up to September 2017, had risen by over 11%.  In my city of Limerick they have risen by 10.5%.  It is frightening because the report shows that rents in Dublin city centre can be anything up to &euro;1,800 per month.  In many other cities they can be &euro;1,100 or &euro;1,200 per month.  There is a need for a cap.  Rent caps and rent pressure areas have been highlighted by the Minister, but he needs to come into the House to address the issue.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maria Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2465"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> The other matter I would like to raise, following on from Senator Reilly, is the signing with the European Investment Bank in Limerick on Thursday of &euro;85 million that we are borrowing from it in the form of a low-interest loan.  This will help towards the economic development of the city.  It is the official signing of the contract for the so-called opera centre site in Limerick where we will have businesses and office spaces.  The student population is also moving into the city centre in the form of faculties from both the University of Limerick and the Limerick Institute of Technology.  I also welcome the European Investment to both Limerick and Ireland, especially on Thursday next when the contract will be signed in Limerick for what one might call this partnership between Limerick City and County Council and the European Investment Bank.  I would encourage, as Senator Reilly has, many of the other local authorities to look at these low-interest loans and partnerships with the European Investment Bank.</p></speech>

There are 10,000 of these workers working in our hospices, in the community hospitals and in the Rehab facilities.  Some one-in-ten workers in the intellectual disability sector are section 39 workers.  They do exactly the same work as HSE workers but they are paid less.  They are paid less because in 2010 Fianna F&aacute;il when in government cut their wages and since then they have been ignored.  Whereas HSE workers have rightly been winning pay restoration, section 39 workers have not.  The 8% pay cut that was imposed on them is still in place.  As a result - I must declare an interest in that I represented a number of these workers in St. Anne's in Roscrea and the Daughters of Charity in Limerick - these workers are now voting with their feet; they are leaving.  They are people who work in incredibly challenging situations with some of the most vulnerable people in society and do an amazing job.  They go above and beyond the call of duty.</p> <p>What is disgraceful is this Government line that they are not directly employed by it.  They were not directly employed in 2010 when their pay was cut.  That is not an excuse.  There are 10,000 of these workers across the State.  SIPTU representatives met the Minister of State at the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Finian McGrath, who told them he would lobby at Cabinet level.  That tells us that the Cabinet is refusing what it must do, which is to restore pay and fairness for these workers because they do exactly the same work as their colleagues.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate as a matter of urgency with the Minister of State.  I also ask the Leader his own view.

I fully support his passion for the Defences Forces.  I feel the same.  We all feel the same sense of pride in the Defence Forces.</p> <p>With that in mind, it is important for us to note that the decision to award the medal to these Jadotville heroes was a consequence of the Government wanting to recognise that they should get full recognition and that what happened to them in 1961 should never have happened.</p></speech>

A working group was set up, with civil and military personnel on it, to organise this ceremony.  I have no problem with any of the arrangements so far, except in the following regard.  Athlone, I believe, is the right venue for it and Custume Barracks is the right place for it.  There is not a building within Custume Barracks large enough to hold everybody.  If we wanted a building big enough, we would have had to take it out of Custume Barracks.  It is fitting that it stays within Custume Barracks, which is why there will be a marquee erected for the ceremony which will only hold 390 people.  Some of the people who will be there on the day will have to be in the officers' mess watching it on a big screen, which is not ideal.  I would very much like everybody to be able to be with their family on the day but that is not possible.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gabrielle McFadden:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2399"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2399&amp;amp;pid=GabrielleMcFadden&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I agree with Senator Craughwell that the Minister of State and the Taoiseach should be asked to have a look at the fact the veterans are not going to be there in numbers.  It is very important for the families and the surviving members that their colleagues would be there to salute them on the day.  It is a very poignant moment.  Some of the families tell us their fathers came home from Jadotville and that some soldiers turned their backs on their colleagues in Custume Barracks in 1961, which was soul-destroying for them.  It would be very fitting if the same veterans could stand up at the ceremony and salute their colleagues.  I ask the Leader to ask the Minister of State or the Taoiseach to intervene on this occasion.</p></speech>

I want to thank Senator Craughwell for his very emotional contribution on the Order of Business this afternoon in regard to the Jadotville survivors and, indeed, to Senator McFadden, who gave us a brief update on the situation regarding the presentation of these long-overdue medals.  These men, who have been regarded by some in the hierarchy of the military as cowards for over 56 years, are heroes, not cowards.  They have been treated as second-class soldiers for far too long.  Quite a number of them have passed on to their eternal reward and the very least we can do in memory of those who have passed on, and for those who survive to this day, is that we make this presentation of medals.  This has been fought for on all sides of this House, including by Senators Mac Lochlainn, McFadden, Craughwell, myself and others, who have raised the issue on many occasions.  I want to pay tribute to the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, and the Minister of State with responsibility for defence, Deputy Paul Kehoe, who brought about the day that is about to happen.</p></speech>

We are in a much better place in the last 20 years because of the Good Friday Agreement, the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the Downing Street Declaration.  I was privileged and honoured to have been in Enniskillen last Sunday with the Taoiseach for the commemoration of Remembrance Day.  We were in St. Macartin's Cathedral, where there was a very dignified and solemn service.  I remember that one of the preachers referred to "the sons and daughters of Ireland" and it was wonderful to see Monsignor O'Reilly come across the street from the catholic church to commemorate these fallen people.  We have come an awful long way.</p> <p>I want to point out that up to 30,000 of those young men - and it was mostly young men - came from the Twenty-six Counties.  To take my own county of Roscommon, which is a county of only 50,000, up to 500 young men died.  We must accept that we airbrushed them out of history, although we have come a long way.  While I understand there are aspects of these symbols that are difficult, I think that to have the poppy symbol set on the background of the shamrock provides a certain atmosphere whereby we can recognise the sacrifices of those young men and also recognise the sacrifices of the men of 1916.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Frank Feighan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2014"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have come a very long way and can go further still.  I hope things will work out in the coming weeks. I understand there has been much negotiation and hope for the sake of the people of Northern Ireland and the people of the Republic of Ireland that the Assembly at Stormont will get up and running again soon.</p><p>When we were in London last week there were many politicians of Irish extraction there.  I would love to see Sinn F&eacute;in MPs take their seats at Westminster, although that is, of course, a matter for them to decide and perhaps we should not comment on it, but there are many politicians drawn from the Irish diaspora in Britain who are filling the vacuum and representing nationalism in Ireland.  One such example is Mr. Conor McGinn, originally from south Armagh but now a Labour Party MP for St. Helen's North.  He is doing considerable work with the all-party parliamentary group on the Irish in Britain.  I understand the Sinn F&eacute;in MPs are working at Westminster, although they do not, in fact, take their seats in the chamber.  I met Senator Paul Gavan there about a year ago and believe a lot of work is being done.  </p><p>Next week, on 18 November, it will be 30 years since Gary Mackay scored that wonderful goal for Scotland against Bulgaria that sent the Republic of Ireland on its way to the 1988 European Championships in Germany.  On 12 June next the Irish soccer team will be 30 years undefeated by England.  We should remember that fact this evening.</p></speech>

The broadcaster currently operates the National Symphony Orchestra and the RT&Eacute; Concert Orchestra, each consisting of approximately 40 musicians.  A total of 25 vacancies have arisen in the orchestras in the last seven years and there are fears that this may rise to a total of 40 absent musicians, the very number required for one stand-alone orchestra.  Voluntary exit packages have been offered to any musician to have left the employment of these orchestras and those who have left or retired have not been replaced.  Is RT&Eacute; winding down one of our orchestras?  This is my concern and the concern of the Musicians Union of Ireland, MUI.  If RT&Eacute; attempts to do so then it is breaking with legislation outlined in the Broadcasting Act 2009 which calls on RT&Eacute; to establish and maintain orchestras - not 'orchestra' in the singular but 'orchestras' in the plural.  Both orchestras have to be maintained in their current format and at their current numbers at the very least.  Our orchestras have had an artistic importance since the 1940s, in line with the importance of our national cultural institutions.  I ask that the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Humphreys, along with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, protect our orchestras; realise the Taoiseach's commitment to double funding for the Arts; and prevent RT&Eacute; from merging or winding down our orchestras or from operating two orchestras from a single pool of musicians.</p> <p>The National Symphony Orchestra and the RT&Eacute; Concert Orchestra are not interchangeable.  They are national orchestras and should be facilitated to return to education, outreach and national touring initiatives.  Anything less than this cannot be considered to be in any way 'national'.  RT&Eacute; is, I think, carrying out this review in the hope of reaching a certain result.  It should instead act in the spirit of its own commercial slogans: "RT&Eacute;: Supporting the Arts" and "Love your Orchestras".  </p></speech>

I want to bring up the report "A Future Together: Building a Better GP and Primary Care Service", which was launched yesterday at Trinity College.  This is very comprehensive report that highlights a number of crucial issues.  I know that we will be dealing with statements on health care tomorrow but this is an issue that needs to be prioritised.  We are spending approximately 4.5% of the total health budget on GPs and primary care when we should in fact be spending twice that.  We have in fact been dealing with the whole issue of a new GP contract for quite some time now.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colm Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2353"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is a matter that should be prioritised.  There are a number of other matters in the report that clearly identify where we need to prioritise actions.  We have the Sl&aacute;intecare report, but there must be a combination of everybody working to bring about change.  I do not understand the prioritisation that has occurred over the past two to three years.  The Health Service Executive took on an additional 2,000 administration and managerial staff while we seem to have made no progress in dealing with the GP matter.  It is something to which we need to attach priority and we need answers from both the Department and the Minister.  It should not be left to continue <i>ad infinitum </i>without any final decision on the matter.  I hope that tomorrow when we deal with the statements there might be some clarification.  I look forward to it.  It is something I will revisit and there is clear evidence from this report published yesterday of the need to prioritise this matter to build a better health service for everyone.</p></speech>

I join all Members in extending our sympathies to the Iranian and Iraqi people on the very tragic loss of life in the earthquake at the western province in Iran.  I join Senator Ardagh in her comments about the international agencies required to engage and be involved in what will be a major humanitarian aid project.  The loss of life in this tragedy is to be lamented.  I hope we, as a House, can convey through the Cathaoirleach to the Iranian ambassador our deepest sympathies on that loss of life.</p> <p>I join Members, led by Senator Boyhan, in extending our sympathies the family of Mr. Kevin Dawson on his tragic death.  As has been rightly noted this afternoon, he was a very brave and courageous journalist who brought high integrity and standards to his work.  To his wife and family we offer our deepest sympathies.  We hope they will remember and take pride in his work and the admiration that so many people had for him on the occasion of his very sad passing.</p> <p>Senators Ardagh, Higgins and Byrne commented on the ESRI report on the affordability of housing, which was published yesterday.  We will have statements later on housing.  Undoubtedly, supply is the biggest issue and there is an urgent need to increase supply not just on the social side but on the private side.  The Government is committed through Rebuilding Ireland to investment of &euro;6.6 billion in the construction of housing.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We understand that the affordable housing issue needs to be addressed as well.  </p><p>I wish to make the following points in response to Senator Higgins.  The Government has not diminished the issue of housing and it does not divide society but the language being used by some has been very polarising.  The job of Government is to be responsible for the construction of social housing and ensure that a roadmap to develop private housing is put in place.  As the Taoiseach said at the weekend, the Government is on the side of people.  Let us be honest, the Government through the policy document entitled Rebuilding Ireland, and I will not list all the different initiatives that have been put in place since we came to Government, but the Government is leading.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Murphy, has put in place a suite of measures to enhance rent pressure zones.  If the measures do not work then let us revisit them.  When I heard Deputy Barry Cowen speak on the radio this afternoon I closed my eyes and wondered had he and his party ever been in government.  I recall that we had the worst recession ever, the construction sector was decimated and the banks closed.  Now the banks are obliged to work with developers.  We need developers, landlords, social housing and to adopt a combined approach that ensures we increase supply.  I hope that we will see all of that happen.  </p><p>I join with Senator Boyhan in thanking the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and his Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, for their announcement about the rate of pay for councillors that they made at the weekend.  I know, mindful that it is a beginning, that some councillors are disappointed while others are quite happy.  We have started a process.  It behoves all of us, as Members of the House, to collectively work on behalf of the councillors.  They do a huge amount of work that goes unnoticed in some cases and very much inconveniences their families and their family life.  Their job of work is done in an extraordinary and commendable way.  I worry that we will reach the point where many councillors will walk away from local government.  Therefore, I believe we should pay them a full-time salary and reward them accordingly.  That might be a step too far for some but the Minister and Minister of State have made a step forward with the initiative, for which we commend them.</p><p>Senator Conway-Walsh raised the issue of school transport and the eligibility status for repeat students.  I presume she means the leaving certificate examination so the number of people involved must be very small.  I advise her to table the issue as a Commencement matter.  I am happy to invite the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Deputy Halligan, to discuss the issue that he raised.  </p><p>Senator Higgins made reference to the public services card.  There has been a lot of commentary in the ether about the public services card.  I wish to state that card helps customers to easily access a variety of public services and it was first introduced in 2011.  It is not a national ID card.  There has been no gargantuan cover-up by the Government or no attempt to do anything other than ensure that people can access services.  Last August, the Department issued a four-page clarification on the matter and I urge the Senator to consult the paper.  I am happy to invite the Minister to the House to discuss the matter.  Again, it might be quicker for the Senator to table a Commencement matter on the issue.  To be fair, her remarks are well intended.</p><p>Senator Bacik raised the issue of gender equality in the workplace.  I was very much struck by her ability to remember that last weekend the Taoiseach, in his Ard-Fheis speech and as part of our document, gave a commitment to make this a "republic of opportunity" and that we are committed to establishing a commission on the status of women in Ireland.  The Senator is right that the issue concerns much more than just pay.  It is also about a variety and a suite of issues that need to be tackled and put on a very proactive basis.</p><p>I join with the Senator in commending Grace Dyas and others who have come forward as part of the discourse on the issue, not just of sexual harassment, but how women are treated, and how all people are treated in the workplace let me add.  We should debate the issue.  I know that the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Humphreys, has had meetings with the Arts Council.  As the Senator has said, this matter does not just revolve around the arts community but society in general and how we address and view the issue.  I am happy to arrange a debate on the issue in the coming weeks.</p><p>Senators Butler and Reilly made reference to small towns in terms of retail and rural Ireland and rates.  I am happy to invite the relevant Minister to the House to discuss the matter.  Senator Butler has long championed the matter.  The matter must be addressed and considered in the context of the national development plan, Ireland 2040, in terms of how we can promote rural Ireland in the future. </p><p>Senators Ned O'Sullivan, Coghlan and Feighan, in a variety of guises, referenced the Good Friday Agreement, the North and the budget that was announced yesterday in the House of Commons.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The face of gambling is being changed daily by technology.  Just yesterday, I was walking on the streets of Cork and overheard a conversation between a couple.  They were talking about what they could get back from a &euro;10 stake on their phones.  It left me boggled.  It was a conversation between two people on the streets of Cork about gambling.  It set my mind thinking about the effect this issue was having on their lives.  If they were having a conversation about online gambling on their phones, what effect was it having on them?  I join with Senator Devine on that issue.  I will have a debate in the House and an update from the Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton, in that regard.  We need to address the issue of gambling as a matter of urgency.  We saw the House almost united on the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015.  We need a similar approach on gambling.  It needs to be addressed urgently and I join with the Senator on that issue.</p><p>Senator Maria Byrne also raised the issue of rents, Limerick and the European Investment Bank.  I commend her on her work on the issue.  I know tomorrow will be a good day in Limerick.  Senator Gavan raised the issue of section 39 organisations.  It is an issue with which we are all very preoccupied.  I think he will join with me in supporting the FEMPI legislation which will reverse pay cuts and which I am sure will have a beneficial effect on members of staff in section 39 organisations.  My view is very simple.  The workers deserve equal pay and deserve to be treated fairly.  I will work with any Member of the House to ensure that happens.  Government has increased funding to section 39 organisations.  It is for all us to ensure that those organisations, institutions and charities ensure that their workers are properly paid accordingly.  I am happy to work with anyone to see that happen.</p></speech>

Senator Wilson also raised section 39 organisations.  I praise Senator Feighan for his ongoing work and commend him for his interview on &quot;The View&quot; last week.  I praise all sides, in Westminster and in the Oireachtas, for the work they are carrying out.  To address Senator Colm Burke's contribution, we will have a debate tomorrow on GPs, during which we can have a discussion and I hope we will get clarity around the whole issue.  I have not read the report from Trinity College but we will debate the issue tomorrow.</p><p>Senator Warfield raised the issue of RT&Eacute;'s review of its orchestras.  I certainly hope that RT&Eacute; does not do anything as part of this review which would diminish or curtail the role of the orchestras because they are a very important part of RT&Eacute;.  It is something which many of us who pay our licence fee are happy to support because, first of all, they provide employment and, second, they bring culture and joy to our country.  The orchestras bring a uniqueness and a sophistication.  I certainly hope that RT&Eacute; will continue to support the arts through its orchestras.  Senator Paul Coghlan also made a contribution regarding the North.</p><p>Finally, I wish our soccer team every success tonight in the Aviva Stadium.  I hope that the streets of Ireland will be rocking to the sounds of &quot;<i>Ol&eacute;, ol&eacute;</i>&quot; at the conclusion of the match.  We had a good result last weekend.  Tonight will be a very challenging occasion but with the spirit of Roy Keane and the captaincy of David Meyler, I am sure the Cork element will lead Ireland to success.  On a serious note, I wish our team and the FAI every success.  As Senator Feighan rightly said, we remember Gary Mackay's great score back in the 1980s.  I hope that we will have similar joy tonight and can look forward to a summer of soccer next year.</p></speech>

I have worked in this important area since my appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora and international development.  Those present who know me well will be aware that I have a deep personal commitment to the global Irish.  I am passionate about engaging and connecting with them and providing support and assistance for them where required.  Since my appointment I have been working for and with our communities abroad.  I have met various groups and organisations in Ireland, London, Leeds, New York, Chicago, Milwaukee, Tanzania and South Africa.  I have been struck by the vibrancy and commitment of our communities abroad and the individuals, young and old, who do such incredible work in sustaining and growing those communities.</p> <p>There is a strong commitment to our global nation which is shared by many, if not all, of my colleagues present.  I will include in my remarks updates on several issues to do with the diaspora that Senators have raised previously with me and my predecessors.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2253"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2253&amp;amp;pid=CiaranCannon&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->These issues include the emigrant support programme, returning emigrants and the barriers to returning, voting rights in presidential elections and our undocumented citizens in the United States.</p><p>Through the emigrant support programme, the Department provides almost &euro;12 million to Irish organisations abroad each year, which is a tangible expression of the strong and enduring commitment of the Government and the Irish public to the global Irish.  Our priority continues to be supporting the most vulnerable members of our community abroad, with 70% of funding going to organisations which provide front-line welfare services.  I have seen the real difference that this funding makes in the lives of our people abroad.  Recently in London I met representatives of the very impressive array of organisations across Britain who receive emigrant support programme funding.  I would like to take the opportunity once again to commend the contribution of such organisations, their workers and volunteers in sustaining and supporting vibrant Irish communities across the world.  Our relationship with the diaspora goes far beyond welfare.  We also provide support for the many other aspects of Irish culture that bind us, including music, sport, business and cultural networks and the Irish language.</p><p>Our support is not just a question of funding.  The emigrant support programme also nurtures a wider sense of connection to home and reaffirms the sense among Irish people abroad that we really value them.  In this regard, I was extremely concerned at incorrect suggestions recently that the Government had somehow cut our funding to the Irish abroad in the budget.  It is important that I highlight the correct position to confirm that the Department's overall current expenditure budget for Programme A: Our People, which covers the diaspora and the emigrant support programme in general, has actually increased by &euro;2.2 million from &euro;69.6 million in 2017 to &euro;71.8 million in 2018.  Not only has the Government not cut funding for our diaspora this year but also we are delivering better, more innovative services that benefit our citizens at home and abroad.  For example, since March of this year citizens can renew their passports online.  In the case of citizens abroad, this has reduced processing time from a number of weeks to ten days plus postage time to wherever the applicant is located.  At the moment the average processing time is four to five days, and more than 100,000 passports and passport cards have been already delivered.  This commitment to innovation in the delivery of improved customer service was recognised in last week's customer experience insights, CXI, survey which placed the passport service as the top ranked Irish public sector in terms of customer experience.</p><p>In May, the Department hosted the second Global Irish Civic Forum at Dublin Castle, which several Senators also attended.  This was an extremely important opportunity for the Government to hear from the global Irish and to get their input to inform future policy development.  One key theme to emerge at the civic forum was youth engagement, and this will be a priority area for the emigrant support programme next year.</p><p>In Global Irish, Ireland's diaspora policy, the Government committed to work to facilitate the return of Irish people living abroad who wish to return to live in Ireland.  The Government continues to deliver to ensure the economic conditions which will allow those who have left Ireland return, should they wish to do so.  Separately, significant funding and support is also provided by the Department to support returning citizens.  Over the past decade more than &euro;4 million has been allocated to Irish organisations working with returning emigrants.  Through chairing the interdepartmental committee on the Irish abroad, I have been both working to ensure joined-up delivery of the Government's diaspora policy and examining issues affecting the Irish abroad and those wishing to return.  Addressing these so-called barriers or any other disproportionate administrative burdens negatively affecting Irish emigrants who wish to return to live in Ireland remains a high priority for me.  I have also commissioned an independent socio-economic report outlining what can be done to reduce red tape and overcome other obstacles facing returning emigrants.  This report will inform the work of the committee into next year.  In addition, since my appointment I have met Crosscare Migrant Project and Safe Home Ireland, both of which are engaged in this area.  I took part, with Senator Lawless, in a very useful forum on that issue in Galway, organised by Ciaran Staunton, and I have had several meetings with the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland and Insurance Ireland on making practical improvements regarding mortgage and insurance difficulties being reported by returning emigrants.  Earlier today I met again with Insurance Ireland and I am glad to report that car insurance is one priority area on which significant practical progress has been made to facilitate industry recognition of safe driving records abroad for the benefit of those who have lived abroad.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2253"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2253&amp;amp;pid=CiaranCannon&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In addition to working to ease difficulties, my Department is always looking for new and innovative ways to assist Irish people abroad and those returning.  I recently launched Back for Business, an exciting new initiative to support entrepreneurial activity among recently returned immigrants.  A period spent living abroad increases entrepreneurial inclination.  However, time spent out of the country can often result in the loss of local knowledge, contacts and networks.  Back for Business is designed to bridge that gap.  We have had a very strong response from interested applicants.  The programme will begin later this month.  Importantly for me as a representative of a rural constituency in the west, it will have a very strong regional dimension.  Returning immigrant entrepreneurs have a very important contribution to make to make to communities across the country, not just in our main cities.</p><p>Voting rights is an issue many Senators are interested in and active on.  Together with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney, I am strongly committed to extending the right to vote in presidential elections to citizens outside the State.  This will be another tangible expression of our commitment to ongoing engagement with the global Irish.  </p><p>In September, the Taoiseach gave indicative timelines for a number of upcoming referendums, with the referendum on voting rights now likely to take place in the summer of 2019, concurrent with the local and European elections.  That gives us a very important timeline to work towards.  I am in regular contact with Senator Billy Lawless and others who are very active on this issue.  Significant work is ongoing at official level between the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, my Department and other Departments, given the complexity of some of the issues involved</p><p>There is general acceptance that even if a referendum was held immediately and passed, it would not be feasible to have comprehensive arrangements in place for an extension of the franchise to have effect for the upcoming presidential election to be held before 11 November 2018.  This will require, among other things, modernisation of the voter registration process and the introduction of arrangements to facilitate those eligible to vote to exercise that franchise from outside the State. </p><p>In this regard, the Government has agreed that work should commence to effect improvements in the process with the registration of voters.  Preliminary work has commenced on the modernisation of the voter registration process, which will examine all aspects of voter registration, including the provision of registration information and practical experience from other countries which already provide voting arrangements for non-resident citizens.</p><p>On the issue of undocumented citizens in the US, the Government&rsquo;s objectives remain constant, namely, to achieve relief for the undocumented and to facilitate greater pathways for legal </p><p>migration to the United States.  We do not, however, underestimate the size of the challenge.  This policy area has been a deeply divisive issue within the US political system for decades, with pronounced disagreement, even within the same political parties, on the best way to deal with an issue which directly affects over 11 million undocumented people in the US.</p><p>The Government has consistently engaged with both parties in a bipartisan way to address our longstanding concerns and this continues to be our approach.  During our visit to New York for the UN General Assembly in September, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and I met representatives of the four Irish immigration centres in the region and a representative of the US-wide Coalition of Irish Immigration Centers, CIIC.  It gave me the opportunity to hear from those working at the coal face with the undocumented Irish as to the current situation and the problems they are encountering.</p><p>The Minister, Deputy Coveney, further emphasised the Government&rsquo;s commitment to this issue when he travelled to Washington DC from 3 to 5 October and met senior members of the US Administration and members of Congress, including the Congressional Friends of Ireland group.  It was also useful that Deputy John Deasy, the Government&rsquo;s special envoy to the US Congress on the undocumented, who was appointed by the Taoiseach to that position last June, was able to accompany the Minister to those meetings.  His appointment was another important statement of our intent and seriousness regarding this issue.</p><p>Our ambassador in Washington DC, Dan Mulhall, hosted a round table discussion on the issue on 25 October with key stakeholders, including the CIIC, which brought together Irish immigration centres from across the US.  Our embassy in Washington DC and our six consulates across the US continue to work continuously with Irish immigration centres in order to provide vital services to the undocumented in the United States.</p><p>The Government remains wholly committed to working with the US authorities to resolve the plight of the undocumented Irish.  The Government will continue to articulate to the US authorities our keen interest in this area while respecting the right of the United States to set its own immigration policies.  I can assure the House of the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to pursuing these matters on behalf of those Irish citizens in the US who are affected, and our continued openness to routes and policies which will provide relief for the undocumented.</p></speech>
