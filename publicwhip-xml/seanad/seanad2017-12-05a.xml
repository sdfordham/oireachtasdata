I hope they enjoy their time in Leinster House.</p> <p>The issue of the moment is Brexit, and the fact the ball is in London's court yet again.  I do not think it has actually left London's court for the past year and a half.  The issue of the DUP's effective veto on these negotiations and on the agreement yesterday is a matter of concern.  We agree with the Taoiseach's statement that it is important to remember the nationalist community, and that we will protect their rights and freedoms and protect the peace and equality to which they are entitled.  The Taoiseach also reminded the DUP and those in Britain that there is more than one political party in Northern Ireland.  The DUP has only 30 members in the assembly.  There are 60 other members of the assembly in Northern Ireland, comprising the SDLP, the UUP, the Alliance Party, the Green Party, Sinn F&eacute;in and others, who did not support Brexit and were anti-Brexit.  A very small party is essentially stopping progress on this issue and wants to turn back the clock.</p> <p>The issue we are concerned about is the statement yesterday by the Taoiseach, that there is very little difference between there being no regulatory diversions and that the regulations would be aligned.  Legal experts would tell us there is quite a huge difference between these two, and that the wording is very important.  Of course, the wording has not been released, but this has to be clarified because there is a lot of wiggle room when it comes to the interpretation of such terminology and phraseology.  This is something that needs to be clarified by the Attorney General.  We should also get a view from the European Union in advance, so we do not end up in a situation where interpretation by the UK side of there being no regulatory diversions and that regulations would be aligned would not lead to a hard border.  If there is a hard border at this stage, the responsibility for it will lie at our door and at the door of the Irish Government, because we are the ones who have the support of the European Union, and we are the ones who need to ensure we keep everybody informed and we put the truth out there.  The problem the British seem to have is they do not even get the basics right.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mark Daly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2246"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2246&amp;amp;pid=MarkDaly&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In a news interview that took place today, Mr. Bernard Jenkin, an MP in Westminster thought that an Enda Kelly and Bertie Ahern were both Prime Ministers of Northern Ireland.  One can say that the British do not understand the problem of Brexit, Ireland and the history of Ireland, but they do not understand the current affairs of Ireland never mind its history.  They need a lot of education.</p><p>I hope that we will never have to revisit the Brexit negotiations.  Yesterday, the Taoiseach talked about semantic differences and how there is very little difference between no regulatory divergence and regulatory alignment.  There is, however, a huge legal difference between the two and we need to know which one will be in the text.  We also need legal clarification not as much from our Attorney General but from the European side as to their interpretation of that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-12-05a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1379" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017120500002#C00200"><p>I, too, wish to talk about Brexit today and I start by acknowledging the work of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney.  He must be congratulated on his work to date.  It is important that we continue to advance the interests of the Irish people, but we can advance the interests of the people and Irish Republic as well as advancing the interests of the people of the island of Ireland.  On many occasions I have spoken about the great opportunities that exist in agriculture, food and many other economic sectors.  One can win the hearts and minds of people when one talks about the mutual interests of people, particularly on the island of Ireland.</p> <p>It is incumbent on all politicians to step back, rather than step out.  It is clear that the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, is in a very difficult position and we must respect that.  Clearly, she is in difficulty with the DUP.  While we do not have to expect it, we must acknowledge that it is a fact.  Prime Minister May has been backed into a very difficult place.  Now is a time for cool heads and stepping back.  We have waited long enough in this process so we should step back a little.  It is unhelpful to be over critical of the political processes.</p> <p>I am always conscious that Sinn F&eacute;in has a mandate and has sought election and mandate to the House of Commons.  The party has chosen not to take its seats and sometimes I think that is a terrible pity.  That is a personal comment from me but Sinn F&eacute;in has enormous leverage that it could use in these particular circumstances.  I do not mean to criticise the party, but Sinn F&eacute;in has opportunities, because it has a mandate in terms of the British House of Commons elections.  It is a pity to have a franchise and a mandate but not use the important leverage that brings.</p> <p>This is an important but delicate time for Anglo-Irish arrangements and agreements, particularly in the context of Brexit.  Let us not allow the issue to fall back into an orange versus green and green versus orange scenario.  Let us not take a step back in that regard.  This is a time for cool heads and to see how we can get this right.  Let us move away from the narrow inward thinking mentality of orange versus green, and this goes for both sides.  </p> <p>Again, I acknowledge the work of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade who has special responsibility in this area.  It is important that he continues to steadfastly move forward.  I thank him for proceeding to advance the interests of Ireland and, hopefully, the whole of Ireland. </p></speech>

The Senator was a valued and respected member of the team and I thank him for his work.  I wish him and his family well.  I am sure that we will continue to co-operate on the many issues that remain important to us all.</p></speech>

Far from being a victory for any particular side, it would have offered clarity and certainty to all of us.  The DUP-Tory deal was always going to end in disaster.  It was cobbled together in chaos and is now delivering political chaos.  One only has to listen to some of the interviews conducted with Tory politicians yesterday to see how they simply do not get it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Their grasp of the challenges presented by Brexit to the island of Ireland is limited because Ireland, let us face it, is of no real significance to many of them.  That is why this Government must hold firm to what is best for Ireland and not be forced into reacting to the internal squabbles of the British Tory party.</p><p>One positive outcome to emerge from yesterday's shambles was the obvious interest and concern shown by so many sectors and groups right across the island.  We now have a broad consensus on what is needed.  Right from the beginning of this Eton mess, Sinn F&eacute;in has been clear and consistent in identifying the solution, namely, a designated special status for the North within the European Union.  While I take Senator Boyhan's point, what he has said here today shows disregard for the very hard work being done by the MLAs, MPs and all people across the Sinn F&eacute;in Party.  Just because we will not swear allegiance to a foreign queen and sit on the green seats of Westminster does not mean that hugely valuable work is not being done there at all times.  While on the face of it, it might seem that the influence is not there, we seek every single day to work on and influence decisions that are made for the benefit of the people of the North and indeed right across this island.  The  designated special status would include membership of the Single Market and the customs union while ensuring a convergence of standards across the island.</p><p>The Good Friday Agreement is incompatible with a hard border exit.  This agreement was arrived at after long negotiations and was overwhelmingly endorsed by the people of this island, whereas Brexit was rejected by electorate in the North.  The Good Friday Agreement must be defended and has to be to the fore in the Government's strategy.  The Taoiseach must stand firm and use his veto to defend the Good Friday Agreement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-12-05a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1405" speakername="Alice Mary Higgins" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017120500002#D00200"><p>I join those who have been speaking about Brexit and the Brexit negotiations.  I do think that Ireland has been represented well in those negotiations, and I share the same concern that others have expressed about the deterioration yesterday afternoon and the hope that we can step back and resume progress again.</p> <p>I want to highlight three issues which I consider to be very important in respect of those negotiations and which have perhaps not got the attention that is necessary.  Time is pressing, and even while the Border is such a key focus, it is important that we be able to operate on a number of fronts.  I want to talk specifically about a letter written to a newspaper yesterday by a number of prominent human rights lawyers and academics highlighting the importance of human rights equivalence as a pillar of the Good Friday Agreement and the need for clear guarantees in respect of the protection of human rights equivalence as a central part of these phase 1 negotiations and of the Good Friday Agreement .  I note that human rights equivalence is separate from the citizens' rights question.  It goes a little bit further.  It is that question of human rights and how we manage to ensure that equivalence, particularly, for example, if the United Kingdom were to leave the European Court of Human Rights.</p> <p>In respect of the regulatory alignment that has been discussed, it is very important and right that we raise these issues of regulatory alignment, hold the United Kingdom to account in this regard, and look for the guarantees that we need.  I would like us, however, to give a guarantee here in this House to ourselves that we will not invoke regulatory alignment in the future in any case of a race to the bottom in any respect or the lowering of our national ambition on standards in areas such as environment, employment and other areas.  We must continue to improve and progress our regulations and it is important that we maintain our own right to do that.  This is something that is compatible but it is important to emphasise it.</p> <p>I would also like to flag the question of the investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS, mechanisms.  If we move to phase 2 then there will be a question about what role ISDS mechanisms, which are disputed and are under the consideration at the European Court of Justice, could or should play in the mandate to begin the second stage of negotiations.  While I absolutely give full acknowledgement to our negotiators, who I feel have represented us very well, it is important that we keep on eye across the breadth of issues.</p> <p>I have two final points.  Today is International Volunteer Day and I would like to take this opportunity to commend the volunteers who have served Ireland so well, both internationally and at home.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The work of organisations such as Comhl&aacute;mh, the organisation for returned volunteers, shows how volunteers can not only contribute in a practical way internationally but can also bring critical and interesting perspectives on international development issues.  Citizens Information Services throughout Ireland and the 1,100 volunteers who work at the front line are very concerned about the heavy-handed approach to the destruction of local citizens information services.  Many of these people volunteer because they have a community ethos and they know the importance of maintaining that independence and community ethos in the citizens information services.  This issue has been discussed extensively by the Joint Committee on Employment and Social Protection and it might be considered further here, as it is also an issue of national relevance.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-12-05a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1423" speakername="Ray Butler" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017120500002#E00200"><p>I wish to speak about the proposed mortgage restructuring Bill 2017 to be introduced by Deputy Durkan.  This Bill will apply to family homes and small enterprises and seeks to curtail the activities of primary and secondary lenders that are insisting on repayment of mortgage in full even though borrowers have been making repayments within their capacity for several years.  I have been dealing with a case on behalf of a family comprising a husband, wife and two young children.  When the husband became ill, the family fell behind in their mortgage repayments.  While they put reasonable monthly repayment offers to the company, they were not accepted.  The mortgage was then sold to a secondary lender, which was ruthless even though it purchased the mortgage for 30% of its market value.  The family had to surrender the family home and is now living in social housing under the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme, which is costing the taxpayer &euro;1,100 per month.  We bailed out the banks to the tune of &euro;68 billion and they are now selling loans and this is resulting in many families and taxpayers ending up on the streets.  Having attended the courts, I know that there are many similar cases before them.  Judges are adjourning cases because they do not want to deal with the issues arising.</p> <p>The proposed Bill contains three elements, namely, the wiping out of compound interest on the grounds that the lenders caused the problem in the first instance and were rescued by the banking bailout and ultimately by bank customers as taxpayers; the introduction of a new code of conduct to be applied by the Central Bank to ensure the repossessions do not take place in a situation where the borrower has made or is making reasonable payments in accordance with his or her income; and the restructuring of the extent to which lenders can pursue borrowers, within reason.  The consequences of the actions of the companies that have purchased the banks loans are often fatal.  We have the backing of the Business Retail Union of Ireland for this Bill.  I ask the Minister for Finance come to the House in January to discuss this proposal in an attempt to address this serious problem.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-12-05a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1395" speakername="Jennifer Murnane O'Connor" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017120500002#E00300"><p>I raise the water refund cheques issued in the past few days, which have been brought to my attention by people in Carlow.  The issue also was discussed on "Liveline" today.  It is an issue that affects elderly people in particular and is another attack on rural Ireland.  As I understand it, a person issued a water refund cheque who does not have a bank or post office account is unable to cash the cheque.  The cheque is an AIB cheque but if the recipient does not have an AIB bank account or a post office account, it cannot be cashed at the post office, which is where many elderly people in particular paid their water charges.  Many people are very upset about this.  Many more water refund cheques will be issued in the next few days.  The process of opening a bank or post office account takes a long time because of the requirement to produce various pieces of documentation and photo ID.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2470"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2470&amp;amp;pid=JenniferMurnaneOConnor&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I ask that the Minister put something in place, particularly as this is an attack on rural Ireland.  There are people in Ireland who do not have bank or post office accounts.  They live from day to day and do not have accounts.  The Minister needs to address this or clarify whether one must have an account if one goes in with one's water cheque to get a refund.  It also is important to be aware that Focus Ireland, the Simon Community and the Peter McVerry Trust have all joined forces to ask people, if they can, to help by donating their payment to The Refund Project.  As Members are aware, there is a housing crisis and they have got together in this way.  The issue I raised is serious.  People today are disheartened because when they got their cheque, they thought they would have the money for Christmas.  They need it and I again seek clarification from the Minister.  </p></speech>

I wish to place on record my congratulations to the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste for the way in which they have stood their ground and have represented this country and for their determination to get the best deal for the country, North and South.  It is important to put those things on record as a lot of people are beating the old drum about what they did not do.  They have played a sterling job to date and need to be congratulated for that.</p> <p>I also wish to thank the Government for the ceremony on Saturday for veterans of Jadotville.  I also thank my colleague Senator McFadden.  It was a wonderful day.  It worked out perfectly at the end of the day.  It was a credit to the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces.  Senator McFadden and the Leader put a lot of work into making sure that we got a dignified occasion.  There have been one or two lash backs through my own social media but one will always get that.  Some people apparently were disappointed at not being there on the day for the medal but there was no deliberate attempt to exclude anybody.  I am sure if they contact me, Senator McFadden, the Leader or anybody in Leinster House, he or she will be happy to see to it that they get it.</p> <p>As some people are overseas, would it be possible to organise it so that they could collect their family  medal from the consulate or embassy rather than just having it posted to them?  That might be a nice turn of events.  On a positive note, it was a great weekend and a great start to the week for this country.  I congratulate the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste for their stance.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the work of the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy McEntee, for the sterling work they are doing on behalf of every citizen of this country and for being a voice for those citizens in the North of Ireland who may feel their concerns are not being heard.  There is no doubt but that it is in the interests of the entire island of Ireland that a resolution be found and that there is no hard border.  One cannot underestimate the importance of a unified approach from the Republic.  I acknowledge the support of all political parties here in the Republic of Ireland, as well as the support from the EU 27 for our negotiating team at this critical time.</p> <p>Only last week, I heard representatives from the Newry Chamber of Commerce voice a very similar position to that held by the Irish Government, which was there should be no hard border.  It also was in favour of a customs union.  The contradiction here and the great irony is that I am sure that many members of that business community north of the Border are supportive of the DUP, Sinn F&eacute;in, and other parties.  That is where the dichotomy is.  I hope a resolution can be found to give those people a voice in the political sphere at this sensitive time.  </p> <p>I also wish to raise concerns regarding a regional and local issue that is happening today in Waterford and Kilkenny.  Psychiatric nurses are protesting the under-resourcing for mental health services in both St. Luke's General Hospital and University Hospital Waterford.  The Psychiatric Nurses Association, PNA, represents the psychiatric nurses who feel they are left with no other recourse due to overcrowding and staffing pressures due to the demands in both centres.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paudie Coffey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2237"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2237&amp;amp;pid=PaudieCoffey&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I ask the Deputy Leader to make time available for a debate on the policy relating A Vision for Change, which is supposed to be adhered to by the HSE, and also on the budget for mental health.  The management of the HSE is not responding to the demands and pressures on the ground.  We need a debate in order that we might discuss the provision of adequate resources for those who are in need within our mental health services.  It is not good to see psychiatric nurses, who do sterling work at the coalface, having to take to the picket lines to raise their concerns.  We need action by Government.  I ask the Deputy Leader to join me in taking up the baton on behalf of the psychiatric nurses who are trying to deliver these essential services.</p></speech>

The reality is that people are dying on our streets.  Two people died last week.  I believe most citizens would give up tax cuts in order to ensure that children have homes at Christmas.  All children have a basic human right to have homes.  Almost 8,500 people are homeless and, of these, more than 3,000 are children.  I know that Members have heard these statistics many times but I feel I have to highlight them again.  We are facing a major crisis that needs to be addressed.  We must do everything we can to bring about change.  The first thing we must do is that which must be done in dealing with any problem - that is, it must be named.  I want to do this today.  We have a crisis and we must put in place the resources necessary to address it.  The Government should take the lead in respect of this matter.  It would be fantastic if the Government did so.</p> <p>In a country as rich as Ireland, it is disgraceful that people are being forced out of their homes by banks and unscrupulous landlords.  Until the State provides housing for its citizens, people will continue to be housed in unsafe accommodation and will continue to pay high rents.  This will continue until there is a fire at one of the premises in question and people are killed.  There is an urgent need for a holistic approach to be taken in respect of housing in Ireland.  Such an approach would include taking account of the needs of new communities and low-paid workers and giving security to all people who live in this country.  Vulture funds and banks cannot be relied upon to look after the most vulnerable in society because their primary aim is to maximise profits.</p> <p>The welfare of the people is the duty of the State.  The National Homeless and Housing Coalition has come together in order to start addressing these issues.  It is calling on the Government to take immediate action as follows: to declare a national housing emergency; immediately acquire properties that are available through NAMA and transfer to councils for those on the housing waiting list; introduce measure's that will facilitate access to finance and build as many social housing units in the next five years as is possible; introduce measures that limit rent increases and escalating rents; end the practice of evicting families who show genuine financial distress in mortgage repayments; and introduce a 30% increase in rent allowance and HAP to enable access to rented accommodation while the supply problems in public housing are addressed.</p> <p>As public representatives, we have an obligation to ensure that everybody has a home.  We must never minimise the problem or blame the people who find themselves without homes.  We must all work together.  It is a terrible to think that people are going to be out in the freezing cold at Christmas.  I urge that the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government come to the House in order that we might engage in a debate on this issue.</p></speech>

We felt that an agreement in respect of one of the most significant issues relating to the island of Ireland was coming to a satisfactory conclusion.  I was in the House of Commons a year and a half ago and I helped to launch the Irish4Europe campaign.  We were hoping that the members of the Irish diaspora in the United Kingdom would vote to remain in the European Union.  I said that a referendum was a very blunt instrument to use in respect of such a very complex issue.  At that time, there was a perfect storm in that the Conservative Party was fighting to protect its flank from UKIP and the Labour Party had come under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn who is anti-Europe.  Now, there is no Northern Ireland Assembly in place at Stormont.  We are in a very difficult situation.</p> <p>I wish to pay tribute to the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy McEntee, and also to the various parties in the Oireachtas which wore the green jersey and which did not play politics with such a sensitive and emotive issue.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Frank Feighan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2014"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Union of 27 countries of which we are part, also stood firm with Ireland.  We are in a unique situation now.  Ireland can hold its head up high as an equal partner in the EU.  I have told many of my UK colleagues that we in Ireland viewed Brexit as the United Kingdom accidentally shooting itself in our foot.  Yesterday, it looked as if it got out a blunderbuss and shot itself all over the place.  I always felt that the Border would be the Achilles heel of Brexit because it is simply unworkable.  It is ironic that the Border could now be the death of Brexit, which I would welcome, but could also undermine the British Government.  We are in a very difficult situation.  I agree with Senator Boyhan that we need to take a step back and take some time to reflect.  I hope that we will have a satisfactory outcome to this very difficult issue in the coming days.</p></speech>

I appreciate that the Minister, Deputy Katherine Zappone, has published monthly updates on the website of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and is planning to bring proposals resulting from the recent facilitated meetings across the country to Cabinet.  I am also aware that there will be more substantial news on the commission of investigation in the form of an interim report.  Could the Deputy Leader shed some light on this?  It might be an idea to invite the Minister to the House to give an update on this issue in its entirety.  She was here before and that engagement was very useful to Members and survivors alike.  Will the Deputy Leader please consider that?</p> <p>Finally I applaud the group, Mental Health Warriors, which held a successful protest on Dame Street last night demanding 24-7 mental health services and expressing alarm at the significant increase in self-harm and suicidal ideation among children.  Such issues are beginning at a much younger age.  They are now quite frequently observable in primary schools and often end in tragedy, as we saw in the coroner's report on an 11 year-old girl last Friday.</p></speech>

Anyone watching the events yesterday would have been dismayed to see what appeared to be an agreement on wording collapse with the symbolic approach of the British Government and the walking away of the DUP, which betrayed the very tenuous basis of the confidence and supply arrangement between it and the UK Government.  I also join with others in urging the Government to hold firm, particularly given the very heartening words of support offered by Donald Tusk to Ireland as one of the EU 27 on Friday.  They were very good to hear.  We should all hope for and work towards a resolution, even if it is couched in language which is somewhat ambiguous, as was much of the language in the Good Friday Agreement, such as the term "regulatory alignment" which we saw yesterday.  If that sort of text enables us to move forward it is all to the better.</p> <p>I ask the Deputy Leader for a debate in the new year on penal reform.  I want to revive the all-party Oireachtas penal reform group which was in place prior to the last election in which members of all parties and none could work together to develop policies on penal reform issues.  Those of us on the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality prepared an excellent report on penal reform and I would like to continue to work on that.  I would also like to let colleagues know that next Wednesday the penal reform group will have a first briefing in the AV Room in Leinster House with the Irish Penal Reform Trust and others.  We will be speaking about the optional protocol to the convention against torture, OPCAT, which Ireland has not yet ratified.  That should be the focus of any debate we have here in the Seanad in the new year.   Why have we not yet ratified OPCAT?  What improvements would it make?  Essentially it would ensure independent regulation, monitoring and oversight of all places of detention in the country.  It is vital that we move towards ratification of that protocol.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I ask any colleagues with an interest to let me know and to attend the briefing next Wednesday.</p></speech>

I come from the Border constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, which stands to be devastated by the doomsday scenario of a hard border.  I hope this can be averted.  This Parliament should say a couple of things to the DUP.  First, we should make it very clear that there is no attempt by the Irish Government or anybody in the Republic to undermine the constitutional position of Northern Ireland without consent.  It should not be necessary to clarify that there is no threat and no proposed threat to the constitutional position of Northern Ireland, given that this is enshrined as a central tenet of the Good Friday Agreement and is accepted by an outright majority of the people of this island, but I suggest we should restate it nonetheless.  My personal view is that a hard border scenario would, perversely enough, present a greater threat because it would accelerate a level of chaos that would be much more detrimental to the interests of unionism in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>The second thing that merits saying in this regard is that we have no ambition to create an east-west border in the Irish Sea.  The contrary is the case.  The position of the Irish Government is that it wants to have the UK within the customs union and the trading arrangements without any alteration in that regard.  My view differs slightly from that of Senator Mark Daly in one nuanced respect.  If the alteration of a word here or there advances the efforts to seek an agreement, for example by getting people to move on from bargaining positions or limbs they have put themselves out on, my personal belief is that this should be looked at as long as the central meaning, which is that there will be no hard border, is maintained.  That is for others to decide.  I join other Senators in paying tribute to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Government and the diplomatic service for the way they have handled this matter.  I thank all the Opposition parties for choosing not to make a political football out of this issue.  That is so important in this instance.</p> <p>I thank the Cathaoirleach for his felicitous remarks in welcoming the Cavan rugby choir, which has been brought to Leinster House by Senator Wilson.  We are very proud that this much-esteemed choir is performing here as part of today's festive occasion.</p></speech>

I ask the new Minister to clarify the excessive spending on marketing and public relations in the Creative Ireland budget.  A freedom of information response that has been received on foot of a request from Sinn F&eacute;in shows that less than 33% of the &euro;4.4 million budget that has been spent on the Creative Ireland programme to date has been spent on supporting genuine cultural activity.  By contrast, 30% of the budget, or &euro;1.3 million, has been spent on marketing.  I suppose I am continuing the trend of Opposition Senators expressing concern about the Government's marketing initiatives.  Artists are struggling to make ends meet.  The Taoiseach has yet to set out a roadmap to outline how the Government will double arts funding.  It is disheartening to see the Department spending excessively on marketing initiatives rather than supporting artists.  One has to wonder whether the Creative Ireland initiative is a window-dressing exercise for the Department.  The Creative Ireland budget will be increased from &euro;4.4 million to &euro;8.5 million in 2018.  I ask the Minister, Deputy Madigan, to ensure this increase has a real and genuine impact on cultural activity and on the lived experience and work of our artists.</p></speech>

I welcome them to the Oireachtas.  It is an historic day for them.  I have no doubt that they will enjoy the occasion and that members will enjoy their singing this evening.</p> <p>It is with great disappointment that I learned of the Government decision to remove the over-age exemption for children with disabilities in the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme.  It is very regrettable that the exemption is to be removed from the scheme from September 2018.  The issue is of major concern to parents because they believe it will severely handicap children who are about to attend primary school and who need a little extra help to make the transition in as smooth a fashion as possible.  It will greatly worry parents and have a knock-on effect on the smooth running of primary schools because more pressure will be applied to teachers and special needs assistants, SNAs.  It is a very regrettable backward step.  However, if a positive can come out of such a negative decision, it is that we have time to sort this out.  I ask the Deputy Leader to bring the issue to the attention of the Minster for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, and ask her to reconsider this very regrettable decision.  The Constitution states that we should cherish all our children equally but this measure flies in the face of that declaration.  I ask the Deputy Leader to bring the matter to the Minister in order that the decision can be reversed and the trauma and stress it is causing to families can be dispersed.</p></speech>

I would like to acknowledge the kind words of my colleagues and very good friends on the Sinn F&eacute;in Seanad team.  I thank them for their support and solidarity in recent times, as I do all colleagues and the staff of the Seanad office and the Houses.  I look forward to working with them on issues of mutual concern.</p> <p>An issue of concern about which Senator Gavan has been banging on for a long time is in regard to the rights of hospitality workers.  We are heading into the Christmas party season, as one can see from the activity in hostelries in most towns.  I ask people to spare a thought for the staff in those hostelries, restaurants and so on, many of whom are working in circumstances that are not good enough.  Some are not being afforded their rights as employees.  A group we put together in respect of the hospitality industry in Galway and which recently carried out a survey in respect of this matter had a very good meeting with the Galway Chamber of Commerce yesterday.  We intend to try to promote best practice in the Galway area and explore setting up an award for restaurants that treat their employees very well.  It is hoped that people would then vote with their feet and go to those establishments and spend their money there.  We have met the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, to discuss the issue and he was quite supportive.  The issue should be debated in the House.  However, I must convey my disappointment with the Irish Hotels Federation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland because, to date, they have not engaged with us on the issue of abuse in the hospitality sector.  I know the Deputy Leader has connections and a very good working relationship with those groups.  She might pass on to them that we are not here to cause trouble but, rather, want to work with them.  The nature of the engagement yesterday was a sign that we can turn this into a huge positive by creating a centre of excellence in Ireland whereby tourists will come here because they know workers are being treated well in the places in which those tourists are eating and staying.</p></speech>

We have had a lot of discussion, and rightly so, about the Brexit issue but last night the two local authorities in Cork came to an agreement regarding the boundary movement in Cork county.  This issue has dogged Cork and the southern half of the country for some 50 years since the previous boundary extension was agreed.</p> <p>I pay tribute to the councillors for their hard work in coming together and putting a solution in place.  It was really tedious work moving vast areas of Cork county into the city boundary.  The city boundary has been moved to include some 100,000 people.  This has increased the city geographical area by a multiple of four, and it has increased the city population by more than 100,000.  There is a feeling in Cork currently that the executives, public representatives and academics have been asked for their views, which they have given, and that we now need to step outside that cosy cartel and ask the public for their views.  The appropriate step for Cork now is to hold a plebiscite on this massive boundary review and put it before the people so they can give their views on it.  There was a previous plebiscite in Ireland in this regard and the legislation is there.  I have researched it, and I believe the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, should look at that issue.  When we consider such a vast change in population and geographical area in boundary reviews, the most appropriate step for us to take now is to ask the people.  We should not be afraid of asking people.  That is, after all, what we are here to do.</p></speech>

I will develop the theme on which he spoke.  Precarious work obviously impacts the restaurant sector and an excellent report has been published by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.  It is excellent because it is facts based.  It tells us that in 2016 some 158,000 workers had their hours varied from one week to the next.  We should imagine the uncertainty this must cause these workers and their families in not knowing, from one week to the next, what hours of work they will have.  The report also shows a step-change in the economy.  For example, there are now 109,000 fewer workers in full-time employment than in 2008.  It shows that 50% of workers last year said they were in temporary employment, not through choice, but because they could not find full-time employment.  ICTU has also called on the Government to publish the Department's report on bogus self-employment.  It is a puzzle as to why that report has not been published.  I call for a debate on this issue.</p> <p>I am aware the Government has planned legislation to amend the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, and I welcome this initiative, but ICTU has pointed out that it does not go anywhere near far enough.  I am particularly delighted that ICTU has endorsed the Banded Hours Contract Bill which Sinn F&eacute;in brought to the D&aacute;il last year, but which regrettably was dropped by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  There is a need, in justice terms and in economic common sense terms, to address the issue of precarious work.  It is becoming far too widespread in the economy.  The Government has the power to address the issue and I call for a debate on it and for all-party agreement so we can afford justice and economic certainty to hundreds of thousands of workers in our economy today.</p></speech>

Seven projects were submitted by Cork City Council to the Department for approval.  Planning was obtained and an estimate was prepared regarding the cost of the projects.  The tendering process, however, has shown that the projects are proving more expensive than the estimates originally indicated.  I understand that the city council submitted the final proposals to the Department in early September.  I am concerned that, three months on, they have not received the go-ahead from the Department.  I ask the Leader to raise this matter with the Minister and that the Minister would also come to the House at the earliest possible date to discuss this issue.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colm Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2353"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->While he probably is not due to appear before Christmas, issues like this must be dealt with to make sure there are not delays in housing projects.  Quite a number of houses are involved as seven projects require this sign-off by the Department.  A three-month delay is a little too long, especially on this important issue.</p><p>The change in the city and county boundary in Cork was raised.  I come from the county, was a member of the city council and had the privilege of being the Lord Mayor of Cork.  I believe there is a need for change as the land available for the development of new housing within the city is inadequate.  It also is important to note that a huge number of ratepayers who pay rates in the city are not living in the city.  Extending the city boundary will bring a huge number of them into the decision-making process concerning the running of the city, and that is a very important issue.  While it is hard to come to a conclusion about where the best boundary should be, I agree with my colleague, Senator Lombard, that a lot of hard work has been done by the council staff and councillors on both sides to reach a compromise.  We should now progress and make the final decision on this in order that we have a clear plan ahead for the development of the city, the county and the entire region. </p></speech>

That is very welcome.</p> <p>I also pay tribute to all involved in the public hearings of the Seanad Public Consultation Committee on the national anthem this morning.  That formula is working very well.  The Cathaoirleach was the Chair of the Seanad Public Consultation Committee in the last Seanad and I think this House could adopt a Citizens' Assembly-type role with the Public Consultation Committee.  It could easily be developed into something much bigger, which could do the work the Citizens' Assembly has been doing.  The place for the type of work the Citizens' Assembly has been doing is the Houses of the Oireachtas, specifically in respect of the public consultation model.  I believe the people voted to retain the Seanad because they thought that is the type of work Members should and can do.  Members are well capable of doing it by bringing in outside experts, calling for public submissions and inviting in the public to give their own views and observations and so on. </p> <p>I have not spoken in the Order of Business since our former colleague, Denis Landy, announced his retirement from politics.  Like everyone else here, I wish to join in the tributes to Denis, who has given many decades of service to local government and has served as a national politician for the last six years. </p></speech>

I will first address the other issues briefly.</p> <p>Senator Higgins raised the issue of volunteers and articulated the point very well.  I agree with her comments.  It is an issue on which Members could easily have a debate in this House in the new year.  Senator Butler raised the issue of the mortgage restructuring Bill 2017.  It sounds like very sensible legislation.  He suggested that we discuss it with the Minister for Finance in this House but I would be keen to see it before the Seanad as legislation sooner rather than later.  Obviously, as Deputy Durkan has created the legislation, it will need to go to the D&aacute;il first but we would be very happy to take that Bill, together with other legislation, into this House in the near future.  Senator Murnane O'Connor raised an issue around water refund cheques.  She has raised a wider issue, however, because there are money laundering concerns to consider there.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Catherine Noone:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2354"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2354&amp;amp;pid=CatherineNoone&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Department has to be able to issue cheques because it is not feasible for it to do anything other than that.  It would be a logistical nightmare for it to try to find a way to give people cash.  The day of cashing cheques, thankfully, is in the past.  I find it hard to believe that people do not have bank accounts.</p></speech>

It is not up to the Minister to sort that out but I will communicate to him that it is an issue for some people the Senator is meeting.  I do not believe it is an attack on rural Ireland.  It may be a reflection of the fact that some people in rural Ireland do not have bank accounts.  I do not understand why they do not.</p> <p>Fair play to Senator Craughwell for being positive and giving credit where it is due.  I welcome that.  To answer the point he raised on Jadotville, I commend the Senator and give him credit where it is due, as well as Senator McFadden and the Leader, Senator Buttimer, who are due a lot of credit for that also.  That has to be acknowledged here.</p> <p>Senator Coffey raised a point on psychiatric nurses.  I am the daughter of a psychiatrist and since I was a child I have been hearing about the issue of mental health services, not that my mother is a complainer as such because she tries to find positive ways to go around things.  It is a huge issue.  As a population, not as a Government, we do not treat mental health as seriously as it needs to be treated.  The forum on the future of mental health is addressing that issue but that needs to be meaningful.  We need to restructure the way we treat mental health.  It is part of health.  We all need to mind our mental health.  Those of us in this job certainly need to mind our mental health.  I agree wholeheartedly with the Senator on that and I believe we should have a debate in this House on the way we treat the area of mental health.</p> <p>Senator Black spoke about the homelessness issue, which she validly raises at this time of the year.  We have to be careful about anything we say in this area because it can be misrepresented but homelessness is nearly a business of its own now.  There are so many different stakeholders and vested interests in that space.  It is really about the individual who is having the difficulty.  The Minister, in fairness to him, is working day and night on this issue.  The Senator will say I would not say otherwise standing here as a Fine Gael Member, but we need to be reasonable in our expectations because it is a complex issue.  Everybody accepts that there is a great deal of work going on, and in certain instances it needs to be more joined up, but there must be some trust in the Minister, who is devoted to this issue, on the part of some of the other stakeholders in this space.  Both he and the Minister of State, Deputy English, are committed to dealing with it.  The least objective people would have to acknowledge that and I hope we will start to see real results in the new year.</p> <p>I will come back to Senator Feighan.</p> <p>I commend Senator Devine for all the work she does in the area of mothers and babies.  Her voice is always heard on that issue.  I am spokesperson on children also and I bow to her superior knowledge of the area in so many ways.  I do not know the state of play but I will request that we have a debate with the Minister, Deputy Zappone, in the House on that issue in the new year.  The Senator also mentioned the Mental Health Warriors.  I refer her to my response to Senator Coffey on that issue.</p> <p>Senator Bacik spoke on the penal reform group.  I want to attend her briefing.  I hope I am available, and I would encourage other Members to attend.  It goes without saying that ratification should be done.  I am one of the highest on the list of those who should appraise myself better on that issue and I encourage colleagues to support the Senator on it.</p> <p>Senator Reilly mentioned the choir, which all of us look forward to hearing later.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Catherine Noone:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2354"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2354&amp;amp;pid=CatherineNoone&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If Senators have a spare few minutes in their busy schedules to listen to a bit of singing, it would be nice.  Senator Warfield raised the issue of Creative Ireland and the &euro;4.4 million.  I am a big supporter of the arts.  I know a lot of artists and I hear the Senator.  The reality is that a new Minister is in place.  The old Minister did a great deal of good work and we should afford the incoming Minister the opportunity to come to the House to dispute some of the facts Senator Warfield has presented.  The Leader would be delighted to organise that in the new year.</p><p>Senator O'Mahony raised the issue of GMIT.  I do not know what the state of play is there, but the Minister, Deputy Bruton, should.  It is something the Senator could table as a Commencement matter to get a clear answer.</p><p>Senator Gallagher also mentioned the choir.  He is not here now but I will ask him to email me directly so that I can raise the issue he brought up with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone.</p><p>I wish Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh well.  He is a brave man.  There is a great deal on which we agree in the hospitality area and the arts.  We often speak to the same issues.  I agree with him on the hospitality industry in general.  There is probably a need to have a better practice for workers.  A Fine Gael councillor in Wicklow has an organisation which runs an initiative to recognise the best places to work, which is a really good one.  A lot of employers are so busy trying to keep the boat afloat that they do not take time to realise people may be struggling.  We need to create policies which improve lives because that is what a Government must be about.  A centre of excellence would be a great thing and I would hope people would not be too political with it.  In the hospitality space, that 9% VAT rate should be getting to the employees as well.  I will certainly pass the Senator's remarks on to the organisation with which I am involved, namely, the Irish Country Houses and Restaurants Association.</p><p>Senator Lombard referred to the boundary movement in Cork.  A plebiscite sounds like a good idea but it is not for me to decide.  His comments are very positive and a good suggestion.  Equally, Senator Burke's comments were also positive.</p><p>Senator Gavan also referred to workers and I agree with a lot of what he said.  The point about economic certainty is valid and well made and we could have the Minister in for a debate on it in the new year.</p><p>Senator Conway raised the issue of the Citizens' Assembly.  We are in danger of being "Citizens' Assemblied" out of it.  The Houses of the Oireachtas constitute the citizens' assembly for the State.  By all means, we can use the Seanad's public consultation process to discuss other issues of importance, which is probably what the Senator was referring to.</p><p>To come back to Brexit and the DUP veto, none of us liked it when we heard the Conservatives were to be backed up by the DUP, least of all, I imagine, Sinn F&eacute;in.  I am not trying to get in a dig, if it is one, but it highlights the prospect that Sinn F&eacute;in should take up its seats.  It might be something the party should discuss at its next Ard-Fheis.  It highlights how much influence Sinn F&eacute;in could have in UK politics whereas I do not know what anybody achieves by abstention.  I acknowledge that the Senators here do not make those decisions personally, but that is my tuppence-halfpenny's worth.  I am not trying to get into a fight with the Senators and it is all I have to say on the matter.</p><p>This is about more than one political party.  I commend all the political parties for wearing the green jersey on this one.  It has been very consistent.  It has been very helpful to the negotiators, including our diplomats, led by the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, to know the whole political system is behind them.  As a country, we punch far above our weight internationally.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Catherine Noone:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2354"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2354&amp;amp;pid=CatherineNoone&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->One has to pay tribute to Deputies Enda Kenny and Noonan for the work they did in establishing relationships in Europe and internationally.  People underestimate how important it is to have good foreign relations to get work done.  We are bearing the fruit of that now because we are so well-respected internationally and in European circles.  We have their backing and that is not by accident.  It is because we play ball in Europe and do so well as a result.</p><p>The point is that it is greater than the DUP now.  There is UK politics at play when it comes to Wales, Scotland and, indeed, London.  That is the difficulty Theresa May is dealing with now.  The DUP's worst nightmare is Corbyn.  That is what the DUP will face if it does not play ball as he will end up as UK Prime Minister.  That is the way I see it.  I do not know about others.  I hope that in the coming days we will have some white smoke, for want of a better term.</p><p>Senator Mark Daly spoke about semantics.  While I agree with him on much of that, the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade are well aware of the subtleties involved.  It is an important point the Senator raised but the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste are on top of that.</p><p>I liked Senator Boyhan's comments about stepping back.  Sometimes we need to get a perspective on politics and look at matters more objectively because we can be in a serious bubble in here.  There is more that unites us and the UK than divides us.  It is to be hoped we will be able to come to some agreement.</p><p>Senator Conway-Walsh raised the issue of the DUP and the Tories, which I have addressed.  She said the Government needs to hold firm.  The Government has exhibited it will hold firm on this issue.  We could not be firmer and the EU and the North of Ireland are backing us.  It is the first time in history that we are in a better bargaining position than the UK, which is remarkable.  It is to be hoped we will hold strong.</p><p>Different Members brought up the point of how the UK views Ireland.  That is relevant.  I was at a meeting yesterday with Senator Boyhan in the House of Lords.  One UK politician referred to the Irish people needing to realise about the mainland.  I explained our mainland is Ireland.  It showed a remarkable mentality.</p><p>Senator Alice Mary Higgins referred to the European Court of Human Rights, which is a valid point.</p><p>Fair play to Senator Craughwell for being positive about this matter.  Credit has to be given where it is due to the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste.  The Government has had a difficult few weeks, but we have had a good week this week.  People are quick to acknowledge the bad weeks.  We should acknowledge the good weeks too.  Although we have not got there and we should not be triumphant, it is going well in that regard.</p><p>Senator Coffey referred to Brexit and paid tribute to the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee.  Senator Feighan articulated it well when he spoke about the perfect storm and references to shooting.  We are in a position of strength.  He acknowledged that people have not played politics.  Senator Bacik mentioned that Donald Tusk was supportive, which is crucial.  When we heard that last week, everybody felt a real sense of confidence going into these negotiations.</p></speech>

I accept fully that our amendment is out of order.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, to the House.  We would argue that this Bill is technical in nature.  It makes clear citizenship and immigration rules for diplomatic staff and consular staff and their private staff by amending the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 and the Immigration Act 2004.  However, while we supported the Bill on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il, Deputy Crowe had one major concern that he wanted addressed on Committee Stage, namely, section 9, page six, lines 28 to 32.  We submitted an amendment in the D&aacute;il but it was disallowed on the grounds that it was a possible charge on revenue in accordance with Standing Orders.</p> <p>I will run through our concerns.  Section 9 seeks to amend the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 to provide that any period of time spent in this State, while exempt from immigration controls as workers in embassies are, is not reckonable for residency in the context of naturalisation.  We believe this is an important right that should not be undermined or interfered with in any way.  We are also concerned that the section states that children born to diplomats and associated persons who are exempt from immigration controls do not, except in certain circumstances, qualify for Irish citizenship by birth.  We cannot understand the purpose of excluding what would be a very small group of people in this way and to write that exclusion into the legislation.  The section does not seem necessary or proportional.  The Minister for Justice and Equality was asked to explain why it is included and why these workers should be treated differently from other workers.  He was asked to provide details on how many people have applied for naturalisation or citizenship in this way in recent years.  The information is important and might explain the inclusion of the provision.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We question why this is something that must be changed now.  What is the policy goal of such a change?  None of these questions has been answered.  This section is very concerning to me and it requires more detailed discussion.  Sinn F&eacute;in said that unless such clarification was forthcoming, we would have to vote against the Bill.  We do not want to do this as the Bill has many positive aspects.</p><p>I am disappointed that our amendment was ruled out of order on the basis that it seeks to retain the provision that any period of time spent in the State while exempt from immigration controls pursuant to section 2(1) or 2(1A) of the Immigration Act 2004 is reckonable for naturalisation purposes.  Apparently, this will potentially make people eligible for citizenship at an earlier date and additional costs may arise due to this earlier date of citizenship.  The amendment must therefore be considered to be out of order on the grounds that it causes a charge on the Exchequer in accordance with Standing Orders.  I find this a ridiculous use of Standing Orders especially when one considers that it costs an applicant &euro;950 to apply for Irish citizenship.  When we queried why it is so high, we were told it was to pay for the administrative work and reflects the high value in which Irish citizenship is held.  If applicants are paying for their own application process, how can more applications be considered a charge on the Exchequer, or is it the case that citizenship applications cost the State money?

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-12-05a.75" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1241" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Cannon" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017120500002#R00900"><p>I acknowledge that several Senators have raised questions on section 9.  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh raised it last week on Second Stage, as did Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe in the D&aacute;il.  On several occasions during the Bill's passage through the Houses, detailed explanations were provided on the rationale behind this provision.  I am aware that the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, MRCI, has signalled its disagreement with the provision.  MRCI is an excellent organisation that does very valuable work and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has a very good working relationship with it.  It has made a valuable contribution to the introduction of procedures in 2014 for the protection of domestic workers in diplomatic missions and households.  It has also worked with the Department to resolve individual cases from time to time.  As part of that valued working relationship, the Department consulted MRCI as part of the consultation on the general scheme of the Bill and changes were made on foot of its valuable recommendations.</p> <p>That notwithstanding, I consider section 9(d) to be an important part of the Bill and I am not convinced there is any merit in leaving it out.  It would be reversing a very long-standing policy of the State.  It may be the case that we will simply have to disagree on the inclusion of this provision.  One thing I want to make very clear is that the Government will remain as committed as ever to protecting vulnerable individuals.  I reiterate that there have been exceptional cases where former staff of diplomatic missions or households have been granted permission to remain in the State on a humanitarian basis.  Such applications, which are very rare, will continue to be viewed sympathetically if they arise.  Once a person is within the mainstream immigration system, under permission to remain, they will be on a path to citizenship and typically will be eligible for naturalisation after a number of years.  It is not at all the case that we wish to deny citizenship to vulnerable people but we feel it is appropriate to exclude time spent working for a diplomatic mission as reckonable residence in line with international practice, and in the spirit of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.</p></speech>

We would like to support this Bill.  Unfortunately, this leaves us in a position where we are unable to do so.  We will have to agree to disagree.  The Minister of State is correct to acknowledge the excellent work of the MRCI.  There is just a lack of generosity on the Government's part in this section.  As the Minister of State acknowledged, several people have expressed their concerns on it.</p></speech>

As Members know, the Department was established on 19 July 2017.  I am honoured to have been asked by An Taoiseach to lead the new Department.  The decision to establish the Department is an important one as we seek to promote and support vibrant, inclusive and sustainable communities throughout Ireland, both rural and urban.</p> <p>The Government has made a very clear commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government that, as the national economy recovers and grows, the benefits will be felt by everybody.  We know that is not yet the case.  The Taoiseach has referred to creating a republic of opportunity for all citizens.  To deliver on that, people working hard in every town and village in the country have to be confident that growth will be evenly shared.  They have to be confident that they can have the same opportunities and choices, no matter where they live or where they choose to raise their families.</p> <p>The Government's focus over the past two programmes for Government has been on recovery and we are definitely seeing the results of that.  There is no doubt the economy is experiencing the kind of growth we had hoped for, with unemployment continuing to fall and jobs being created across a wide range of sectors.  I recently launched the new updated Pobal HP Deprivation Index, which takes account of the significant changes experienced throughout the country since 2011.  We can take some encouragement from the finding that there has been a 41% recovery since 2011 in terms of overall levels of affluence and disadvantage.  However, the index is a reminder, if it were needed, of the significant challenges that exist including in rural Ireland and in our towns and villages.  Small towns with a population of between 1,000 and 5,000 have been the worst affected over the past ten years, being disproportionately hit by the recession and benefiting less from the recovery than the most urban and the most rural areas.  The index has and will enable us to target more effectively resources and services at the most disadvantaged and it is a vital tool for so many Departments, including my own, as well as many State agencies.</p> <p>Within this new remit, I see my Department's role as twofold: first, to facilitate economic development through the creation of jobs and the infrastructure required to support those jobs; and, second, to support our communities to become more sustainable and attractive places to live and work.  The work is guided by two key policy documents.  Realising our Rural Potential, the Government's action plan for rural development, aims to unlock the enormous potential of Ireland's rural communities to improve the lives of those living and working in rural areas.  Through a framework of supports at national and local level, the action plan takes a co-ordinated approach across Government to both the economic and social development of rural Ireland.  The plan covers a three-year period and contains a series of time-bound actions which will be monitored and reported on regularly.  The first progress report on the action plan, delivered in August 2017, showed great progress on the 227 actions contained in it.  Some 220 of those 227 actions are either completed, on schedule or in progress, and I expect to be able to detail further positive developments when the second progress report is published early next year.</p> <p>Our Communities: A Framework Policy for Local and Community Development is the second important policy document guiding our work.  The framework policy reflects a shared commitment by national and local government, and the local and community development sector, to engage with communities and to work with partners in planning, delivering and evaluating interventions, and the policies underpinning those interventions, for the good of individuals and communities.  The framework policy will be implemented on a cross-Government basis and will seek to secure a joined-up collaborative and participative approach to local and community development at local level.  It is guiding the work on the development of local community planning and public participation networks within my own Department.</p> <p>Communities are nothing without their people, and the efforts of volunteers across the entire country are invaluable to the social fabric of those communities.  They are in many ways our greatest asset and must be supported and encouraged at regional and local levels.  Engagement across Government at political and Executive level will be a very strong feature of how we work.  I will come back to the House again on that, but I also have the opportunity to make investment choices within my own Vote to support and promote local communities to become more sustainable and vibrant places in which to live and work.</p> <p>In the recent budget I secured in excess of &euro;220 million in funding for rural Ireland, giving us the foundation we need to drive the rural and community agenda and to deliver initiatives that can foster growth right across the country.  This includes flagship programmes such as the Leader and the SICAP programmes; the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme; the town and village renewal scheme; the library capital investment programme; and the local improvement scheme, as well as a range of other community support schemes and programmes.</p> <p>In 2017, I have had the opportunity to advance a number of important investments right across my brief, including &euro;11 million in approvals for projects under measures 1 and 3 of the 2017 outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme; &euro;20 million in approvals for the town and village renewal scheme, which focuses on economic development in rural towns and villages; &euro;7 million in approvals for the CL&Aacute;R programme for small-scale infrastructural projects in rural areas that have suffered the greatest levels of population decline; &euro;17.4 million for a new local improvement scheme for non-public rural lanes and roads; the &euro;5 million RAPID programme, which is focused on tackling social exclusion in disadvantaged urban areas and provincial towns; additional funding of &euro;3.75 million for the continued modernisation of the library service, enhancing services for library users and paving the way for the launch of the new public library strategy early in 2018; some &euro;1.4 million in grant funding for the Tidy Towns competition as we look forward to celebrating the 60th anniversary in 2018; and &euro;800,000 for 120 agricultural shows throughout the country.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Michael Ring:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1000"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1000&amp;amp;pid=MichaelRing&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Let me give a couple of examples of the impact that these investments can have on local communities.</p><p>The Ludgate Hub in Skibbereen is a digital hub that was given &euro;150,000 under the town and village renewal programme.  Ludgate is a great example of what can be achieved with the aid of Government investment.  There are now more than 30 businesses operating out of the hub.  It is a credit to those involved.  I recently visited the Blueway project in Drumshanbo, a project also supported by my Department.  It supports eight small local businesses.  Even these small investments can have an enormous impact on a town and the surrounding hinterland.  These projects offer the potential for local job creation and, if replicated, can generate real economic growth.  In a different way, the investment in the Tidy Towns competition serves to celebrate the wonderful example of volunteerism with results that benefit the whole community.  We know this is part of the social fabric we enjoy in Ireland and we must protect and promote.</p><p>The home from home learning programme in north-east inner city Dublin is another excellent example supported by revitalising areas by planning, investment and development, RAPID, one of the community programmes.  The programme is making a really positive difference to children and families in the area so that these children can grow up with the language and mathematical skills needed for success in life.  However, what was most striking to me in visiting the area was seeing how this whole community works together to make this happen.</p><p>Another initiative my Department is involved in relates to broadband connectivity.  We all know that this is a serious concern for many in rural Ireland, and the Government has committed to ensuring that high-speed services are available to every business, group or residential customer in every area of the country.  I am delighted to be supporting the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, in the roll-out of this project.  My Department has provided funding to every local authority to appoint a dedicated person to assist in ensuring that there are no local barriers to the roll-out of broadband.</p><p>I also want to mention the Charities Regulatory Authority which has also come under the remit of my Department.  This is Ireland's national statutory regulator for charitable organisations.  It is independent in its mission to regulate charitable organisations operating in Ireland.  Since its establishment in 2014, great progress has been achieved by the regulator as it seeks to increase public trust and confidence in the management and administration of those operating in the charitable sector.  The work of the regulator is a separate but important aspect of my Department's work in supporting the community and voluntary sector in Ireland, recognising the unique role charities play in supporting communities across Ireland.</p><p>The scheme to support national organisations in the community and voluntary sector, SSNO, is a key element of the State's support for the role of the sector in contributing to the development of strong and vibrant civil society and in improving outcomes for those most disadvantaged.  The Department supports volunteer centres in 21 counties as well as a number of national organisations such as Volunteer Ireland and young social innovators.  The funding of these organisations is designed to foster volunteerism in Ireland, building a support structure that would develop volunteering locally from the bottom up.</p><p>Social enterprises differ from commercial enterprises in that they have a social mission.  Social enterprise has a long-standing presence in Ireland, building on deep roots of community organisations, self-help and enthusiasm for enterprise.  In September, I committed to developing a national social enterprise policy.  As part of this work I announced a research partnership between my Department and the Social Finance Foundation.  Work on this research is ongoing.  A steering group is in place which involves both key Government Departments and experienced social enterprise practitioners.  The policy is scheduled to be completed in early 2018.</p><p>I mentioned earlier that achieving success involves the work of a number of Departments.  Collaboration between my Department and our colleagues across Government must lead to policies and programmes that take a holistic approach.  This approach must consider the needs of all communities, regardless of location or population.  Responding to the challenges being experienced by many communities requires many hands and financial investment across many Departments.  This cross-Government working and leveraging of effort and influence is at the heart of the two policy documents I mentioned earlier.  My capacity to engage at Cabinet level and bring that continued focus to this rural and community agenda is also going to be critical to achieving real impact.  Upcoming Government initiatives include the national planning framework and the national investment plan, ensuring the balanced regional rural and community development of communities everywhere is an important focus for me in working with colleagues across Government on these two policy initiatives.</p><p>In addition to the ongoing programmes of work being undertaken, my Department is also working its way through the challenges associated with its establishment.  There is no doubt that this brings its own workload but I am very pleased with the progress to date.  As well as making the practical arrangements, both legal and administrative, to establish the Department, we have welcomed a cohort of young, vibrant new staff to our ranks.  My officials and I recognise that part of the opportunity and the challenges for the new Department is to make a difference.  My team are in the process of finalising a statement of strategy which reflects the new combination of responsibilities.  By bringing together key policy, supports and programmes we can offer something which is greater than the sum of its parts. </p><p>I will conclude by saying that I believe the creation of this Department is a huge opportunity for communities across Ireland.  I know that the Senators here this evening share with me the aspiration that all our citizens have the same opportunities, regardless of where they live.  As Minister for Rural and Community Development, I am committed to ensuring that the policies of this Government reflect these aspirations and recognise the unique challenges these communities face.  I thank the Senators for their attention.</p></speech>

I congratulate him and wish him well in his new role.  What does hearten me is that the Minister is a man born from the roots of rural Ireland.  That does give me some confidence that he does understand the plight of rural Ireland and the pressures and strains that rural Ireland currently is going through.</p> <p>Having said that, there is no denying that the Fine Gael-led Government over the last couple of years has allowed this country to develop a two-tier economy where the growth is primarily concentrated in the major cities such as Dublin, which accounts for as many jobs as the next 45 towns and cities put together.  In many ways rural Ireland under Fine Gael to date is the black sheep of Government thinking.  Rural Ireland can be described as being in the intensive care ward.  We cannot just blame lack of finance.  The new Department of Rural and Community Development has a budget of &euro;212 million.  It is 36% behind expenditure targets as of November.  A whopping &euro;54 million has been left unspent in rural Ireland.  If we look at the many areas of concern, under the different headings and we go through the list, it does make for depressing reading.  </p> <p>We have 139 Garda stations closed which has resulted in an increase in rural crime of 8%.  The figure increased this year to 30,000.  We have had four Army barracks closed in Clonmel, Mullingar, Cavan and Castlebar.  We had 24 post office closures and 160 bank branches closed.  Rural schools are under severe pressure through lack of numbers.  We have had ten GP training positions unfilled as rural GP practices just cannot survive.  Bus &Eacute;ireann alone has reduced services by over 100 routes.  We have talked in this Chamber, and indeed in the other House, many times about the IDA and visits to rural Ireland.  Unfortunately, the evidence is laid bare to date.</p> <p>I refer also to the issue of rural housing of which I am sure the Minister is aware.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Robbie Gallagher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2471"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Access to rural housing by people who would like to live where they were reared is becoming increasingly difficult.  </p><p>I mentioned crime statistics earlier.  In regard to Garda stations and Garda numbers, Garda numbers in Athlone are at a critical level.  Almost half of the county, which has a population of over 65,000 people, is being policed by one patrol car six nights a week, and it is lucky to have two occupants in that car.  </p><p>I am heartened that the Minister, Deputy Ring, was born and reared in rural Ireland.  I would like to acknowledge some of the recent developments in this area.  The Minister referred to the local improvement schemes, the reintroduction of which everybody from rural Ireland has been striving to achieve.  I welcome the recent allocations for this scheme and I congratulate the Minister on securing them.  This scheme is vital to those who live in remote locations throughout rural Ireland.  There is much work to be done in this area.  In many ways, rural Ireland is at a crossroads and its future is in the hands of the Minister, Deputy Ring, and the Government.  Unless we do something different from what was done before, we will back here next year and the year after discussing this topic.  </p><p>There is a huge responsibility on the shoulders of the Minister, Deputy Ring, but I have confidence in him.  I am confident that he will be able to persuade his Cabinet colleagues that rural Ireland is a critical stage such that unless we have a plan to address the decline therein, it will reach the point of no return.  I look forward to more positive announcements from the Minister in regard to this area such that when we are discussing this issue in 12 months, I will have an opportunity to praise him for all of the good work done.</p></speech>

Is deas &eacute; a fheice&aacute;l.  I am delighted that he has responsibility for this portfolio.  I have a lot of respect for the Minister.  He wears his heart on his sleeve and he gives everything 100%, and God knows we need that for rural Ireland.  As mentioned by Senator Gallagher, the Minister is from Westport, which is in rural Ireland.  Westport has been one of the leading lights in regard to small towns in Ireland from a tourism perspective and the people working together.  Two and two makes a lot more than four in Westport and in terms of what the Minister has achieved.  This year's Entrepreneur of the Year is from Westport and he will be representing Ireland in the World Entrepreneur of the Year next May, another significant achievement on which I congratulate the Minister.</p> <p>I am very positive about rural Ireland, not least because the Minister understands what it is about.  That said, I have a number of concerns.  The Minister faces significant challenges.  In regard to employment, in the past seven years, 27% of households in rural Ireland have lost more than one person to emigration.  The percentage in this regard for urban Ireland is less than half that rate.  Between 2016 and 2011, rural unemployment increased by 192%.  As Senator Gallagher stated, we have a two-tiered economy.  The Minister effectively acknowledged this in his opening statement.  If anybody is going to do anything to re-align that trend, it will be the Minister, Deputy Ring, and he will have my support and, I am sure, the support of everybody else in this House, in doing so.  </p> <p>In regard to small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, four out of every five, or 80%, of all of the SMEs that closed between 2006 and 2011 were in rural Ireland.  There have been lots of plans and lots of strategies, and I note the new strategy contains 227 key objectives.  From my perspective, which I admit is a limited perspective, there are a couple of fundamental issues.  First, there is no joined-up thinking.  This was referenced seven or eight years ago in a CEDRA report.  Also, various Departments appear to be working in a silo effect.  The Minister mentioned in his opening remarks that he will make a sincere effort to bring about joined-up thinking and to rid us of this silo effect.  If we do what we always did, we will get what we will always got: a two-tier society in rural Ireland.</p> <p>In my view, we need effective balanced investment and by this I mean a greater emphasis on the return to communities and Ireland Inc. from investment.  For example, IDA Ireland spends four times, or 400%, more of its allocation on job creation than the amount given to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, which directly and indirectly, through its support to communities and businesses in the Gaeltachta area, employs 7,500 people.  Another key area referred to, including by the Minister, is housing.  We need to address the housing crisis.  The housing problem in Dublin and some of the other major cities in Ireland has been well highlighted but there are also significant housing problems in rural Ireland.  People are finding it almost impossible to get planning permission on sites owned by their parents, grandparents and other relatives.  There is need for focus on how people from rural Ireland can be supported to build a house or extend the house in which they live.  People have to be number one.  I accept there is a need for balance between people and the environment but this issue needs to be challenged.  I know that the Minister has the passion, ability and motivation to do that.  </p> <p>I mentioned jobs and one of our greatest successes is the Wild Atlantic Way, in which I know the Minister was actively involved a number of years ago.  It was his inspiration, and the inspiration of others, that helped create the Wild Atlantic Way.  It works well in the west of Ireland from a tourism perspective, but what about the rest of rural Ireland?  We need to look at what type of industries fit particular regions and at how we can develop clusters in those regions.  In this regard, we need similar initiatives to the Wild Atlantic Way, which, as I said, the Minister was instrumental in developing and creating.  What works in Connemara will not necessarily work in Monaghan, Donegal or Clare.</p> <p>The Minister mentioned innovation hubs.  Last January, I brought together in the AV Room representatives of four innovation hubs, including Ludgate, the purpose of which was to show Deputies and Senators what innovation can achieve such that they would be encouraged to work with Ludgate, Portershed and others on how to go about creating hubs in places like Westport, Castleblaney, Ennis and so on.  We can be leaders in our communities to help support the Minister in creating a better rural Ireland.  I hope to repeat that exercise next January or February, for which I will be seeking support across the House in terms of attendance and so on.  In 2016, some 44% of all the start-ups in Ireland were in Dublin.  This is the trend continually despite the fact that 40% of the population is in rural Ireland.  </p> <p>The Minister mentioned broadband, in respect of which there are two factors at play, availability, and connected to that, speed.  In my own county, Galway, 53% of the population has broadband.  In Dublin, 99% of the population has it.  Galway is the third largest city in Ireland.  There is a lot of work to be done in this area and it needs the motivation, drive and initiative that I know the Minister, Deputy Ring, has and we will support him in that regard.  Other speakers have spoken about schools.  In regard to nursing homes, the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, rate for a nursing home in Dublin is in the region of &euro;1,300 but the NTPF rate for Mayo, which is where the Minister comes from, is in the region of &euro;800.  I cannot understand why there is an approximately 70% gap in this regard.  This is one of the issues on which we need joined-up thinking.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2482"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2482&amp;amp;pid=PadraigOCeidigh&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I wholeheartedly support the Minister and am absolutely delighted that he is in this role because I am passionate about it.

I understand that he has recently established a new business in Connemara, which his daughter is running.  The entrepreneurial spirit is with Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh and we are fortunate to have his expertise in the House.</p> <p>I wholeheartedly welcome the Minister, Deputy Ring, in his new capacity as a Cabinet Minister.  It is long overdue, if I may say so, and I am absolutely delighted for him.  The first time I came across the Minister was when I canvassed for him in the 1994 by-election in Mayo.  At the time people were not giving Fine Gael much hope of winning that by-election.  Deputy Ring gave great hope when he won the by-election against all the odds, and he continued to do that in his capacity as a Minister of State in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  He reactivated the swimming pool grants scheme and the sports capital grant scheme, which assisted hundreds of sporting organisations in rural Ireland to kick-start capital investment at a time when money was not as plentiful as it is now.</p> <p>He has now taken on a new challenge of kick-starting parts of rural Ireland that have not necessarily benefitted from the upturn.  He is doing this is in a focused, strategic and determined manner, with the support of our new Taoiseach and Government.  The Minister, Deputy Ring, has been given this role because rural Ireland is in his veins.  He knows how it is done.  All one need do is look at his home town of Westport to see what has been achieved there in respect of development.  Many towns in Ireland would like to emulate what has been achieved in Westport.  Time will tell.</p> <p>I come from County Clare and we are the first county to have a rural development strategy.  We have a rural development directorate within the county council.  There has been much talk, especially at local authority level, about developing rural Ireland.  The Minister has made many different schemes available in his time in the role.  It is quite sad to see that some counties do not spend the money they have been given to any large extent.  Allocations of funding are made and in some categories the spend might only be 20% or 30%.  It is extremely frustrating for a Minister who has been constantly lobbied to make grant aid and money available for projects to see the money unspent at the end of the year.  The Minister can only do so much in his capacity as the Minister for Rural and Community Development.  There also is an onus on the people down along the food chain to get moving and to use their initiative, be creative and - most importantly - to spend the money they have been allocated.</p> <p>I had not realised until today that the Charities Regulator also comes under the Minister, Deputy Ring's brief.  It makes sense that it should because communities in Ireland are very involved in the charity sector.  I believe the regulator is an extremely important development that is badly needed.  We have seen the scandals that have taken place in a small minority of charities over the years.  The Charities Regulator will bring professionalism and transparency to the whole charity industry.  The streamlining of charities is badly needed.  There are mass sporting events that are held for charity where thousands of people take part in runs or cycles.  While it is great to see people out and about, like anything else it needs to be regulated.  The last thing we need is small towns or communities having to accommodate 8,000 to 10,000 participants in a mass sporting event.  While these events do have benefits, there are also challenges.  I would appreciate the Minister asking the regulator to review the protocols in place with local authorities in dealing with mass sporting events.  There are some mass sporting events that have a great history and have been going on for a long time such as the Ring of Kerry cycle.  A lot of other events are springing up, however, and I believe it is necessary to have some sort of regulation in order that the good people who are involved get to enjoy it and contribute to the event and that no community feels it is absolutely being taken over and hijacked for a weekend or some time.</p> <p>The fact that the Minister, Deputy Ring, is the first senior Government Minister with responsibility for rural and community affairs says a lot about the Government's commitment.  Looking back over the years, criticism can sometimes be justified in respect of rural Ireland being forgotten.  There have been cases of twin development where cities blossomed and rural Ireland was forgotten.  Since last June - and prior to that - but especially since this Department was created, a statement is being made about the Government's commitment.  It is similar to when the Department of Children and Youth Affairs was established and a senior Minister for children was appointed.  We then saw referendums and a lot of development in that area.</p> <p>I believe we will see significant wins in rural development very quickly.   The Minister, Deputy Ring knows that rural Ireland needs quick wins.  The money made available last week for the agricultural shows around the State was a significant development.  These shows, many of which have been running for decades, are run by volunteers and communities and act as attractions for tourism and so on.  For the first time, these agricultural shows will get financial support from the Government.  This is the type of joined-up thinking and partnership between government and community groups that will see rural Ireland foster, develop and achieve its potential.</p> <p>Aside from Athenry, one will never get the likes of Apple or Google employing thousands of people in rural Ireland.  We can, however, get thousands of cottage industries employing ten, 20, 30, 50 or 100 people that create everything from food to small crafts and so on.  These businesses can be sustainable and can sell the Irish message all over the world.  We have seen what can be achieved with joined-up thinking in the Wild Atlantic Way.  We see what can be achieved when there is a partnership between community groups and the Government.  I believe that if we are here in one or two years' time, we will indeed be praising the Minister for what has been achieved.</p> <p>All that is left for me to say is to wish the Minister, Deputy Ring, well.  He will have our absolute support in this House when it comes to his Department and the good work it is doing.  I would appreciate the Minister coming to the House perhaps every three or four months to update Senators on the various projects and schemes he is initiating that will not just revive rural Ireland but will also result in rural Ireland thriving.</p></speech>

I very much welcome the post and the setting up of the Department of Rural and Community Development.  There is a huge expectation around it.  While the Minister has &euro;220 million in his budget, I do not believe this is enough to make the changes that are needed in rural Ireland.  I believe that amount will only tweak things at the edges.  The first mistake made was the inclusion of 227 objectives in the plan.  I would rather have seen five objectives.  When one has a plan with 227 objectives and actions, it is very difficult to measure in a genuine way what is done - even percentage wise - and some of these objective may already have happened or be in process.  People's expectations of the Department are huge.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Department, which was established almost six months ago, has not yet been successful in its key role of co-ordinating other Departments to put rural Ireland at the front and centre of all Government policy.  I hope there will be a focus on this role so that people can see tangible results.  Lottery funds and other bits of money here and there are valuable in themselves, but something very drastic needs to be done across all Departments to stop the decline of rural Ireland.  I think all representatives will agree with that.  We need to drastically change our approach to rural Ireland.  I am worried that even though we have plan after plan, we are not yet seeing such a change on the ground.  As a mother of two children, I want to see things happening in rural Ireland.  No one is more keen than me to see things being done in a different way.</p><p>The first area I will focus on is the delivery of broadband, which would make a massive difference in rural Ireland.  We have heard plenty of figures, expectations and announcements.  Rural Ireland is suffering from announcement fatigue.  We are told that broadband is being given to 100 houses a day or whatever.  I need to know that when I get up in the morning, I will be able to send and download emails and do my business from Belmullet.  At present, there is no day of the week on which I can get such a guarantee.  It is constantly a question of whether I happen to be lucky on the day.</p><p>Like many other people, I cannot operate a business from there.  The lack of reliable broadband is preventing the creation of hundreds of jobs that could be created in rural Ireland.  People want to come back from England, America, Dublin and other parts of the country to set up in rural Ireland.  There is no reason people in County Mayo should not be able to operate in a way that allows them to link in and do business with companies in Tokyo, London or anywhere else in the world.  This would enable them to bring up their children in rural Ireland, send them to local schools and do everything else that is required.  The Minister has acknowledged the importance of volunteering in local communities.  All of those things are possible if people can get salaries, wages, incomes and careers in rural Ireland.</p><p>Huge opportunities are presented by the transatlantic cable and other things.  Broadband is desperately and urgently needed.  Every day we are without broadband and proper telecommunications, we are haemorrhaging jobs out of rural Ireland and stifling its growth.  National growth is not sustainable without regional growth.  The same point can be made about something as basic as mobile phone coverage.  I am not even talking about areas like Belmullet; I am talking about estates in Castlebar where people have to go outside the door to make a phone call.  For God's sake, we are in 2017.  It is not good enough to have to go outside the door and start walking around one's car to make a basic phone call from a mobile phone.  This issue needs to be addressed.  I know this matter is not the Minister's direct area of responsibility, but it falls under the general category of rural affairs.  If we cannot provide the basics, there is no point in giving money to golf clubs, etc.</p><p>I welcome the additional funding that has been provided for other infrastructure like roads under the local improvement scheme, LIS.  I did not want &euro;10 million to be taken from the Leader programme and put into the LIS.  I thought it was wrong to do that, especially because it was announced as new funding.  When things are announced, we often find that Peter is being robbed to pay Paul.  That has to stop.  There needs to be new investment in rural Ireland, just as there is in other parts of the country.  LIS funding is impossible for people to understand.  I know of people with dire illnesses and multiple medical conditions who have to use helicopter services to get to hospital.  They cannot get out of their houses.  Ambulances cannot get in.  After this debate has finished, I will tell the Minister who they are.  Medical staff cannot get into the houses of people who have paid property tax and every other tax under the sun.  They do not have access because the roads have not been repaired.</p><p>Much better co-ordination between central and local government is needed.  When we contact local authorities after great announcements have been made to ask whether certain roads can be done, the answer we receive is "No, that is not done, and this is here and this is there".  Elected members of local authorities need to have a say in where this money goes.  It should not be divvied out at the discretion of the chief executives of local authorities.  We must stop eroding the powers of our elected representatives.  There needs to be a direct line.  When funding is announced, it should be clarified whether the money in question is new money or money that has been shifted from one place to another.  The roads that are most in need should get done, and people with medical conditions should be given priority in that context.</p><p>I would like to speak about access to health in rural areas.  There is no point in allocating little bits of money.  In County Mayo alone, over 500 children with disabilities are waiting for the physiotherapy or occupational therapy they need.  It is not right that parents, family members and children have to go through such delays.  It is a rural issue because delays on the same scale are not happening in other areas.  We have to consider these issues as rural issues.  The accident and emergency department in Mayo General Hospital does not have the staffing levels required to meet the needs of seriously sick people with physical and mental health problems who come in the door.  The staff who are working in the hospital at the moment are run off their feet.  There is no point in putting in people who have just qualified.  We need people with qualifications and experience.  There are unacceptable waiting lists for treatment right across the board in rural Ireland.</p><p>I have much more I would like to say.  I look forward to the Minister's return to the House with the review.  Something drastic is needed to address the issues in rural Ireland.  I want to be positive about rural Ireland.  Like many others, I want to continue to live in rural Ireland.  I want to see it grow and develop.  We cannot continue with the two-tier growth that is evident at the moment.  There is an unemployment rate of 21% in some rural areas.  As the Minister will know, it reaches 35% in some parts of County Mayo.  When I come in here every day, I listen to people saying we are in a full employment situation.  Such lies need to be stopped.  We need to face the truth and deal with these problems.</p></speech>

She is not able to be here because she is stuck in transit at the moment.  I thank the Minister for his speech, in which he displayed his passionate and detailed approach to all facets of life in our communities and in rural Ireland.  When we consider these issues, it is important to look at all facets of what it means to be able to lead lives that are full of opportunities.  People in rural areas should be able to enjoy as many aspects of life as people in the rest of Ireland.  Far too often, the opportunities of people in rural communities have been constrained.</p> <p>I will not speak in detail about the issues that have been touched on by previous speakers.  The concerns in respect of broadband have been articulated clearly and strongly.  I would like to add to what has been said about transport concerns by saying there is a lack of awareness of the 17 local link services that are being rolled out in this country.  I might return to this issue.  As others have said, the post office network, which is one of many networks that have kept all the communities on this island connected and working, is under threat.  The great expressions of concern we have heard in this regard need to be reflected in the procurement decisions that are made in individual Departments.  I refer, for example, to decisions on driving licences and television licences.  There needs to be a long-term guarantee that social protection payments will continue to be made through our post offices.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Those issues are being treated separately when, in fact, they comprise a composite issue in respect of which joined-up thinking is required with regard to whether we will have credible hubs for local services and for the State's engagement with citizens.  Post offices have a role to play in this.  I ask the Minister to deal with a core issue, namely, the need to examine public procurement policies and look at how we use State moneys to ensure that the best and most appropriate benefits are obtained.  He and his Department are very well position to do this.  One cannot reserve contracts for particular contractors, but there is still a question of recognising a qualitative aspect of procurement, namely, whether something creates additional benefits for societies and economies at local level.</p><p>An example to which the Minister referred in this regard relates to the investment in libraries.  It is a source of great regret that the way in which the book-purchasing contract for libraries was rolled out precluded them from buying books from local bookshops or booksellers.  This is what I mean when I refer to joined-up thinking.  We need to have a discussion about public procurement policy - we have the scope to do this within the parameters of European regulations - in the interests of ensuring that we are using the most economically advantageous model and that we are taking account of qualitative as well as lowest-price indicators.  It is very much within the Minister's power to identify those qualitative indicators and bring them to the fore.</p><p>Another area of concern - this does not quite relate to procurement but, rather, to a new dynamic in contracting - arises in respect of our network of community development services.  Local development companies and community development services throughout the country - not just those in rural areas but also those in urban locations - have had a very difficult time.  Invisible factors, namely, the 80-10-10 rule and other rules, often constrain the community development services in terms of the work they might have done previously in developing the social fabric because such a large portion of their energies have, at times, needed to be redirected towards employment and training.  This has meant that many services for younger people and older people and those simply dedicated to keeping the fabric of communities healthy and vibrant have fallen away.  In that climate, there is increasing concern about SICAP funding and other forms of funding.  There is also concern regarding the fact that there is now a dynamic whereby competitive tendering processes are driving out some of the established services.  I know that there are a number of services involved and I do not have a rosy-eyed view of every single one.  I know, however, that there are very important community development services that really need to be considered.  We need to look at these organisations and listen to the concerns they have been flagging for a long period regarding how stretched their services are and their capacity to be free to respond to community needs as they arise.</p><p>As we are now operating in a different economic climate and have different goals, I urge the Minister to bring together the community developments services from rural and urban areas and listen and talk to them about what they need to maintain the fabric of communities.  This also issue relates to the RAPID programme and family resource centres.  These make up the web that allows us to maintain a health country in which people can live proper lives.  We need to ensure that we listen to those involved in terms of what it is that communities need in order to flourish.</p><p>I wish to address a number of other matters.  One of these relates to services for older people.  These services have also fallen somewhat by the wayside and the capacity relating to them has been diminished because the pressure has so often been on working age payments.  There are certainly concerns when it comes to older people.  Services such as wheels are essential in the context of keeping people connected.  Again, the postal service has a key role to play, not just in respect of post offices but also in the context of keeping people connected by means of postal deliveries.  Our transport networks are vital in ensuring that older people can lead full and dignified lives and participate in their communities.  There is also a wider debate - I am sure the Minister will contribute to it - regarding appropriate home care services.   We know that some of those who need care are also, in some cases, contributing at the same time.  Older people, for example, have been the lifeblood of much of our volunteering network in this country.</p><p>In light of the time constraints, I will conclude my contribution by focusing on two issues.  I would like the Minister to address the matter of the citizens information service network.  I ask him to examine the transcripts of the discussions in which the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection has engaged on this matter.  I am of the view that we are looking at measures that will endanger the very independence and community ethos of our citizens information service.  I refer the Minister to the joint committee's report on this issue and ask him to place it on his agenda.</p><p>My very final point concerns youth unemployment which is, as others here have indicated, a huge issue.  I worked with young unemployed people in rural County Wexford in the past.  The south-east region and the midlands have the highest rates of unemployment in the country, coming in at more than 8% higher than the national average.  At the time, I campaigned with those young people for a rural pilot of the European Youth Guarantee.  There had already been a pilot project in an urban setting, but the challenges faced by young people seeking employment, education and training in rural settings are quite different.  The State could really benefit from the piloting of a high investment project in order that we might learn from it.</p></speech>

When the Department of Rural and Community Development was established last July and he was appointed, we all felt it to be a massive boost for rural Ireland.  In fairness, the Minister very much epitomises all that is good about rural Ireland.  I congratulate him on being a champion for both rural Ireland and the west over many years.  The consolidation into a new Department of the policies and supports for community and rural development has provided the means for a greater focus on making communities more vibrant and sustainable.  Significantly, the Department also has a critical interface with the community and voluntary sector.  In this regard, it provides a key conduit for Government in its relationships with this sector.  The Department administers a wide range of programmes to support rural and community development, including the town and village renewal scheme; the CL&Aacute;R programme; the Leader programme; the RAPID programme; and the SICAP programme.</p> <p>The Department has certainly hit the ground running.  In the past few months alone, there has been major investment across a range of areas.  As the Minister said, &euro;17.5 million has been allocated to local authorities under the local improvement schemes this year in order to support the improvement of non-public rural roads.  I joined Roscommon County Council in 1999.  Local improvement schemes were a huge part of that local authority's work.  I saw people who had no access to their houses until those roads were improved.  Due to the position regarding funding, that scheme had to be curtailed.  In recent years, however, we have been able to catch up again and this second round of funding is very important.  I know that when people come to my house or my office, they are absolutely delighted to hear that there will be another chance they may be able to drive up to their houses in the future without damaging their cars.  This scheme is sustainable and comes at a reasonable cost to the home owner.</p> <p>Significant funding has also been provided in order to protect the elderly, with &euro;2.3 million being allocated for a new senior alert scheme.  This week there was an investment of &euro;800,000 to support 120 agricultural shows throughout the country.  This money takes account of the fact that smaller shows have struggled significantly in recent years.  I am familiar with these smaller shows.  I have seen them in Elphin, Strokestown, Boyle, Ballinamore and many other places and I know what they offer.  They provide the social event of the year and bring the people of the town and the local area together.  These shows have struggled because there are fewer pubs, shops, restaurants and businesses around to sponsor them.  Representatives of those shows could hardly believe it when they heard last Friday that they were each to receive an allocation of &euro;7,000.  They were absolutely delighted.  This money will go towards subsidising the shows in what are very difficult times.</p> <p>There has also been an increase in funding for the hugely popular town and village renewal scheme.  The allocation in this regard has been increased by &euro;3 million up to a total of &euro;15 million.  This will be of benefit to hundreds of rural communities.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Frank Feighan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2014"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Funding for the outdoor recreation scheme has also increased by &euro;4 million to &euro;11.5 million.  The scheme provides greenways for local people and families to use, which can also attract visitors and jobs to the local areas.  <br/><br/>Between 1999 and 2000, I was involved in Lough Key Forest Park.  I was chairperson of the action group, and that is what got me involved in politics.  We worked extremely hard and we got a grant from Europe which helped, and we made it a major tourist attraction<b>. </b>It is absolutely flying, but we need more infrastructure.  <br/><br/>I helped the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, open a fishing stand last Friday, 1 December.  That shows we have an all-year climate.  When I went to school, I was told we had a temperate climate.  I did not believe it until I went to eastern Europe and felt the Siberian wind coming through it.  I realised then that the Gulf Stream meant we had a temperate climate.  The infrastructure being put in place for all these things is vital for the tourist industry.  <br/><br/>I congratulate the Minister and thank him for the work he has done.  I know that he will not accept &quot;No&quot; as an answer from the Taoiseach or during budget negotiations because he is able to fistfight in the trenches for rural Ireland.  I wish him every success.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-12-05a.105" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1409" speakername="Colm Burke" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017120500002#AA00200"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House and wish him and his Department well in the job they are doing.  I join Senator Feighan in thanking him for the funding that he made available to 116 agricultural shows around the country.  One of those was in fact a show in my own parish of Inniscarra.  It was very pleased to receive that funding, and it was important to it.  A huge voluntary effort is made by people working in that area.  Over a period of 30 years, sports facilities have been built up in the area in one block of 46 acres, including rugby, GAA, soccer and camogie pitches, a community centre and a pitch and putt course.  These have all been made possible as a result of voluntary effort over the past 30 or 35 years, and they service a huge population in the immediate area.  When those volunteers started 35 years ago, there was very little support at local authority or national level.  The sports grants announced last week, together with the moneys announced for shows this week, are of benefit to all the organisations and the people working in them on a voluntary basis.</p> <p>We are facing major challenges in rural Ireland in many ways, and we need to deal with those challenges.  I am particularly concerned about elderly people living on their own who do not have sufficient public transport available to them.  I find that the big challenge for older people is that many older couples have an income from their pensions of over &euro;400 a week but find it difficult to live on that amount.  If one of them dies, the money decreases to &euro;250 a week, and it is a huge change and challenge for people.  If public transport is not available to them, they can become very reliant on help and assistance from neighbours.  It is important that we give support to voluntary groups that work in rural areas.  </p> <p>I recently spoke to someone whose work involves visiting farmers in rural areas.  That person found that a large number of those farmers were elderly but were working and living on their own.  We face a challenge regarding health care for these people.  It is fine to say that we want more home help hours, and I believe firmly in that, but it is important to know whether we will have sufficient numbers of people to provide that level of care so that people can continue to live in their own local areas.  </p> <p>We are making much progress, but we need to make much more.  In particular, we need to have progress on broadband.  If rural areas have broadband access, more families will live and work and raise their families there without necessarily having to travel to the big city.  We are now seeing a change occurring, where many people who work in the city or town two or three days a week are able to work from home on the other days.  That is something that will develop and grow over the next number of years, but in order to do that, people need the necessary infrastructure, particularly broadband.  It is one of the things we need to prioritise and push forward at a very fast pace.  It is important that is given priority. </p> <p>We face many challenges.  We are making a lot of progress when it comes to facilities for people who are visiting this country.  The evidence of that is the growth in numbers, despite the drop in the numbers coming from the UK.  I presume that is tied into the devaluation of sterling.  The figures announced last month show that there is an overall growth rate in the number of tourists still coming here, despite the drop in numbers from the UK.  That is welcome, but in order to bring people in, we need to have the facilities and infrastructure, and we need to make sure that the people who are providing the support for the tourist industry are given the necessary commitment, both at local and national level.  They need to know that we are on their side and want them to continue to improve and grow the services they are offering. </p> <p>I thank the Minister and wish him well in his portfolio.  I am sure, as my colleague has said, that he will not be take "No" for an answer when it comes to the areas he feels need to be prioritised in this very important Department.</p></speech>

All of us are united in wanting the best future for our rural and urban communities around the country.  That is the reason my Department was established by the Taoiseach in July.  It is the fundamental objective of my Department, and I am confident that with this strong mandate we will achieve much.</p> <p>I will respond to some of the issues raised by the Senators.  I will not be able to respond to them all.  Senator Gallagher mentioned the action plan.  I have tried to make the action plan framework stretch across Government.  My job is to make sure that every Government decision and every Minister is accountable to me at the Cabinet table.  That is what I am there for, and why the Department was set up.  I have my own functions, delegation powers and budget, but at the same time I have to make sure that every Minister is accountable to me at the Cabinet and also to rural Ireland.  That is the job I have to do.  People will say that I will get blamed for everything negative but will not get any credit for anything that is positive.  That is fine.  </p> <p>The senior alert scheme was mentioned.  That scheme has worked very well.  Senator Higgins also raised the issue and spoke about the campaign about community.  She is correct in what she said.  I launched the senior alert scheme in October and there was a tremendous response to it, simply because we went out and advertised the scheme.  Today, I had to put a further &euro;400,000 into the scheme because it is such a success.  I compliment everybody involved, including those in my own Department and those in Pobal.  We went out on the road to publicise it, and I am sure many elderly people are feeling safer at home tonight because they have that scheme.  </p> <p>Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh has gone, but I thank him for his kind comments.  He is somebody who really understands rural life and business.  He created many jobs over the years and worked very hard to try to keep rural Ireland alive.  I compliment him on his comments.  He is very job-orientated, and he is correct to say that if we are going to have people living and working in rural Ireland, we have to create jobs and infrastructure.  We must try to help the families that are going to live in rural Ireland.  Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh has been doing that all his life, and has tried to ensure that people are kept in employment in rural areas.</p> <p>Senator Conway-Walsh comes from my area, and she knows what we have done over the past year.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Michael Ring:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1000"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1000&amp;amp;pid=MichaelRing&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I will not give the Senator a history lesson tonight.  The Wild Atlantic Way, the greenways and the announcement regarding Ballycroy National Park last week will all help to create jobs.  </p><p>To address some of the issues Senator Conway-Walsh raised, she is quite right on broadband.  It is the most important piece of infrastructure we need in rural Ireland.  Broadband is needed.  In my Department, I have only one role and part to play in the matter.  We put funding in place to ensure that there was a dedicated officer in every county council.  That person is there to help overcome any difficulties when the broadband team rolls into town, whether they have to do with opening roads, dealing with the county council or dealing with the State agencies. They ensure that there is a common plan across the country so that we can get the teams in and develop the infrastructure.  I will give the Senator a few figures.  I know she is being critical of broadband not coming quickly enough.  Of course I would like to see it coming faster.  I would like to see it in many more parts of rural Ireland.  To be fair, there has been &euro;2.5 billion of commercial investment in broadband in recent years.  Some &euro;1.6 million is spent on broadband every day.  </p><p>The Senator does not hear from the people who are getting broadband.  Why would she?  They are happy when they get it.  She only hears from the people who do not have it, as do I.  It is my job, the Senator's job and everybody else's job to make sure that the commercial companies are brought in and roll out the broadband as quickly as possible.  The State also will be obliged to subsidise and intervene where the commercial companies will not operate.  Of course the companies will take the low-hanging fruit and the most profitable areas available.  They will not go into the places the Senator and I would like them to.  We are going to have to set up a tender process and subsidise the roll-out.  We will have to put it out for public procurement.  Senator Higgins spoke about public procurement and I will speak about that in respect of the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, in a minute.  Public procurement must be carried out or we will end up in the High Court as we did in the past in respect of the mobile phone licence.  We do not want that to happen.  I want to see broadband giving people opportunities.</p><p>Senator Conway-Walsh also mentioned the local improvement schemes, LIS.  I will tell the Senator quite directly that another Minister was in another Department for 17 months and he did not deliver.  I have only been in my office since July and I already have spent &euro;17 million on the LIS.  I will put in on the record of this House that I challenge the other Department to match my funding for next year.  I will also challenge the local authorities because they actually charge us to administer the LIS.  Even though their staff are getting paid on the ground, they still charge the Department to administer that scheme.  They should be taking some money out of the rates they receive and putting it into the LIS.  If we had a three-way game, more money would be going into the LIS.  </p><p>The Senator is correct.  Many people are paying their water charges because they have to.  They have their own water supplies and have to pay into their own schemes.  They pay their property tax and their other taxes.  They are entitled to have a road into their homes.  That is why I set up the LIS.  The Senator criticised me.  I will not say "criticise" as that is not fair.  She made a comment about me taking money out of Leader and putting it into LIS.</p></speech>

I am not to blame.  The Leader companies are.  We made 31 changes to the Leader programme.  I want to see it implemented.  I want to see more jobs created and to see that funding put into community organisation, businesses, hubs and job creation.  I do not want to see the companies sitting around, as they are now doing.  Today we have made our 500th approval in respect of the Leader programme.  It is beginning to happen.  I expect more to happen next year and the year after.  Others have criticised me about the Leader programme but everybody knows - and the Senator was involved in the community sector herself - that it takes two years to wrap up the Leader programme by the time applicants get their approval and start drawing down the money.  The money is there.  There was &euro;40 million available last year.  It was not drawn down and I had to look at ways and means of ensuring that money did not go back to the Exchequer.  That is what I am at.</p> <p>I am very proud of setting up the LIS.  People talked about it.  At a recent committee I reminded my Independent colleagues in the D&aacute;il that they have an Independent colleague who knows a lot about rural Ireland and knows that the LIS has certainly been a valuable scheme.  I will continue it again next year.  It will not be funded with money taken out of any other scheme.  It is in a programme that I will be announce early in the new year.  I hope the local authorities will draw it down together with any further funding we may have.  We will welcome any funding local authorities, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport or anybody else wishes to contribute to the LIS.  I have now set up the scheme and I hope they will all contribute to it.</p> <p>The Senator is quite correct on jobs.  Take the hub in Belmullet for example.  Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh also talked about the issue.  I have not always been the biggest fan of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta but in recent years it has got its act together and is now doing a fine job.  It is doing fine work in job creation.  Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh is quite correct, it does not get the funding the IDA or other State agencies get.  I will look at how it can assist and help me with some of my schemes.  As Senator Conway mentioned, funding for some schemes has not been drawn down by local authorities.  I might look at ways and means in which &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, the Leader companies or some other State agencies such as the Western Development Commission might be able to administer these schemes.  If councils are telling me they do not have enough staff or resources, I must look at other ways to roll out these schemes.  </p> <p>Senator Higgins spoke about communities.  She is quite correct.  Communities are very important, as is volunteerism.  Many Members spoke but none mentioned the funding of &euro;1,000 to &euro;3,000 I gave to towns involved in the Tidy Towns competition, as well as the &euro;4,000 given to bigger towns involved.  Next year is the 60th year of that competition.  That funding is not grant aid to the Tidy Towns competition.  It is a commitment to, and funding for, every town, village and community in this country.  That money will be spent in the local village.  It will be spent in the local community for the betterment of the community and of society.  I want to put my thanks to the Tidy Towns committees across the country on the record of the Seanad.  They do work the State does not.  We see these committees in Belmullet, Westport, Belcarra and all across the country.  I was recently down in Cork meeting with such a group.  There were 30 or 40 there waiting for me.  They were so proud of the place where they lived.  If we could get that community spirit in every corner of this country we would not have many difficulties.  </p> <p>Senator Higgins mentioned the seniors alert scheme.  I am glad to say that we launched it on 19 October.  We had a great campaign and 2,650 people have already made applications and have been approved.  I had to put a further &euro;400,000 into the scheme this week.  I was delighted to do so because it means that our senior citizens will at least get the pendants, whether for their hands or their necks, and will feel safe in their own homes.  I am delighted to do that.  </p> <p>The Senator also talked about public procurement in respect of SICAP.  I will read this for her: "In accordance with the Public Spending Code, legal advice, good practice internationally and in order to ensure the optimum delivery of services to clients, SICAP is subject to a public procurement process".  There is nothing I can do.  I do not disagree with what she is saying.  Whether it is in respect of SICAP or any of these community schemes, she is quite correct.  I saw it myself in inner city Dublin.  I saw the community coming out.  I saw people with young children teaching them how to read, how to write and how to do whatever they had to do in society.  I want to see these schemes working.  This is a job I have been given in government.  There are many organisations drawing down from the same pool.  There are organisations which need a bit of funding, help and support.  Where they are working, I want that work to continue.  Where they are not working, we have to look at them and at other ways to provide services.  </p> <p>The community remit is being transferred to me from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in January.  Of course I will talk to my officials about ways in which funding, whether for RAPID, for SICAP or for community programmes, can be targeted at the areas where it is required.  There are many such areas and it is not only a rural issue.  It is an urban issue as well.  We have both.  In urban areas all over this country we have very serious and difficult problems.</p> <p>Senators raised many other issues.  We talked about rural post offices and we talked about broadband.  The Government recently decided to make &euro;30 million available to post offices.  It is a big challenge.  I want to put it on the record that post offices will not close if people use them.  I put that on the record of the D&aacute;il or the Seanad at every opportunity I get.  Many people do not use post offices.  The only time they stand in a post office is when there is a protest.  The Government has to look at ways in which we can support post offices.  The Senator is quite correct on the social protection contract.  That contract has been given to the post offices.  We need to look at other services.  While I acknowledge that An Post has come to the Government with plans and will be coming with future plans, it must look at other business models to help.  We want to keep as many post offices as possible open.  I say that against myself.  Some post offices have 20 or 25 transactions a week and they will not stay open.  There are other post offices which could be kept open if they got a small bit of support, a bit of back-up and a few more services.  It is not an urban problem or a rural problem, but both.  There are rural post offices and urban post offices.  Both are needed.  I do not know the difference between urban and rural anymore because of the way in which society is changing.  </p> <p>I think I covered everyone who spoke.  Senator Colm Burke talked about broadband and tourism.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Michael Ring:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1000"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1000&amp;amp;pid=MichaelRing&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Tourism is a big issue, particularly in rural Ireland, and that is everywhere whether it is the midlands, the Border counties, or the west. </p><p>What infrastructure did we put in place for the Wild Atlantic Way?  None; the infrastructure was there.  We had the best infrastructure in this country.  What we did was to go out and promote it.  We put up a few signs and some signature points.

Again, communities bought into it.  They saw a market there for themselves.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is now doing a plan for the midlands.  The midlands have something unique and we need to be able to promote it and sell it.</p><p>It is similar to the position with communities.  The Government cannot do everything for everybody if communities themselves are not out there working and supporting one another.  One can see it in the sports capital programme and in the CL&Aacute;R programme, and in the town and village scheme, which is one of the better schemes we have introduced in the last year.</p><p>We talked about hubs.  Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh referred to them.  Look at Drumshanbo.  Senator Feighan knows about this because he was there when we opened a brilliant enterprise, where we had given them &euro;700,000.  The day we were there was fantastic.  Someone in the tourism sector told me that there are now thousands of people there every week.  It has lifted Drumshanbo.  We have now given them &euro;1 million to bring the project into Leitrim village and Ballyshannon.  It will open the towns and villages and keep people working in rural Ireland.  </p><p>The more investment we can target the better.  Senator Conway-Walsh referred to this.  It is about money and we must make sure that the infrastructure is in place.  The Gort to Tuam bypass has lifted that area and we need to continue it to the N5, from Tuam to Claremorris, down into Sligo and up into Letterkenny.  We have to open up the north west.  The Atlantic economic corridor is something in which I have a big interest.  We must get our infrastructure in place to ensure that we can compete with the east coast.  It is important that we get jobs into the regions.  The first quarterly report for the CSO said that 77% of jobs created this year were created in rural Ireland.  We need to spread them out more, get more jobs into rural Ireland, get more infrastructure and get them the supports and the help they need to create jobs because jobs keep people, they keep schools, shops and post offices.  That is what it is all about.  It is my job at Government level to make every Minister accountable to me, to Government and to rural Ireland.</p></speech>
