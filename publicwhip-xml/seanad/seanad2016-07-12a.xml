This caused much trauma, concern and pain to the people of the county.  Since then, they have been forced to travel, and sometimes to take their place in a queue, in order to have an emergency attended to in hospitals either in Cavan or Drogheda.  At the time the service was removed, the HSE promised that a primary care centre would be fast-tracked for north County Monaghan.  Unfortunately, that was over ten years ago and there has been no sign of a brick being laid.</p><p>We all agree on the virtues of primary care.  It is estimated that 95% of all health care can be taken care of at a local level.  Therefore, it is vitally important that such facilities are fast-tracked, particularly in a county that has no acute hospital services.  I am very disappointed with the delay.  I understood that different sites had been explored and examined and that a site at the current campus of Monaghan General Hospital had been selected.  We expected a lot more progress would have been made long before now and I am sad to say that I have nothing to report at this point.  I ask the Minister of State to update me on the current situation and explain the reason for the delay.</p></speech>

Two of his colleagues were on the programme as well, Senators Frances Black and Fintan Warfield, and they were way more talented than I.  I always wanted to be in a boy band so we had a good afternoon and got a bit of politics in as well.</p> <p>I congratulate Senator Gallagher on being elected to the Seanad and wish him the best of luck.  I thank him for raising the development of the primary care centre for Monaghan town and I welcome the opportunity to outline the current position on this important health infrastructure development.</p> <p>Over the past number of years work has been under way to deliver and manage health care as far as possible within a primary care setting, with patients less frequently requiring admission to hospital.  The development of primary care is central to the Government's objective of delivering a high quality, integrated and cost-effective health care system.  Enhancing and expanding capacity in the primary care sector is crucial to ensuring delivery of a preventive, joined-up approach to the management of the nation's health and the modernisation of primary care delivery.  The programme for a partnership Government sets out a clear vision for health services in Ireland that is community-based, responsible and accessible to patients.  The development of primary care is central to this by shifting the balance of care from a hospital-centric system to one located in the community, enabling users to access easily a broad spectrum of care services through their local primary care team.  I have outlined the principle behind the system and the broader vision involved.</p> <p>The delivery of primary care infrastructure is, however, dependent on a number of factors, including suitable locations being available, successful planning processes and a commitment by GPs to sharing accommodation and delivering health care services with HSE staff.  The HSE is looking to provide a new primary care centre in Monaghan town to best provide for the needs of the population of Monaghan and I strongly support the Senator's view on this matter.  The primary care centre for Monaghan town is included in the HSE's multi-annual capital plan and is currently at the design stage.  The proposed location is the Monaghan hospital campus and it is presenting certain technical challenges - hence the delay.  The HSE is examining these matters with the design team and all options for the delivery of the project are being considered.  This process to identify a satisfactory solution to address these design challenges has not yet concluded.  After the design issues have been dealt with, I hope to come back to the Senator and we can see what can happen from there.</p></speech>

I plead with him to use his good offices to try to ensure this project is fast-tracked as a matter of urgency.  I will not go over the same ground again.  Suffice to say this facility is badly needed.  It would be very much appreciated by the people of County Monaghan, and by me, if the Minister could use his good offices to assert the case for the primary care centre for Monaghan town.</p></speech>

We need to make progress.  I will talk to the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, about the design and technical delays.  We all agree in principle that a primary care centre is needed in Monaghan.  A site is available, so we should do the job.  I assure the Senator that I will bring his message to the Minister.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-07-12a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1379" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016071200002#D00400"><p>I wish to ask about the public procurement of products and services for the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, IBTS.  I have already submitted details to the Department of Health.  We know that, under statute, the Irish Blood Transfusion Service is fully accountable to the Minister for Health.  The principal activity of the IBTS is to provide blood and blood products for humans.  The IBTS is also responsible for the collection of blood platelets and for managing the unrelated bone marrow registry in Ireland.</p> <p>My concerns relate to public procurement.  It has been brought to my attention that there are issues in this regard.  When a body raises concerns, one must differentiate a failure to secure a procurement contract through a public procurement process from more substantive concerns.  I am not here to make that judgment call.  I wish to express concerns raised by parties who have been in touch with me and to seek reassurance that the procurement process is being followed to the letter of the law.  We all know that the key thing underpinning confidence in any public procurement process is transparency.  I wish to see reassurances from the Minister on five or six key matters.  Does the organisation maintain a tender list?  We need to see a schedule of advertising of products and services.  There is a subtle difference between the product - blood transfusions - and the services that the board contracts in.  Are there records of tendering timescales, receipts of opening of tenders, records of all tender evaluations, and retention of these records historically - or certainly for a period of five or six years - for potential audit?  The concerns I heard were about a number of issues relating to products and services provided by the IBTS.  I request that the Minister - not necessarily today, but in the future - discuss these issues with the Irish Blood Transfusion Service and seek assurances that the public procurement process is being followed to the letter of the law in respect of the various thresholds that apply for public procurement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-07-12a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1359" speakername="Finian McGrath" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016071200002#D00500"><p>I thank Senator Victor Boyhan for raising this important issue.  Before I respond to him, I pay tribute to all who donate blood to the Irish Blood Transfusion Service.  This fantastic service saves many lives.  We all know of friends and family members who have benefited from it.  I am taking this commencement debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, so I will raise the points made by the Senator when I speak to him.</p> <p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue and for giving me the opportunity to address the House.  The remit of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service is to provide a safe, reliable and robust blood service to the Irish health system.  Blood and the products derived from it are an integral part of our health care delivery.  A major objective of the IBTS is to enure that it always has the necessary programmes and procedures in place to protect both the donors and the recipients of blood and blood products.  The Department of Finance published a revised code of practice for the governance of State bodies in May 2009.  The code defines corporate governance as comprising the systems and procedures by which enterprises are directed and managed.  State bodies must serve the interests of the taxpayer, pursue for value for money in their endeavours and act transparently as public entities.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Finian McGrath:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1822"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1822&amp;amp;pid=FinianMcGrath&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The boards and the management of State bodies must accept accountability for the proper management of the organisations involved.  State bodies and their subsidiaries are required to confirm to the relevant Minister that they comply with the up-to-date requirements of the code in their governance practices and procedures.</p><p>In regard to the procurement issue, the IBTS has confirmed in writing in respect of 2015 that requirements for public procurement are understood and adhered to; appropriate attention is given to, and adequate procedures are in place for ensuring compliance with procurement policy and guidelines; EU directives and national regulations on procurement are being complied with; and a corporate procurement plan is in place in accordance with the national public procurement framework.  This procurement plan reinforces the IBTS's commitment to effective and efficient resource allocation and service provision to all its customers.</p><p>A copy of the annual accounts of the IBTS and the auditor's certificate and report thereon must also be presented to the Minister.  The IBTS financial statements are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, and the 2014 statements were laid on 5 October 2015.  The 2015 statements will be laid very very shortly.  Every effort will continue to be made to ensure robust governance is in place in the IBTS, including in regard to procurement.</p></speech>

I was reading it line by line as the Minister of State delivered it.  I note that in the last paragraph he raised the issue of the 2015 auditor's report and accounts and added that it will be laid before the House very very shortly - I note the Minister of State added the words "very very" to his script.  I welcome that.  I suggest we look at them.  The period I am referring to is in 2015.  The sooner we could have the 2015 statements before the House, the better.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Pat Breen.  It is appropriate that he would take this matter as it falls within his area of responsibility.  Commencement matters are regularly taken by Ministers who have no line responsibility as such.</p> <p>The Marrakesh treaty was a culmination of years of work by the International Blind Union and various NGOs involved in sight loss and people with eyesight difficulties, the principle being access to print material.  Unfortunately 90% of the books printed in the world are not available electronically.  People who are blind or visually impaired or who have sight loss as a result of diabetes and various other conditions have limited access to books.  I often give the analogy that if one were to go into Easons on O'Connell Street and find 90% of the shelves empty, one would get out the back door as quick as lightning because of lack of choice.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is the situation faced by people who are blind and visually impaired in terms of access to printed material.  As a result of technology upgrades, such as the iPad and improvements in digital facilities and so on, the provision of print material in electronic format is simple.  The problem that arises is one of copyright and publishers.  </p><p>Following years of negotiations between the various stakeholders, the UN Marrakesh treaty was agreed.  I raised this issue in the House prior to its agreement and the Minister of State's predecessor, Deputy Sherlock, took a hands-on approach to ensuring Ireland played its role in the negotiations that took place on the treaty.  The Marrakesh treaty has now been ratified by 20 countries, which effectively means that it will come into force.  When is it proposed that Ireland will ratify this treaty?  Does the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Breen, have a timeline in mind?  Are his departmental officials working on ratification of the treaty and, if so, when can we expect Ireland to sign up to the treaty?  </p><p>The Marrakesh treaty eliminates the copyright issues around the provision of print material in electronic format.  Most countries have a lead agency which deals with this process to ensure the integrity of the process is protected and, obviously, that the interests of publishers are protected.  If the copyright issues are dealt with, as is the case in respect of the Marrakesh treaty, and if Ireland were to ratify it, I would contend that instead of 90% of books not being available, 90% of books would be available.  This would be revolutionary for the 270,000 people in this country who are blind or visually impaired.</p></speech>

I thank Senator Conway for raising this important issue.  I know the Senator well and I am aware of his special interest in issues affecting people with disabilities.</p> <p>The Marrakesh treaty was adopted on 28 June 2013 at Marrakesh and was signed by over 50 countries.  It is an international agreement under the auspices of the World Intellectual Property Organisation based in Geneva.  The treaty facilitates access to published works for persons who are blind, visually impaired or otherwise print disabled.  The object of the treaty is to improve access to books and other publications in braille, large print text and audio format.  The treaty also provides for the exchange of works across borders by organisations that serve people who are blind, visually impaired and print disabled.  </p> <p>Canada recently became the 20th state to accede to the treaty, which means the treaty will now come into force on 30 September 2016 for those countries that ratified it.  When the treaty comes into effect it will oblige contracting states to introduce limitations and exceptions in copyright law to ensure access to books and other publications in accessible format.  It will also oblige contracting states to allow the import and export of accessible versions of books and other copyrighted works without the need for permission from the copyright holder.  This sharing of works in accessible format should increase the overall number of works available to persons in need.</p> <p>Ireland played an integral role in the negotiation of the Marrakesh treaty and contributed to the conclusion of the treaty during the Irish Presidency in 2013 of the European Union.  Subsequently, the Government approved the signature of the treaty by Ireland and the permanent representative of Ireland to the United Nations in Geneva, Patricia O'Brien, signed the treaty on behalf of Ireland on 20 June 2014.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Pat Breen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1766"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1766&amp;amp;pid=PatBreen&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This indicates Ireland's commitment to the objective of the Marrakesh treaty.  Ratification of the treaty will require contracting parties to adopt national law provisions which will permit the reproduction, distribution and making available of published works in accessible formats through limitations and exceptions to copyright.  Ireland and other EU member states operate exceptions in their national copyright laws allowing for the adoption of books into formats easier to use for visually impaired persons.  This does not operate in a harmonised manner, however, and the current framework does not facilitate cross-border sharing of accessible format copies, which is a cornerstone of the treaty.</p><p>The European Union signed the treaty in April 2014 on the basis of a proposal by the Commission and a mandate from the Council of the European Union.  In discussions following the act of signature, the Council could not reach agreement ratification within the EU.  As a result, the European Commission has formally asked the Court of Justice of the European Union for its opinion on whether the European Commission has exclusive competence to conclude the Marrakesh treaty on behalf of the European Union.  This matter remains under consideration by that court.</p><p>The EU remains committed to ratification of the Marrakesh treaty, and this commitment is reflected in the Commission communication on copyright published in December 2015.  In its communication, the Commission outlined its intention to bring forward legislative proposals to ratify and implement the Marrakesh treaty.  These proposals are expected in September 2016.  Ireland remains fully supportive of the aims of the treaty and is ready and willing to work proactively in Council towards ratification of the treaty as soon as possible.</p></speech>

The strategy of it being an all-European treaty to be ratified by all countries at the same time is good.  Ireland has a small publication of print material while Europe has significantly more.

An independent copyright review committee was established by the then Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in May 2011 to examine copyright framework from the perspective of removing any obstacles to innovation.  The committee's report, Modernising Copyright, was published in October 2013.  The report contained in excess of 60 recommendations covering a diverse range of issues, including that of the access to justice before the Courts, particularly for low-value claims relating to intellectual property infringements.</p> <p>Since publication, the Department has conducted extensive analysis of the recommendations, including examination from a policy perspective with relevant Departments and assessment of the complex legal issues involved in certain proposals.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, expects to be in a position in the coming weeks to bring to Government the Department's response to the committee&rsquo;s recommendations and to seek approval for legislative proposals on several of its recommendations, including the area of interest to the Senator.  I am sure Senator Conway is aware of the copyright review committee, chaired by Dr. Eoin O'Dell.  I thank him for raising this issue and will keep him informed of any developments in this area and of the report in September.</p></speech>

An interesting fact has emerged to the effect that, following over 20 years of reports and consultants being asked to consider issues on behalf of different Ministries in the UK, no report disagreed with the British Government's position.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mark Daly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2246"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2246&amp;amp;pid=MarkDaly&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is an amazing statistic when one thinks about it.  I am sure the statistic would not be much different in Ireland but as Mark Twain pointed out, &quot;Facts are stubborn things, but statistics are more pliable.&quot;  The facts of the report from the trauma steering group which was set up by then Minister for Health, the current Minister for Social Protection and by all accounts the future leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Leo Varadkar, are that the nine emergency departments in Cavan, Naas, Portiuncula, Kilkenny, Mullingar, Clonmel, Cork's Mercy Hospital and Portlaoise would be shut down and their patients would be moved, along with any future patients, into an already overcrowded and chaotic emergency department system.<br/><br/>It must be borne in mind there is a lack of joined-up thinking here.  Currently some of those hospitals are actually advertising for consultants for their emergency departments at the same time as a steering group is proposing that those very departments would be shut down.  Would a consultant, in all seriousness, take up a post when a death notice is being served on these departments and with 400 trolleys plus per day already in the system of the emergency department wards? That is why we are pushing for an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister would come to the House today to discuss this issue and the state of our chaotic health system.<br/><br/>From start to finish emergency departments and our emergency ambulance service around the State - and the Leader would know with regard to Cork and Kerry - are hugely under-funded.  People are not getting the emergency treatment they require in time and therefore spend longer in hospital, spend more time in recovery and tie up more beds in the long term.  This report, although shocking, is a great credit to <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>for highlighting the fact that a bad situation is now being made chaotic.  The chances of people taking up posts in those nine hospitals, the emergency departments of which have been earmarked for closure, will make that situation virtually impossible to rectify.  The report in itself will cause chaos in the emergency departments in the hospitals that I have outlined.<br/><br/>I seek leave from the House to introduce an amendment to the Order of Business to allow for No. 18 to be introduced.  It is the National Anthem Protection of Copyright and Related Rights (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill to allow for-----</p></speech>

I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Education and Skills to the House to give Senators a heads up on the Peter Cassells' report.  I found the report somewhat fascinating.  After two years they could come up with only three elements of how third level education could be funded.  This is extraordinary: either keep the current fee system and raise the fees, abolish the fees or have loans.  The idea of asking students for loans and the way the banks have treated graduates and undergraduates in this country is absolutely outrageous.  You could not write it down.  Banks are rocking up to the university campuses, setting up stalls on students' day, asking students and their parents, in the safety of the university environment, to take out loans and then when the students qualify the interest is raised on these loans.  It is outrageous and it beggars the best of them for the next 25 years.  I could not understand why there has been no in-depth analysis on proper means testing of third level education.</p></speech>

There is something radically wrong when that is happening and at the same time we are bringing in all sorts of people who were educated outside Ireland.</p> <p>How come we have no in-depth analysis so that if one does not have the money, one gets the education free and if one can pay, one pays?

Recent reports have highlighted the future of emergency medicine, with recommendations that increased centralisation of specialist emergency departments in larger hospitals does not work.  The potential closure of nine emergency departments around the country is extremely worrying for service users.</p> <p>When will this report from the trauma steering group be presented to the Minister and can the Leader request that the Minister update the Members on any restructuring that is proposed or coming down the tracks?  It is not just the advertising for consultants; it is also nurses and ancillary staff.  There is already an atmosphere of uncertainty and this will only add more fuel to the chaos that exists in our emergency departments countrywide.

Although only three options are laid out, we need to have a discussion.  The future of education is one of the most significant things we will discuss over the next few years.  We need to talk about investing in our future, our young people and in lifelong learning.  The narrative yesterday was heavily based on talk of income-contingent loans.  I was saddened by that because when one looks at the figures attached to free education and loans, there is only a 0.2% difference in GDP over the course of around 15 years to fund either one, so both come with a huge cost, yet people seem to be fearful of the idea of free education.</p> <p>On free education, people were saying yesterday on different media outlets that it has failed, as there was no influx of people from minority or working class backgrounds entering education just because free fees existed.  However, it was not the idea of free fees that failed, but us who failed to address the years of oppression and inequality that existed in those minority groups and that acted as a barrier to them even realising that free fees existed or that college existed for them.</p> <p>I fully back the idea of free education.  I know what it has given me.  If it had been necessary for me to take out an income-contingent loan or if I had to pay for my education, I would not be in the position I am in.  Education is much more than filling a skills gap or creating new technologies.  It is about opportunity, choice, freedom, and our future.  Being in education, as a result of free education, my children will now go on to education.  That changes the trend for the generations that come behind us.</p> <p>Leading up to the general election, every party in this House, bar Fine Gael, spoke about their stance on fees.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Ruane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2481"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Every party committed to not supporting an increase in fees.  I would like to remind those who supported that policy that if we were ever to advocate for the third option, it would involve fees at a later date - there is no point trying to call it anything else.  It is really important for us to have this debate before the summer recess.  </p><p>College courses will resume in September and October.  It is a shame that the report does not address their financial situation.  As somebody who has sat on the finance board of Trinity College for the past year, I know the majority of colleges are working under a deficit, bar UCD which has generated significant income from postgraduate courses.  Perhaps it is time for the university sector not to be afraid to acknowledge the deficits that exist.  They have not done so to date because their rankings are falling and they do not want to put off international students.  They are afraid to say how bad things are in the sector.  I ask the Leader to consider having a debate on the matter before the summer recess.</p></speech>

Like other speakers, I believe it is a very urgent and important issue, and one which we should debate in the House, in particular because six Senators represent university constituencies.</p> <p>Unlike Senator O'Donnell, I think the report was helpful.  It was not very surprising, in that Peter Cassells had more or less indicated what would be in it.  The Royal Irish Academy did a good deal of work on the report.  Senator Ruane and I spoke at a seminar in Trinity College some months ago which examined the different models under consideration.  Like Senator Ruane, who has put the case for the State funded system very eloquently, and which the Cassells report puts forward as option one, I would also endorse that option.  It is the way we should proceed and is the norm across other EU countries.  It clearly provides for education as a right rather than a privilege.  In the same way as Donogh O'Malley provided for free secondary education in this country, which was a revolutionary move at the time, we should move back to that system and reject the proposal for a deferred payment loan system as proposed in the other options.</p> <p>In response to Senator O'Donnell's point on the funding needs of universities, it is very clear if one looks at the evidence gathered by a range of different bodies, including the European University Association, that between 2008 and 2013, inclusive, Ireland had an 18% increase in student numbers but a 29% decrease in public funding.  Student numbers increased at a very significant rate, yet funding has fallen which of course has had an effect in terms of declines in international rankings and student-to-staff ratios.  In 2016, they were 21:1, compared to the OECD average of 14:1.  </p> <p>We need to be very clear about the needs of third level, in particular when we consider demographic change.  The Cassells report states that &euro;1 billion is needed over the next 15 years by way of investment in third level to accommodate a growing population.  We need to be clear about the urgency of introducing a new system for funding universities.  We also need to be very clear about the disadvantages of a deferred payment loan scheme.  The Cassells report puts the evidence fairly.</p> <p>I welcome that we will have a debate on Friday on the motion to establish a citizens' assembly.  The first issue for debate by the assembly will be the eighth amendment.  I am concerned to note that no timeframe has been set out for that particular aspect of the work of the assembly.  The Leader and I were heavily involved in the Constitutional Convention, a model from which the citizens' assembly clearly borrows.  In that model, there was a clear timeframe - I understand it was four months - for the first issues under consideration.  It is unfortunate that the motion before us does not set a timeframe within the overall timeframe of one year for the work of the assembly.  There is no tight timeframe for a decision or recommendation to be made on this very important issue.  I know we will have more time to debate the matter on Friday, but I wanted to put that matter on the record now.</p></speech>

As we all know, it has suffered huge reputational damage.  There was a serious loss of confidence in construction.  If we are to meet the pressing needs in housing, foreign direct investment and economic growth we have to have a vision and strategy on how we propose to provide for a sustainable construction sector.  I have said here before and I will continue to repeat that we need the skilled craftsmen, tradespeople, apprentices and graduates to meet the growth demands currently in our economy.  We can make all the calls and table all the motions we like in this or the other House, but if we do not act quickly, have a strategy to deal with it, talk it through, debate it and make the resources available to deal with the issues and barriers that exist, we will not meet that demand.  That is fairly obvious for everyone to see.  Will the Leader provide for a debate on the future of the construction sector and acknowledge the work of former Senator Feargal Quinn and of the former Minister, now our colleague, Senator Ged Nash, on this important issue?</p></speech>

As of three hours ago, 419 people were waiting on trolleys in emergency departments in this country, and this is the middle of the summer.  The hit list of emergency services covers all parts of the country.  As we know, overcrowding in accident and emergency departments is a problem.  All the data suggest that it leads to increased mortality among patients who attend them.</p><p>We used to bemoan the fact that some counties did not have an accident and emergency department.  If some of these cuts come into practice, we might have whole regions without one.  While I understand why we need to centralise services, and I welcome the BreastCheck and the prostate referral system, we cannot over-pressurise accident and emergency departments that are already overcrowded.  That would be my concern.  Also, these types of leaked recommendations are not helpful to staff working in the hospitals and GPs who would refer frequently to their local services.  For example, Cavan trauma cases could be transferred to Beaumont Hospital or Connolly Memorial Hospital.  Both these hospitals have major capacity issues.  Kilkenny, Mullingar and Wexford trauma cases could transfer to the Mater or St. Vincent's.  All these hospitals are bursting at the seams.  This is coupled with an ambulance service that is under-resourced.  We have an ageing fleet.  Often the roads from the accident or the emergency to the trauma centre have poor infrastructure.  I ask the Minister to come in to discuss some of these issues.</p></speech>

Contrary to what has been said, as I understand it there is not a proposal before the Minister yet and he has not received the report.  Therefore, until such time as he gets it, I do not think he can give us the answers we are looking for, but I believe that at the earliest possible date the Minister should provide clarification on this matter.</p> <p>We have a lot of criticism of the health service.  Some of it is justified, but we also need to understand the volume of people going through the system.  I have repeated this figure previously.  There are 63,000 people a week going through outpatient departments between all our hospitals.  Another 23,000 a week go through our accident and emergency departments.  An impression is being given that nothing at all is being done.  In addition, life expectancy in this country has increased by more than two years in the past ten years.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colm Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2353"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There have been improvements in the health service.  For example, there has been a huge increase in the number of day-case procedures being carried.  There have been many good developments.  However, on this particular issue, the Minister needs to clarify the position at the earliest possible date because people are unduly concerned.  A proposal was put forward to the effect that the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI, would consider this matter.  The relevant report has obviously been leaked and it is now time to clarify matters.  I ask the Leader to request that the Minister for Health come before us at the earliest possible opportunity in order that he might provide that clarification.  Obviously, the Minister must get the report first.  The sooner he does so, the sooner we can obtain clarification.</p></speech>

In seeking a debate, however, we must take a much broader approach.  Senator Coffey referred to the need to examine the position with regard to apprenticeships.  Until we have the two options of a vocational stream and an academic stream within the education system and until there is parity of esteem between both, we will not have a proper third-level education system.  Unless we restore to secondary schools the guidance councillors who were removed, we will continue to experience the considerable attrition rates at third level, particularly in first year.  If we are to have a debate, we should begin by looking at education, particularly higher education, in the round rather than at the Cassells report <i>per se</i>.  We also must look at the staffing of higher education because there are still staff who are on zero-hour contracts.  Some academic lecturers are on contracts whereby they are paid between &euro;10,000 and &euro;15,000 per annum.  If we are to have a debate on this matter, what needs to happen is that we set aside the Cassells report and consider instead what is wrong with the higher education system.  Higher education is in a state of crisis.  All we are hearing about are the grand flowery things, we are not being told what is happening on the ground.  As already stated, higher education is in a state of crisis.  Before we start discussing how to fund it, let us start talking about what it should be delivering.  As Senator Coffey said, we will pay a significant price in the coming years for failing to develop an apprenticeship scheme that provides for the needs of the economy.  It is my belief that too many people who would have made great carpenters or plumbers are graduating with arts degrees.</p></speech>

The judging team is in Ireland at present.  It is visiting Limerick, where there has been a huge display of community spirit.  The whole of O'Connell Street is closed off and everything from pastries to fish and chips is available to eat.  Schools are also involved.  There has been a great community effort and a major clean-up.  I also wish the other counties, the sister cities and Galway the best of luck.  However, given where I come from, I will obviously be supporting Limerick on Friday.  Certainly, it is positive that the European Commission has sent a representative as well.  I merely want to highlight the community spirit that has been created.  When the judges arrived last night, there was a gathering of people of different religious beliefs across all the different communities and all the bells in the various churches rang out.

However, this is not a new phenomenon.  While I take on board the concerns of certain colleagues to my left in respect of the number of sick and elderly patients on trolleys, it would serve us well to remember that in January 2010, under the stewardship of then Minister, Ms Mary Harney, there were over 500 patients languishing on trolleys.  This just goes to show that the path was wrong then, that it is still wrong and that we need to change our ways.</p> <p>I wish to refer to what has happened in the North.  I take a somewhat personal view on this matter, particularly in view of the fact that we spoke a great deal about incitement to hatred a couple of weeks ago.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have seen towering bonfires, the burning of the Tricolour and images of politicians, and displays of sectarianism and ethnic hatred.  This cannot go unnoted.  We must ask: where will it stop?  It is incitement to hatred.  I call on the Taoiseach, the leaders of the political parties and the new British Prime Minister to examine what is happening.  What example does the burning of the flag of the Republic of Ireland and the incitement to hatred give to young people in the North?</p><p>In the wake of the High Court case taken by the County Tipperary farmer, I request that the Leader ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to come before the House to tell us what action he will take to put right the injustice that has been done to many farmers across the State.  It is very clear that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has flouted its rules and procedures and this has not been confined to County Tipperary.  It is very clear also that any farmer who has had an inspection without the signing of a control report must now have his or her money, interest, and costs reimbursed immediately.  Furthermore, it is imperative that their entitlements be reinstated so as not to affect payments in the future.  The Agriculture Appeals Office also has questions to answer.  Instead of being an independent appeals office, it is endeavouring to justify the actions of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It is very clear that the constitutional rights of farmers right across the State were breached and it is unacceptable the Department has not yet commented on this development.  We need the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Michael Creed, to show leadership.  It is appalling that farm families have had to go before the courts to establish their rights.</p></speech>

I very much welcome a debate on all aspects of this in the Chamber.  I would prefer to bring all the stakeholders as well as politicians around.  I saw five years ago the heat generated by such a proposal in Roscommon.  Nobody wanted to listen to expert opinions or even the consultants.  It got to such a stage that nobody wanted to listen.  We need a very careful and rational debate.  Before we run for the barricades, we need to look at Roscommon.  I am not saying that what is happening around the country is right, but we do need to look at what has happened in Roscommon.  The hospital is much safer and busier.  Dozens of lives have been saved.  Now, five years later, I can see that had the situation been different we could have worked together.  I welcome the debate.  It is absolutely right to raise this today.  I hope the report will be published soon.</p> <p>Senator Conway-Walsh is absolutely right.  I was horrified to see images of what was happening in the North last night, with not only the Irish Tricolour but election posters of members of Sinn F&eacute;in and Independents burning on the bonfires.  It would be wrong if this were to go unnoticed in this House.  Some of those involved are community groups that get funding from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and others.  This is incitement to hatred.  We need to bring the relevant Minister to the House, as I really think it should be raised.  If it happened in any other country, any other part of the United Kingdom, or elsewhere in Ireland, we would all be up in arms.  I am not afraid to raise these very important issues.  I agree absolutely with Senator Conway-Walsh.</p></speech>

I have been contacted by people who work in the museum, who raised the lack of communication about the future plans for this Chamber.  They are aggrieved that requests for finance in previous years in order to upgrade the facilities in the National Museum were put to one side.  They believe the cultural heritage and the arts communities have been affected disproportionately by the downturn in the economy and the decisions made by various Governments.  Now they are aggrieved that investment in the museum is being made to benefit the Houses of the Oireachtas and not the museum itself.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2301"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2301&amp;amp;pid=AodhanORiordan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is a great deal of misinformation in regard to whether this House will decamp to the National Museum for one year, two years or three years and in regard to what curtailment will inevitably come into effect in terms of the exhibitions and outreach programmes that can be held by the museum.  If this House is to move, as clearly it is proposed to do, the communication lines in that regard need to be better.  Perhaps the Leader will ask the Minister with responsibility for this area, Deputy Humphreys, to come to the House for a debate on this issue, which I am sure is one of interest to most Senators.  We do not want to be encroaching on another part of the wider campus, not uninvited and not unwelcome, without ensuring that the transition is as smooth as possible and does not overly inhibit the facilities already in place.  There is a wider discussion to be had about the stature of the arts, culture and heritage in this State.

I also understand that the Minister has yet to read and respond to it.  However, I join with colleagues in asking the Leader to provide for an early debate on the report with the Minister.  I make no apologies for being parochial and saying that I would be concerned if there were to be any diminution of services at Cavan General Hospital.  I am concerned that it is on the list and that there might be any reduction in services available to the people who use them, which is ultimately the issue.  I appeal to the Leader to provide for that debate as a matter of urgency.</p> <p>Last week, I raised with the Leader the issue of how we could make greater use of home help hours and home care packages and, specifically, the carer's allowance to help reduce hospital waiting lists and delays, but when replying to me he was interrupted by a point of order.  I would be interested in hearing a response from the Leader on that issue today and also, if possible, a commitment to a debate on the issue.  As I said last week, I know the Leader, due to his chairmanship of the previous Joint Committee on Health and Children, has an acute awareness of what I am talking about.  I am convinced that there is more that could be done through the use of the home help scheme, home care packages and the carer's allowance to reduce hospital waiting lists.  </p> <p>I make no apologies for defending the excellent services of Cavan General Hospital and seek an assurance that any threat in that regard will be discussed in our national parliament prior to being actualised.</p></speech>

The report has been selectively leaked, possibly to cause the greatest amount of disturbance and unrest.  Let us wait until it has been published and we have all had time to read and understand it, so that we can have an informed debate on it.  There is nothing simple about the health service, as people know.  There is a relationship between every part of it.  It is not possible to sort out the problems of accident and emergency departments without sorting out the issues of delayed discharges in hospitals and greater access to community facilities, not only to rehabilitation services and nursing homes but also, as pointed out by Senator O'Reilly, to home help, home care, community teams and intravenous nursing teams, to allow people have their treatment at home.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator James Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2180"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That also includes early intervention and prevention.  I do not intend making a Second Stage speech but politicians have been far too quick to look to the nice, shiny new hospital wing and MRI scanner rather than focusing on serious community-based public health initiatives that save many lives, prevent much illness, as well as providing for early intervention and chronic illness care, as we do with diabetes and can do in many other areas.  We also need to look at the whole way doctors, nurses and other health professionals work.  Currently, we have consultants doing work that GPs could do, GPs doing work that nurses could do, and nurses doing work that nurse assistants could do.  There is a significant role for physiotherapists and many other allied health care professionals to play.  We must work towards a situation where we treat the patient at the lowest level of complexity which is safe, timely, efficient and as near to home as possible.</p><p>I decry the behaviour of those burning our flag and, particularly, posters of elected representatives and those who seek candidature.  It is very wrong.  We should not focus on the negative, however.  We should commend those involved in the peace process in the North and be grateful that the PSNI had so few incidents of a serious nature to deal with last night.</p></speech>

I began my third level education in 2009 and, since that time, higher education institutes have faced cuts of up to &euro;500 million.  The funding of third level education is now at crisis point.  All the options laid out in the Cassells report yesterday identified the immediate need for an injection of funding.</p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in is committed to ensuring third level education is accessible, irrespective of class, ability to pay, disability, age or family circumstance.  The introduction of a student loan will not address the immediate shortfall of funding as outlined by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, as it would take several years to implement.  Added to that, Ireland has the third highest rate of personal and household debt in the European Union with a credit union survey stating that 59% of parents have debt in excess of &euro;5,000, as a result of private borrowing to support the costs of third level education.  Student loans do not increase access to education and many students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds will not pursue third level education as a result.  Publicly funded education is the only fair and equitable model proposed in this report.  Sinn F&eacute;in requests the Minister for Education and Skills to outline to the House the reaction of his Department and his response to this report.</p></speech>

I equally commend, however, the majority of people from both communities who allowed parades to pass off peacefully today.  I particularly commend the people of Rossnowlagh, County Donegal, who hosted their annual parade on Saturday, welcoming Orange lodges from across the Republic and further afield to their quiet seaside town.</p> <p>Despite being the grandson of an Orangeman, I very much consider myself to be a republican and patriotic Irishman.  I am still very proud of my personal background and the insight it has given me into the wider traditions on our island, even when my jack-the-lad Tricolour shorts mysteriously vanished one morning before a visit to relations in Ballynahinch, County Down.  I would love to see an Ireland of the future united peacefully in terms of commerce, sport, social inclusivity and mutual tolerance.  However, I fear prioritising political unity, as has been suggested, without first focusing on reconciliation could be disastrous, alienating a population on this island, North and South, that I for one share a deep sense of common identity and history with.  Put simply, I believe a united Ireland is currently not feasible while the economic and social costs are head-spinning.</p> <p>We do, however, need to start urgently discussing the future of North-South relations.  Accordingly, will the Leader schedule a serious debate in the House on the post-Brexit future of North-South relations, involving the relevant Ministers from the Government, as well as inviting Northern political, business, church and community leaders from across the political divide?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Neale Richmond:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2472"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2472&amp;amp;pid=NealeRichmond&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Ultimately, far more unites us than divides us.

This report makes it clear that there is a funding crisis across our third level education system and that more funds need to be invested in this sector to accommodate the young population.  There has been a decrease in Exchequer support for third level funding since 2010 and capital investment has also slowed significantly.  In addition, spending on research and development has fallen from &euro;938 million in 2008 to &euro;743 million in 2014.  Going forward, the option proposed in the Cassells report urgently needs to be addressed by the Oireachtas committee on education and skills.</p> <p>An important aspect of the whole issue of assessing third level education is people's ability to pay the fees associated with attending college.  In order to address one part of the problem, we must look at the grant system.  For example, the grant system is based on a PAYE worker's P60, which is based on his or her full gross pay.  Also taken into account is the student's P60 and his or her gross income, which more often than not brings him or her over the limit and means that he or she does not receive the grant.  It is a massive issue in third level education that there is a two-tier system and that many students are now not qualifying for the grant.  I believe this needs to be addressed in order that every student who wants to attend third level college is given the opportunity to do so.  In Carlow we are lucky to have two excellent third level institutions, one of which is on course to obtain university status.  We need to ensure that these colleges receive the proper funding and that young people who want to attend third level education are not left behind.  It is critical that every student who needs to attend college be given that opportunity.</p> <p>I second the amendment to the Order of Business about the introduction of the National Anthem (Protection of Copyright and Related Rights) (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2016.</p></speech>

I believe we need to discuss this with the Minister in charge at the moment.  Political pressure needs to be applied to ensure that the budgets for projects in Cork can continue.  These are major projects, including the Dunkettle roundabout works, the N28 works and the Macroom bypass, which relate to huge economic drivers for Cork.  They will be put back now by at least two years.  We need to have the Minister in the Chamber to find out exactly what is going to happen with these projects and, in view of the summer economic statement, what he proposes to do with these budgets.</p> <p>The infrastructural deficiency in Cork, as the Cathaoirleach and the Leader of the House know, needs to be examined.  We are the second city and we are the largest county.  These infrastructural deficiencies need to be addressed if Cork is to develop.  Such a delay will have a major impact.  I have been contacted by many councillors in County Hall, with whom the Cathaoirleach would be associated, who are deeply concerned.  I hope we can have a decent debate on this with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, in order that we can have the access for Cork that is badly required.</p></speech>

I hope it can be moved forward and discussed before item No. 2 today.  Deputies can see it on the Order Paper as item No. 17.</p> <p>I also wish to raise the issue of increasing motor insurance costs.  Last night there was a public meeting in Donegal with a very large attendance from across the county of young, elderly and middle-aged people raising the issue and telling their stories.  I ask the Leader to bring the Minister for Finance before the House to outline the work of the interdepartmental task force with responsibility for addressing this issue and for making sure the insurance companies are held to account for fleecing so many of our citizens across the State.</p></speech>

It is contributing to social and environmental problems both here and internationally.  We talk about world hunger and we examine food poverty, yet it is generally accepted that there is sufficient food in the world to feed the global population.  Ireland has a growing population and is in a position to expand its food industry, including in the context of exports.  We also import - under Harvest 2020 and Foodwise 2025 - many foods that cannot be grown here.</p> <p>Notwithstanding the fact that enough food to feed the world's population is being grown, it is ironic that 1.3 billion people are going hungry.  At the same time, we are wasting 1.3 billion tonnes of food annually.  This is happening because of waste throughout the food supply chain.  When farmers grow produce on industrial farms, the food is dumped if it is not aesthetically pleasing, even though it might contain all the nutrients and flavour we require.  That is just one aspect of it.  Right down through the food supply chain it is calculated that approximately 35% of perishables are wasted.  In Ireland, 1 million tonnes of food are wasted every year between commercial and domestic consumers.  Some 300,000 tonnes of this waste comes from households, although 60% of it is avoidable.  We must consider what is happening in this regard.  It is a crying shame that our systems are set up in this manner.  The situation is unsustainable.  In addition to world hunger and our food poverty, we must also examine the relevant environmental issues.  These include the cost of food production, transportation and disposal.  This issue is at the heart of many problems we are trying to deal with.  A debate on food waste would be worthwhile and would give us cause to reflect on our lifestyles.</p></speech>

I do not give a damn about people's election literature being burned.  Most of it is rubbish in any event.  However, the bonfires were not supervised properly and a row of terraced houses on fire was set on fire as a result.  I think that is much more serious.</p> <p>I support the calls for a debate on the Cassells report.  Universities in Ireland are consistently dropping down the rankings.  I think Trinity is still in the top 100 in Europe but there is a huge deficit there.  I am surprised and delighted to learn that UCD is still in credit, which is astonishing.  I think that medical training is a really good investment, despite the fact that 17 doctors left for Australia.  I do not know what one can do about that.  One cannot very well imprison them here.  I remember when an entire class of nurses left Galway.  It is shocking that this happens but I do not know what one can do about it.  It is time, however, that we had a really good debate about it.

I join other Members in expressing concern about the leaked report that appeared in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>concerning the potential closure of a number of emergency units throughout the country.  One of them is in my own constituency in County Cavan.  Unfortunately, in Monaghan we have had experience of such reports and, ultimately, the end game is that the service is closed.  I would warn all Senators and people in those locations to be on their guard when reports such as this come to the fore.  I understand that the former Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, commissioned the report.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Robbie Gallagher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2471"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is strange that, although the report has not yet been received by people who requested it, we can read all about it in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>.  This is not a criticism of the opposite side of the House.  It is just an observation.  <br/><br/>I wish to raise the issue of lone parents and the decision by the previous Government to impose cuts that affected that section of our community.  The changes had a serious impact on the quality of life of lone parents and their families.  At the time the cuts were made last year, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul warned that it would be a serious issue for lone parents and that it would act as a deterrent to lone parents looking for employment, education or training.  Unfortunately, this has proved to be the case.  The latest figures show that 59% of one-parent households experience deprivation and 22% are in consistent poverty.  Our one-parent households deserve better, so I ask that the Minister come to the House to address us on this issue.</p></speech>

Could the Leader arrange a debate on the US military's use of Shannon Airport?  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade was here last week and I asked him a question about this issue.  I raised specific items relating to mid-air refuelling of planes and multiple take-offs and landings in June, which happened to coincide with a NATO exercise, and, frankly, the Minister did not answer the question.  Perhaps we should just get used to Ministers coming to the House and not answering questions, but I do not think it is good enough.  In light of the Chilcot report in particular, we need this debate on the US military's use of Shannon Airport and to hear from all sides in the debate.  We know that the Iraq war was illegal.  We know that it was criminal and that half a million people died in it and, unfortunately, we know that Fianna F&aacute;il sanctioned the use of Shannon Airport by the US military.  We know that the Labour Party had an excellent policy on challenging that but, regrettably, it dropped it as soon as it entered Government.  We need to hear from all sides.  In fairness, I know that there was a tradition in the past, represented by people such as Niall Andrews and Dan Breen, who stood up for military neutrality.  We need to hear from all sides of the House on this issue.  It is a disgrace.  As someone who lives in the area, I am deeply ashamed to see the US military dominating our civilian airport in Shannon, and it is time for it to stop.  I ask for a debate at the earliest convenience.</p></speech>

In respect of the amendment to the Order of Business tabled by Senator Daly, I have no problem bringing the Minister for Health to the House, but we are setting a very dangerous precedent if we bring the Minister to the House on foot of a newspaper report and an unfinished and unpublished report that the Minister did not commission.  Let us be clear that there are no plans to close any emergency departments.  That is the first item to be put to bed.  Second, it is not about the emergency departments, as the Senator argued this afternoon.  It ill behoves any of us to play politics with emergency departments and people's lives.  The Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland, at its annual general meeting, commissioned a piece of work about trauma care, trauma centres and how we can get the best outcomes for people with traumatic head injuries.  It is about developing a national trauma policy, ensuring that the core of this policy is the patient, and examining how trauma centres can best deal with people who sustain traumatic injuries.  Everyone agrees that there is a need to have a national trauma system.  I am very happy to have that debate when the report is published.  Rather than divide the House, I will give a commitment that we will have that report when it is finished, but as of now there is no report.  The Minister did not commission the report and the report has not been presented to him, so he cannot come to the House to give an update on a report that he has not seen and that has not been finished.  Let us make it quite clear.  It is about ensuring that there is co-ordination between the HSE, the Department of Health and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.  I served as Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children for five years and I also served on the HSE southern regional health forum.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If one takes Cork, for example, nobody can persuade me of the need, as reported in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>at the weekend, to close the emergency department at Mercy University Hospital in the city.  It makes no sense.  Rather than divide the House, I will give a commitment to hold the debate when the Minister receives the report because at present there is no report to debate.  I ask Senator Mark Daly not to divide the House but to allow time for the Minister to receive the report.  I give a commitment to have the debate when the Minister receives it.  <br/><br/>I am happy to accept the amendment proposed by Senator Mark Daly in respect of No. 18, but we will not have the debate today.  I am happy to accept the proposals put forward by Senators Mac Lochlainn and Warfield but, like Senator Mark Daly's proposal, we will not have the debate today.  They can be moved; I am happy to accede to them and to co-operation in that regard.<br/><br/>I thank all Senators for their comments on the Cassells report.  We are all - or should be - committed to seeing more people attend third-level education.  That should be our purpose.  I thank Peter Cassells for the work he has done on the publication of the report and in terms of the consultation.  As a growing economy, Ireland needs third-level education.  We also need to marry what Senators Coffey and Craughwell spoke about in terms of apprentices and how we can make our third-level education fit all people and sectors of society.  I spent ten years of my education career involved in adult and continuing education.  Its importance is critical; it is the lifeblood of society.  The three options put forward in the Cassells report make for interesting reading.  We all agree the funding model and investment in third level education needs to be addressed.  The Minister, in response to the report, spoke about a ten-year consensus.  We need to see that as part of the movement in terms of third level education; there should be at least a ten-year consensus.<br/><br/>The Minister has referred the Bill to the education committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas but I hope, like all Senators, that the Upper House can play a role in the formulation of third-level higher education policy.  I give a commitment to have a debate on this matter in the autumn prior to the education committee starting its work.  We need to address participation and the attrition rates of people who opt for the wrong course and leave early.  We need to address why that happens.  In terms of the funding mechanism, how can we fund a sustainable third-level model of education and ensure there is access from all parts of society?  As somebody who did not get a grant when attending college, I was lucky I was able to go.  I very much treasure and cherish the memories I have of the time I spent in third-level education.  I am very conscious there are others who could not go to third level.  Equally, there is an issue of participation.  I heard Dr. Walsh, the former president of UL, on the radio yesterday speaking about the rates of participation in New Zealand and Australia, which have different models.  It is important that we have a debate on this matter.  It is about better life opportunities and ensuring we have a skilled workforce, whether that is through the postgraduate studies or via the apprenticeships to which the Deputies referred.  There are deficits in our apprenticeship system.  I concur with Senators Coffey and Craughwell on that.<br/><br/>The Cathaoirleach and I are from a university city, Cork, where research and innovation plays a pivotal role in third-level education, both in CIT and UCC, as it does across the country in other third-level institutions.  None of the options is easy regarding third level but let us have mature debate to establish consensus on how to develop a ten-year strategy.<br/><br/>The other emerging theme in the Order of Business, which was raised by Senators Conway-Walsh, Feighan, Reilly and Richmond, is the activities yesterday and today of burning the Tricolour and political posters.  All of us want to see tolerant and respectful celebration of different traditions in the north of our island.  None of us wants to go back to the old days.  We remember what happened in the past.  It is important that calm and peaceful celebration of traditions takes place.  I join with other Senators in condemning any form of sectarianism or lack of tolerance.  It is imperative that together we build bridges to an Ireland where we can all be equal and where the north and south of our island can coexist on an economic and cultural basis, where we can build on the Good Friday Agreement and work together.  It is important, in a post-Brexit era, to have that debate and it is intended to do so in the autumn.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> On the issues raised outside the emerging themes, Senator Bacik raised the issue of the citizens' assembly.  I agree with the Senator that the model of the Constitutional Convention is one we should try to mirror.  On occasion, the timelines were not achieved in terms of the replies but the Minister is conscious of the need to make sure this assembly is successful, and I am sure, when replying to the debate, that he will give that commitment and an outline of what he has in mind.</p><p>Senator Coffey highlighted the work done on the Construction Contracts Act, and I pay tribute to Senator Nash and former Senator Feargal Quinn in that regard.  Senator Nash, as Minister of State, played a key role in developing that strategy and it is important that we all work to protect those subcontractors who are at the mercy of outside forces.  They were the big losers when the recession hit.  I would be willing to pursue that with the Senator.</p><p>Senator Swanick referred to patients on trolleys.  We have seen a reduction in the number of people on trolleys.  Senator Colm Burke gave the figures for the number of people attending outpatient and emergency departments, and it was interesting to note the number of days lost in terms of the people who failed to turn up for appointments at outpatient departments, which has a cost-----</p></speech>

I will see if the Minister can come to the House to discuss that.

That is a matter for others.  The Senator raised the issue of the arts and culture in particular, and I am willing to have the Minister come to the House to discuss the policy on arts and culture.</p> <p>Last week, Senator Joe O'Reilly raised the issue of home helps and home care packages.  As a consequence of the Senator and other Senators raising this important issue, the Minster for Social Protection will be in the House this evening to discuss it.  Last week, Senator Kelleher and Senator O'Reilly spoke about the importance of home care packages and the work being done by home helps, family carers and carers in general.  That is a debate we can have as part of the debate with the Minster present.</p> <p>I am willing to accept Senator Warfield's amendment and the proposal from Senator Mac Lochlainn.  I have dealt with the issue of the Cassells report.</p> <p>To be parochial for a moment, Senator Lombard raised the important issue of infrastructure projects for Cork.  It is important that Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and the Minister, Deputy Ross, would address the issues because the projects Senator Lombard referred to are pivotal infrastructure projects which are about developing the region economically in terms of the N28, the Macroom bypass and the Dunkettle roundabout.  If those projects were to be delayed or not gone ahead with, it would have a profound negative impact on the economic life of Cork, not to mention other areas.</p> <p>Senator Mac Lochlainn raised the issue of motor insurance, which was addressed recently in the House.  The Minister for Finance has set up a working group on the issue and he has committed to come to the House to discuss it.  I hope we can have that debate.</p> <p>Senator Norris referred to both the supervision of bonfires and the Cassells report.  In terms of the Cassells report, it is important this House would play a role prior to the Committee on Education and Skills beginning its work on the report.</p> <p>Senator Gallagher raised the important issue of lone parents.  This will be part of the debate today when the Senator will have an opportunity to participate but if we cannot get to it then, I am sure the Minister will return to the House to debate it.  As it will probably be the Minister's last time in the House before the summer recess and the legislation coming to the House, I felt it was important to have statements on social protection in order that Members can have an input into that debate.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Senator Gavan raised the issue of Shannon and our policy with regard to our airports and military use.
