I was fascinated by this, and somewhat bemused, considering that, when he had the opportunity earlier this year, he did not promote even one woman to the junior ministerial ranks - not one woman.  Is he now appealing to the female vote following the confirmation of the partisan nature of some of those who have been designating themselves as Independent Senators in this House following last night's votes?  Perhaps that has been the inspiration for the Taoiseach to proceed now with confidence on the basis that whoever he nominates to this House and to the other House will continue to support the Government.  However, that is democracy in action and I have no wish to in any way reflect on the decisions that anyone takes on how they vote in this House.</p><p>Of much more importance is the overnight news that a takeover attempt of Aer Lingus was unsuccessful, and I ask for the Leader's response.  The board has rebuffed this and I am pleased that it has.  However, I am particularly concerned that the Government has been quoted as saying it is open to the sale of its 25%-plus stake in Aer Lingus.  This country has an extraordinarily successful experience in aircraft maintenance and aviation leasing.  Ireland is the leading country in the world for aviation leasing.  We also have, extraordinarily, two very successful airlines.  We have Ryanair, the pioneering airline which led the break-up of the cartels which operated when I could not afford, as an emigrant in London, to fly from London to Dublin because it cost nearly the equivalent of a month's salary.  Ryanair and Michael O'Leary are to be complimented in this regard.  They have continued to be successful.  Aer Lingus, following a period of very difficult trading, is now a successful company.</p> <p>This is an extraordinary turnaround for a company that at one stage looked like going under.  When the former Taoiseach, Brian Cowen, was Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications in the early 2000s he made statements to the effect that the future of Aer Lingus was in serious doubt.  I ask the current Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Donohoe, to clarify the Government's position on a potential hostile takeover of this nature.  We are an island nation and we are unlike any other country in Europe or, indeed, the world in the context of this debate about our national airline.  The Irish people have a strong empathy with the iconic brand of Aer Lingus and the Government's retention of a 25% share in the airline offers great comfort and reassurance to them.  It would not be in this country's strategic interest to allow the airline to be sold off to the private sector because it would leave us exposed to the vagaries of the corporate world not only in terms of potential job losses but also in regard to the service that Aer Lingus provides.  Retaining our stake in the airline is of national importance.  For these reasons, I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport come before the House today to clarify the Government's position on the future of Aer Lingus and to reassure the Irish people, as we approach Christmas, that we will retain a significant stake in our national airline.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-12-19a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1172" speakername="Aideen Hayden" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014121900003#B00200"><p>Yesterday I raised the serious issue of a young woman in her 20s who is being kept on life support while carrying a child that is at 16 weeks of gestation and unable to sustain life outside the womb.  It has emerged that a High Court case was initiated and is due to be heard next week.  I am sure that case will cast a light on where we stand in respect of the protection of life during pregnancy legislation.  As a mother of two daughters in their early 20s, I feel for this family.  They have not only lost a daughter but they are also unable to grieve while they await a decision in the courts.  I thank the Leader for giving his commitment on arranging a debate early in the new year on the protection of life during pregnancy legislation and the eighth amendment to the Constitution, and their effectiveness in protecting the lives of Irish women.</p><p>On the issue of the European Central Bank and Mario Draghi, I support the Taoiseach's efforts to persuade the bank to reconsider its position on appearing before the banking inquiry.  The bank is showing a total absence of solidarity towards the people of Ireland in refusing to come before a national banking inquiry.  Its claim that it is only answerable to the European Parliament reflects a narrow view of its mandate towards European people.  Even if was unable to add a scintilla of new information over and above what the Governor of the Central Bank could provide, it would be showing solidarity and upholding the right of the Irish people to have the fullest possible disclosure of what happened in respect of the collapse of our economy and the banking crisis.  </p><p>Staying with the issue of solidarity, I ask that we have a debate in the new year on the threats, for want of a better word, to the European economy and its stability.  It came to my attention recently that the old age pension in Greece has been cut to 20% of the rate paid prior to that country's entry to the bailout.  There are older men and women near starvation on the streets of Greece.  Furthermore, 30,000 Syrian refugees are in the Aegean area of Greece, at a time when the country cannot even afford to feed its own people.  We should be cognizant of the issue of solidarity among European people.  It would be useful to have a debate on the issues faced by the European Union from an economic and a security perspective.</p></speech>

The irony is that the British regulatory authorities have ruled against a merger between Ryanair and Aer Lingus.  Was this done so that their own national airline can take over Aer Lingus?  I hope the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, will protect Ireland's national interests.  The current actions by the competition authorities in the UK to oppose the Aer Lingus-Ryanair merger while also restoring the cartel that previously operated between British Airways and Aer Lingus are not acceptable to this country.  I comment Christoph Mueller and his staff on turning the airline around.</p><p>Like Senator Hayden, I commend the Taoiseach on his efforts to persuade Mario Draghi to appear before the banking inquiry.  The role of the ECB is a crucial aspect of the inquiry but the bank has displayed an unacceptable level of arrogance in this regard.</p><p>As this is our last Order of Business before Christmas, I wish the Cathaoirleach, the Leader and the staff of the Seanad every happiness for Christmas and thank them for their courtesy in facilitating the operation of this House in such a splendid manner.  I wish them the very best for 2015.</p></speech>

In the madness of the water debate, we seemed to forget this was an extraordinary year for the justice system of this country.  A Minister was forced to resign, as were a Garda Commissioner and a confidential recipient.  The current Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, whom I wish well, has given a commitment to the Irish people and the garda&iacute;.  We continue expect the Garda to protect our homes and streets even though there is a lack of resources.  It would appropriate if the Minister came to the House to set out her plans for restoring confidence in the Garda.  The frontline garda&iacute;, whether they are protecting Leinster House from a small element of rowdy people during marches or our streets, are the people who have taken the hit.  The Minister should outline to us her roadmap to recovery of the justice system.  She was correct to describe her Department as a dinosaur.  It is old, rusty and creaky, and it is in need of a total overhaul.  I will support the Minister in her efforts in this regard but it is important that she comes to the House for a full debate, hopefully before the end of January 2015.</p><p>I wish the Cathaoirleach, staff and Members of the House a happy and peaceful Christmas and, le c&uacute;namh D&eacute;, an election free 2015.  I second the amendment.</p></speech>

This House was saved in order to represent the voice of the Irish people.  I recognise that the Government legitimately used the whip but I regret that the so-called Enda-pendents, as well as one of my own colleagues, chose to vote in the way they did.  This happened previously, when a Government was saved by one vote from this side.  This House is supposed to be an independent voice that is above politics.  Nothing made more clear the need for radical reform of the House than its lamentable behaviour last night.  I do not blame the Government Senators.  They had their reasons.  They were whipped and they had to support a decent Minister in an awkward position.  However, I cry shame on my colleagues who are allegedly independent.</p></speech>

I support today the Federation of Irish Sport which has, under the auspices of Bernard Brogan, called for the sharing of income raised from the sports betting tax among all sports not just between horse and dog racing.  While both are very enjoyable, all sports serve us equally.  In conjunction with a debate on that, I call for a debate on the problems that gambling, particularly online, brings.  Gambling is becoming more popular, particularly online.  No country can stop it, but we should be aware of the dangers of it also.  The taxes raised should be shared among all sports equally and not just greyhound and horse racing.  I call for a debate on both issues.</p></speech>

Go dt&eacute; siad sl&aacute;n i mbliana.  I wish everyone the good wishes of the season and thank the staff and Cathaoirleach.</p><p>I note that the Samaritans brought us back to earth with a bang when they gave us a presentation the other day around their services.  I commend them on the services they deliver and note that while Christmas can be a difficult time for many, there are those like the Samaritans who do incredible work to support people.  Their new helpline 116 123 is available through the winter season and they also have a line for the North 008457 909090 for those who find themselves in need of support.  Their message was that they have had a 50% increase in that since they brought it in.  They put a great deal of that down to the fact that the telecommunications companies are actually supporting those helplines.  We must commend those companies on the work they are doing and ask them to continue to support it as there is a finite date on it.  I commend all of the volunteers and those who support that vital service.</p><p>I raise with the Leader an issue which is coming to the fore and needs to be addressed quickly with the Minister for Education and Skills.  It relates to nominations from ETBs to the boards of management of local schools.  It is particularly affecting rural areas and Irish medium schools because there is a limit of 20 km being imposed by the Department of Education and Skills on members who are eligible to sit on a board of management.  In an area like Connemara, most of the schools are more than 20 km apart and many people are simply ruled out of sitting on the board of management of any school.  Boards are finding it very difficult to find people to sit on them which issue is compounded in Irish language medium schools and Gaelscoileanna given the limited number of Irish speakers on ETBs themselves.  It is a huge problem to get people onto boards and it needs to be addressed.  The gender quota system is causing issues in Donegal.  While I welcome the quota, it appears a great deal of pressure is being put on female councillors in Donegal to go on the board of the ETB even though they do not want to.  That also needs to be addressed.</p><p>I would welcome a debate on those issues.  I ask the Leader to intervene with the Minister for Education and Skills as soon as he can.  I also ask for a debate on the future of rural schools in spring and on the future of Irish language education and Irish medium education.  Nollaig Shona a ch&aacute;irde ar fad.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-12-19a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1150" speakername="Colm Burke" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014121900004#C00300"><p>I join colleagues in wishing everyone a happy Christmas, including the staff, the Cathaoirleach and all Members.  Regarding 2015, I hope we will not have to go through the process of an election until 2016.<br/>One of the issues that has come home to me in the debate on the water charges is the lack of information out there on the cost of running services in Ireland as evidenced in emails to me and replies to my replies.  I am sure colleagues have received similar correspondence.  I have raised the matter previously in relation to local authorities and the amount in commercial rates being collected from the private sector.  There is a lack of knowledge among the general public of the amounts being demanded from the private sector.  One of the issues that really amazes me is the lack of knowledge people have in relation to the cost of social welfare, health care and education.  There was a letter to the <i>Irish Examiner</i>in the last week comparing the current state of Ireland to its state in 1847.  That sends a very negative message about the country.<br/>Despite the difficulties we have gone through over the past four to five years, we still pay out more than &euro;400 million a week in social welfare payments.  That includes payments to 585,000 people in receipt of the old age pension, people who are unemployed and people with disabilities.  It is only right that we should be paying that and it is unfortunate that we have not had an increase in that area over the last four to five years.  While we will hopefully be able to provide for increases as the economy recovers, we should have a debate on how proper information is circulated, in particular to young people going through the education system.  It might be done through a transition year programme or another way in the schools given the lack of knowledge that is there.  We have a duty to ensure that we not only provide services, but get information out as to their cost.</p></speech>

I also extend best wishes to the camera operators who provide the excellent television service extended over the year which has brought the House to the attention of so many people.  I get a response now when I speak in the House on foot of what appears on television and radio.</p><p>Next Tuesday, 23 December 2014, the President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns, will make a monumental decision based on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of 7 October 1983.  As the sole Member of the House who was a Member of the D&aacute;il in 1983 and who stood by the amendment of the Constitution, which is a very enlightened one, I certainly do not pull back from the decision to include Article 40.3.3&deg; whereby the State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.  I will not get into the details, which are tragic and very difficult for the families involved and I will certainly not add to them.  However, I note regarding the utterances of Deputy Leo Varadkar on 16 December that it is not his right to interpret the Constitution.</p></speech>

I am not doing that, but am recording the exact position.  I have no change of mind on the decision I took as the sole Member of the House in the D&aacute;il in 1983.  I stand by that decision which has led to the safe delivery of many Irish citizens who have contributed to this society since then.  Without that safeguard in the Constitution, that may not have been the case.  I hope there will be room at the inn in 2014.</p></speech>

The first was how on how we should respond to the suicide crisis, the second was on activating and social networking and the third was on threats to women's health today, in particular alcohol and smoking.</p> <p>I wish to say, without preaching, that this is a time when people are inclined to over indulge in alcohol and smoking.  It is no harm reminding ourselves to be less indulgent.  We are leaders in society so we should advise the people around us, and not to be puritanical about it, to be less indulgent.  </p><p>I wish to put the following matter formally on the record.  Senator John Crown is a professor oncologist at St. Vincent's Hospital.  He has said that the complete eradication of smoking and a sharp reduction in levels of alcohol consumption are critical in Ireland.  He also said that smoking is by far the leading preventable cause of illness in Ireland, that there is nothing redeeming about it and that there is no safe level.  Also, that it contributes to cancer of the mouth, throat, head, neck, lung, pancreas and stomach.  In addition, it damages the arteries, causes circulatory problems, heart attacks and strokes.  Senator Crown also argued that the physical and social health of Irish people would be greatly improved if they only drank less.  Plus, reducing drinking would lead to a decrease in the levels of liver disease and many forms of cancer, as well as, very importantly, a decrease in domestic violence, rape and teen pregnancy.</p><p>The esteemed chief executive of Alcohol Action Ireland, and former chief executive of the Samaritans, Suzanne Costello, raised the following matter which I have raised here before.  She discussed the huge increase in the number of young women drinking in Ireland.  It is no longer a taboo in Ireland for women to go into pubs and drinking.  </p></speech>

At this time of year we all have to be proactive.  We have been very successful in the campaign to decrease the number of people driving with alcohol.  We, as leaders in society, have to drive the lesson home and get rid of smoking and ask people to be very careful.</p><p>Senator Crown also made the point that it has been said that a little red wine is good for a person.  The point is people never stick to just drinking a little bit of wine.  I do not mean to preach but it is important that I pass on this very important information today.  It would be ideal to publicly debate these three issues and I ask the Leader to arrange same as we go forward in the months to come.</p></speech>

T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeidh Nollaig shona ag gach duine.</p><p>Unfortunately, with the run up to Christmas there is always rushed legislation which usually makes, it has to be said with the precedence that has been set over the past few years, bad legislation.  I listened to the debate yesterday but did not take part in it because my party Whip asked me not to for a number of reasons.  However, today I shall very much participate on Committee Stage.</p><p>The Minister did not table any amendments.  Therefore, I appeal to my Independent colleagues, who gave conditional support to this Bill, voted for it and ensured its passage, to consider this.  I heard Senator Quinn say he was very concerned that amendments should be looked at and accepted.  We have reached a very difficult stage for the Senator because the Minister has not put forward any amendments even after listening to the debate.</p><p>Yesterday, the Minister made great play of changing &quot;may&quot; to &quot;shall&quot; in terms of holding the plebiscite.  If I understood Senator Mac Conghail correctly, the change of wording was a factor for him.  In my view the change was the greatest example of political bait and switch that we have seen.  The mistake was so obvious that it could be spotted by anybody who read the legislation.  It enabled the Minister to say he had listened and has changed the legislation.  That wording was always going to be changed and was a deliberate error included in the legislation in order to make it look like the Minister gave something back.  </p><p>Let us look at the reality of what has been promised.  I tabled two amendments that I wrote and my colleague, Senator Wilson, has a number of other important amendments.  My amendments attempt to deal with the difficulty the Seanad has in terms of proposing a constitutional referendum.  I have proposed that the public water forum would produce a report on the holding of a constitutional referendum, something like the Constitutional Convention.  I also discovered a significant flaw in the plebiscite proposals.  They only refer to the sale of shares or shares in Irish Water.</p></speech>

I am concerned that a lot of young people have become addicted, in particular, to online gambling.  It is now far too easy for people to access gambling services.  Gambling is an issue that we need to have a look at and we should strengthen laws in this regard.</p><p>I join with colleagues in acknowledging the fantastic work done by many voluntary organisations at this time of year.  I wish to acknowledge all the volunteers throughout the country who work diligently to ensure that many people have a better Christmas, as a result of their activities.  I refer to people who live in isolated and difficult situations.  I encourage everyone to keep an eye on vulnerable people over the Christmas period, particularly as the weather has been predicted to be harsh.</p><p>Finally, I extend very good wishes for Christmas to all my colleagues in this House, the Cathaoirleach, the Leader and particularly to all the staff who have been exceptionally helpful and courteous to all of us throughout the year.</p></speech>

I noticed that the Minister for Justice and Equality made a very substantial statement in the D&aacute;il on domestic violence two days ago.  At the earliest opportunity in the new year we should ask the Minister to come here for statements on domestic violence.  I am very disappointed we have not done so already.

I assure him that there are more women in this Government than was the case with any previous Administration.  The Senator also asked that we clarify the Government's decision in respect of Aer Lingus.  The Minister noted the confirmation by the board of Aer Lingus that it received a preliminary proposal from the International Consolidated Airlines Group and that it had rejected this on the basis that it fundamentally undervalues the company.  This is a matter for the board, in the first instance, and the Minister notes its advice to shareholders to take no action.  The Government has publicly indicated that it remains open to the sale of its minority shareholding in Aer Lingus but only when market conditions are favourable and on terms and at a price that are acceptable to it.</p></speech>

I am sure we will have another debate on that matter in the new year.</p><p>Senators Hayden and Barrett welcomed the Taoiseach's efforts to get representatives from the ECB to attend the banking inquiry.  The Taoiseach has indicated that he will renew his efforts in this regard in the coming weeks.</p><p>Senator Hayden also requested a debate on solidarity among European nations and on the EU in general.  I am sure the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Dara Murphy, would be willing to come before the House to debate that issue.

I have put together a sub-committee to choose items from that programme for debate in the Seanad on a regular basis throughout next year.</p><p>Senator O'Donovan requested that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, come before the House and provide it with a progress report on the reform of her Department and on plans to reform An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

I will certainly bring that matter to the attention of the Minister for Education and Skills.  However, I am sure she is quite aware of the problems that exist.  On education, I welcome the 70 major new school building projects, announced as part of the five-year plan, which are scheduled to proceed to construction in 2015.

This matter has been discussed in the House on several occasions.  I completely agree with the sentiments expressed by the Senator.</p><p>I assure Senator Byrne that there will be no rush with legislation in the House.

This has been a matter of contention outside of the House.  There is a substantial amount of agreement between me and the Minister on the avoidance of the privatisation of the utility.  We all interpret that as the wish of the people.</p><p>The amendment&rsquo;s purpose is to allow for the alienation of the shares in Irish Water currently held by Ervia.  The presence of shares vested in Ervia is where the problem has arisen with the concerns about privatisation.  I want these shares to be transferred to the Minister for Finance.  Accordingly, this amendment is a stronger protection in the common goal I share with the Minister to prevent the privatisation of Irish Water.  The shares are the vehicle through which this fear of privatisation exists.  If we put them firmly in the provenance of the Minister for Finance, it will afford a protection against the shares&rsquo; sale.</p><p>Nationalisation of the sector is the defence against its privatisation.  By having Ervia removed, the amendment would allow the Minister for Finance to reallocate its functions to the local authorities.  This would allow a different set-up than heretofore.  Having listened to the debate, I am aware of some local authority areas that had bad records in water wastage and others with good records.  Perhaps we have not given credit to the latter.  We should look more at the good performing local authorities and county engineers.</p><p>As water service provision will involve, for now and the foreseeable future, taxpayer funding as well as funding from charges, the amendment proposes no punitive actions against dwellings where, or tenants whose, charges have not been wholly or partly paid, as it involves general taxpayers.</p><p>Appreciating as we do that public opinion is so strongly against privatisation of Irish Water, alienating those shares from Ervia to the Minister for Finance, essentially nationalising the company, would be a belt-and-braces approach to what the Minister also wishes to achieve, namely, the protection of Irish Water from privatisation in the future through the mechanism of a plebiscite.</p> <p>The amendment allows the possibility of reconfiguring water services in whichever form the Minister wishes, stresses the role of local authorities, which have a good record on wastewater services - the measure used in the McLoughlin report on non-performing water authorities - and recognises that people will still make substantial payments for water through general taxation.  This is an obstacle to cutting off people's water supply, which the Minister and I both oppose.  I table the amendment in the spirit of being of assistance to the House and Minister.</p></speech>

It is notable that it is the only one of the first four amendments to have survived, with the other three ruled out of order because they make reference to referendums, which is precluded under the Constitution.  There is no reason the Seanad should not be able to move an amendment on a referendum.  That is what the House is about.  I am aware that it was not the current Government but Mr. de Valera who created the Constitution.    As I pointed out some time ago-----</p></speech>

It is the season of goodwill, jolly ho-ho, rum, raisins, holly berries, mistletoe and the rest of that jazz.</p><p>A previous Minister - I cannot remember which one - took up very strongly my point that it is idiotic that Members of the Seanad and D&aacute;il cannot move a resolution that creates a charge on the Exchequer.  I urge the Government to examine this issue.  Given its taste for holding referendums, it should hold a referendum on the matter.</p><p>In any case, I congratulate Senator Barrett on negotiating the line between a referendum and a plebiscite.  What he has produced is a plebiscite which has all the characteristics of a referendum.  Well done to him. </p><p>The amendment will also be a test for the Senators who I would describe as the &quot;Enda-pendents&quot;, although I note that two of the Independent Senators who are taking an interest in proceedings voted with their consciences despite having been nominated by the Taoiseach.  I pay tribute to them for exercising their consciences and wish their approach extended to their fellows.</p><p>The most important elements of the proposed new section are subsections 8 to 11, inclusive.  Subsection 12, the final subsection, is simply a definition.  Subsection (8) reads as follows: &quot;The Minister or the Minister for Finance have an obligation to ensure the orderly alienation of Irish Water and to provide an audit statement on the financial and operational state of Irish Water to each House of the Oireachtas.&quot;  The lack of prudent financial oversight is one of the reasons for the current mess.  This provision would at least give us a glimpse at the figures and a definitive statement, in as far as that is possible.  This welcome proposal should be implemented in any case and notwithstanding any alienation of Irish Water.  The company should be required to make an annual statement on its financial state.  </p><p>Subsection (9) proposes that the powers of Irish Water be returned to the local authorities.  I hope this will also mean shedding the additional Irish Water staff.  There is no point in shovelling a load of people down to rural Ireland and having them on the payroll when they are doing sweet damn all.  </p><p>Subsection (10) provides that no punitive actions, such as the reduction or cessation of water services, are to be taken on households.  The Minister has been firm and convincing on this issue.  As I stated yesterday, he was handed a poisoned chalice and I cannot imagine why he accepted it because he is heading straight for the graveyard, although he does so with insouciance and a smile on his face. </p></speech>

Not only is it outrageous, in a democracy, to cut off a person's water supply, but it is also outrageous to cut off someone's gas or electricity supply, particularly given the parlous state of the country.</p><p>Subsection (11) prohibits landlords from taking punitive actions against residents.  Landlords should not be required to become involved in this matter.  It is up to legal tenants to make whatever arrangements they please with Irish Water.  I strongly support this crucial amendment, on which I hope we have the numbers to defeat the Government. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-12-19a.83" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1133" speakername="David Cullinane" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014121900010#K01000"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I expect the House will discuss the Bill for some time today and on Monday and I hope we will have constructive debates on the amendments and sections.</p><p>While I accept that the fault does not lie with the Government, it is still outrageous that a number of amendments on the section have been ruled out of order and that Senators must confine their remarks to Senator Barrett's amendment.  All amendments tabled by Senators Craughwell, Zappone, Mary Ann O'Brien, James Heffernan, Healy Eames, &Oacute; Clochartaigh, Reilly and me, which provided for a constitutional amendment, have been ruled out of order.  While Senators are precluded from tabling proposals that provide for a constitutional amendment, the Government has the right to initiate a constitutional amendment on this issue.  Instead of exercising that right, as it should have done, it chose to provide, in section 2, for the possibility of holding a plebiscite on the ownership of Irish Water.  As Senators pointed out in the Second Stage debate yesterday, the plebiscite promised by the Government is not worth the paper on which it is written.  The previous two water services Acts are being amended by this legislation, making it the third Bill on water services.  If a Government decides in future that it wants to privatise or sell off parts of Irish Water - full privatisation is not necessary, as we can see from the ESB case - it need only introduce amending legislation to delete section 2.  The promise that has bought off some Independent Senators would then vanish. </p><p>The position is comparable to that of a Government promising to insert in legislation a provision that it will not reduce child benefit.  All it would have to do to break its promise is specify a child benefit rate in a social welfare Bill and produce amending legislation the following year to reduce the rate.  These types of commitment are not worth the paper they are written on, and the commitment to hold a plebiscite on Irish Water is a charade.  The Government and a number of Independent Senators are engaged in a little choreography on this issue. </p><p>I support the amendment and would like the Government to hold a constitutional referendum on the issue.  Why is the Minister preventing such a referendum?  Why is the Government refusing to let people have their say now?  What is the difficulty with holding a constitutional referendum?  I remind all the Independent and Labour Party Senators that, not so long ago, they voted for a Seanad motion that called specifically for a constitutional referendum on the ownership of water.  That motion has not been vindicated in the Bill and, as such, the logic of their position does not stack up.  If they wanted to be true to the motion passed by the House, they would vote against section 2.  </p><p>As the Minister is aware, there are a range of opinions on Irish Water and water charges.  I accept that some people do not mind paying for water and believe it is good to do so.  I also expect the Minister to accept that some people have difficulty with the idea of paying for water twice and the charges element of water provision.  As the Leader has stated on the Order of Business on several occasions, all political parties are against the privatisation of the water service.  Fine Gael, the Labour Party, Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in have all expressed opposition to privatisation.</p> <p>I am not sure whether any of the Independent Senators have.  I hope most, or all, of them are against the privatisation of water.  If the political system, in its entirety, is at one on this issue, why can we not have a conditional referendum?  </p><p>We will have a number of them in May next year.  We could also have one on this issue.  Nothing is stopping the Minister or Government from doing that.  It adds to the confusion for people.  Why is the Government not committing to that?  Why are we simply putting something in a Bill which, the Minister would have to concede, can be reversed, deleted, amended, taken out or dispensed with if a Government was minded to privatise water services?</p><p>The Government also said it has no intention of privatising water.  People have experience of other public services, which were once paid for through progressive taxation, as water was, and were delivered as a right.  One paid ones taxes and one's water was provided.  We are now changing that to a system of water charges and the so-called &quot;polluter pays&quot; principle.  </p><p>We had the same arguments about waste collection.  When bin charges were first introduced in Waterford, it was nothing to do with privatisation.  Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and other councillors all said it was about improving the service.  The argument was made that a body cannot be a regulator of a service as well as a provider.  The charges which were introduced started at a very low base and in most areas were &pound;30, but they increased every year.  At a certain point the service was privatised, local authorities left and I do not think a single local authority in the State now provides waste collection services.  </p><p>It is quite obvious that once the concept of charges is introduced, water is commodified and water services are commercialised, it will inevitably lead to privatisation.  People have experience of bin charges and the health service, where they have been forced to take out private health insurance.  Once the concept of charges is introduced, inevitably private operators and profiteers come in, and services like water become commodities rather than a public or human right, which is what I believe water to be.  </p><p>Can the Minister explain why water will be any different?  We know, because it is anchored in European policy, that what Europe wants is for the full cost of water to be recovered.  People will end up paying more.  Once they are paying higher charges, things become easier for profiteers and it becomes profitable for companies to buy up our water infrastructure or for the State to get out.  Will we then hear the same arguments that we cannot be a regulator as well as a provider of our water services?  </p><p>I cannot understand why the Government is so fearful of a constitutional referendum on this issue and allowing the people to have their say.  If all of the parties in the House and the State are genuinely committed to ensuring that we do not have privatisation, then they should have no difficulty whatsoever in supporting a constitutional referendum on this issue.  Ruling out amendments is not the fault of the Minister or Government, but refusing to hold a referendum on the issue is clearly the responsibility of the Minister and Government.  </p><p>I have more to say on this issue, but others wish to contribute.  I would also like to hear the response of the Minister.  I ask him to answer some direct questions.  Can he confirm that if a future Government wanted to privatise water services and not hold a plebiscite, all it would need to do would be to introduce a water services (amendment) Bill that would delete the relevant section?  That would negate the need for a plebiscite.  Can the Minister be honest with people and say that is all it would require? </p><p>Can the Minister explain why he will not hold a referendum on the issue?  Of what is he fearful?  What is the problem with it?  People want to have their say on this issue.  Why would we fear the people and a referendum?  </p></speech>

The fact that we have an opportunity to discuss this issue is because of the Irish people who voted to retain the Upper House.  Without their support, this issue would not be debated here today.  It is an important point and the 60 Members of the House have a unique opportunity to put forward ideas to the Minister.  He is very attentive and willing to listen to ideas.</p><p>The Bill refers to a plebiscite.  Senator Barrett has tabled a very good amendment, which we will support.  Senator Craughwell's amendment was extremely good, and I respectfully suggest that on Report Stage he changes the term &quot;referendum&quot; to &quot;plebiscite&quot; with the same wording.  The wording is very precise.</p><p>The idea of a plebiscite or referendum is academic, to some extent.  In reality, the imposition of charges is the straw that has broken the camel's back.  Many people spoke to me about the household charge, which has been implemented and paid.  Why could the Government not have incorporated water into it to fund water provision and services?  It would have been much more acceptable.  Instead, there is a charge on a charge, which is causing problems.  </p><p>Yesterday, I heard a clip in which the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, committed the Labour Party to opposing the imposition of water charges.  That is a real betrayal of the electorate.  It is misleading the people.  The former Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, has said that is what people say during elections.  I remember commitments given in manifestos in 1977 which, for better or for worse, were implemented.  It was the first time I was elected.  The other parties also went down the same road at the time, but people do not realise that.  I remember advertisements were taken out in certain newspapers by Fine Gael and others.  Let us not discuss history; we are where we are at this point in time.</p><p>If there is a widespread decision by people not to pay under any circumstances, will that negate all the efforts being made in this regard?  The system will be unworkable unless it has the will and support of the Irish people to pay for water.  There were large protests in every town and city in the country.  The message should be clearly heard.  We have received a large number of e-mails in the past few days.  Will people decide not to pay and let everyone else carry the can?  </p><p>It is the first time I have not yet filled out any form, and will not until I get clarification on the situation.  I do not know whether the situation regarding those with a second house has been clarified, in terms of whether they are legally liable to pay the charges, irrespective of the tenancy arrangements.  Paying back retentions is not acceptable.  </p><p>Families with children in college, in particular those from towns like Roscommon which have no universities, have to pay for apartments and water charges, on top of charges at home.  There is no provision in the Bill for a cap on the amount any family would have to pay, whether children are living at home or in rented accommodation.  </p><p>I refer to the Minister's dismissal of a referendum and unintended consequences.  It would be fair that the advice of the Attorney General is put on the record of the House.  </p> <p>Any explanation should set out exactly why the proposal for a referendum was turned down.</p><p>I understand the complications.  Water is a complicated issue.  Several contracts have already been given out to private organisations such as Veolia in Roscommon as well as other companies that are now managing water schemes in some of the cities in a partnership set-up.  They have a certain control over water at this point and whether we could nationalise these arrangements now is for the Minister to explain.</p><p>Another question is the matter of the ownership of the River Shannon and the waterways.  It is proposed to extract water from the River Shannon to provide water for Dublin.  Is provided for in the Constitution?  Could that be provided for by amendment?  Could that be regulated for?  I understand the complications of the issue.  It is complex, but it is coming to the fore.  I know as a former Minister of State that Ministers get excellent advice, and the Minister has tremendous officials with him today.  I imagine the Department is altogether aware of the issues.  I always found that I relied totally on the civil servants who advised me.  I found them to be of the highest quality and they offered the best advice and I respect the advice being given.</p><p>It is a complex issue.  The Constitution contains a right to private property.  I understand that if we have a well, we can extract water and sell it.  There is a question arising if we have a referendum and decide that we all own that water and that individuals cannot own it.  I understand these things.  It is not as simple or straightforward as having a referendum and then deciding everything will be solved.  One unintended consequence is the position of an organisation providing water, for example, Ballygowan Water in Limerick, which has some lovely wells.</p></speech>

I remember the same people suggesting that there should be no charge for the collection of waste in Dublin.  They said they would go to jail and never pay for the collection of refuse.  I do not hear a word about them any more.  They moved on to the next issue, which is water.</p><p>It is fundamental and important.  I emphasise that people in my area have been paying for water up to now.  We pay for water for farming and for business.  We are excluded from the household charges for water.  There is an exemption of 40,000 gallons per year.</p><p>There is a difference.  Furthermore, there is an urban-rural divide in this regard.  If the people in the urban areas of Dublin, Waterford, Galway and Limerick decide not to pay, what are the consequences for this or any future Government?  Put frankly, are the Government charges enforceable at the end of the day?  If not, then the Minister will have to avoid a situation whereby those who are paying will say they will not pay either.</p></speech>

We had an exceptionally good debate in the House yesterday evening.  It was clear in the House and outside beforehand that there was a fair degree of tension.  This was because people come at an issue like this from different points of view.  That is what democracy is about at the end of the day.  Then people vote and accept the result.  Many people in the House, even those who voted for the legislation, would have been far happier if we had promised a constitutional referendum in order that the issue of the ownership of Irish Water was sacrosanct, beyond question and enshrined in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.</p><p>In the heady days of Irish patriotism the slogan was: &quot;The land of Ireland for the people of Ireland&quot;.  James Fintan Lawlor, Michael Davitt and such people knew precisely why that had to be acted on.  After all, the land was one of the most important and essential resources that the country had.  They did not want to see it being used as a cash cow for absentee landlords, which was the case at the time.  When the State got the opportunity, it did a particularly good job in ensuring that the land was available to the people and could be used in a productive manner.</p><p>The same issue arises with water, there is no question about that.  More so than land, it is an essential resource for the people.  Senator Barrett has made some exceptional contributions to the House.  Members will agree that he has been most investigative and analytical.  He has put his expertise at the service of the House on many complex issues in his time in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</p><p>In this case he is trying to ensure that in the absence of a constitutional referendum, some class of block is put in place in respect of the shares of Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  Senator Barrett would admit that this is not the ideal route to go.  Let us suppose we agreed that we must protect the water of Ireland for the people of Ireland and ensure that it does not get into the hands of private interests and become a cash cow once again.  If there were privatisation, Irish people might not be in charge of that process.  This is especially relevant today given the disappearance of international borders etc.  People from China, America or anywhere could control Irish Water if that were the case.</p><p>On the face of it the plebiscite might seem like a good idea.  However, we all agree that legislation is what it is: it is legislation.  Every day and every week in this House we make amendments to legislation.  Given the pressures that have been on the economy during the recession and those that are and will continue to be on the economy, it is not beyond the power of imagination to envisage that whoever occupies these seats in any future Seanad &Eacute;ireann would have legislation before them regarding the privatisation of, or, rather, removing the ownership of, Irish Water from the people.  Of course, that is a possibility.</p><p>This raises another question.  If we are all agreed on the ownership of Irish Water by the people, surely the only way to copperfasten that beyond question is to have it in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  While I am supportive of Senator Barrett's contribution, because I know where he is coming from, there is no doubt that we cannot still accept that we are not going to have that.  It is within the power of Government to do that.</p><p>Of course there are complexities.  When Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann was first brought into being in 1937, there were many challenges facing the emerging State a short time after the Civil War.  It was one of the greatest challenges and it is to our credit as a people that we handled all those complexities at the time.  The small number of changes which have been made to Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann in the intervening years provide an indication of how to overcome complexities when we are faced with them.</p><p>We deal with complex issues in the House on a weekly basis.  Surely, nothing could be more demanding of our attention, time and energy then this issue of water, which belongs to the people and without which we could not live.</p><p>My appeal is that we would be supportive of the interim measure that Senator Barrett has put before the House.  I complimented the Minister yesterday on the valiant efforts he has made.  I made the point then and I make it again now.</p> <p>We must avoid political partisanship because if we do not, we will not truly reflect what the people are saying, the unrest on the ground and the fears and suspicions.  If we do not reflect honesty and respond with integrity, we are not doing what we should be doing as legislators.  Given the valiant stand taken by the Minister, will he go one step further and reflect on what he has heard in the debate?</p><p>A motion has been passed seeking a constitutional referendum and during the Christmas recess we will hear all about the efforts made to encapsulate all options, ideas and concerns, which are complex.  It is, however, straightforward to use the legal brains at our disposal to come up with a solution to include Irish Water in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  If we do not do this, as Senator Terry Leyden and others have said today and yesterday, even when all of our work is done and the legislation is passed and has to be implemented, some measures will not be acceptable to everyone.  However, this is one issue on which there is huge hostility.  When I raised it yesterday, a few heads nodded.  If people do not pay, will they be brought to court or put in jail?  Some Members shook their head and said, &quot;No.&quot;  I will pay the water charge and get good value for money, but that is not the issue.  The issue is changing the ownership of Irish Water which belongs to the people.  I am sure the Minister has tried, but I ask him not to give up and to return to the Cabinet to discuss again the possibility of holding a referendum.  The proposed plebiscite and legislation will not put people's fears to rest, but, at the same time, I compliment Senator Sean D. Barrett for trying to plug a hole which is likely to burst if we, as legislators, do not find a proper, positive and constructive way forward on this issue.</p></speech>

I appreciated many of his comments yesterday and his willingness to engage with the Seanad in the light of the contributions he was expecting to be made.  There has been a great deal of expertise this morning reflective of what the Minister anticipated.  I support Senator Sean D. Barrett's amendment on which he has brought his economic expertise to bear.  We have also benefited from the expertise of politicians on the other side of the House who have significant experience in politics.  We have also heard from cultural historians who speak with great eloquence and there has been legal analysis.  It is great, therefore, to participate in the debate.</p><p>I am also one of those who argue that public ownership can ultimately only be guaranteed by a constitutional referendum, an issue on which I commented yesterday, but if we cannot have this, the amendment would represent a way to plug the gap, as Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; said.  There are still a few holes in the proposal to have a plebiscite.  It should be made as strong as possible to reflect public opinion.  I appreciate the Minister's comments both at the beginning and the conclusion of the debate yesterday evening and his bona fide commitment to oppose the privatisation of Irish Water.  That is what the amendment and others are trying to do.  The only amendments we can make to this section relate to holding a plebiscite.  Deputies tabled amendments in the D&aacute;il to provide for the holding of a constitutional referendum.  My understanding is that they were ruled out of order because constitutional referendum proposals could only be accepted if the legislation solely related to them.  Several of us made efforts this morning which were also ruled out of order to move beyond the holding of a plebiscite to a constitutional referendum.  Article 46.2 provides that every proposal &quot;for an amendment of this Constitution shall be initiated in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann as a Bill&quot;.  The D&aacute;il and Seanad amendments seeking the holding of a referendum have been ruled out of order for different reasons; therefore, Deputies and Senators do not have the power to change the Government's view that a plebiscite is the best way to guarantee public ownership.  The Constitution guarantees that we, as law-makers, can privatise but internal rules block us such that we cannot propose a constitutional guarantee of public ownership.  Only the Government can do this, which is a pity because via this single decision the Minister could secure the goodwill of a huge swathe of the people.</p><p>In his opening remarks the Minister offered us a few paragraphs on why that was not possible.  The first paragraph related to complexity, an issue on which Senator Terry Leyden elaborated, which was helpful.  The second paragraph indicated a slippery slope argument in that if we were to do this in respect of water services, what about similar referendums on other infrastructure considered to be strategically important?  </p><p>In his concluding remarks the Minister mentioned the problem of unintended consequences.  He said he had consulted the Attorney General, which I appreciate, and mentioned a few arguments coming back.  Did her office conduct a scenario analysis of unintended consequences?  One can only think about such consequences if one has a wording.  Was it using this wording that the Minister had thought of unintended consequences or did he have another wording?  I wonder whether that happened while acknowledging it is not the Government's habit to make the Attorney General's advice available to law-makers, although I still do not understand this.  It would be helpful for him to provide us with a little more by way of rationale in that regard.  He is nodding his head and I look forward him to doing so.</p><p>In the absence of having any power as Senators to continue to find ways to secure a constitutional referendum in order that Irish Water can be placed in public ownership, our position is that we can only ask.  It feels a little like begging because the Government has the power to reconsider.  I strongly support the amendment to strengthen the plebiscite.  I am looking forward to, and anticipating, some of the arguments from Senator Thomas Byrne whose amendments might be a creative way of ensuring a referendum.  We will debate them later.  I affirm the questions asked by Senator David Cullinane and hope the Minister will reply to them.  Will the Government bring forward amending legislation to propose the holding of a referendum?</p> <p>We have some good examples of wording as proposed by Members of the D&aacute;il, Senator Craughwell and the Sinn F&eacute;in Senators.  If that is not the case, why will the Minister not do this?  I hope the Minister will answer those two questions and will affirm the encouragement of Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; that he will not give up and will go back to Cabinet on this issue.</p></speech>

The Minister in his response yesterday in this House asked if Senators were seeking that Irish Water or water be protected from privatisation under the Constitution.  We are seeking the protection of the water resource.  We should have debated that issue.</p><p>What are we afraid of?  Why are we not willing to stand up for the Irish people and say that water is a life resource that needs to be protected?  It is proposed to hold a referendum providing for a reduction in the age for candidates for the Presidency.  Is it more important to hold a referendum on that issue than it is to hold a referendum that seeks to ensure protection of a resource for life that, as stated previously by Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell, should be &quot;referendum-ly&quot; ours?</p></speech>

I am delighted that Senator Barrett has put forward a measure that could strengthen the weakness of the plebiscite which the Government is offering the people.  Senator Barrett's middle ground protection is a wisely and judiciously sought strengthening of the plebiscite, which is nothing in that it is reliant only on a resolution of both Houses.  When have the Houses got right what the people want?  We are aware of the desire and will of the Irish people that water be protected and not subject to sale.</p><p>The Government and Independent Senators who last night voted against this measure sold out the potential for the protection under the Constitution of our water.  They sold us out and they sold out our resource.  In so doing, they sold out the potential sources of our lakes that supply the water, including Lough Corrib in Galway, the Shannon and other midland lakes.  This is a serious issue.  What we are trying to do here is ensure we are never again beholden to others.  The Irish people are of the view that we are too beholden to Europe and European regulation.  Unless Senators give serious consideration to and vote in favour of the measure proposed by Senator Barrett we will be leaving ourselves open to Ervia selling off its shares in the future.  That is what this is about.  Ervia can sell its shares.  Senator Barrett's measure would ensure that the Minister for Finance or the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government hold those shares.  Nationalisation of those shares would be a bulwark against privatisation into the future.  Who in this House would disagree with that?  We must act for the Irish people and our natural resource of water which we cannot live without.  As stated earlier if, in the future, a Chinese company buys the Ervia shares it will put its needs ahead of the Irish people.  </p><p>Let us give serious consideration to this legislation and do our business well by including the necessary protections.  I welcome that debate on this amendment, which provides some protection, has been agreed to.  I thank Senator Barrett for his wisdom in tabling it. </p></speech>

A constitutional referendum was proposed to ensure protection of the right of the people of Ireland to their water.  Article 10.3 of the Constitution states: "Provision may be made by law for the management of the property which belongs to the State by virtue of this Article and for the control of the alienation, whether temporary or permanent, of that property."  I sought amendment of Article 40 of the Constitution to protect water.  Many Senators have said they would like to ensure protection of our water by way of referendum.</p><p>The Minister said yesterday that there was a difficulty in providing for protection of water under the Constitution because of property rights.  In this regard, he adverted to private wells and so on.  No Government has been slow in moving to nationalise or take possession of any asset it felt it needed at a time of crisis.  If in the morning a particular area was without water the Government would not be slow in coming forward to seize all the wells in that area to provide water.  Thus, I do not accept the Minister's argument.</p><p>Is the Minister aware that a company was established in October of this year in the UK named &quot;Irish Water-Uisce &Eacute;ireann&quot;?  I wonder if it is in any way related.  Everything I have read or heard about water services provision in terms of the several attempts already made to get legislation in this regard through the Houses has been hamfisted and a total mess.  I admire the Minister in that he has at least tried.  However, when tens of thousands of people in this country came out to protest he had the unique opportunity to at least appease a substantial number of them by providing for protection of Irish water by way of referendum.  </p><p>Perhaps the Minister will when responding show himself to be a brave Minister and indicate that he will bring forth a Bill to the D&aacute;il and then to the Seanad to provide for a referendum not only on water but on all our natural resources and ownership of them?  </p></speech>

It is our policy in Fianna F&aacute;il to abolish Irish Water and suspend the charges pending a full review of the policy.  Fianna F&aacute;il has consistently opposed the creation of Irish Water, and the controversy of consultancy costs, bonuses and over-staffing of this super-quango has borne out our fears.  Irish Water is top-heavy in management, which has been placed on top of the existing water services in the local authorities.  It has lost the confidence of the Irish people and it must be abolished.</p><p>As I said yesterday, it has caused anarchist groups to arise and create a potentially difficult democratic situation in the country.  If these people on the extreme left get into government the country could be destabilised and it would give out the wrong message around the world, particularly with regard to foreign direct investment, which would run away quickly if there were any break in the continuity of centre-right or centre-left governments.  We need foreign direct investment and if they see all these anarchists becoming part of government we will be on a rocky road.  </p><p>The new delivery model should be a mutually owned holding company owned by the customers.  The company would set national standards, be responsible for capital investment planning and borrow on behalf of local authorities.  Delivery of services should be restored to the local authorities in order to ensure local knowledge and direct democratic accountability, and the company should be a slimmed-down provider of national water infrastructure.  </p><p>The Minister will agree that the national road network is outstanding as a result of the partnership between the NRA and the local authorities.  I do not why the same cannot be done with regard to water services.  The national routes are world class.</p><p>I understand it is very difficult for the Government to face up to the fact that Irish Water is such a shambles, but if this were a business the decision would be to cut losses and start from scratch.  I wish the Minister good luck.</p></speech>

I wish to point out to other Senators that if they intend to quote me they should quote me correctly.</p><p>I think we should preserve our water, purify our water, supply our water and pay for our water.  I have said this from the beginning.  I also think it should be fair, just and affordable and it should be ours.  This is very important to me, because it is the argument I made here a month ago about it being ours and nobody else's.  I have researched the World Bank and the way it walked into countries all over the world and, in order to help them pay off their debts, took their water.  Some countries were left without water and some were left with a trickle; some were left with cholera; some were left badly supplied, while others had to repay fortunes to the World Bank to re-nationalise their water.  It was vulture funds, bank speculators and corporations who did it, and they beggared the poor.  Today, large companies own 34% of water.  This is an extraordinary statistic.  The World Bank rushed in to congratulate the multinationals in Argentina, but the government in the end had to re-nationalise.</p><p>When I hear the word &quot;privatisation&quot;, I am apoplectic.  I am in four minds about this Bill.  I understand we have to pay for water but I do not understand the way it was set up, which was so outrageously bad that Noddy and Big Ears and some people in Toytown would have done a better job of it.  I understand that what the Minister had to take was a poisoned chalice and I know what he had to try to realign.  I know he made some attempt with regard to a plebiscite but I want him to explain to me the watertight nature of the plebiscite.  I want him to explain to me the legality of the plebiscite.  I know that it is at least something, because I can tell the House about the last legalisation with regard to Irish Water, which was so wanton and so loose that it could have been changed overnight.  I want to know where does the Irish public and public ownership stand in relation to section 2, which provides for a plebiscite on ownership of Irish Water.  That is where I stand and fall on how I vote.  That is what I have to be convinced of.  I know we have to pay.  I would prefer if we were metered and I know that will come into play in 2019 or before.  I agree with paying for water and with the conservation, purification and supply of water.  However, things were done very badly.  In all my days of working in the public sector and with the public, I have never been as upset and abused - as I know the Minister has been - on all kinds of social media.  That is the game, and as a public figure one cannot hide from it.  However, many of the people who write and e-mail are correct.  This is very difficult.  While I know that, generally speaking, the Government is trying to clean up the pipes and clean up supply, clean up effluent, clean up waste management and create a great supply, the way it has gone about it has absolutely undermined the trust of the Irish people, to the point at which they are not even listening now to any form of reasonable argument, and I do not blame them.</p> <p> I need the Minister to convince me that the plebiscite will work, will be watertight and cannot, as some Senators have suggested, be realigned like the lottery was realigned overnight and given to Camelot and the teachers of Canada.  I was a lone voice in the wind on that issue.  I continue to hold to the idea that water should be retained in public ownership.  Some people think this is not as important as the charges but it is important to trust something that we can own and develop into a world class service over the next 30 years.  I would come closer to believing in it if I thought it was ours and that we could take pride in it.  In the Netherlands, one would nearly be jailed for mentioning privatisation because it is so watertight.  If the Minister can convince me that the same will apply here, I might be able to take the abuse with a little bit more heart.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-12-19a.124" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1116" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014121900016#Q00200"><p>I thank the Minister for the assiduous attention he has shown to the debate and for listening to the robust and differing views expressed by Senators.  I suggest to Senator O'Donnell this provision could be changed in exactly the same way that the national lottery was dealt with.  It is the same procedure and the national lottery sets a precedent in this regard.</p><p>The provision on the plebiscite has already been amended.   I pointed out this morning that it is an example of a political bait and switch.  There was an obvious error in the first version of the provision and the Minister subsequently introduced a more detailed proposal.  However, the revised provision will not make a huge difference because all legislation can be changed by future legislation.  We might think in terms of two or three years but Senator O'Donnell reminded us that the national lottery was privatised 30 years after it had been established.  That was a big issue for the Senator and for many people around the country.  We have to think about what the fourth or fifth Government after this one might propose.  The political tempo could change and we have a responsibility to ensure that what we do holds fast until the people decide otherwise.  The only way to do that is by means of a referendum.</p><p>A large number of amendments have been ruled out of order but I urge my colleagues not to get hung up about them.  A specific provision in the Constitution prevents the Seanad from initiating a constitutional referendum.  We are governed by the Constitution in this regard.  It is not the fault of the Cathaoirleach or the Minister.  I would like a constitutional provision to prevent a future Oireachtas from discussing the alienation of Irish Water.  That is what is at stake in this debate.  A Bill is only as watertight as Government policy dictates.  The whip system is rigid and if a future Cabinet decided to sell Irish Water, the necessary legislation would be passed by the Oireachtas.  All that is required is the deletion of section 2.  I acknowledge that the Minister will never initiate such legislation and I fully accept his bona fides and his political views.  I would never introduce such legislation, although Senator Quinn indicated that he might do so.  </p></speech>

We are not looking at this or the next Government; we are looking at the distance between the establishment of the National Lottery and its sale.  The Bill does not deal with that distance.</p><p>I have suggested that the public water forum be turned into a constitutional convention on the issue of privatising Irish Water, and would make recommendations that the Government could implement.  This was an attempt to come some way to meet people's concerns while recognising that the Seanad cannot introduce legislation providing for a referendum.  Even this proposal is not watertight but it is better than the Minister's proposal because at least we would be allowing for the possibility of a referendum in legislation.</p><p>The Minister's proposal on a plebiscite refers to the alienation of shares but it does not deal with the assets of Irish Water.  We have sold shares in Bank of Ireland but we sold the assets of IBRC, namely, its loan book.  There are different ways of privatising public bodies.  We could sell the shares, the business or the physical assets.  That is a significant lacuna, and I would like to hear the Minister's response to an amendment I will move later on this subject.</p></speech>

He has introduced fairness and ensured affordability for all customers of Irish Water.</p><p>It is important to clear the air in regard to section 2.  We need to forget about scaremongering because the reality is that the section guarantees public ownership of the utility by providing for a plebiscite.  As one of the Labour Party Senators who voted to allow for a debate on the possibility of holding a referendum to safeguard Irish Water, I am satisfied that the Minister's proposals will safeguard it from privatisation.  With respect to my colleagues, I think we are fighting the wrong battle.  We should save our strength and depth of feeling for future Governments because Fine Gael and the Labour Party have ruled out privatising Irish Water.  If Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in and a plethora of Independent Members want to privatise Irish Water, we should fight that in the trenches.  I speak for myself in regard to the day I voted on the Order of Business.  Retaining Irish Water in public ownership was paramount for me; the mechanism by which that would happen was not as important.  I am reassured by the strength of the language in the sections of the Bill we are currently debating.  The word &quot;shall&quot; makes a demand, as opposed to &quot;may&quot;, which is merely persuasive.  This shows a definite intention on the part of the Minister to safeguard this utility for the Irish people.  I ask my colleagues in Opposition whether Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in or Independent Members would delete section 2 if they are elected to Government.</p></speech>

Senator Higgins brought her legal background to bear on the issue and expressed her satisfaction with the language used in the Bill.  All we can ask from each other is honesty.  I ask the Minister to confirm that it would be possible for a future Government to simply amend the Bill by removing section 2.</p> <p>That is correct, is it not?  I want to put it in context.  I take the point made by Senator Higgins that at present, there is no proposal from Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il, the Labour Party, Sinn F&eacute;in or anyone else to privatise Irish Water.  I ask my colleagues to reflect on what happened in late 2009 and 2010 when this country was absolutely broke and desperately needed a huge injection of funding to pay salaries and pensions, including those of our garda&iacute;.  If some wealthy businessman who is lauded at home even though he does not pay his taxes or pays them offshore - I am not referring to anybody in particular; we would have a menu of such characters to choose from - had offered &euro;20 billion or &euro;30 billion for the Irish water system when the then Government had no money, I wonder how the various political parties would have responded.  I suggest we would have been challenged on whether we wanted to pay nurses, doctors or teachers and whether we wanted to keep the State solvent.  We would have been presented with this proposal as a way of solving our problems.</p><p>We do not know what this country's economic circumstances will be five or ten years from now.  There could be another repeat of disastrous economic policies.  We could reach a set of circumstances in which we desperately and urgently need &euro;15 billion, &euro;20 billion or &euro;30 billion.  Nobody can know what the political reaction would be if the Government of the day were to decide, in what Charlie Haughey once memorably called &quot;the higher national interest&quot;, that Irish Water should be sold.  That could happen without any referendum - it would merely require a short Bill to amend this Bill to be brought before the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  I would hate people to vote on the basis of misinformation or misinterpretation, for example, in the belief that this Bill somehow prevents the sale of Irish Water.  Irish Water can be sold without consulting any member of the public.  All that would be required is a simple majority vote of the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.</p></speech>

Having been in this House at the time of the bank guarantee, and having been in the Oireachtas when the State was essentially bankrupt and people were desperately seeking a way to fund it, I ask my colleagues to reflect on how we might respond to the temptation to sell Irish Water if another emergency were to arise and a national cash injection of &euro;10 billion, &euro;15 billion, &euro;20 billion or &euro;25 billion - whatever the worth of Irish Water might be - were needed.  The brutal reality is that under such circumstances, Irish Water could be privatised and sold within two days - a day in the Seanad and a day in the D&aacute;il - without the public being consulted.</p><p>The change in language from &quot;may&quot; to &quot;shall&quot; might make the text on a plain sheet of paper look stronger, but we all know it makes no difference in the context of the political reality.  If people want to support the legislation on the basis that they are happy with it, that is fair enough, but we should not fool ourselves into believing this legislation offers any assurance about the future ownership of Irish Water.  It cannot do so.  The legislation as written cannot allow any assurance.  The law can be changed by any future Government that commands a one-vote majority in the D&aacute;il and a one-vote majority in the Seanad.  We should admit to ourselves that the Irish public would not be consulted, or would not need to be consulted, if some sort of emergency situation were to arise.</p><p>The Minister has heard all of these arguments being made in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  He has responded in the D&aacute;il, so we know where he is coming from.  I hope we will not be making an adjudication on this worthy and detailed amendment today.  I suggest we should reflect further on it in advance of Report Stage.  We should not try to cod ourselves into believing we are offering a triple-lock solution.  The Minister and the Government can use their key to open the triple lock at any stage without needing to consult the public.  The reality is that there is no guarantee to the public in the absence of a constitutional referendum.  We should vote on what we know to be fact, rather than what we would wish it to be.  It would be much more convenient for colleagues on the other side of the House who have doubts to believe this legislation provides some sort of guarantee about the future ownership of Irish Water.  Sadly, that is not the case and we know it.  At the end of the day, in politics one has to be true to one's self.  If Senators want to support the legislation, that is fair enough, but they should not allow themselves to be fooled into believing something that is not in the Bill is in it.  This is not George Orwell.  It is not a case of language meaning what one wants it to mean.  It means what is in the legislation.</p></speech>

The Minister heard two people doing so yesterday.  Regardless of how one looks at this issue, one cannot deny that Senators Quinn and White said clearly that it would be a good idea to discuss it and that we should not be closed to it.  There is the Minister's answer.  I would say there is a hell of a lot more of them in the bulrushes.  Certainly this is a Fine Gael point of view.</p><p>I was down in my little office, working for the people and slaving my fingers to the bone, when I heard the plaintive tones of my long-time good friend, Senator O'Donnell.  I hope nothing I say causes her to burst into tears.  I suggest that when she said she &quot;voted to have the Bill read&quot;, it was dissimilation of the most obvious kind.  I remind her that she was voting for the Second Reading of the Bill.  Everything that needed to be said in terms of Second Stage speeches had already been said.  We did not vote on the reading of the Bill - we voted on the Second Reading of the Bill, which involves moving on towards the amendments.</p></speech>

The amendment cuts to the bone of Irish Water in its current form and where we want to see water in the future.  It touches on financial transparency and the transparency or clearness of the water as well.  It relates to who will own the water into the future.  We must accept that water is a fundamental human right.  According to the World Health Organization, each individual needs between 50 and 100 litres of water to live each day.  If we are to accept the UN declaration on the right to water and what it states, surely we have to make sure that right is not diluted by future ownership or by the costing of future unaffordability issues.</p> <p>While they are both interlinked, the charging is a matter for section 3.  Section 2 is about ownership.  Senator Bradford outlined very clearly the fact that a simple resolution by both Houses of the Oireachtas could in effect lead to an equity stakeholding to permit outside interests to takeover control of Irish Water whether that be a controlling interest or another level of interest.   Given that there will be a worldwide scarcity of water over the next 30 to 40 years, water will be a valuable investment opportunity for speculators and those who might want to export water from Ireland to other jurisdictions.</p><p>We are going into uncharted waters, if colleagues will pardon the pun.  While I accept his bona fides and acknowledge the work the Minister has done to tidy up the mess left by Phil Hogan, the fundamental issue is the ownership of our water and that has not been tidied up sufficiently.  The issue of public ownership of a water supply is fundamental to why people marched on the streets.  While they are concerned about the charges, people's opinions should not be reduced to that.  People are cleverer than that.  The Irish people know the importance of water not only now but for future years.  They know there will be a scarcity and they are concerned about the future ownership of the resource.</p><p>If we learn anything from other jurisdictions, we should be aware of what happened in England where there are 11 regional monopoly companies dealing with water.  In the first ten years of their operation from the late 1980s, they increased the price of water by 100%.  In the following ten years, they increased the price of water by a further 102%.  Under the Labour Party in England, the British Government wanted to call a halt to spiralling prices and the monopoly situations that existed in each region, but it was too late.  The Government under the Prime Minister at the time, Tony Blair, failed because it had gone too far.  The establishment had been created and the precedent was there.  The Government was unable to go back and reverse what had occurred.  That will happen here because in 20 or 25 years Irish Water will still be there in whatever form - public, semi-public or private, no one knows - and in control of the drinking water supply in every domestic or business premises.  It will be too late then to break it up and bring it back into public ownership.  If we accept that water is a fundamental human right and necessary, according to the World Health Organisation, just to live, this is a fundamental decision that will affect future generations.  It is not like food; it is more important than that as it is necessary to live on a daily basis.</p><p>We are going down the wrong road and I agree completely with where Senator Barrett is coming from.  The steps initially taken by the previous Minister, Phil Hogan, in moving control and the decision making responsibility away from local authorities and councillors was the wrong way to go.  It was to take decision making on a precious and scarce resource away from the closest level of democracy and centralise it.  One can argue that there are economies of scale and critical mass, but that does not add up when one looks at how much water is being lost.  When the Minister was last in the House on 5 November, he outlined that 49% of all water was lost through the pipe network.  We do not know how much it costs to produce water as half of what it is produced is lost.  In that context, the &euro;1.2 billion which people are currently paying and which we will discuss in relation to section 3 is not an accurate figure.  In County Kilkenny, 56% of water is lost and in County Donegal, 43% of water is lost.  These are huge losses and the first thing to do is surely to carry out a complete cost-benefit analysis of the network to find out how much water is being lost and what the monetary value of the loss is, and put in place an investment programme funded by borrowings and Exchequer returns contained within the local government sector under the control of the Department of the Environment, Communities and Local Government and the local authority audit section.  At least then, decisions would be made locally.  Individuals who have a pipe leading up to their houses have to ring a call line with all that goes along with that.</p><p>Irrespective of the Minister's best efforts and what he is trying to achieve, we are still going down the wrong road and creating a dangerous situation.  There is speculation in the international market looking at investments that will yield returns.  According to US investment firms, one of the most lucrative currently is water.  Water is deemed to be a necessity but it is also deemed to have investment potential which can yield huge returns if not immediately then in future years.  We are going down the road of creating a situation where a majority of Members of D&aacute;il and Seanad &Eacute;ireann could in future years provide for a lucrative financial position.  We have a very party-oriented political structure in Ireland.  I am not throwing anything across at any Government party.  My party is as much to blame.  We have a party system in which the whip rules and, ultimately, those in leadership roles give directions to backbench Deputies and Senators to vote legislation through.  We have seen it many times from all parties which have also sought to coerce Independent Members to go with them.  It is inevitable that will happen in future when an international investor comes along and offers the billions needed to satisfy interests in certain constituencies to build football fields and other amenities.</p><p>We are going down a dangerous road.  It is wrong.  It is a public water supply currently but we are changing that.  Deep down in his own heart, the Minister believes it is the wrong way to go too.  He might say that Fine Gael and Labour are not going to change it, but there will be election after election and change after change.  Offer after offer will be made and the Minister should be under no illusion about it.  There are speculators out there now, some of whom are known to Members, who may be interested in purchasing equity stakes in Irish Water in future because it is about profit.  The world revolves around finance.  I rest my tuppenceworth at that and ask the Minister even at this late stage to allow a referendum to be held.  There is nothing to fear in that.  The people are entitled to express their opinion and to allow them to do so would strengthen the Minister's position by allowing him to stand up and say the right to water has been galvanised in the Constitution.  It is an opportunity that will be missed if it is not availed of.</p></speech>

While I did not have an opportunity to speak on Second Stage yesterday, I will not make a Second Stage speech.  Like the Minister and many Senators, I have received abuse on social media and via emails, etc.  That is part of what we do and we must accept it when we put our names on ballot papers and sign up for public life.</p> <p> I listened intently to yesterday's debate, which was like a ping-pong game over and back across the House from Opposition to Government.  Many good points were made on both sides of the argument.  I believe water should be paid for.  I believe we need a utility company to run it but it needs to be run properly.  I have seen people get exercised over this, people who would not normally get exercised.  I do not think at this stage it is about payment for water.  I think it is years and years of austerity having beaten down on people.  They have been gradually hit with charge after charge.  I think people have reached the point where they can take no more.  This is the final straw.</p><p>It is not easy to impose a charge on people.  However, as the economy grows, it is incumbent on us to put something back into the people's pockets that helps them to pay these charges.  The universal social charge should be looked at.  I know we have taken 80,000 people out of the universal social charge net, but we need to take many more out of it.  It was introduced as a temporary measure.  Further changes on the universal social charge would put money back into people's pockets enabling them to pay for these facilities.</p><p>In Kerry we have had 18 years of not paying for water.  I accept that Labour was party to abolish the water charges back then.  We have seen what 18 years of not paying has done for the water in Kerry.  The pipes in mid-Kerry are constantly breaking, leaving people without water.  Many houses receive their water through lead pipes.  There are constant breakdowns at the pumps.  All of these have to be paid for when they have to be replaced.  We need to get money in to address this.</p><p>In the area where I live the cost of water for me is &euro;30 year for the year.  I have no sewerage facilities.  I have my own bioCycle unit.  I have mains water.  The charge is &euro;130 for two adults and we will be refunded &euro;100, so the cost for the whole year is &euro;30.  I do not think people are on the streets protesting about the &euro;30 but about what it stands for.</p><p>For once rural Ireland trumps urban Ireland because the cost to us is less, which does not happen very often.  People in rural areas have been paying for water for many years.  Many people I talk to are not going on social media, e-mailing, going on the radio and voicing their opinions.  They have been paying for it for years and cannot understand what the hype is about.  There are two different opinions out there.  We hear the ones from the people who are most vocal through the newspapers, television and Internet, but many other people are not.</p><p>I believe that water has to be paid for and we have to set up a utility company to provide the service.  However, it is the composition of that utility company that has incensed people.  Using the word &quot;bonus&quot; at this time is inappropriate.  I know the Minister will refer to the increments, which I understand.  I know there are workers on low pay who are depending on that.  However, the word &quot;bonus&quot; drove people off their heads at a time when they were being hit in their pockets and paying left, right and centre for everything.  It is very hard for the public to take that word.</p><p>Will the Minister do whatever he has to do to ensure that Irish Water will never be privatised?  The Labour Party group here in the Seanad voted to ensure that Irish Water would never be privatised.</p></speech>

He stated:<blockquote><br />The global population is forecasted to grow by 2 billion people by 2050 resulting in substantial increased demand for food, while at the same time there will be ever increasing pressure on natural resources such as water and biodiversity.  Ireland is fully committed to playing its part in addressing these global challenges whether it be through enhanced production of sustainable and healthy food products.</blockquote>New Zealand had not privatised its water.  As Senators will know, the milk quota is about to be lifted.  New Zealand is turning &euro;3.7 billion in its dairy produce.  If we look back over the past 30 years, did we imagine at Christmas we could pick up an iPhone and Skype someone in Australia?  Did those of us with modern homes imagine that we could pick up an iPhone and control the central heating?  Can Senators imagine what it will be like in 2050?<br/>In response to Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill, we are all saying it is a precious natural resource.  I am not just talking about us drinking it and bathing in it today.  We will be centred in the world.  We are so fortunate to have the perfect temperate climate.  We will be the target for the oligarchs of Russia and will be the targets of the Chinese to privatise it and the Minister, Deputy Kelly, will not be here to defend us.  I would love if he were but he will not be.  He has a chance to go back to the Government to revisit the option of a constitutional referendum, which is the only way that we can be absolutely 100% certain.<br/>To go back to the cartoons and movies, the Wizard of Oz has gone to Brussels.  The rainbow has a crock of gold at the end of it, but it will end up with the Chinese or Russians unless the Minister gives us a referendum.</p></speech>

While some Senators, who have spoken at length about the importance of not privatising Irish Water, with which I agree completely, had an opportunity to reject the Bill yesterday, unfortunately, for whatever reason they decided not to.  There is now a real opportunity to tie into the legislation the absolute necessity for a referendum.</p> <p>A plebiscite in the Bill does not do it.  This amendment is good in that it addresses what is at stake.  Senator Barrett will decide as to whether it is to be re-tabled on Report Stage for Monday, but all of us are in agreement with it.  If, as I am hearing from colleagues, none of us wants to privatise, and the Minister does not want to see water privatised, we should tie it in by way of a referendum.  It is as simple as that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-12-19a.181" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1088" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="12:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014121900020#U00200"><p>I thank the Senators for their comprehensive contributions.  I will go through this amendment and, I dare say, probably this section, because it broadens out into the section as well.<br/>I have a couple of initial comments.  I had nothing to do with amendments being ruled out of order.  If they were ruled in order, I would debate them as much as I would debate any of these.  This is merely to make that clear.<br/>To deal with the amendment first, Ervia is owned by the State.  It is owned by the Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform and Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  It has two subsidiaries, Irish Water and Gas Networks Ireland, which are also owned by the State.  Ervia has no financial rights of ownership.  These shares are wholly-owned by the Minister for Finance and myself and there is no way that Ervia can dispose of Irish Water because in a sense Ervia does not own it.<br/>I will not be supporting this amendment even though it is put down for the right reasons.  I accept all of the amendments, even those ruled out of order, were put down in the right spirit, but I will not be accepting this amendment.<br/>The amendment states it will give functions back to local authorities.  This would create issues.  There are serious economies of scale in what Irish Water is doing.  I quoted yesterday that in the case of the Ringsend plant there is a saving of &euro;170 million because Irish Water is doing that piece of work and there is five or six such examples across the country.  There are many economies in tendering.  Also, the financial capacity of one utility to borrow is one of the most fundamental reasons Irish Water is necessary because of the scale of investment that is necessary in the future.<br/>The Constitution is something which every one of us holds dear.  When I took my seal of office, it is something on which I reflected.  I must uphold and protect the Constitution and I always will to the best of my ability.  I hope everyone accepts my bona fides in that regard.  I am doing everything to the best of my ability, with the advice that I can take, as a member of the Executive.<br/>Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann is the fundamental legal document of the State.  It includes the fundamental rights of Irish citizens and establishes and documents the main institutions of State, etc.  It describes the legislative branches of the State, including this House, the Executive branch of the State, the Judiciary - the three pillars of the State.  It also lists key officers, such as the Attorney General.  However, it does not seek to describe the structures of the State which are mainly provided through legislation, for example, the education system, the health system, the road network.  In this House I made a commitment, which I honoured, that I would bring the resolution of this House to the Cabinet and state clearly what this House told me and discuss it, and we did in great detail.<br/>Senators will be familiar with Articles 10.1 and 10.2.  Article 10.2 states:<blockquote>All land and all mines, minerals and waters which belonged to Saorst&aacute;t &Eacute;ireann immediately before the coming into operation of this Constitution belong to the State to the same extent as they then belonged to Saorst&aacute;t &Eacute;ireann.</blockquote>Under that article, all natural resources and all water is vested in the State.  I will not do anything to change that or to ensure that the water resources of the State do not belong to the citizens of the State.<br/>In the D&aacute;il debate, a colleague of mine who is legally qualified, Deputy Penrose, stated that he would allow Irish Water and the water of this country to be privatised over his dead body.  I want to repeat that.  I would allow the privatisation and sell-off of Irish Water and of the water service in this country over my dead body.</p></speech>

I come from the Labour Party.  We all are politicians at the end of the day.  I am a Member of a Government involving Labour and Fine Gael.  From my ideology, the idea that we would privatise Irish Water is against everything I stand for.  Let me be clear about that.</p><p>A couple of colleagues referenced - I do not know whether they quoted them fairly - that there might have been two Senators who stated yesterday that they would privatise Irish Water.  That is not what I heard.  One of them said maybe in the future but not now and the other wanted a discussion on it.  Be that as it may, I have not heard of anyone in these Houses, particularly in the other House, or any of the local authorities - I have been around a lot of those because I am responsible for them - who wants to do this.  The Bill provides that this cannot happen and now we are providing that it would need a resolution of this House and the other House, and then it would have to go to a plebiscite of the Irish people.  We are stating clearly that this can never happen.</p><p>In response to many who have asked, including a number of Senators here, all legislation in the State can be changed.  I am a straight talker.  All legislation can be changed.  However, what future government, no matter who its members are, would change this?  I would respectfully say that Senators should have a little more confidence in the fact that the people know whom they vote for.  People know whom they vote for and they know what they stand for.  If every party in the State states it would not do this, what future government would potentially take away the right of the people to decide on the ownership of water if, which I can never see happening, they were so minded to do it in the first place?  What government in its right mind would even consider that?  I do not know what public would elect a government to make that decision in the first place.  Even if one parks the privatisation of Irish Water, what people would decide to elect a government to take away the right of the people to decide to do something that they never wanted in the first place?  It is illogical.</p><p>One can trace the line of saying that legislation can be changed.  I say it out straight.  Of course, legislation can be changed.  Senators need not even respond.  I am acknowledging that.  I am straight up about it.  Of course, it can be changed.  However, what Government will do that based on this?</p> <p>The threshold is up at ceiling level.  </p><p>I also want to repeat, and I did it deliberately.  I have been in this House previously and I am not saying this in jest but I have always believed that the best debates, in many ways, come from this House.  I deliberately in my response on Second Stage went over this item because I knew it was the item that most people had a lot of interest in and we discussed it before in this House.  I have referenced the fact that we went to the Attorney General, we went across Government, took advice and took legal advice and remember the Attorney General, like all the rest of us, is the guardian of this sacred document in this country.  Therefore, we have to look at the law of unintended consequences.  We should learn lessons, in this space, from other referenda that we had in the past in another area.</p><p>If we were going to have a referendum, what would it be on?  How would we define it?  Would we have to go back at it again and again?  Would we be having a referendum on Irish Water?  Would we be having a referendum on Irish Water as an organisation?  Would we be having a referendum on water services?  Would we be having a referendum on water?  Would we be having a referendum on water plus something else or what?  Those are real questions and I do not say them in jest but honestly.  </p><p>If we were to have a referendum, what would be the inventory of what we are protecting?  Would it include boreholes, private wells, pumps, land which pipes go through, aquifers, group water schemes, infrastructure co-owned by many different people and by different companies, companies' infrastructure, infrastructure owned by commercial organisations that are working and using large quantities of water, that are even producing water and selling it?  </p></speech>

In fact, it is very important.  What is the component of what is protected?  What unintended consequences and what issues could potentially arise from this matter?  These are very real questions.  As regards property rights, which are also protected in the Constitution, there are issues for same.</p><p>Let us remember what I said earlier on what is in the Constitution, what usually falls in the Constitution and what does not.  If we did this, should we not be doing it for many other areas?  I do not ask the following in jest.  Should we be doing it in relation to roads, CIE, bogs and a whole range of other areas?  Potentially the same argument, in many ways, would stand up for one issue as for another but perhaps not to the same degree because I accept and understand that we cannot live without water and air.  I still must  pose the question.  </p><p>The argument has been well made in terms of the surrounding issues say in 20, 30 or 40 years' time.  </p></speech>

After the past few months I am not too sure about that but we will see.</p><p>Let us be honest about this matter.  Do not forget that I sat here in 2008 when we debated the bank guarantee which was one of the most fundamental nights in the history of this State.  I personally think the wrong decision was made and voted against it.</p><p>People have put forward arguments in relation to Europe.  Last night I read Article 345 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union about the principle of neutrality and these issues.  I know that will not satisfy everyone and accept that because people will say circumstances can change and all of that but the principle exists.  </p><p>I want to convey the following.  In reaching this decision, trust me, I did not filter all of this down in a flippant way.  I filtered all of this down with my colleagues, and with everyone, in a comprehensive way.  I probably spent more time on this matter than on most of the Bill put together, to be honest, because it is a fundamental issue.  </p></speech>

Working within all of the advice we can get in Government, I believe that the threshold created absolutely protects Irish Water.  I also need to say to Senators that before they put a provision into the Constitution they would need to be absolutely certain it could achieve what it sets out to achieve and dealt with all the issues that I have just said need to be dealt with.  Given my role, given my philosophical beliefs, given the fact that I represent the Government, given the fact that I honestly take this matter seriously to the nth degree, given the fact that I have brought what the Senators decided some time ago to the Government, I can tell Senators, absolutely hand on heart and in all conscience, that I have gone as far as is possible in terms of this issue.  I hope Members appreciate that and I have said that in the right spirit.  I genuinely acknowledge the fact that the amendments, ideas, concepts and proposals put forward by Senators - and I have read the ones that where ruled of out order as well and I would have had no issue dealing with them either - but all were put forward in the right spirit.  Through the process that we have undergone, I believe what we have in front of us is as far as we can go and ask Senators to support the legislation.  Therefore, I will not accept Senator Barrett's amendment.</p></speech>

He made a lengthy and passionate contribution but, in reality, it was meaningless for the following reasons.  It was easy for him to say, as a Minister, as a citizen and as a person, that "over my dead body will our water be privatised".  Any Senator in this Chamber could stand up and say exactly the same.  This issue is not about the Minister, me, his party, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, any political party or any Independent but about the process.  We have been asked to deal with here a process that could, potentially, allow for the water services to be privatised at some point in time in the future.  That is the question.</p><p>The Minister also said that he found it very difficult to imagine a set of circumstances in which our water could be privatised.  He asked what government in their right mind would privatise our water services.</p> <p>I am sure six weeks, six months or even six years before the bank guarantee the same question could have been asked.  What Government in its right mind would put &euro;90 billion of taxpayers&rsquo; money into private banks?</p></speech>

He will have a chance again to respond to me.  What Parliament in its right mind would put &euro;90 billion of taxpayers&rsquo; money into private banks, not public banks, to pay back private bondholders?  We emptied the National Pensions Reserve Fund and borrowed money to put into the banks.  Leading up to that, no one would have foreseen a set of circumstances in which we socialised the debts of private banks.</p><p>It is not, therefore, beyond the realm of possibility that some Government in the future may want to privatise our water services.  What the people want is the ultimate protection that the only people who can give permission for our water to be privatised or sold off are the people of the State, not a politician or party.  That is the very point the Minister is missing.</p><p>I asked the Minister a straight question when I was on my feet the last time but he did not answer it.</p></speech>

I will repeat the question and the Minister might respond.  I accept that the Labour Party and the Government do not want to privatise water services at this point.  What if, at some point in the future because of an economic crisis, a Government was minded to privatise water?  Would it be possible for it to do so?  Is it possible for a future Government to introduce an amending Bill to remove section 2?</p></speech>

All it is is a promise by the Government put into legislation which can be undone by one simple vote of the Oireachtas.  Accordingly, the people do not have any say.</p><p>Earlier, Senator Lorraine Higgins of the Labour Party said we now have a guarantee that there will be a plebiscite on the ownership of Irish Water.  There is no guarantee.  This is smoke and mirrors of the worst kind.  The Government cannot give that guarantee.  The only way such a guarantee can be given is if we have a referendum for an amendment to insert into the Constitution the right of the citizens to make such a fundamental decision.  The Minister, along with other Senators, claimed getting the right wording for such an amendment would be a difficult.  We had a Constitutional Convention, of which I was a member, that examined difficult and complex issues.  It made several recommendations to hold referendums on a range of issues.  It properly teased out and ventilated all of the concerns about certain constitutional amendments and any potential unintended consequences that may arise.  The Minister could have reinvigorated the Constitutional Convention or a similar forum to properly ventilate all the issues, explore unintended consequences and then come up with a formula of words that would protect our water.</p><p>This issue is being made very complicated when, in fact, it is very simple.  Senator Bradford made a very good contribution earlier when he essentially said the same.  There is no point in any of us here pretending and codding ourselves, because nobody outside this House believes the Government.  There is no point in any Independent Senator pretending that, if we pass this Bill today, the concerns people have about privatisation are gone.  The people are not silly.  The Minister has just conceded that all it would take is a repeal of this section and it is gone.  It is all hocus-pocus.</p></speech>

When a service is provided free at the point of delivery, funded by progressive taxation, it cannot be privatised, as there is no incentive for anyone to buy it.  Once charging starts - once water is commodified - in time, the dynamic changes.  That is when the political approach will also change, with huge pressure brought to bear.  Then we will hear that we need competition and it is a slippery slope.  We have seen this in all the countries that have introduced water charges.  One only has to look at Britain, where water services have been privatised because the concept of charges was introduced.</p><p>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien is right that the Minister will no longer be a Minister in two years&rsquo; time.  </p></speech>

However, they cannot legislate for what any future Government might do.  What Senator Marie-Louise O&rsquo;Donnell and Independent and Labour Party Senators wanted when they voted for the motion some time ago was a constitutional referendum on the ownership of Irish Water.  We are not getting that, however.  It does to matter what the Minister says.  All the fighting talk from the Minister means nothing if a future Government just tears this Bill up.</p><p>The amendment does not propose a constitutional referendum.

Public life could do with much more of that.  I could see the passion he had in expressing his position on changes in the ownership of the water of Ireland in the future, but I remind him that the archives of current affairs programmes are littered with pronouncements like that.  People, through no fault of their own - they can do nothing about it - cannot live up to them, and subsequently one finds them being used very often in a method of ridicule with which I do not agree.  Very often, through ridicule, they are being shown in a context.</p><p>The Minister confirmed what we all believe, which is the most important thing of all: that the plebiscite, when enshrined in legislation, can be changed by any future Government through amendment.  That is the bottom line we are dealing with.  There is a degree of histrionics about using Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann and holding it aloft.  I accept the Minister's credentials and that he has done and will continue to do, what is correct and right as a Minister.  However, while we all accept there is a degree of sacredness about that document and sometimes it does put an end to a discussion, the article the Minister read out would tell me that, even if there is some indication within the Bunreacht that the people of Ireland already own the water.  One could extend that argument quite easily legally.  One elects people to do whatever is required and that ownership by extension is handed over to the people.  The Minister might be overly idealistic, if he does not mind me saying so, not to be able to imagine any Government doing what the people do not want.  There was an Irish statesman one time who said that when he wanted to know what the Irish people wanted he looked into his own heart. </p></speech>

If the Minister looks into his own heart, which I am sure he is doing regularly, he knows that people do not want a cosmetic exercise.  The anger, the suspicions and the lack of trust are real.  Senator John Crown made the point yesterday that we are not talking about any single lobby group.  We are talking about the middle ground.  We are not talking about extreme lefts or rights or anything else.  Senator Cullinane and I know it in Tipperary as we listen.</p><p>That is why the debate on Senator Barrett's amendment is so important.  We cannot argue for a constitutional referendum, but surely given the logic of what he is suggesting, even if it is only to shore up the plebiscite and subsequent legislation in a minimalist way, the Minister would have to accept what he has put forward.  I do not hear much party politics at all, in this Chamber, bu&iacute;ochas m&oacute;r le Dia, but I must say this: if the Minister had heard what we were saying on the plebiscite and admits the weakness of that plebiscite and its supporting legislation, surely he would be very pleased to go back to the Cabinet and to the drawing board and take what is being put forward.  The fact that this is not the case and he is not open to doing that is worrying and adds to the lack of trust and the suspicion that is out there at the moment.</p><p>I have no doubts about the Minister's credentials.  I do not know how he took on the task.  The Government has an unenviable job to do.  I must say that.  We all want pure water.  We also want to ensure the availability of that water and its conservation.  We must pay for it.  None of these are the issue here.  The methodology that has been used from the first time that legislation came into the D&aacute;il has been the problem.  If there is one lesson I have learned from the people of Ireland, it is that they are quite astute.  They listen very carefully.  They took their time on protesting, but now they begin to realise that whatever is put before us now must be questioned because there is a possibility that in a very short time, even under a new Government, we will be back here debating this again.  The bottom line must be that the plebiscite is minimalist at best.  The constitutional situation must be looked at very clearly, but I do not at all accept that we should balk at the idea of harvesting the view and the sentiments of the public because it is difficult, or that we are not capable as legislators, with all the legal advice and help that we have.</p><p>What do we say to the people?  The Minister tends to intimate that a constitutional referendum is a good idea, but that as a democratic, sovereign, independent state, we are not capable of harvesting that sentiment and that requirement.  I do not believe he meant it like that, but that is how I heard it and that worries me as well.  That is why we are here as legislators - to pool our expertise, our intelligence and our experience on the ground, to reflect the views of the public and to use every agency at our disposal to do what the people want.  I hope the Celtic tiger has not taken that tenacity from the Irish character.  I do not believe it has.  I believe it is still possible to capture what the people want and enshrine it in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann and then to debate ends at that stage.</p></speech>

What Irish Government would take us into war?  What Irish Government would have us involved in conscription?  We changed the Constitution in order to allay the fears of the Irish people in that regard.  We introduced the triple lock under the United Nations mandate, and approval of the D&aacute;il and this House is required before we enter into EU defence mechanisms.  This is normal.  The law of unintended consequences is not a law.  In fact, many of the consequences of the Eighth Amendment - I support the Eighth Amendment - were outlined in the D&aacute;il and Seanad debates at the time and are available to be read.  Some of the issues that arose as a result of that amendment were predicted.  They were not all unintended consequences.  People opposed it and were cautious about that amendment.  It is well known that there were changes to the amendment and that the Government had concerns, both in the Fianna F&aacute;il party and in the Fine Gael party at the time.  If the law of unintended consequences is now considered by the Government as a reason for not amending the Constitution, then we would never have a Constitution in the first place and nothing would ever be changed in case someone would interpret it differently in the future.  As a Legislature all we can do is to do our best to encapsulate the values which are permanent and unchangeable except with the consent of the people.  This section does not do this.  The more I read the section, the more I regard it as minimalist - as Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; said - because it only talks about the alienation of shares in Irish Water; it does not talk about the sale, lease, letting or licensing of those shares or of the business or assets of Irish Water.  As I said previously, the national lottery was effectively privatised by simply issuing a licence to a private company to operate it.  Who would have imagined, in the Labour Party of the 1980s - which was in government with Fine Gael and which established the national lottery at the end of its term - that a private company would be asked to run it and to take the profits from it?  The then Minister - it may have been Barry Desmond, but I cannot remember, as I was only a child at the time, like the Minister, Deputy Kelly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey - who introduced the national lottery, had he been faced with Senator O'Donnell, as someone who has expressed trenchant views about the privatisation of the lottery, would have given the same answer that the Minister, Deputy Kelly, gave, which is "Who could have imagined it?".  The issue of the national lottery is not an issue of principle for me, as it is for Senator O'Donnell, but she is entitled to her view and she has expressed it eloquently.  She would have been given the same answer at the time by the then Minister, which was "What Irish Government would do this?", but 30 years later it was done.  I have no particular difficulty on that issue.  However, we are looking at 30 and 40 years down the road.  We are looking at those values that set us apart as a society, the values we hold dear.</p><p>The minimum change I am looking for, which does not really change the substance of it, is to have the water forum at least discuss this issue and bring forward recommendations to the Minister and for the Minister to report back.  This is the proposal in my amendment.  I ask the Government to consider my amendment.  At the very least, it gives the forum a substantial job to do, and there is a precedent in the Constitutional Convention.</p></speech>

It is very ungenerous, in particular, of my Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues, not to afford the same sincerity to the Minister.  Senator Cullinane said it was easy for the Minister.

Here in this House some time ago we voted in favour of holding a referendum.  I voted in favour.  I thought it was a good idea at the time.  We discussed this matter long and hard in the Labour Party and with the Minister and his officials.  Having explored the possibility of holding a referendum, it turns out that it is not the simple thing I, for one, thought it to be at the time.  There are many unintended consequences, as the Minister said.  For instance, there is the question of pipes going through private land or privately owned treatment plants or water pumps, which leads to a discussion on the rights of private property, which in this country are held very dear.  If it was agreed to have a referendum and that referendum was not passed - it may be an outrageous suggestion, but who would have thought a year ago that the Seanad would not be abolished?

What if that were to be the future scenario?  These are some of the dangers and risks and challenges that face us if we go to the Constitution to secure the rights of something.  I refer to the rights under the Eighth Amendment and the absolute mess that has caused.  It is the most divisive thing in Irish society - perhaps not now, but it has been in the past.  Although it was flagged that there were problems associated with it, it was well-meaning, but it has caused huge division and controversy in Irish society over the years.</p><p>During a debate on the Order of Business some time ago, I thought it would be an easy thing to support a referendum to change the Constitution in order to support the public ownership of Irish Water.  While we are all in favour of public ownership of Irish Water, in my view, a referendum is not the way to go.  It is a basic tenet of democracy that no government can legislatively bind its successor, but we have to have some confidence in our politicians and in the electorate who vote for them, to say that they will take the decisions in the best interests of the Irish people.  </p><p>There is one further guarantee we could get.  Senator Cullinane and others say that the Labour Party and Fine Gael will not be in government next time.  Will Irish Water be sold in the next 18 months?  What about the boys on the other side?  God help us if they get into government.  Why do they not give a commitment in a programme for Government that the very first thing-----</p></speech>

Would there be anything left in the economy within 12 months if both of those parties were in power together?  A referendum certainly seemed a good idea to me when we were voting here two months ago or six weeks ago.</p> <p>However, when we reflected on the intricacies and logistics of holding a referendum that would achieve the objective everyone hopes would be achieved, it was not as simple as it appeared.  As well as considering practical options in this regard, the Minister has explored this option; the Attorney General has given legal advice, while the officials have given practical advice, which shows that it is not the simple option being proposed.  That is all I wish to say, except that, of course, I support section 2 and believe that while holding a plebiscite is not ideal, it is as far as the Government can move on the issue.</p></speech>

I am delighted its members have doubts about the way in which the wording of a constitutional amendment might be brought forward because the example of what happened with the eighth amendment to the Constitution demonstrates how much a job can be made of this.  I have never viewed the Constitution as a place in which to deal with certain issues, as it is too cumbersome.  However, on the issue of property, property rights and, in particular, the right of the people of Ireland to own their own water, it is not too cumbersome for it and I have not heard an argument to support that view.</p><p>My colleague, Senator Thomas Byrne, recently observed that there was nothing to stop the new company from licensing its services.  There is nothing to prevent it from bringing in a subcontractor for the production of water.  There is nothing to stop it from introducing a subcontractor for the maintenance of the country's water infrastructure.</p></speech>

If such a subcontractor fails in its job, we will not have water services.  Consequently, I am not at all satisfied with the manner in which things are going.  </p><p>My colleague, Senator David Cullinane, asked for the withdrawal of section 2 in its entirety and that is not a bad idea.  Let Members get rid of the plebiscite proposal totally and return the Bill to the D&aacute;il.  Before it proceeds any further, Members should instigate or initiate a Bill for the holding of a referendum on the ownership of Irish Water.  I reiterate that the expertise to do this already resides within the Government which suggests a plebiscite would protect us.  Were the European Union to decide at some stage that competition law was not being met with respect to the ownership of Irish Water, would it protect us?  Can the Minister guarantee that the European Union will not, at some point in the future, use competition law to force this country to sell off part or all of Irish Water or the company to have a subsidiary private company to produce water or to have private companies maintain the water supply?  While the Minister argues that this cannot happen, I refer to the Lisbon treaty, the Lisbon 2 treaty and all of the other re-runs during the years and I am not at all satisfied.  In fairness to the Minister of State and his senior ministerial colleague, they are trying desperately hard in a desperately hard situation.  At this point, I compliment the Members on the Government side who took an extremely difficult decision to support section 2 yesterday, as did a number of Independent Members, who have received the most horrendous backlash for their vote yesterday.  That is unfair because people do what they believe is right.  Members must acknowledge this and one must admire them for doing so.</p><p>I constantly hear about how no Government ever will do this or that.  The only thing of which one can be sure and certain is the moment or second in which one is living.  In two seconds time I could be dead, as could anybody in the Chamber.  It is possible that in one year's time, no political party currently represented in the Chamber will be in government.  Members must protect the system of water in public ownership and enshrine this in the Constitution.  That is the only way in which they can be sure it will happen.  I again tell the Minister of State that the Government must stop.  It has already angered the entire population, including ordinary, decent people who would never take to the streets and never get involved in any protest.  The Government has angered them to the point where they are turning out in their tens of thousands at the drop of a hat.  This is only going to get worse and the Government should move to try to appease them by dealing with some of the problems.  The easiest way to do this would be to enshrine this in the Constitution.  At this point, I have not received an answer from the Minister of State that would satisfy me on any issue Members have raised and perhaps he might have a sos.  He should go outside to have a chat and find a way to answer these questions.</p></speech>

A common theme throughout the Committee Stage debate on this section and the amendments and throughout the entire debate is trust.  As Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; has referred to this issue in some detail, I will not go over old ground.  However, the overwhelming majority of the more than 4,000 e-mails I have received in recent days about this issue were certainly about whether the Government could be trusted not to privatise Irish Water.  Essentially, I suggest this is at the core of all of the arguments being made in respect of the holding of a constitutional referendum.  While listening to Senator Gerard P. Craughwell and after talking to Senator Thomas Byrne, I could not help but reflect on the various State utilities that had been created since the foundation of the State.  Since Ireland joined the European Union, nearly all of them have been deregulated.  The European Union, effectively, has forced Ireland to deregulate in the telecommunications sector and I was in the House for the debate on the legislation which was passed to deregulate it.  Similarly, the electricity sector has been deregulated to a large degree.  What is there to say about Irish Water in the future?  It, unquestionably, will be successful or else it will disappear and go into bankruptcy and neither the Government nor a Government of similar ideology would allow this to happen.  What would be the scenario were the European Union to state Irish Water was anti-competitive or not compliant with anti-trust regulations and that, therefore, the Government must deregulate it and sell off some of its services?  I note that the Government decided to sell off elements of Bord G&aacute;is Energy to generate money.</p><p>Are Members on the Government side surprised that there should be such massive distrust and a disconnection between swathes of the people and the Government on this issue?  That is the message I am getting and it is sad because, in a way, it is a matter of some concern for Members as democrats on all sides of the House.  To put it in another way, a Government governs with the consent of the people and if it does not have that consent, democracy is in danger.  That is at the core of this issue and while it may sound somewhat melodramatic, the trends that have been developing in Irish society in the past year or two are a source of great concern.  Now that it is being reflected in a mass movement across the country - despite suggestions on the Government side of the House that it is being orchestrated by one particular grouping or ideology - it is a fact of life that the ordinary, common people of Ireland have come together and are united on this one issue.</p> <p>They do not believe the Government when it says it will not privatise Irish Water.  They might be prepared to give some concession to the current Government's promise not to privatise it but what about the future?  The same question arises in respect of charges.  They are being frozen until a certain date but what will happen after that?  This is all bound up with the banking debt which continues to hang over our heads.  The distrust began to emerge when people asked themselves how they ended up in a situation whereby their children will be responsible for paying off this money.  These issues have all come together under the heading of Irish Water but the distrust of the Government and even the democratic process grows from a wider base.  For this and other reasons, the Government should be alert to the dangers of going down the road of a plebiscite.  It seems to me the worst of all possible worlds.  As Senator Byrne and others have observed, it is meaningless because it will not address the concerns about privatisation.  I acknowledge that the Minister has come a long way in listening to the people but we are dealing with a huge movement on this issue.  In my entire career in public life, I have never before received so many communications on an issue as I have on this one.  Even the pro-life issue did not give rise to as many communications.  I have replied to people in my own constituency but it would be impossible to reply to everybody.  It is the same answer in many cases because I understand a certain website allowed people to use templates.  I also received replies to my own responses.  If it was a party motivated movement, it would be most unlikely that people would bother replying to me.</p><p>As has been pointed out time and again, the plebiscite is not going to resolve this distrust.  A disconnect between the people and their government is an extremely serious issue in any democracy.  I wish it were otherwise because I do not think it will reflect well on any of us as we head in to an election over the next 15 months.  We are already seeing the rise of Independents and independent issues.  There is nothing wrong with those who were elected to these House.  The people are sovereign.  They decide who will be elected.  However, people are elected not just because the single issues for which they stand but also due to a continuing disconnect with the mainstream parties.  I do not want to labour the argument but I am trying to give another view on the arguments against section 2 and the holding of a plebiscite.  The Government should pause and reflect on the outcome of this provision.</p><p>Senator Byrne gave the best example of what might happen when he cited to the triple lock introduced after the Nice referendum.  The Nice treaty had nothing whatsoever to do with militarism.  It was nothing more than a housekeeping exercise at European level.  I will argue that against all comers because I was actively involved in the campaign.  Somehow, a significant number of voters got it into their heads that there was a military dimension to the treaty and that their sons and daughters would be joining a European army.  Twelve years on, I have heard nothing about a European army.  At the time, however, I met mothers in my own town who genuinely believed their sons and daughters would be conscripted into a European army.  They voted against the treaty on that basis.  The Government was forced to reassure the people by vesting authority in the United Nations and the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That was the most controversial issue and, once it was addressed, the people accepted the treaty.  That is what I believe is going to happen with this plebiscite, and I urge the Government to withdraw this section and return to the drawing board.</p></speech>

Our future depends on what we do today about water.  I accept the assurances offered by the Minister and this Government that they will not privatise water but that is not the point.  The Minister will not be there forever.  Any measure we put into the Statute Book should be strong enough to prevent unintended consequences in the future.  Given that legislation can always be changed, the only way to prevent privatisation is by offering the Irish people an opportunity to put it into the Constitution.  We are all saying the same thing but what problem are we trying to solve?  Water and its sources should remain in public ownership and in the hands of Irish people in perpetuity.  We all agree that is what we want to achieve but we disagree about the best way to achieve it.</p><p>At times like this, it is a pity that we did not have political reform.  The whip should have been lifted because I am sure a number of Fine Gael and Labour Party Senators who do not want to introduce any sort of risk of privatising water into our Statute Book.  We are leaving the door open to privatisation.  Senator Gilroy put forward valid arguments about how we would handle water passing through private property but Senator Craughwell observed that we have already addressed this issue with gas lines.  What about European competition law?  Senator Heffernan outlined interesting figures yesterday which revealed that after the grants and subventions to Irish Water, its revenue would be &euro;60 million per annum even if everyone signed up.  What infrastructure would that fund?  If only 50% pay, Irish Water will be in the red.  If Irish Water is in the red, it definitely will be open to privatisation.  Please think again.  All we are trying to do is protect water as a resource, as well as its sources, including Lough Corrib, the River Shannon and lakes in the midlands.  Why would we leave even the slightest doubt that they could be taken over?</p></speech>

Unfortunately I was unable to speak on Second Stage and I do not intend to make a Second Stage speech now.  Issues have been raised include the unintended consequences and the provisions of our Constitution.  The Constitution is not cast iron that can never be changed.</p> <p>The Constitution is not a cast-iron thing set in stone that can never be changed.  So many things have changed in the 78 year period since 1937.  I will not go into the history, but at that time about 60% of the Irish economy was based on agriculture.  That has totally turned on its head.  Another simple point is that at that time, according to statistics and figures, 3% of the children of this nation were born outside wedlock.  That is well over 30% now.  Somebody mentioned the unintended consequences of enshrining the right to water in our Constitution.  I see no difficulty whatsoever in doing that.  I have been listening as carefully as I can to the debate and I respect what the various people say.  Somebody referred to the right to property, which is enshrined in our Constitution.  Maybe there should be a rethink of that.  </p><p>I was chairman of a committee on the Constitution which, to make it as broad as possible, we enlarged to 16 members.  I requested the then Taoiseach, former Deputy Bertie Ahern, to do that in order to be inclusive.  We brought in an Independent Member of the Oireachtas, a member of the Green Party and a member of Sinn F&eacute;in.  My colleague up in County Louth was on that committee just to have it all-inclusive.  The man who was our advisor at that time was probably the greatest exponent of constitutional rights and knowledge in this country, Mr. Justice Gerard Hogan.  It is being seen here as impossible to enshrine the right to water in the Constitution.  I have heard Mr. Justice Hogan and other constitutional experts say that maybe we should expand and look again at the Kenny report.  </p><p>The right to property was watered down in a local government Act which allowed for social housing needs.  Maybe we should think outside the box.  What about the right to shelter and housing?  We should not be buried in the back of what cannot be done, but should look at what can be done.  We had a big debate recently on homelessness when somebody died close to this House.  We should be looking outside the box and seeing how we can make our Constitution more appropriate for 2027 rather than 1937.  The Minister of State should stand back, have a referendum in April or May, and instead of the potential of this Bill kicking in on 1 January or 1 February, it can be put back to 1 June or 1 July.  Then we can put this thing to bed for once and for all.</p></speech>

We even looked at an example as well as a corollary in the notion - which I still think is necessary for this city - of providing an underground train from the city centre out to the airport.  In doing that we looked at every person who has a house, a barn or a commercial building from here to the airport.  Every person who owns a piece of property owns the land right down to the core of the earth and the air up into the sky as far as possible, even going down 5,000 feet.  We looked at the possibility that, like in Spain and other countries, the amount of territory under the house that is part of the property - subject to doing no structural damage - should be no more than ten metres.  All these possibilities can be done.</p><p>It is not my style to be in any way derogatory against the Minister, Deputy Kelly, or the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, but I must put on record that this provision in the Bill about a plebiscite, however well meant, is a political manoeuvre.  It is intended to indicate to the thousands of people that have not alone e-mailed and phoned us but have come out and marched.  That is probably 250,000 people altogether, the biggest movement since Daniel O'Connell back a couple of hundred years ago.  By ignoring that the Government is saying look, this is going to satisfy them,  it has already been seen to.  The Government is under the impression that by putting this section 2 into new legislation it will ease the minds of lots of people.  I think it is disingenuous and that the Government should go back.  This was not agreed by the D&aacute;il, it was agreed because the guillotine was used.  It was forced on the D&aacute;il; Members had to come in and the Whip was cracked.  As a member of a party I know that feels and I know how it feels to break it as well.</p></speech>

Which is more important?  We have a right to support, so that our houses do not fall down.  We must remember why the right to property was devised in our Constitution.  It was to support the landed gentry, the settlers and the rich people.  How many people in the street in Dublin have nothing at all to their name?  Look at the people in mortgage difficulties at the minute, and banks repossessing, what have those people to their name only headaches, problems and stress?</p><p>I sincerely ask the Government to go back and defer this, it is not going to kill off the Bill.  I am not going to go into the amount of money involved, the amount of the charges, the propriety of Irish Water or the catastrophe in setting it up and how badly it has been handled - probably disastrously handled - for the last months.  I think we should step back from the brink and bring the proposal through the D&aacute;il for a referendum.  There are already suggestions from a number of Ministers - maybe the Cabinet is not agreed on it - that there will be a multiplicity of referenda held possibly in April or May.  This could also be incorporated into that.</p></speech>

I am supporting Senator Barrett's amendment because there are all sorts of possibilities out there.  As we saw in the referendum to abolish the Seanad, the public are no fools.  I personally thought that would succeed but they were put to the vote and they decided listen, we cannot trust the boys in the lower House.  We want another House to keep an eye on what is going on.  We are here to act as a hand brake to the system.  For anybody out there to think there is a promise of a plebiscite in legislation, however sincerely meant, whenever a Government comes in of whatever hue or colour in ten or 15 years, by one simple debate in the D&aacute;il and Seanad they can, as Senator Byrne suggested, have that section deleted in two sitting days.  That is important to put on the record.</p><p>If we really want to put the status of the Senate in a better place - maybe we are there already - we should be seriously looking.  It is something I said 15 years ago in this House about upgrading our Constitution.  The 1937 Constitution with all due respect is not fit for 1917 or 1916.  We are in a different society for many reasons.</p></speech>

My apologies.  I think we should enshrine the right to water in the referendum and I am asking that, if Senator Barrett's amendment is not accepted or agreed to by Government side, we defer this Bill.</p> <p>I am so far away from my little abode in west Cork that I might as well stay here tomorrow, Sunday, if it is possible, and Monday and Tuesday.  <br/>If we want to deliver proper legislation and if we are to be honest with ourselves, look into our hearts and be honest with the people who are marching - people who cannot afford to pay mortgages and who cannot have a happy Christmas because they have nothing in their pockets - we should be here, and say, with regard to this notion of having a promised plebiscite on legislation, that it is pie in the sky.  Let us step back from the brink, and this legislation can kick in on 1 June next year.<br/>This legislation has been held up for over 12 months.  The reason it was held up for over 12 months is we have lengthy debates.  I spoke <i>ad nauseum</i>in this House when the Bill was introduced before Christmas and, to be honest about it, at least the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, his colleagues who have been here and the Minister, Deputy Kelly, are listening.  They are engaging with us.  I remember comments made by Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill.  The chickens have come home to roost.  We were not listened to, like a hoo ha.  They thought what of the Senate.  It will be gone next year.  We are going to abolish it; now we will move into the D&aacute;il, the real Chamber.  The Taoiseach got a wallop.  If this matter is not sorted out properly - I am not getting into the ratio about charges or their propriety - the greatest wallop of all is going to come.  I have got wallops myself politically on many occasions, from my own crowd and from the people.  The greatest wallop of all is going to come, but the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste are not prepared for it.  This will not go away.  I am saying they should step back from the brink.  The Government should either accept Senator Barrett's very genuine amendment or alternatively defer this issue and have the referendum in the spring of next year.</p></speech>

I do not wish to produce the same speech that I had prepared but there are two points I would like to get across while speaking to the amendment.</p><p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, back to the House.  Many people have said that he and the senior Minister, Deputy Kelly, have inherited an almighty mess and they are doing the best they can to straighten it out.  I sometimes feel I can almost hear and see Commissioner Hogan over in Brussels, as he moves onwards and upwards, chuckling at the dilemma he created for them and the mischievous smile he must have on his face.  That is the way things are and the whole thing has been one hell of a hames from start to finish.  There was a lot of controversy and hoo-ha, when Fianna F&aacute;il was in government, at the time of the voting machines.  It turned out to be a costly error.  I remember the Fine Gael speakers at the time being particularly scathing.  That is a hill of beans compared to this particular situation we are in now.</p><p>There is no doubt about it; the people have spoken.  They have spoken in a new way.  There is a new type of politics in the country.  They are no longer speaking through their D&aacute;il representatives.  They are speaking with their feet and with their placards.  To a certain extent, democracy in practice is always to be welcomed.  However, I have to temper that by saying that I believe that parliamentary democracy is supreme and shall always be supreme.  </p><p>I seem to have cleared out all my own benches here.</p><p>Some of the activities of the protesters - including some of the TDs, who have the unique privilege of being in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to make their point on behalf of constituents but who seem to prefer to leave the precincts of the House and to go to some place with a megaphone under an oxter----- </p></speech>

It is late in the year and we have had quite a lot of debate on the airwaves, on the television and in the national print, and it was morning, noon and night.  I was just making the point about the new type of democracy we are seeing in Ireland.  It is a new phenomenon.  It is interesting in one way and it is worrying in another.  If parliamentary democracy fails the people, the people will find a way of getting their point of view across.  We saw some very unpleasant events.  I think I was the first Opposition spokesperson in either of the Houses to condemn the disgraceful behaviour and manner in which the T&aacute;naiste was treated in Jobstown, and also the Taoiseach in the same week.  It is a sad day, if that will be tolerated, particularly where it is tolerated and almost condoned by elected Members of the Lower House.  This is something we have to worry about.</p></speech>

De Valera was giving the final speech on behalf of the then Opposition.  People were expecting a big long Churchillian kind of a speech from Dev and all he said was, "I think we have heard enough".  People have heard enough from us.  They have spoken first.  The question is whether the Government has heard the message.  Has the Taoiseach and his Cabinet finally got the message that the people are giving them?  Have they come up with the right solution?  I have said it before and I concede that they have made the best fist they could of it.  One cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.  Senator Barrett's amendment has great merit in it.  It would help to allay the genuine concerns of the public.  At the end of the day, they will have the final say if there is to be a constitutional referendum.  That would be seen as a safeguard and would answer the worries people have that the political system currently is failing them.</p> <p> The provision of water services, historically, has been a bit of a mess, and I acknowledge it did not start with this Government.  I was a shopkeeper for many years in the provincial town of Listowel, County Kerry, and I had to pay water rates although I had barely a washbasin in the premises, as I lived in my private home.  There were families with seven and eight children four or five doors down the street and they were using what water there was in the country and not paying anything for it.  There was every kind chicanery going on, with people piping water from one person's supply to their own supply in order to escape payment.  Clearly, madness has prevailed in the water services area for a long time.  At least this Bill is attempting to put some shape on things, but it is not perfect.  I call on the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, a former great colleague of ours, and the Minister, Deputy Kelly, to find some way of answering the genuine fears of the people.</p><p>The only reason I would consider voting for this Bill - although I cannot and will not vote for it - is that I am not happy with the activities of some of those who are most violently opposed to it.  Reference was made to the way our communications system has been held up over the last week, with Members getting an average of 200, 300 or 400 e-mails per day on their iPhones and other systems.</p></speech>

He read from Article 10.1 of the Constitution and implied that water was already protected in the Constitution when he stated: "All natural resources, including the air and all forms of potential energy ... belong to the State," but he stopped reading at that point.  What he did not say was the phrase, also in the same article, "subject to all estates and interests therein for the time being lawfully vested in any person or body".  Article 10.3 states: "Provision may be made by law for the management of the property which belongs to the State by virtue of this Article and for the control of the alienation, whether temporary or permanent, of that property."  The Constitution clearly envisages that the State has the power to alienate and to sell the natural resources, and that has happened.  If that article were taken to mean what the Minister has interpreted it to mean, wind farms would not be allowed to operate, the Tara Mines would be in State control, and so on.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-12-19a.361" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1116" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014121900029#DD01000"><p>The ESB is in State control, but there but there are also private generators of energy and private extractors of natural resources throughout the country, and that is as it should be.  It was a bit disingenuous of the Minister to read partially from Article 10 of the Constitution.  He said that we all know what is in Article 10 without reading the entirety of it.  What is needed is an amendment to Article 10 of the Constitution which would protect Irish Water.</p><p>The Minister and Senator Gilroy also made great play of property rights.  Of course, property rights are not absolute, but they made an issue of wayleaves and pipework going through private land and how that would affect us.  In fact, Irish Water - it was the local authorities previously - owns the sewerage pipes.  The private landowner does not.  It has a wayleave or a right of way through that land.  These are the rights we want to protect in public ownership, the rights we do not want sold to the highest bidder and the rights we do not want somebody in the private sector to be able put a toll on to allow sewage to go through or water to flow to people's houses.  Those pipes are not in private ownership; they are already subject to the rights that Irish Water has.  That argument about property rights is bogus.  It is the property and assets of Irish Water that we want to protect, not just the shares in the company that is Irish Water, for which the Act provides.  It is the assets - the pipes, the treatment plants and access to people's homes - that we do not want sold.  That is what we do not want to happen.  This section does not provide for that in any way.  It is a minimalist approach.</p><p>The Minister spoke about the difficulties and possibilities presented by referendums and the reasons we should not hold a referendum, but these reasons would also apply to the holding of a plebiscite.  It would be exactly the same, except that at least with a referendum something is put into the Constitution.  Those are the points to which I wanted to respond.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-12-19a.362" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1148" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014121900029#DD01100"><p>I  want to make a point briefly because I have already spoken on Second Stage on this topic, and we have been speaking on this for some time.  Clearly, the idea of enshrining in law the principle of public ownership of Irish Water is hugely attractive to all of us, and we are all on the same side on this in this House.  It is a question of how it is best done.  Like others, I had another look at this following our discussion in the House on the constitutional idea.  It is attractive until one starts to look at the complexity of the wording and how we would construct a wording that does what we all want without having any other unforeseen implications.  We spoke before about the difficulty with a constitutional referendum.  The big contrast between that and a plebiscite is that we are inserting a wording into a constitutional text that is there until further amendment.  We want to ensure that there is a popular vote before any government can seek to sell off any aspect of Irish Water in the future, and that is what a plebiscite would do.  I am convinced that is enough.  No government would bring in nuclear power, because the people spoke on that.  The clear groundswell of support for public ownership of Irish Water is so overwhelming that no government would contemplate changing or privatising that, and a plebiscite is a way of copperfastening and safeguarding that through a double resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas and a popular vote.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-12-19a.363" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1123" speakername="Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014121900029#DD01200"><p>I wish to pick up on what Senator Byrne said, because it was a valid point.  An element of confusion was brought into the debate by the Minister in regard to property rights and the law of unintended consequences.  Senator O'Donovan pointed out that there is no such law, because it does not exist legally.  It is merely a knock-on effect, an externality, or an inefficiency of a property right.  Therefore, the property rights issue is a separate element entirely.  It is not linked to this issue.  The only property rights in question here were those outlined by Senator Byrne - that is, the rights associated with the infrastructure, land and networks that have been transferred to Irish Water.  For example, in my county, assets worth &euro;155 million were transferred from public ownership to Irish Water overnight on 1 January this year.  Those are the property rights about which we should be concerned - the vast array of the public drinking water network, together with all the treatment facilities and all the sewerage infrastructure, which have been transferred to Irish Water.  If Irish Water had not been established we would not even be having this debate on the section.  It would be irrelevant, because the water system would be held within the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government or the local authorities and it would be within the control of public representatives.  A public monopoly is being established with rights over the control of our water supply, and decision-making is being centralised away from the local authorities, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Houses of the Oireachtas and into an agency, which is being provided with all the infrastructure to supply the network of water to every premises in the country.  That is what is in question here.</p><p>What is being provided for in the legislation is extremely weak.  A plebiscite is not worth the paper it is written on.  It is only one of the options available under the proposed legislation.  The other option is a simple resolution of D&aacute;il and Seanad &Eacute;ireann, and the equity stake in the company that is Irish Water could be transferred to any private stakeholder or stakeholders who wish to invest.  We know that, inevitably, that is what will emerge down the road.</p> <p>We can dream that the realm of politics does not work that way but I do not believe that.  If an outside investor with serious bang for his buck is willing to provide billions of euro I do not believe that a future Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government will resist, particularly if an election is coming and the Government is struggling.  It might be different if the money was used for something beneficial to the country.  This applies irrespective of party allegiance and that future Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government could represent my party.  We all know what would happen if this outside investor approached, given the party system; the Whip would be enforced, backbenchers would be silenced and the Minister would get his way.  In these circumstances private sector rent-seeking behaviour would take control and we saw what happened with the bank guarantee.</p><p>I agree with what my Sinn F&eacute;in colleague said on the bank guarantee because it was disgraceful but I think it will happen due to this legislation too.  At the time of the bank guarantee outsiders had more information than the regulators, the Minister for Finance and the Department of Finance officials so those outsiders called the shots and got their way.  The same will happen with this legislation.  I will not name the outsiders in this matter, though I suspect their names are on every Senator's lips, because those outsiders will come at this issue with the best legal financial, economic and financial brains in their corner and run rings around the system.  Politics, Government and decision making would be captured by these outsiders.  I am not blaming any political party in Government or in Opposition but I have set out the future if this legislation proceeds.  We should not put our water network infrastructure in a position from which it might be captured in the manner I have outlined.  At the end of the day, money talks and finance walks - that is what is at stake.</p><p>I could go on and on but the Minister, Deputy Kelly, and the Department give me the feeling they are unwilling to examine this.  The referendum has been ruled out but why not disband Irish Water before it gets going?  Establishing a public monopoly that is not fit for purpose, like Irish Water, is a bad decision and I base this observation on the fact that it has squandered so much money to date.  Some &euro;200 million of taxpayers' money has been spent on consultants and legal experts to replicate a structure that exists in other jurisdictions.  The referendum would at least enshrine in the Constitution the human right to water, as defined by the UN.  We must see that the right to water is enshrined in the Constitution so it cannot be sold for private gain and if we do not do so I believe Irish Water will be sold at some point in the future.  It could be sold partially or wholly but, ultimately, elements of it will be sold because private equity investment will be required to fund infrastructure.  It seems the Government is hell-bent on not providing funding for infrastructure, as evidenced in the recent announcement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-12-19a.365" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1159" speakername="Mark Daly" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014121900030#EE00200"><p>Like my colleagues, I am concerned about the tokenism of the plebiscite provision and the fact that it does not address the real issues raised by people around the country on the provision of water.  I do not believe the assurances on infrastructure not being sold are sufficient because, when it comes to the privatisation of Irish Water, the money will not be made in the infrastructure.  As is the case now with providers of electricity and gas, money will be made through the provision of the service.  The Government wants to call the people using the service customers, rather than citizens.  The provision of water could be regionalised under privatisation.  The privatisation of infrastructure is a different issue as that mistake was made with Eircom but an imaginative financial institution could approach a future Government on the issue of the right to bill customers and offer to do it better.  That institution could offer to provide water more cheaply and take responsibility away from the Government.  I am sure there would be a tendering process but, as evidenced with broadband provision, the least economically viable areas would get the poorest service.  This is already evident in how water is provided in rural areas where communities must provide their own water using their own methods.<br/>The wording of the plebiscite pledge and the Government's reluctance to guarantee a constitutional referendum on the matter concern me.  The right to water is the most basic right and a plebiscite on this matter is merely tokenism of the highest order and a reaction to an outcry by the people on the Government's lack of trustworthiness.  The plebiscite offer is clear evidence that the Government cannot be trusted because, as I read into the record previously, in June 2010 the former leader of the Labour Party said water is a right.  He did not believe it should be metered, that there should be a flat fee or that people should pay for it.  For the record, I will read the exact quote from Deputy Eamon Gilmore in the <i>Irish Examiner </i>of 28 June 2010.<blockquote>I am against water charging.  Water is a necessity.  I have always believed essential services like water should be delivered as a public service.  A flat household charge would be unfair.  It does not discriminate between houses with five bedrooms and those with none and metering is unworkable.</blockquote>Why should people believe a plebiscite would be held on the sale of shares in Irish Water, though shares are part of the assets of Irish Water?  Inventive financial engineering of the kind evident on Wall Street, around the world and here in Ireland, which created the financial catastrophe, would be invoked to manipulate Irish Water in selling off its customers to private equity investment companies.  Those companies would reap the benefit of Ireland's water infrastructure because one need not own the infrastructure.  Owning infrastructure is a liability and having the ability to collect the money is the real asset.</p></speech>

The lack of will in the Government to ensure not only public ownership of the infrastructure but also of those who would be billed is why the amendment is required.  Not having it in the Constitution leaves open the sale of Irish Water and the people being billed to third parties.</p><p>Deputy Eamon Gilmore made his famous statement that he did not believe in flat charging or metering, and that he believed it was a public service.  All we are trying to do is give fruition to his beliefs and to the beliefs of the Labour Party.  However, it seems that if it does not like those principles it has others.  The biggest problem for many people with regard to the billing and the &euro;3 a week for water charges is they simply cannot pay it.  A referendum will be held in May so there would be no charge to the Government to include another issue on the ballot paper with regard to Irish Water.  It would give people genuine assurances, as opposed to words and the promises of leaders of political parties in the run-up to an election that it is an essential public service which they do not believe should be privatised.  Deputy Rabbitte made a famous comment about making promises at election time.  All that really counts-----</p></speech>

We will have a plebiscite, which is unheard of in the history of the State, as opposed to having water as a right and a guarantee to the citizen.  We believe this should be enshrined in the Constitution and should be included in the referenda to be held next year.  It would give assurance to people no matter what Government is in place or who is in charge.</p><p>The problem with the wording on shares is that it is possible to have subsections of shares, and assets, infrastructure, companies and sub-companies can be manoeuvred.  Subsidiaries of Uisce &Eacute;ireann could be moved, as could customer billing, and legal people would be able to argue Irish Water was not actually sold.  This could well be the case as a technical point of the law.  People want to be assured the State will maintain control over all aspects, from the provision of water to customer billing, if the Bill is passed.  All that people can really believe with regard to what is being said about Irish Water is what is written in the legislation, and not what is being promised in speeches in this House and other places, or what was being promised in advance.  The Government previously stated it was not possible to deal with ten different issues.  We were told these were absolutely impossible.  However, U-turns were made on all of them.</p> <p>There was a U-turn on the suspension of the charge.  A household benefit payment, a winter fuel allowance and tax credits on payments were introduced.  There was a replacement of the water conservation payment, a side-lining of the free allowance, an expansion of water application packs, the introduction of flat fee and the temporary abandonment of water meters and the bonus system for Irish Water.  We were all told this could not be done yet it was done.  The CER has been sidelined and now the Government is fixing pricing and not an extra cent in capital investment.  Now the Government is telling us that there is all the capital investment in the world.  When people see those U-turns and what the Government said could not be done being done, and when they were told that we could not have people having a say in Irish Water and the Government doing a half measure on a plebiscite, one needs to understand how people have no faith in the Government's assurances on the privatisation.  The wording and phraseology by Minsters is quite clear.  They talk about the infrastructure.  There is no money in the infrastructure.  The financial houses are looking at how they can maximise an investment on taking over the billing and that is where the money is.  There is no provision within Irish Water to stop that from happening because the U-turns that have happened in the past 12 months can happen again.  </p><p>As we know from plebiscites and the Constitution, the wording here can be interpreted in so many ways that it will not prevent them from retaining the infrastructure and at the same time, ensuring that the Government, which has abandoned Irish citizens and which says that it does not represent people who do not agree with it, cannot assure them that at some future date without a plebiscite or a constitutional amendment, it could not sell them down the Swanee and sell the billing rights under the great auspices and guise of the ever-demanding European search for the all-mighty euro and the belief that someone must make a profit at all times and that there should be competition.  On the altar of competition, we would then see many of the people that the Government has abandoned and turned into customers would then be required to pay not to Irish Water but to some third party which has won a competitive bid.</p><p>We see in rural Ireland how disastrous the provision by private entities has been when it comes to broadband.  I would imagine that in respect of our famous and much-lauded infrastructural improvements that the Government said could not happen but now there is capital investment in the water services, we would not see that happening.  We will never see a plebiscite but I can guarantee that at some future date because of the requirement for money and Europe's instructions, we might end up having to look at a situation where there will be four different providers of the service who do not own the infrastructure but who will end up billing the customers nonetheless.  In that case, the Government will say that it is within the legislation.  Therefore, the U-turn will go from ten to 11 and the Irish citizen, who is our main concern, will be no better off.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-12-19a.433" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1139" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014121900032#GG00200"><p>One of the fundamental flaws in this and one of the biggest concerns people have is the ownership of water and whether it can be sold on.  I heard the Minister say that no Government in its right mind would do this, that or the other.  I do not agree.  One can go back to the Minister of State's party and look at the NewERA document and the proposed establishment of the strategic investment bank which can be funded by the sale of State assets and the fact that this Government under a Labour Party Minister wanted to sell the harvesting rights for Coillte.  These things were done very recently.</p><p>In an earlier contribution, Senator Byrne outlined how the fact that people think that no Government in its right mind would declare war on anyone else does not mean that we say that we do not need to copper-fasten that in our Constitution because nobody would actually do it.  Ownership of water is a real and genuine concern.  Senators on Second Stage who rightly called for that and supported the motion calling for a referendum did so on a cross-party basis.  They were people from all parties and none with the exception of Fine Gael which supported that.  This is what people want.</p><p>The Minister said earlier today that effectively the Government would not do it because it is complex.  It is not that it cannot do it.  If one looks at the referendum that related to this very House over 12 months, one can see that it was an extremely complex referendum that the Taoiseach and Cabinet had officials working on the wording of that referendum for the guts of a year.  I believe over 70 amendments to the Constitution and Standing Orders would have been required to remove any reference to the Seanad.  That was an extremely complex referendum to put together yet the Government did it because it wanted to do it.  In this instance, where the people overwhelmingly want the Government to have a referendum to ensure that Irish Water cannot be sold or privatised in future, the Government will not do it.  It is not that it cannot do it; it simply will not do it.  I do not accept some of the comments from Labour Party Senators earlier who effectively said while they supported the motion that was within the House, they went back, studied it and were effectively told that it was not possible.  </p></speech>

The Senators thought it was not necessary.  Why was it necessary only a matter of weeks ago but it is not necessary now?  My opinion as to why it is believed that it is not necessary is because within the Labour Party, the party leader and T&aacute;naiste in discussions with Ministers at Cabinet, told Labour Party Members that this was causing too much difficulty, that they had to toe the Fine Gael line on this and that there would be a halfway house whereby the Government would promise some type of plebiscite.  The Minister openly acknowledged, and I welcome the fact that he did, that this piece of legislation can be just changed, as we all know.  Nothing is tied in.  What cannot be changed that easily is if one has a referendum and it is tied into the Constitution.  If it is tied into that, only the people can decide.</p><p>I agreed wholeheartedly with Senator O'Donnell only a matter of weeks ago when she spoke so eloquently in here about the ownership of water and why water should not be privatised.  I do not believe she could be convinced that what Government has come up in this Bill is sufficient to deal with her concerns and the concerns of probably over 80% of the people in the most recent poll.  I do not believe her fears could have been assuaged by what the Government has come up with in section 2 of this Bill which can be removed by any future Government.  That section could be stood down.  They are real concerns.</p><p>Senator Daly outlined ten different U-turns.  Since the Government set up Irish Water, things that could not be changed have now been changed.  Here is another one the Government said could not be changed.  The Taoiseach said only a matter of weeks ago that there was no need for anything and that this was fine.  Now it is in the legislation.  Let us remind ourselves about what is being done here about Irish Water.  The Government has spent &euro;172 million on setting it up.  That does not include &euro;540 million on the meters themselves.  I am supportive of metering because in future-----</p></speech>

I am not convinced by the argument made by Government and those who support this section that what Government is proposing with regard to a plebiscite would in any way, shape or form deal with the future ownership of water.</p> <p>While commentators might say now no Government would do it, I do not agree.  Fine Gael, in particular, would be a party about which, should it be in government again, I would be concerned would sell Irish Water because that has been the party's track record.  Fine Gael tried to do that already in the term of this Government.  Look at Fine Gael's NewERA document that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, put together in 2009 in advance of Fine Gael's election manifesto.  Way back then, Fine Gael talked about the creation of a utility.  Look at what has happened in Britain with regard to privatisation of water, the problem they have and the cost.  Once one gets the people into the net, as Senator Cullinane mentioned, they are treated as customers, not citizens.  The people own the water and it is not up to the Government to come up with some half-baked measure like this.</p><p>We all are supposed to feel confident in a Government that has utterly failed,-----</p></speech>

It has been an absolute disaster.  Anyone who is honest about it would say of the mess created - by both the former Minister, Commissioner Hogan, and the Cabinet - that Deputy Kelly comes in here, beats his chest and states correctly that he will sort it out, he recognises mistakes were made and it was a mess but his party leader, the T&aacute;naiste, and others all sat at Cabinet and made the decision together.  There is collective Cabinet responsibility.  Because the former Minister has gone to Europe, they can blame him for this mess and state it was nothing to do with them.</p><p>While I acknowledge that the Minister has moved some way towards rectifying some of the issues, the fundamental issue that relates to this section and that Senator Barrett's amendment would deal with, has not been dealt with sufficiently.  I listened to the Second Stage speeches yesterday.  I listened with interest to some of the Independent Senators who decided, for their own reasons, to support the Government on the Bill, particularly around the area of ownership, and I was not convinced.  I remain unconvinced.</p><p>For those who may be frustrated with the fact that we are still on Committee Stage a number of hours in, I would say that this Bill should have been defeated on Second Stage.  That is why we are perfectly within our rights to table amendments on Committee Stage and to debate those amendments, and we will continue to do that.</p><p>As for all the thousands of people who have made contact with each of us - I do not subscribe to what the Minister and some Senators stated earlier about these computer-generated e-mails - I have spoken to some of those who e-mailed me and responded to many of those e-mails.

He cannot publish the Attorney General's advice but he can state the issues in real terms.  This idea of private wells, bore holes, aquifers is a load of nonsense.  I assume that Cabinet received formal advice from the Attorney General but I have not received a proper answer to that either.  The Minister stated that the Attorney General advised and was contacted.  Did formal advice go to the Cabinet?  Did the Cabinet meet specifically about the issue of a referendum following the passing by the Seanad of a motion on the issue?  The Minister, Deputy Kelly, stated he brought that to Cabinet and it discussed it.  Was it dealt with formally as an item on the agenda at a Cabinet meeting?  Did the Minister formally get advice from the Attorney General?  What are the real areas of complexity and how are those complex issues so insurmountable that we cannot deal with them when only last year a number of civil and public servants were sent away for the guts of a year to prepare for a referendum on the abolition of the Seanad which was far more complex?  It showed when the Government wanted to do something, it could.  The reality is that they do not want to hold a referendum on this issue.  They should because that would clear up a major part of the concerns that people have.</p><p>Let us return to look at Irish Water right now and everything that was said.  The local property tax was mentioned.  Not one cent of what was collected in this country this year under what the Minister calls the local property tax has gone to the local authorities.  Furthermore, to get around EU rules, the Government has taken another &euro;60 million from the local authorities to cook the books to ensure that its subvention to Irish Water does not go over 50%.</p><p>It is a disaster.  I acknowledge that the Minister tried to go some way towards fixing it but he has not gone far enough.  The Government should hold a referendum next May.  With the other referenda that it has announced and with the by-election, it can be done.  It might be the one referendum on which the Government would get the support of the people.  It is important.  People are genuinely concerned about it.</p><p>Section 2 does not do it for most people.  If the Bill is passed, the Minister could introduce an amendment next year, if he wanted to, to remove the section.  That would be it, job done.  It does not matter about a plebiscite or two thirds of the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  None of it matters.  It is completely irrelevant.  The Minister could come in and change it.  If he holds a referendum and it is enshrined in the Constitution, the Minister would have to go back to the people to get their approval.</p></speech>

Is it a political decision that Fine Gael and the Labour Party have made or are there really complex areas that the Government cannot deal with, or is it that the Government will not deal with those areas?  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, or the Minister, Deputy Kelly, whenever he returns this evening, to answer that question.  What is so complex about this that the Minister cannot do it?</p><p>I still think, even at this stage, that this section in its entirety should be deleted.  My party is opposing it.  My colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in and others on the Independent benches are opposing the section.  The Government should delete this section, take it out of the Bill and go back to the drawing board.  They can still do that.</p><p>They have set themselves a false deadline of January for charges.  They have changed that previously.  They changed already the deadline for the return of applications forms to be sent in to Irish Water.  At one stage we were told that it was an absolute necessity that PPS numbers be sent in to get allowances and, lo and behold, it is not and Irish Water is deleting all the PPS numbers that it holds.  Why should we trust the Government with the advice the Minister is giving us on this important issue when it has got so much of it wrong up until now?  The Minister of State should tell us why the Government cannot hold a referendum.  Is it a political decision, did the Government merely decide that it does not want to and it is against doing so, and what are the areas of complexity in that regard?  Even if Deputy Coffey stated the Government could not hold a referendum next May and it will take longer than that, he should prepare a referendum for next year.  He should clear up that issue and deal with other areas of concern, such as charges.</p><p>I am yet to be convinced by those who argued vociferously, in my view, rightly, for a referendum only a short couple of weeks ago who now believe that this section on a plebiscite is sufficient.  I still remain to be convinced as to why that is.</p><p>The Leas-Chathaoirleach might advise me as to whether it is appropriate that the Minister of State respond at this stage to answer queries that have been put already.</p></speech>

Water is the single commodity we cannot live without.  A lot of people are repeating the same things, but the more I hear going on today, the more I demand that the evidence that this cannot be put to a referendum be brought before the House and made public.  This notion that we get legal advice from some person with a wig who can hide behind his gown and never make himself or his opinion known to the people - or worse still, offer an opinion and hide behind anonymity - is totally unacceptable.  Somebody made the point that we did not sell off the ESB, which is  correct.  How many companies are supplying electricity in this country at the moment?  How many companies can contract from the ESB and supply electricity?  I just had a quick look on the internet and can pick any one of six companies.  I can go to <i>uSwitch.ie</i>and pick a company at random.  I can do the same for gas, TV and telecommunications.<br/>We keep referring to people as customers.  How can I be a customer of something I own?  The Minister says he is going to enshrine ownership through a plebiscite, because he cannot flog it off unless the plebiscite is passed.  We all accept, and the Minister himself accepts, that a plebiscite has no legal basis whatsoever.  I agree it would be a brave Government that would run a plebiscite, win or lose it and then go off and do the opposite thing, but there is absolutely nothing to stop this from happening.<br/>Meters that we do not need have been installed around the country to the tune of &euro;540 million.  We are told they will help people control their water usage.  I can assure the Minister of State that there will be a meter outside my house in the next few days and it is not going to change one jot the amount of water we use in the house.  My wife will still go out and water the garden and I will pick up the cost.  It is a nonsense.  The Minister has gone off and decided to spend this money when he could have put that &euro;540 million into repairing the system.  A flat charge does not in any way inspire or enthuse people to cut down on their water usage.<br/>It strikes me, based on what Senator O'Brien has just said, that there will be insufficient funding from the fixed charge.  The fixed charge is already discriminatory, because I am paying &euro;40 a year more than my single neighbour - an extra &euro;20 each for myself and my wife.  The bottom line is that the Minister is not going to collect enough money to pay off what he has borrowed, so how is he going to fix the infrastructure?  Some smart suit over in Brussels is going to stand up and insist that he bring in competition in order to fund his infrastructure.  It is going to happen.  They have already forced him to make our electricity system competitive.  They will force him to make our water system competitive unless we have something there to protect us.</p></speech>

Perhaps it has been a tiresome morning for all of us.  I cannot even begin to explain to the Minister of State the level of frustration that I feel today.  I have two telephones beside me here.  I have contacted country councillors all over the country and none of them wants anything to do with Irish Water.  The level of frustration they feel as a result of starvation by countless Governments down through the years that refused to fund water properly is palpable.  My phone is hopping off the table here.  I am tired.  Bring me the evidence.  Show me and the Irish people what legal advice the Minister - I am glad to see the Minister, Deputy Kelly, is back in the Chamber - has.  He should bring that advice in and read it into the record and let the people know.  Otherwise, he is hiding something.  That applies to both the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey.  If there is nothing to hide, why not just bring it in and read it out?  You does not have to read the name of the person who gave it to you.  If you asked the Attorney General to give you advice, I am sure the Attorney General contracted some other senior counsel or legal entity.</p></speech>

A plebiscite on the ownership of Irish Water is essential if water is to remain within the ownership of the Irish people.  I said on Second Stage, and would have said again on Committee Stage, that I am certainly not enamoured with monopolies.  Public monopolies are not quite as bad as private monopolies.  What we have in Uisce &Eacute;ireann is a public monopoly.  Unfortunately, it has started in the worst possible way, with all the excesses we would associate with some of the longer-established public or semi-private sector companies.  Mention has been made of ESB, for example-----</p></speech>

If we look at the ESB, though, the average salary there as of about six years ago was &euro;70,000 per year.</p> <p>If one compares this with any other industry one will see a huge disparity.  During the terms of the last D&aacute;il and Seanad I was a member of the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and I sought to obtain figures on the salaries of the top ten executives in each of the semi-State companies under the remit of that committee.  I met some resistance but we also got figures for the average salaries.  It is fair to say that people were handsomely paid because I doubt that people in the same positions in the private sector got half the amount of money.  There is a historical record on this and, ultimately, when it comes to public utilities, taxpayers and householders foot the bill for egregiously handsome pay packages in semi-State companies.</p><p>Mention has been made of the privatisation of water but water is one of our great natural resources and I think we all acknowledge that it is valuable.  It will become increasingly valuable because climate change will have a significant bearing on the need for water around the world and will adversely affect water supply in many regions.  All of this will enhance significantly the value of our water resources.  We are fortunate to live in an area with a plentiful supply of good quality water.  I visited Jordan as part of a delegation of American and Irish politicians some years ago and I attended a meeting with King Abdullah where he predicted that the next general war in the Middle East will be about water rather than oil.  Huge issues in that region at the moment have given rise to tensions that could lead to conflict over the supply of water.</p><p>If there are to be charges, it is essential that we ensure water continues to be available to the people of Ireland at a competitive rate.  The cost of water must be reasonable and affordable but if Irish Water is privatised, customers, householders and the people of Ireland will be fleeced.  This could be avoided if there was sufficient competition under privatisation but I do not know how that could be achieved.</p><p>Much reliance has been placed on section 2 and I will return to the wording and the weaknesses of the section shortly.  The weaknesses of section 2 are apparent irrespective of the intent behind the section, which is unachievable anyway.  The previous speaker mentioned the European Union and I welcome the fact that the EU has protected the consumers of this State in various areas but greater efforts are required to ensure competition and consumer protection in a range of areas where monopolies or dominance exist.  Energy provides a good example because we pay far more in Ireland for electricity than those in other countries.  The cost of telecommunications is very high in Ireland but efforts have been made through the EU to introduce more competition to tackle the issue of cost.  As stated, water is an area upon which the EU will focus attention in the not-too-distant future.  The EU has increased its levels of intervention in all areas of society but I do not welcome intervention on social matters because I think that is ideologically driven rather than in people's best interests.  The sovereignty of individual states must be respected.</p><p>Ireland has signed up to the powers of the EU through various treaties that were approved by the people of Ireland in referenda.  The State will not be able to contest any challenge by the EU in the area of water because the people of Ireland have already endorsed the various treaties from which the EU derives its powers.  Fine Gael and Labour Party Senators have said that their parties have guaranteed the people of Ireland that Uisce &Eacute;ireann will not be privatised.  I do not know how reassured the people will be by such a commitment from these parties but it is only a couple of months since one of the parties in these Houses, Sinn F&eacute;in, stated that it would buttress any shortfall in funds by part-privatising Irish Water.  The by-election in Dublin South-West changed the view of the party but it could make another U-turn on this in future, as could any party.  I am concerned by this and do not believe the people of Ireland will find comfort in the assurances of any politician from any party.</p><p>I was in this House when the economic crisis began in 2008 and it is the biggest emergency the State has faced in my lifetime.  The future of the country was at stake and the parties in the Opposition at that stage were happy to play politics by promising to burn bondholders and show the people of Ireland a better way.  Yesterday I read into the record assurances from the then Opposition that there would be no charges for water because the then Opposition opposed such charges.  However, the Bill before us and the Bill we dealt with this time last year aim to impose water charges on the people of Ireland.</p><p>The standing of politicians in public opinion is very low and, while this is somewhat exaggerated and media-driven, there are good reasons for it.  Politicians say things without any intention to follow through and give no thought to reversing direction when the time comes.  I heard rumours yesterday that public moneys and soon-to-open public positions are being used to secure the passage of this Bill through the Houses.  I do not know if the rumours are true and I sincerely hope they are not because, if true, they would further undermine the standing and credibility of politicians.  This would not be good for democracy at a time when many people in society are almost anarchists who are happy to undermine the democratic process by stoking public opinion.  If we lose the democratic process we lose everything.</p><p>I know that section 2 was added with good intent and to assuage fears held by the people who campaigned against the legislation.  They feel that Irish Water could fall into private ownership and impose unaffordable costs on hard-pressed taxpayers.  As many Members have asked, is section 2 any more than a fig leaf?</p> <p>I will give two reasons for my saying that and raising the question.  First, as many speakers have said, any legislation can be overturned at any stage by any Government purely by bringing amending legislation through the House.  If there is another Government such as the current one, with a huge majority in the Lower House, legislation may be overturned at the whim of a Minister or, perhaps, a Department.  This presents a serious risk for the public.<br/>The next issue I wish to raise was highlighted by my colleague.  If the European Union, for example, imposed a requirement on us to ensure an element of competition in the interest of the consumer, the Government would be obliged to take it on board.  No Government would be able to resist that.  In such circumstances, there would be a credible argument for changing the legislation without a plebiscite.  The latter would leave us offside with the European Union and we could be fined for contravening its laws and regulations.  This point has been made by many others.<br/>Let me raise a point I have not heard made yet but which seriously concerns me.  I refer to the complete undermining of the Government's intent.  Section 2(1) states a Bill providing or allowing for the alienation of any share or shares in Irish Water to a person other than a Minister of the Government shall not be initiated without a resolution on a referendum coming before the House.  That deals specifically with the transfer of shares.  As we all know, one does not have to transfer shares to transfer business.  The business could be transferred.<br/>In this regard my colleague, Senator Byrne, referred to the lottery, in respect of which a licence to operate or a lease for a period could be given.  In this instance, however, one could go further.  There could be a transfer of the business of Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  Perhaps it would retain the distribution system but there is nothing in this section that would prevent it from transferring the treatment plants or reservoirs, for example, or from determining the water charges.  Perhaps Uisce &Eacute;ireann would retain the network of pipes, for which it would apply a charge to the new private entity.  There is nothing in this section that would prevent that from happening.  A Government could have to act under duress based on a requirement of the European Union.  If what I describe happens, a Government could proceed without any reference to the Oireachtas.  It would not even have to go to people.  The business could be transferred under the legislation.  That is a very serious lacuna in what is drafted.  This would be the case even if it had the force of sustainability in the future, which, obviously, no legislation has because it can be changed.<br/>I ask the Minister to reconsider.  It is not as if we are asking for something very unreasonable.  Everybody I have heard speak, including the Minister, talked about keeping our water supplies in Irish ownership in perpetuity.  If we are <i>ad idem</i>on that, there will be an opportunity next May, at no extra cost to the people or at very little cost, to hold a referendum with the others the Government is proposing to hold.  There is actually an avenue to achieve what we are asking for if the Government is of a mind to do it.<br/>To date, I have not heard how the Government could give us absolute assurance on this without underpinning that assurance with an article in our Constitution.  One of the greatest legacies of &Eacute;amon de Valera and the Government of the 1930s was a Constitution that has really stood the test of time, as the Minister acknowledged.  It was extraordinary a few years ago, when we were introducing in our laws the European Convention on Human Rights, that all the protections we were adding to our laws were already invoked and covered under the 1937 Constitution.  It is remarkable that there was such foresight and vision almost 80 years ago.  Today we urge that some of the vision of the founding fathers of this State be applied by our current Government and all politicians.  I do not just point the finger at the Government.  We all need to renew our sense of commitment to the people and this country, in which we are fortunate enough to have been born and to live.</p></speech>

There is a plebiscite in planning legislation whereby there can be a plebiscite to have a housing estate taken into charge.  What is the practice with those plebiscites?  The practice is that the residents just fill out a form and submit it to the council.  It is not a vote.  It is not a referendum of the residents of the housing estate in my experience of those types of plebiscites in County Meath.  There is no definition of a plebiscite.  There is an implication here that there are votes, but there is nothing specifying that this event, whatever it is, will be akin to a referendum for changing the Constitution.  It mentions votes.</p><p>The Minister is given extraordinary powers under section 2(6) to make all the rules relating to this plebiscite, whatever it is.  With constitutional referendums, not only do we have the Constitution of Ireland to guide us in how to carry out those referendums, but we have so much legislation to deal with all the related issues.  It is important that is dealt with by primary legislation because the Minister does not have the powers to make all the rules I believe this legislation purports to give him.</p><p>With referendums, we also have the benefit of a referendum commission, which ensures equal treatment of both sides of the debate.  Presumably if any future Government were to come to holding a plebiscite, it would be advocating for the plebiscite and would be proposing the sale of a share or shares in Irish Water.  It would then be in its interest to persuade the public as best it can.</p><p>There is nothing in the legislation to prohibit the spending of Government money to promote a &quot;Yes&quot; vote on the sale of shares in a plebiscite, whereas there is for a referendum.  There is absolutely nothing about that.</p><p>There is a provision that the Minister can make regulations, but it is such a broad provision that is almost as if the Minister is taking upon himself the powers of the Oireachtas to legislate for this.  If the Minister were allowed to do that, why do we have Referendum Acts?  In that case surely the Minister of the day could just issue regulations instead of having detailed provisions about polling places and ballot papers.  The issue of ballot papers in referendums has been a contentious issue.  There is nothing about that here.</p><p>We are talking generally and not talking about the present Minister, Deputy Kelly.  That is the whole point as to why we want absolute protection on this.</p> <p>There is simply nothing here.  The Government could decide - probably 30 years later - that it wants to sell it and that it will go to a plebiscite.  It would be open to it under this legislation simply to put a leaflet in the door of every house stating "Sign and return if you want Irish Water to be sold or not".  That is the precedent we have for plebiscites in this country under the Planning and Development Act.  As I understand it, what happens is that the forms are signed and put back to the council.  There is no vote taken in the local community hall.</p></speech>

Senator Landy has disagreed with my interpretation of "plebiscite".  My interpretation of "plebiscite" may not be right, but Senator Landy's may not be right either.  The point is that there is no definition of "plebiscite" whatsoever in the section.  That is a major failing in this legislation.  The reason that there is no definition of "plebiscite", the reason we do not know what a plebiscite actually is, is that this was done as a rushed job after the public said no, and we are being asked to rush this through, and to endorse it before Christmas.  My colleagues and I have been calling to stop this in its tracks, to think about it more carefully and the Minister should listen to the arguments that are being made.</p></speech>

How many points were made that the Minister might not even be aware of?<br/>That is not the point I wanted to raise at all.  Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell asked a question earlier and I want to address it through the Chair.  She read out a section of the Bill relating to the holding of a plebiscite, which is the first paragraph of section: <blockquote>A Bill providing or allowing for the alienation of any share or shares in Irish Water to a person other than a Minister of the Government shall not be initiated by or on behalf of a Minister of the Government in either House of the Oireachtas unless&mdash;<br />(a) a Resolution of each such House...</blockquote>and so on.  None of that means anything.  None of it means a damn thing, because it can just be repealed, amended or taken out of a future Bill.  She must accept that.  The Minister has already acknowledged it so she must accept that.  The reason we are going around in circles on this issue is that we have some Senators trying to pretend this is something that it is not.</p></speech>

There may not be any vote in the Oireachtas, there may not be any plebiscite, there may not be anything, because it could just be amended if a Government wants to do that.  That is the simple reality.  Examples were given earlier of industries that were deregulated and it does raise concerns about Irish Water and what could happen there in the absence of a referendum.  The example was given of telecommunications, when Telecom was deregulated and we then had multiple operators.  The example of the ESB was also given and we now have a number of different operators operating in that market.  How can the Minister say the same thing will not happen with water?  How can he say categorically that we will not see the deregulation of our water services?</p><p>The Minister has not at all dealt with the root of this problem, which goes back to the European Union Water Framework Directive and the wider policy in Europe, which is to liberalise, deregulate and privatise services.  That is where all of this is coming from in the first place.  We had a derogation for years in relation to water charges.  The Minister knows that the thrust of European policy is to take us in this direction.  I have already articulated what will happen once the charges are introduced.  I made the point in my Second Stage speech to the Minister, and I will make it again: he is like a second-hand car salesman, coming in here, trying to ask us buy-----</p></speech>

I was here for the 17 hours that we discussed the Water Services Bill and not once in all of the discussions we had at that time - this was only a year ago and we had 17 hours - was the holding of a plebiscite mentioned by the Government.  Now it is an issue because they are saying they are listening to the people, but it is only a sop.  It does not mean anything.  That is the point.  They are trying to tell us that we cannot have a constitutional referendum because of so-called unintended consequences.  The point is that they are not serious about it.  The Government does not want this.  It never wanted it.  Go back to the very start of this.  It never wanted a plebiscite.  It certainly does not want a constitutional referendum, and if it were serious, we could have one.  If the Government wanted it, it would happen.  They are coming up with all sorts of excuses because they do not want it.  Not one single excuse has been given by the Government so far as to why we cannot have a constitutional referendum.  That is why we must keep coming back to the Minister.  He has not given us the excuse.</p><p>I asked a straightforward question about whether section 2 could simply be withdrawn.  I know the Minister has not come back yet, but hopefully he will answer it.  How meaningless does that make the section?  I would say that to all the Independent Senators.  I know they are in a difficult position, but they are being asked to make a big decision that at some point in the future could have profound consequences.  We can all say whatever we want in this Chamber.  The Minister can say what he wants, I can say what I want, Fianna F&aacute;il can say what it wants and Senator O'Donnell can say what she wants.  We can all say whatever the hell we want, but at the end of the day, if, at some point in the future, any future Government wants to privatise Irish Water, or any element of it, or through the back door with a licence, as was said earlier, it can be done by way of legislation.  What we want, and what we should have, is a cast-iron guarantee in the Constitution that goes back to the people.  Then we will have certainty.  Any words on this paper, with the greatest of respect to any of the Independent Senators, are not worth the paper they are written on.  I said at the very start of the Water Services Bill, mark 1, that I was not buying a pig in a poke.  I was right.  The Minister is now saying that we were right, because the Government made mistakes.  I said on the Water Services Bill, mark 2, that I was not buying a pig in a poke, and I was right.  I am saying it again with the third attempt by this Government.  I am not buying a pig in a poke because I will be proven right.  It may not be in three weeks time or three months time or three years time - it could be ten, 20 or 30 years time - but at least I can say I fought for the people.  I fought for a constitutional amendment.  I did not buy a formula of words that was in legislation that could be overturned by one day of debate and the passing of one Bill.  This will be my final contribution on this amendment, but I have listened to a lot of nonsense from the Government Senators.</p> <p>Not one single contribution, either from the Minister or anybody from the Government, has persuaded me that we cannot have a constitutional referendum.  The Minister can dismiss it all he wants and we may have a long night, but the reason for that is that he is not prepared, willing or able to provide us with the information we ask for.  We had exactly the same problem when we debated the Water Services Bill for 17 hours.  We had the same sighs and grunts from the Minister and Government Senators who said we were filibustering, raising amendments and asking questions that should not really be asked.  All of those same questions are now being asked by the Government Senators and we are being told that they were legitimate.  I have no doubt we will be back here and I am putting my position on the record, which is that I am not going to be fooled by anybody.</p></speech>

If the Minister or anybody else suggests otherwise, he is trying to con and fool people and I certainly will not be conned or fooled.</p></speech>

First I want to deal with the amendment rather than the section, because we are on the amendment.  Regarding amendment No. 1, tabled by Senator Barrett, the opening piece deals with the passing of the shares to the Minister for Finance for the dissolution of Irish Water.  It sets out the resolution on a plebiscite, in section (8) it talks about ensuring orderly alienation of Irish Water and in section (9) about powers of Irish Water going to local authorities within 180 days.  To be quite clear on ownership, Ervia has no shares in Irish Water and no capacity to sell Irish Water.  The shares in Ervia are vested in the Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform and Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, and the shares in Irish Water are vested in the Ministers for Finance and Environment, Community and Local Government.  There is no need for a transfer of shares, they are already owned.</p><p>Regarding the proposals put forward on putting this to the Houses and the plebiscite, there is a pre-determined outcome possibly in the plebiscite but be that as it may, there is also a determination here that water services would go back to local authorities.  For many different reasons I do not think that would be appropriate.  There are greater economies with Irish Water.  We have huge investment and borrowing capacity because of Irish Water instead of 31 water utilities and it is by far the best way to go.</p><p>Regarding the contributions by Senators, I made commitments on this previously that I would bring it to Cabinet and to the Government.  I have brought the possibility of a referendum to the Government and spoken for a good period of time with them.  Every single part of that was vetted through the Office of the Attorney General, which is the normal way, and Senators can be sure of everything in that regard.  </p><p>It was strange that Senator Cullinane suggested on two occasions that the legislation we pass in this House is not worth the paper it is written on.  I have never heard a Senator say something like that in my time in public life. </p></speech>

I have said it a number of times.  Senator Cullinane just chose not to listen as usual.  I am not going to repeat the whole thing.  I outlined earlier regarding the Constitution and how we have to be very careful about putting amendments into the Constitution, about the consequences of that and the fact that Article 10 already says what it does on water.  We have to be very careful about any potential changes of our Constitution.  It is essential that anybody who makes or considers to make any changes to it bears in mind every single potential consequence.  It was brought up by some people as regards the potential to license services.  Irish Water has a statutory function to deliver water services and cannot really get involved in asset transfers as stated under the previous Act.  They cannot contract out their statutory responsibilities.  I would like to give that assurance to the House.</p><p>Regarding the European Commission, which was referenced on a number of occasions, in 2014 the Commission issued a communication in response to the European citizens' initiative on the right to water.  I referenced it yesterday and spoke about it again this morning.  In the communication the Commission stated that it would continue to ensure full respect of treaty rules regarding the EU remaining neutral in respect of national decisions governing the ownership regime for water undertakings.  The Commission also stated it would remain attentive to public concerns about the specificity of water services.  It is clear there is no agenda of privatisation.  Ownership of water services is always a matter for the Government or for the country on its own terms.  </p><p>Some Senator, I am not sure which, brought up a reference to a company of a similar name in Britain.  I understand it has nothing to do with Irish Water here.  That is the information I have been given.</p><p>I believe what we have proposed here is as far as we can go.  I say that hand on heart and given the genuine proposals put forward by Senators.  I say it on the basis of the spirit of each amendment and the spirit in which it has been proposed by all the Senators.  I would like to point out that I have faith in the Irish people, as there are two resolutions to be passed by each House, to elect people who will represent the fact that they never want to see this privatised.</p> <p>I believe in the people.  Whatever decisions they make, I believe they will elect people to reflect the fact that they have no wish to see this company ever privatised in any way, shape or form, and it is important that we acknowledge that.  I cannot see how any government would not only behave in that manner but, through this threshold, take away the right of the people to make the decision in that instance, which, in any event, I do not believe would actually arise.</p><p>I wish to affirm and restate the serious issues in respect of what we are discussing and the need to define what we are discussing.  Even defining what we are discussing is difficult.  Can Senators imagine the unintended consequences if we went down that road?  Can anyone in this House absolutely guarantee that any wording put to the people would not have unintended consequences?  I cannot.  Can anyone guarantee-----</p></speech>

While I have been absent from the House of late, down at the banking inquiry in the basement, I have looked up at the monitor.  From that purgatory I have seen the heaven of the Seanad Chamber and I have wished I was here at the debate.  Perhaps, when the Lord wants to punish one, he grants one's wishes.  Therefore, I have come here for this great debate.  I am pleased that the amendment has provoked approximately five hours' worth of debate.  It is important to assess the matter.  The Minister may have suggested that people are in favour of the plebiscite.  Not many people have been, but there is a reference to a plebiscite in the amendment as well.  This is one of the problems we encounter.  Let us consider the text of the Bill.  Section 2(8) states: "In this section &ldquo;Plebiscite&rdquo; means the Plebiscite to which subsection (1)(b) refers."  However, section 2(1)(b) refers to a plebiscite as: "a proposal to provide or allow for such alienation is submitted by Plebiscite for the decision of the People".  That is not a definition.  By contrast, the definition of a plebiscite in section 2(1)(b) of the proposed amendment states: "if such Resolutions are passed, the proposal of the dissolution of Irish Water may, if the Government decides to proceed with the proposal, be submitted by Plebiscite to the decision of the People, and if, consequent upon the proposal having been submitted to the People by Plebiscite, a majority of the votes cast in the Plebiscite shall have been cast in favour of the proposal, legislation may (if the Government so decides) be initiated by or on behalf of a Minister of the Government in either House of the Oireachtas in respect of the proposal."  I humbly submit that this is a far better definition of a plebiscite than the definition in the Bill.  For this reason alone, between now and Report Stage, the people in the Custom House might actually acknowledge that sometimes there are good people in Seanad &Eacute;ireann coming forward with ideas.  The last time we proposed amendments, the Custom House, that beautiful Gandon building, was turned into a bunker.  They would not accept anything we said.  I appreciate that this Minister has brought in changes and I welcome it.</p><p>The first debate I had with the Minister was on taxis.  We both changed the Bill substantially and we remained good friends afterwards, but it was a better Bill and there was no personal animus in it.  We are always prepared to do that.</p><p>The Minister said in his reply that there is no such thing as shares in Irish Water.  The first line of section 2 refers to: &quot;A Bill providing or allowing for the alienation of any share or shares in Irish Water&quot;.  I would need to examine the record to see why the Minister believes there is no such thing as shares in Irish Water, because it is in the first line.</p></speech>

The Title refers to alienating the shareholding Irish Water as well.  I am keen to get that clarified between now and Report Stage.</p><p>The Minister referred to Ervia as a protection against privatisation.  The explanatory memorandum refers to &quot;Irish Water as a State-owned company, established as a subsidiary of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann (now Ervia).&quot;  Substantial parts of the gas industry have been privatised.  I am taking for a far more sensible route to prevent privatisation by vesting those shares in the Minister.  I submit to the Government and Independent Senators that we should consider that between now and Report Stage.</p><p>The Minister said several times in his first appearance and again now that he has gone as far as he can.  Last night, several of the Independent Senators were under the impression that there would be movement today, and they were looking forward to that movement, but it has not materialised.  That has to be discussed.  The Minister claims he is giving an undertaking that no one ever in the future of Ireland will privatise the water industry.  Yet, apparently, a commitment the Minister gave to some Independent Senators not 24 hours ago is now gone.  Is it true?  Is this as far as the Minister can go and no further?  That is not the impression that was given to the House last night.  That is a matter for communications between those directly involved, but I speak as someone who listened to what was said.</p><p>There are major public finance implications.  The Minister's welcome reduction of the charges will reduce the income of this company by &euro;21 million in 2015 and &euro;56 million in 2016.  The grant will cost &euro;130 million.  There is provision in sections 10 and 12 for &euro;460 million in payments to local authorities and &euro;59 million for the alleviation of rates.  Fully &euro;500 million has been paid for the installation of meters.  We must have the Minister for Finance involved rather than Ervia, which, subject to my research between now and the next day, was associated with the part-privatisation of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann.  That is not the protection that the Government Senators seek and in respect of which Independent Senators were reassured.</p><p>We have not referred at any stage to aquifers and all the other things that have been discussed.  The purpose of the amendment is to put the shareholding in the hands of the Minister for Finance and the Exchequer.  Our proposed amendment would nationalise Irish Water to ensure no one else can privatise it.</p> <p>This is belt and braces.  I submit very strongly that our amendment in regard to the deficiencies elucidated is stronger than the Minister's section 2.  I will not move it today because we should all have time to consider it.  I want to consider what is happening with EUROSTAT and with Ervia but I will re-enter the amendment on Report Stage if a similar amendment is not tabled by the Minister.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, for him, the Minister let the cat out of the bag in his previous contribution.  My amendment seeks to ensure that the assets of Irish Water are also subject to the same plebiscite provisions, flawed as they are, that the Minister proposes.  When I raised this issue previously the Minister answered by saying that is prohibited by the Water Services Act 2007.  That is the whole point.  We are bringing in a plebiscite so that we go further than legislation.  Previously the sale of shares in Irish Water was prohibited by legislation and now the Minister is introducing the belt and braces approach that he prefers.</p></speech>

In fairness, the Minister's officials should do some research on this issue.  I am raising a valid point which the Minister has dismissed out of hand privately here in the Chamber.  The reality is that shares, assets, business, undertaking, licence, all aspects of what Irish Water can do, are not subject to the plebiscite provisions.  It is true to say that Irish Water cannot contract out of its statutory obligations.  That is absolutely correct.  However, the Minister is purporting to make sure that if a future Oireachtas wants to contract Irish Water out of its obligations by issuing a licence to somebody else to carry out the functions for profits or whatever to a private body, it will have to go before the plebiscite and that the plebiscite provisions would apply.</p><p>In the same way that the Minister part privatised the national lottery by issuing a licence - that is the most recent precedent - that would not be subject to the plebiscite provisions if he did something similar to Irish Water.  If the Minister sold the assets of Irish Water by passing legislation to overrule the 2007 Act, which could happen, that would not be subject to the plebiscite provisions.  That is a matter of statutory interpretation and it only relates to shares in Irish Water.  The Minister is shaking his head but the Bill refers to &quot;any share or shares in Irish Water&quot;.  Why does the Minister want to exclude assets?  I will table a further amendment on Report Stage to include business, undertaking and licences in the event that anything is proposed in that area.  It is not good enough to say that the transfer of assets is prohibited under the 2007 Act.  We are trying to get beyond that.</p><p>I urge the Minister, if he is not willing to accept my amendment, to look at the issue and realise that is a significant gap in the legislation.  I ask him to look at my amendment for Report Stage which attempts to look at wider possibilities in terms of privatisation and to accept this is a gap.  I reiterate the point Senator Sean D. Barrett made.  I heard the Minister say very clearly that amendments would be accepted.  He said it in public and he said it here.</p></speech>

One of them who spoke privately to me voted with the Minister; he said that it could change during the course of the debate.  The Minister seems to have ruled that out entirely.  I think I have spotted a significant gap.  The Minister cannot say that assets are covered by shares - they are not.  A limited company can sell its assets without selling its shares.  The State could sell the assets of Irish Water without selling its shares.  The State could sell the assets of Anglo Irish Bank, the loan books.  The State could sell the shares in Bank of Ireland which it owns.  It could sell the shares in Aer Lingus which it owns.  It owns control of Aer Lingus but it cannot sell the assets but it can sell the assets in Anglo Irish Bank.  By saying it only relates to shares in Irish Water, the Minister is leaving a significant gap in the legislation.  I appeal to the Minister to look at this issue at the weekend, to realise this is a mistake and to come have and include it in the plebiscite provisions.</p></speech>

The Minister knows full well the point I am making that they can be undone.  Whether it has to do with the assets in this or the previous amendment in respect of a constitutional referendum it can be undone by an amending piece of legislation as opposed to a referendum where the people decide.  That is the distinction between any piece of legislation, any amendment and a constitutional referendum.  The Minister know that and he knows full well the point I was making.  I wanted to reiterate that point.</p><p>The amendment is important.  There is a distinction as has been drawn by the proposer of the amendment between the share holdings and the shares themselves being disposed of, which is essentially what the section protects.  It protects the shares but not necessarily the assets of the company.  That is what the amendment seeks to do.  For that reason I will be supporting the amendment.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-12-19a.681" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1126" speakername="Jim Walsh" time="16:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014121900041#QQ02900"><p>I listened carefully to what the Minister had to say in his reply and I readily acknowledge that he was honest in respect of section 2 that it is only enforceable so long as a Government does not decide to repeal it.  Therefore, it is meaningless in the context of giving any assurances to the public that this natural resource will remain in public ownership, which is the kernel of what we are seeking.  I looked at the wording of the amendment and would question the fact that the security provided for only relates to the shares and that the distribution system parts of the essential infrastructure, the network, the reservoirs, the treatment plants could be transferred, without any reference to the Oireachtas.  I ask the Minister to confirm that is in fact the case and, therefore, what we are doing will not achieve as Senator O'Donnell said, namely, a fig leaf under which she could cast her vote.</p> <p>A more serious scenario is more likely to develop.  The Government said that the purpose of the establishment of Uisce &Eacute;ireann was to attract investment to improve substandard infrastructure by dealing with ageing pipe and treatment systems and I accept this.  The aim was to ensure an environmentally sound and sustainable water supply.  It is inevitable that to achieve this investment it will be necessary for Uisce &Eacute;ireann to borrow money on the markets.  It is very likely that the security sought by lending agencies in this regard will be securitisation of the revenue stream.  The revenue stream controls the business in the event of default.</p><p>I commend the Minister on the changes he has made as he was left in an invidious situation on coming into office.  He has taken major steps to correct the mistakes made prior to his appointment and has presented a more reasonable package than the previous one.  Having said this, the Minister's actions have put the viability of Uisce &Eacute;ireann under the microscope and lenders will want to ensure that any loans given are repaid.  The dangers of default on loans are higher now than under the previous proposals.  I am concerned that, despite our efforts in these Houses and the efforts of this and future governments, there is a risk that control of some assets of Irish Water, including the revenue stream, may move elsewhere.  The Government may not be capable of stopping this.  This is a real fear among members of the public and I ask that the Minister acknowledge these facts because together we can explore a resolution.</p><p>I cannot see any way to ensure that Irish Water is not privatised other than by adding such a provision to an article of the Constitution.  I am in favour of such a measure but there is a down side as it might canonise a public monopoly that has a bad track record over the 12 months since its establishment.  We cannot be sure that the interests of consumers will be at the heart of Irish Water's mission statement.  If the Minister can address my points, we can then discuss a resolution.</p></speech>

We can debate semantics and Senator Byrne may make another proposal, as is his right, which I will consider in detail.  I give Senator Byrne my word on that but I have outlined the facts.  The assets are part of the ownership of the company and I have explained previously the ownership structure of the company.  The assets are covered as part of this structure and the shares will never be vested elsewhere, as I outlined, so there is no need for this amendment.</p></speech>

The business may be transferred by way of a sale of the shares in the company which owns and operates the business or by the sale of the assets, which are necessary for the continuance of the business.</blockquote>We must cover both options and all of the lawyers on the other side of the House know that I am right.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-12-19a.691" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1126" speakername="Jim Walsh" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014121900042#RR01000"><p>On that point, which goes to the core of this amendment, owning the shares in a company is only as valuable as the company itself.  A company owns assets consisting of fixed assets, goodwill and revenue stream, which is probably classified under goodwill.  I notice the Minister did not answer my questions so I will ask them for the third time and will continue to do so until I receive answers.  Does the Minister accept, in this scenario, that the company can dispose of any of its assets that could realise shareholder value?  For example, the company could sell goodwill or sell off some assets and retain others.  We have seen what other public utilities, such as EirGrid, have done with assets, such as distribution.  My point is that models exist so we do not have to reinvent the wheel.  Nothing in this legislation prevents such a disposal of assets and the shareholder, the State, could benefit from the capital sum accruing from the revenue stream.  We are merely asking the Minister to acknowledge that this is the case.</p><p>My other point must be of concern to the Minister and the Department.  Investment in infrastructure is required and this will be secured on something; I do not believe Irish Water will obtain unsecured loans of the hundreds of millions of euro necessary to improve infrastructure.  This brings the revenue stream into play as I do not see any other valuable assets from a lender's point of view.  In a default situation, a lender could gain control of the revenue stream and charges.  Given its management system and financial structure, Irish Water faces issues relating to its future viability.  This all arises due to the changes that have been made to the original proposal, although I agree with those changes.  Charges can change and that can affect viability.</p><p>On Second Stage, I asked whether an exercise was carried out in the Department prior to the establishment of Uisce &Eacute;ireann but this was not answered.  If such an exercise was carried out, what internal rate of return was predicted?  What internal rate of return is now predicted, based on the changes to the revenue stream?</p></speech>

Shares in Irish Water are owned by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p> <p>Irish Water is a statutory company and, as such, is covered by statutory rules.  As it has statutory functions, it is owned by the State, and that is how it will remain.  It cannot pass these functions to others.  I understand the reason the Senators have put this argument forward.  I will give them a commitment that if they put forward an amendment for Report Stage that expands on what they are saying I will consider it or look at it and see if there is some way in which it can be embellished.  I will take it in that spirit.  However, I do not believe it is necessary.</p></speech>

The assets can be disposed of by a decision of the board or perhaps the CEO, depending on what rules are in place for the governance of the company.  The assets can be sold by any company without reference to the shareholders.  I have had ownership of companies in the past where we sold the company by selling the shares in the company.  I have also seen situations where we sold the assets of the company, rather than the company.  That is quite common in normal commercial trading.  Often, it hinges on the wishes of the purchaser as to what will suit their requirements.</p><p>This is the point that the Minister has not referred to in any of his replies.  This section deals exclusively with the ownership of the shares, and even if this was enforceable it would do nothing to safeguard the assets.  That is the reason we must have it embedded in the Constitution in a properly worded amendment stating that the supply of the water and all of the infrastructure remains in the public ownership.  I believe the Minister shares that view.  It is in our interest to do that now, because there is a possible scenario over which neither the Minister, I nor anybody else in this House will have any control.  Lenders could get securitisation, which I have no doubt they will as a condition for the significant sums of millions that are due to be invested in the infrastructure.  We have all seen what happened with the banks, how assets were secured and how people's houses were taken from them.  People did not realise that in the past.  We must learn from these things and ensure that we safeguard what is a natural resource in the interests of the Irish people.</p><p>I welcome the Minister's response to Senator Byrne, that if we can propose a properly worded amendment he will seriously consider it.  However, there is also an onus on the Minister and his Department to consider what might be appropriate to meet the concerns we have in this regard, and I appeal to him to do that.</p></speech>

Employees are protected not just for the sale of shares of a company but also the transfer of an undertaking.  An undertaking could be a part of a company or an asset that somebody works on which is moved to another company to generate income elsewhere.  The employee can move with that asset if that is the business or undertaking that is moving.  It is not just confined to the sale of shares.  There is an absolute distinction here, and it is not covered.  Is the issue Senator Walsh raised, that these assets will, by the nature of the project, have to be secured by way of mortgages, the real reason that the Minister is not prepared to cover it?</p><p>We have raised a very serious point that has not been dismissed by anybody on the Government side.  The lawyers on that side have spoken up previously and have spoken well.  The officials have worked really hard today and I compliment them on that, but they should check this point.</p></speech>

I have given as much of a commitment as I can give.  With regard to the shares, the shares in Ervia are owned by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, while the shares in Irish Water are owned by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  I take the advice of the Attorney General very seriously and I believe it is sufficiently robust.  Assets are part of the ownership of the company and the alienation of shares covers that.  Irish Water is a statutory company so it is covered by statutory rules.  Given the shareholding, assets cannot be sold without the shareholders agreeing to do so.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact that the Minister will examine this in more detail.  Senators Byrne and Walsh have tabled an expanded amendment for Report Stage.  It is clear from the Minister's response and from the contributions of others in the course of the past hour that what is in the Bill is more than likely insufficient.  I cannot understand how the Minister can say that any financing sought by Irish Water for investing in infrastructure will not be held against any assets of the company.  How can he say that?  Has the Government already sought private potential investors outside?</p> <p>The only way the Minister would know that is if Irish Water was already seeking expressions of interest in investment in water infrastructure.  I do not understand how the Minister can say that, in no way, shape or form, will there be any lien on any of the assets.  No one will be prepared to loan &euro;500 to &euro;700 million without some type of security, be it on the revenue stream or on the assets.  I will not labour the point but I do not understand how the Minister would know that.  If the Minister knows, then he should tell us.  If he has had initial discussions or preliminary discussions with private equity firms and investors we need to know that.  I am not against private investment, by the way, but we need to have that information.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to look at a further amendment on Report Stage but if the Minister reviews the discussion over the past half an hour or 40 minutes on this amendment, I think it shows very clearly that he will need to strengthen the provisions of the Bill in this regard, to include what Senator Byrne and my colleagues have proposed, which refers to any of the assets or part of the assets of Irish Water.  I ask the Minister to clarify this point further before we move on.</p></speech>

That is what I understand from what he said.  On what basis is the Minister conveying that information to the House?  Is it an opinion or is it based on, as our leader has asked, some discussion and negotiations with lenders, to ensure that the assets will not be secured and are therefore at risk?</p></speech>

It must be borne in mind that Irish Water is statutorily debarred from agreements which involve the transfer of its assets.  Therefore, it can only raise finance external to that by loans because it cannot be done by assets or equity.  I remind the Senator that is the premise because Irish Water is debarred by statute from transferring assets.  Those are the terms under which it must act.  Any future borrowing is based on its revenue model and it will have to raise finances in the furture.  The investment levels which will be needed in the future are quite huge and this is one of the primary reasons that Irish Water was established in the first place.</p></speech>

We propose that a resolution of each city and county council is passed approving the alienation.  For many years the local authorities had control over water services and the provision of water.  It is accepted that some local authorities did a very good job while others did not do as good a job.  I do not have a big problem with the creation of a single water utility, as such; I just have a problem with the way Irish Water was set up and the whole fiasco that went with it.  Whether multiple local authorities or a single water utility provide the service, we want an infrastructure and the ability of whatever organisation to provide people with good quality drinking water, and in my view, this should be provided without charges.  <br/>It used to be under the control of local government for many years.  While the Minister has ruled out any possibility of a constitutional referendum, he is sticking to the provisions in section 2 by which a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas would be required and followed by a plebiscite of the people.  We are seeking a provision in the Bill that there would need to be a resolution of each city and county council.  I do not think this is unreasonable.  The Minister stated earlier today when he was speaking on this issue that, &quot;over my dead body would Irish Water be privatised or water services be privatised or the shares be alienated&quot;.  If that is the logic of what he says, then surely he would not object to a local authority having its say.  Some local authorities are much larger due to amalgamation and they have, on average, 30 elected councillors who, in my view, should have their say.  If we want to make these provisions as watertight as possible - which the Minister says he does - then I do not see why allowing the city and county councils have their say would prove to be a difficulty.  Unfortunately it is a difficulty because I have listened to the Minister's Committee Stage discussions with Sinn F&eacute;in in the other House.  I was not at all persuaded by his arguments.  That is why we agreed we would re-table this amendment which Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh will second.  This is an important issue.  In our view local government has been devalued and has lost significant powers over many years.  This amendment would give local councils their rightful place and if there ever were to be a Government minded to privatise our water services a resolution would be required to be passed in each local authority in the State.  <br/>To follow the logic of what the Minister said earlier, that he cannot envisage any circumstances where any Government at any time in the future would ever consider privatising water services, then accepting this amendment should not matter to him as it provides another safeguard which fits with that logic.  I appeal to the Minister to listen to those points and to strengthen section 2 in as much as possible.  Any future Government can dispense with it in any case but if that is the road the Minister is going down and he has ruled out a constitutional referendum, we think that this amendment would add value to the section.  I await the Minister's response.</p></speech>

T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm bheith in ann labhairt ar an r&uacute;n agus ar an leas&uacute; &aacute;irithe seo at&aacute;im&iacute;d &aacute; chur chun cinn.  S&iacute;lim go bhfuil an t&aacute;bhacht a bhaineann le seo l&eacute;irithe go r&iacute;-shoil&eacute;ir ag mo chomhghleaca&iacute;, an Seanad&oacute;ir Cullinane.  I have been listening to the debate most of the day and I note some very interesting points raised.  Our amendment is in line with what the Minister has been saying with regard to ensuring that people know that both he and this Government are adamant they do not want to sell off Irish Water.</p><p>Many local politicians who are members of local authorities have significant experience with regard to the water infrastructure in their areas.  For example, in Galway and Mayo, a number of public meetings have been held on the issues around Irish Water and on the impact on group water schemes and non-group water schemes and on local authority housing.  Even though the water function has been taken out of the local authorities, the provision of water has a very great impact on other areas of the work of local authorities.  In my view they are very valid stakeholders in any future discussions about privatisation.  This point must be included in the debate about a plebiscite.  I refer to the democratic mandate of elected councillors.  If we really intend to put people first in this scenario, this amendment will provide a triple lock which would be very welcome and I cannot see why the Minister would not want to put it in place in order to reassure all those who do not believe what he said earlier.</p></speech>

A decision in a plebiscite represents the will of the people; it is a straight vote on a proposal.  The people will be asked to make the decision on the ownership of Irish Water in a plebiscite.  That is the best means to do it.  Accordingly, I will not support the amendment.</p></speech>

That is a clear contradiction of what he said in the past five hours.  I wish the people will have a say, but, unfortunately, they will not if any future Government is minded to do so.  We have discussed this issue <i>ad nauseam</i>and know the reality.  In the first instance, there would have to be a situation where a Government would be of a mind to privatise the service.  Second, the people would have their say in a plebiscite.  Taking this at face value and discarding the notion that any future Government would be of a mind to privatise water services would not in any way dilute or repeal section 2, why will the Minister not consider including a resolution of each House of the Oireachtas as also being required?  That would be a good development because the Seanad and the D&aacute;il should have their say and it would introduce several locks.  What about local authorities?  They always seem to be forgotten.  We are taking more power from them.  We gave them powers to nominate candidates to become President.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-12-19a.747" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1116" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="16:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014121900046#VV00200"><p>I move amendment No. 8:<br/>In page 4, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following:<blockquote>&ldquo;(8) The Forum established under <i>section 7 </i>of this Act shall not later than seven months after the passing of this Act, meet and consider a proposal to amend the Constitution of Ireland to incorporate a provision prohibiting the alienation of any share or shares in Irish Water or its assets or any part thereof and the Forum shall lay a copy of its recommendations in relation thereto before each House of the Oireachtas.<br />(9) Within one month of the recommendations of the Forum under <i>subsection (8) </i>being laid before each House of the Oireachtas, the Government shall outline to each House its proposals to implement the said recommendations of the Forum.&rdquo;.</blockquote>I have tabled this reasonable amendment to try to bridge the gap between the Seanad's powers on referenda and what the Minister is proposing.  As we have already acknowledged, the Seanad does not have the power to initiate a referendum to amend the Constitution.  Mar a d&uacute;ramar cheana, n&iacute;l an chumhacht ag an Seanad leas&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar an mBunreacht n&oacute; reacht a thos&uacute; sa tSeanad chun leas&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar an mBunreacht.  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir leas&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar an mBunreacht n&oacute; togra le sin a dh&eacute;anamh a chur i mBille eile n&oacute; ruda&iacute; eile uile.  The Seanad's powers are quite limited with respect to constitutional referenda.  We cannot initiate legislation to amend the Constitution and a proposal to amend the Constitution cannot be contained within other legislation.<br/>People are very frustrated that their amendments have been ruled out of order.  However, we are subject to the Constitution and we cannot do that and that is the reason.  As I said earlier, I would like us to be subject to the Constitution and I would like our successors in the Seanad, and the Oireachtas as well, whether it is in ten, 20 or 30 years time, to be subject to a constitutional prohibition on selling Irish Water or any of its assets.  We are looking for the prohibition on us initiating legislation to amend the Constitution to be imposed on both Houses of the Oireachtas and that both Houses would be prohibited from legislating to sell Irish Water or its assets.  The Minister has not accepted that.  He has gone for a plebiscite option which we say is deeply flawed.<br/>My proposal is to ask the water forum that the Minister establishes in this legislation to look at this issue in a manner similar to the constitutional convention.  I have suggested that it would report back within seven months.  The legislation provides that the regulator has six months to get the administration up and running, or to announce it is up and running.  I have therefore proposed seven months, to be reasonable about it.  I ask that the forum would lay a copy of its recommendations - its report - in relation to its consideration of a proposal to amend the Constitution - to incorporate the provision that Members are talking about - before each House of the Oireachtas, and the amendment then would call for the Minister, within one month of the forum laying its recommendations before the Houses of the Oireachtas, to outline to the Houses his proposals to implement the recommendations.<br/>I am trying to come half way in this amendment between what we want to do and what we cannot do, which is initiate a referendum.  We cannot do that in the Seanad.  What the Minister is suggesting, to hold a plebiscite, is deeply flawed.  This is a body that the Minister is setting up in this legislation.  The water forum has a specific function.  I grant that.  However, I suggest that we mandate it to statutorily do this, almost as a first task.  It would look at this issue, get advice, consider it and then it can come back to the Houses of the Oireachtas and then the Minister can come to us.  There is precedent for this - the constitutional convention.  There are, of course, alternatives to this.  The Constitutional Convention could be reconvened to discuss this.  The committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas could discuss this.  I am acknowledging in putting forward this amendment that there are issues concerning it.  Some issues have been raised, such as where does one stop.  Should the forest be protected?  Should the fish be protected?  Who should be protected in terms of an anti-privatisation agenda.  However, that is an issue for discussion and it can be discussed.</p> <p>How do we do it?  I think it is reasonable.  It is an attempt to come half way and the Minister should give it serious consideration.  I will listen to what the Minister has to say but I am interested in hearing what colleagues have to say.  Have they any other improvements to it or other alternatives they could suggest to meet the Minister half way?  </p></speech>

It is a decent attempt at meeting the Government half way and trying to strike that balance between the plebiscite, which Sinn F&eacute;in believes is flawed, the inability of the Seanad to propose a constitutional amendment, and all of the amendments that have been ruled out of order.  What is interesting about this amendment is that the Minister has said on a number of occasions that he has gone as far as he can in respect of giving a commitment to hold a plebiscite.  If the Minister had re-constituted the Constitutional Convention, set up a similar mechanism or allowed the forum, as this amendment suggests, to look at the issue of a constitutional referendum and all of the issues associated with it and ventilate all the concerns and issues that have been raised by the Minister and Government Senators as to why we cannot have a constitutional referendum or why it would be very difficult to do so, he would be able to say that the Government has done as much as it can.  In the absence of that, I do not believe the Minister has done what is possible.  This is a reasonable amendment and one that we will support.  The Minister should reflect on this.  I am guessing the Fianna F&aacute;il Senators may withdraw the amendment and resubmit it on Report Stage.  I will listen to what they and the Minister have to say.  The amendment is a genuine and decent attempt to do our best and use whatever mechanisms are open to us to make sure that there is a constitutional referendum as opposed to the plebiscite, which I also believe is flawed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-12-19a.750" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1115" speakername="Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014121900047#WW00300"><p>It is quite clear from the debate we have had for the past six or seven hours that a void exists in this debate regarding including protection for the water of Ireland in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  It is even clear in the comments generously put forward by the Minister.  It is also clear to those of us who are trying to find a resolution with regard to this that we must find a mechanism.  It will not be sufficient to just walk away knowing that there are issues, be they the legal advice from the Attorney General, the opportunity for us to hear that and debate it or whether it is a question of a plebiscite and the extent to which this plebiscite has been properly described or how it will operate.  There are so many issues outstanding.  I have seldom noticed so many inadequacies in a debate here.</p><p>It is also clear from Senator Byrne's comments that a huge effort is being made to accommodate the Minister and Government.  This is where we will be aware of whether or not the Minister and Government will accept in partnership co-operation from everybody in this House to find a solution to the logjam that exists.  The rationale and logic put forward by Senator Byrne cannot be ignored.  On one hand, we cannot put forward an amendment regarding a constitutional referendum.  This is as it is,  we are bound by that and there is no point in wasting too much time in that regard.</p><p>On the other hand, the Government can do that.  Interestingly, the Minister has said here on a number of occasions that he will go away and study seriously some of the points that are being made.  We take it in good faith that this is his intention.  That indicates that there are questions coming to the fore where the Minister is concerned as a result of the debate and the ideas and views.  He would not be saying that only for those questions arising.  I see no reason why it could not be done through the Constitutional Convention considering the seriousness of the issue and the passion the Minister showed in this Chamber today.  It is hugely serious.  Do we want to go away for the Christmas break and put people's minds at ease?  If we think closing down the Houses of the Oireachtas at Christmas will in some way close down the debate and put people's minds at ease, the Minister knows that is not true.  I have no doubt that when he gets down to Tipperary, many a person will want to have a word in his ear because of the uncertainty, suspicions and lack of trust which exists.  </p></speech>

I know it.  Everybody in this House is aware of that.  Given all the unanswered questions, doubts and lack of trust which seem to be coming forward in the messages we are receiving; what Senator Byrne said; and the work and thought he has put into this without standing up in any confrontational way - I admire his logic and it is quite clear he is trying to be helpful - would it not be wonderful if the Minister could make an announcement to the thousands of people who came out on to the streets and are worried and the thousands who have not yet taken to the streets?  Would it not be great if he was such a Minister that he was able to go out this evening and say that he had listened to what seemed a very informed debate, that questions were raised that he had to think about, which he has already admitted himself, and as a result of that, he will show himself as a new breed of Minister - independent-minded and listening to the people, which is what we are supposed to be about?  Would it not be wonderful if he went out and said that the Government would not road-block everything and that the idea of a forum or using the Constitutional Convention is a great idea?  Then all the questions that remain unanswered, all the information that was not provided to us today and all the doubts that are building up could all be focused in that forum.  Is there something unreasonable about that?  Is that not what we have been talking about all day - listening, reflecting and representing the people?  Is that not what we have all been saying?  Let us prove that we mean it when we say that.</p><p>The amendment put forward here is very reasonable.  It might be worthwhile at some stage to have a break in our deliberations and let the Minister go away and reflect, discuss with his officials, get on the phone and talk to An Taoiseach.  That is what it is about.  I would love to see democracy and the democratic process being opened up in that way and not stuck in straitjackets with people with whips lining us to put us into the seats.  That is what the people want.  If the Government wants to look at the polls, everybody is telling us and the media is reflecting the fact that a new type of politics taking centre stage.  There is no question about that.  </p></speech>

I see him sitting there and shaking his head saying he will refuse because the grey beards - the backroom boys - have told him to come here and reject everything because they have written the Bill and he is not to change it because if he does, they will really screw him up.  This is a wonderful idea.  The Minister cannot take a referendum amendment.</p> <p>In fairness to Senator Byrne, I am sorry he got to this before me.  It is a fine piece of work on his part.  It costs the Minister nothing to commit to this.  It allows for a review of the possibility of enshrining in the Constitution the desire that Irish Water be in the hands of the people forever.  The Minister has nothing to be afraid of.  He is a brave man to be here at all.  I would have expected him to have gone underground by now but he is a brave man and is sitting it out; fair play to him for that.  He should do the brave thing, follow the advice given to him by Senators Byrne and &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, take on board the amendment and show that he is a man.  He does not even belong to Fine Gael so he can go back and tell the Taoiseach he is not one of his boys and has just proved it.  I do not want to see the Minister unemployed after the next election.</p></speech>

We have debated today whether a referendum is required and the complexity of the matter.  Section 7 of the Bill, on the public water forum, presents what is actually a pretty good idea.  Should the Bill be passed, the forum will be established.  All Senator Byrne is doing is giving to the forum that is to be established the power to assess whether a referendum should or can be held on the public ownership of Irish Water.  The Minister would just be giving it another job to do.  Whether there should be a referendum could be decided independently by a group appointed by the Minister, irrespective of our debate and its merits.  It would consist of at least 12 and not more than 60 members, including a chairperson.  The Bill states the Minister shall appoint a person to be chairperson of the forum.  I await the Minister's response but genuinely cannot envisage any reason the amendment cannot be accepted.</p><p>In fairness to the Minister, his Labour Party colleagues in the House supported some weeks ago a motion tabled by a number of parties on a referendum.  Senator Gilroy said this earlier.  Since then, some questions may have arisen.  The best way to ensure the question of a referendum will be dealt with outside the political sphere and independently of Fianna F&aacute;il, the Labour Party, Fine Gael, Sinn F&eacute;in or the Independents is to let the public water forum consider it.  I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.  The only reason for not accepting it is simply because it would discommode the D&aacute;il as it would have to come back on Tuesday.  That cannot be the reason for not accepting it.  What Senator Byrne has proposed is eminently sensible.  It will actually assist the Minister.  I am interested in hearing what he has to say.</p></speech>

I had a long chat this morning with Senator Byrne about this amendment.  It is a decent attempt to reach some sort of compromise on the matter.  I have put a lot of thought into this since we spoke this morning.  While I feel I should support the amendment, I have one or two genuine questions that mean I cannot support it in its current form.  I will explain why if the Members opposite can listen without tut-tutting and whatever else they want to do.</p><p>Section 7, which establishes the public water forum, is probably not the right forum for dealing with this subject.  The very thrust of the forum concerns customer participation, customer advice and customer protection in an operational away.  I do not believe we could constitute the forum such that it would have the expertise needed to examine the intricacies of a constitutional referendum.  That needs to be done by a specific body with the required legal expertise and authority.  For that reason, I will not support the amendment as it stands.</p><p>The other argument concerns what body should have responsibility.  I believe it should be the Constitutional Convention.  However,</p></speech>

We would be obliging it to consider something it may feel is not appropriate.  The Senators opposite may shake their heads but my remarks comprise a genuine attempt to address the concerns that arise.  If we want to start slagging each other across the floor, that is fine, but Senator Thomas Byrne and I sat down this morning and had a long chat about this, as he will confirm.  We entered into our conversation in a spirit of trying to seek a resolution.</p><p>Instead of having to legislate for sending this to a constitutional convention-type organisation, perhaps the Minister, as a member of the Cabinet, could give some sort of non-legislative commitment to consider doing so.  That might address everyone's problem instead of tying up our institutions by some form of what would necessarily be tightly scripted legislation.  It is not appropriate to send the matter to the forum under section 7, nor is it appropriate to legislate for sending it to the Constitutional Convention.  However, the matter could be considered by the Cabinet.  Perhaps the Minister will commit to this and, if he feels it is appropriate, the matter could be referred, in non-legislative way, to the Constitutional Convention.</p></speech>

My concern over section 7 is that the public water forum could end up comprising narrow vested interests.  The Constitutional Convention has a track record, albeit a slow one.  However, we can see that the recommendations of the convention since the beginning have resulted in referenda, and will result in referenda on the age of citizens eligible to run in presidential elections and marriage equality.</p><p>I would like the Minister to consider, either now or on Report Stage, what kind of response is required.  He has put his views on the record, both in the D&aacute;il and very clearly in the Seanad.  Unlike some of my colleagues in the Seanad, I am an Independent.  Senator Norris should note that this means we differ constantly in the way we vote.</p></speech>

It is in the nature of being an Independent Senator that one will differ from other Senators in how one votes.  I have a better and stronger record than Senator Norris on this occasion.  </p><p>To return to Senator Gilroy's suggestion, I had the privilege of being part of the precursor to the Constitutional Convention, the We the Citizens movement, which examined evidence-based results regarding how a constitutional assembly with 100 members can deliberate and make tough and clear decisions over a defined period.  The vexed issue of ownership of Irish Water is one that concerns all 60 Senators and the Minister who has been clear on the matter.  We are trying to find a way to convince and reassure the citizens we represent or with whom we engage and work that public ownership of Irish Water will be maintained and the company will not transfer to private hands without eligible voters taking a decision to permit such a transfer.  </p><p>On Second Stage, I set out the reasons I am in favour of holding a plebiscite.  I acknowledge, however, the reasonable point made by Senator Byrne on how we can assuage public anxiety on this issue.  I and Senator Mary Ann O'Brien, my colleague on the Independent benches, have frequently voted on different sides when the House divided.</p></speech>

A convention of 100 people could show a greater sense of difference and discretion.</p></speech>

I accept that the Attorney General has advised that the idea of enshrining public ownership of Irish Water in the Constitution by means of a referendum could give raise to serious complications.  Having heard the Minister's argument on that issue loud and clear, I will not press that option.  However, the Government must consider the ongoing anxiety about public ownership of Irish Water.  To assuage this anxiety, the Minister should examine the possibility of finding a halfway house, as it were, between Senator Byrne's interesting amendment and a public water forum. </p></speech>

I have never known that to happen so what makes anyone think it would happen now?  It is rubbish to believe this would be done before Christmas or in response to reasonable arguments made by the eminent Senator Byrne.  Reasonable arguments do not matter a fish's tit in this place.  The Senator is wasting his time and whistling in the dark.  I do not know why he is doing it.  Perhaps he is posturing or hoping that some member of the gullible public is watching this debate online.  There must be very few members of the working class left if they are spending the whole afternoon this display of political imbecility.

The Minister should accept this amendment and allow the debate to proceed.  If, as he states, he is sincere about listening, I ask him to show sincerity by accepting the amendment and allow a forum to consider this issue for seven months.  The amendment does not dictate what the Minister must do but states what the forum should do.  Surely the Minister would have more control over such a forum than the Seanad would have.  It will lead me to doubt his words if he cannot make a gesture and defer the decision on this matter to the forum.  I await his reply.</p></speech>

The United Kingdom established a citizen's charter that is founded on feedback from citizens.  While it could be argued that Parliament, whether in the Seanad or D&aacute;il, can provide feedback, that is in the eye of the beholder because such feedback would amount to anecdotal information coming from Members.</p><p>Senator Byrne's proposal would provide a statutory footing to a forum that would relay information from citizens on what types of services they want.  This is what public service is all about.  The Senator has hit the nail on the head on this issue.  People deserve a say in what type of future they want for themselves and their children.  Politics is often about taking a narrow approach where one looks six months ahead or to the next election.  What about looking forward to 2030 or 2040 or creating a vision that would give everyone an equal say on what type of country they want, whether in respect of water, roads, schools, education or jobs? </p> <p> It is time politics changed in this country.  What Senator Byrne is proposing touches on a new type of politics.  Prior to the last general election people spoke of a new type of politics but suddenly the next election is fast approaching and this new politics has drastically diminished.  This is sad.  We can speak about reforming the public service, but we will never reform it if we do not first reform politics.  When those at the top of the Civil Service at the top are answerable to the Minister and the needs of the Minister, the future direction or vision of the public service will always be the direction of the politics of the day.</p></speech>

I got an understanding from the Minister, as he nodded his head, that he would consider changes if he heard something.  He may tell me he has found nothing.  Senator Craughwell tabled an amendment which was not allowed, but Senator Byrne has found a way to allow the same thing to be achieved.  This is an example of where the Minister can keep his word, which he gave me last night.</p></speech>

It was a good debate.  In all honesty, I say to Senator Quinn that I stand by the commitment I have given with regard to anything brought forward.  I do not say these things for the sake of it.  However, it must be for the right reason.  I can see the logic behind the amendment tabled by Senator Byrne, but there is a problematic core issue.  The amendment states the forum established under section 7 of the Bill shall, not later than seven months after the passing of the Bill, meet and consider proposals to amend the Constitution of Ireland, but as I outlined a number of hours ago the Government does not believe this is the course of action to take.  The Government has gone through this.</p></speech>

It is not necessary and not the route to go down.</p><p>I welcome the comments made on the forum.  In fairness, Senators of all political colours have said it is a good idea.  I very much welcome this, and when we will discuss the section later I will welcome Senators supporting it.  All that is in the Bill is the principle of it.  The regulations on what will be in the forum will be decided later.  It is my intention to make proposals and send them to the joint Oireachtas committee and let it come back to me on it.  This is the right and appropriate way to deal with what should be in the forum and what it should discuss.</p><p>The forum will not be about constitutional issues.  I will come back to the amendment.  The forum will be about customers, feedback to Irish Water, Irish Water's capital investment plan, strategies and priorities, and what it is doing wrong and right.  Many changes have been made in Irish Water in recent months.  There has been a vast improvement with regard to customer feedback and how it deals with customers, and this was necessary.  I had to have very difficult conversations with Irish Water.  Representatives of Irish Water are in the AV room every week and this is not by accident.  There is a new line for Oireachtas Members to call Irish Water.</p></speech>

Senators have asked me to reflect - and they can laugh if they want - but I can only be honest with them.  I will examine whether there is a process whereby the constitutional convention, or another body perhaps not of that scale, could examine this and what the Government is proposing.  I must speak to Cabinet colleagues about it.</p></speech>

It will be prescribed after I send regulations to the joint Oireachtas committee and it sends them back to me, and then the forum will be established.  It is for customers to give feedback on Irish Water's plans.  I do not believe it is necessary to amend the Constitution on this issue, and I do not believe I can accept an amendment which proposes this, considering what I already outlined in very clear terms with regard to how far the Government is going on the plebiscite and all of these issues.  In light of the amendment, the spirit of the House and the time of the year I will reflect on it, speak to my Government colleagues and see whether there is a process or forum which can discuss this item.</p></speech>

It is a pity it was not done months ago.  If it had been done and the Minister had such discussions with his Cabinet colleagues we might be in a very different position whereby the Minister would be bringing forward a Government amendment which established a mini-constitutional convention which would have allowed us discuss how we would hold a constitutional referendum on this issue.  This is the point we have been making for the past six or seven hours.  This is exactly where we want to be with regard to all of the complexity involved and the potential unintended consequences about which the Minister spoke earlier.  I do not know whether the Minister has just made a genuine offer.  It has struck me that up to now the Government has not been interested in ever holding a constitutional referendum prior to any intention to sell privatise Irish water.</p><p>I accept the forum may not be the best body to make such a recommendation.</p> <p>What the amendment calls for is not a binding recommendation on the Government, but that the forum would "consider" and then "recommend", and like the Constitutional Convention, the Government could then accept the recommendation or not.</p><p>It is regrettable that we are in a situation where we have now, at the eleventh hour, had an offer from the Minister to go back to his Cabinet colleagues.  It is never too late.</p></speech>

Had the Minister done this earlier, he might not be in the mess he is in now.  Why could he not have done that months ago, when the Cabinet met on the issue of the ownership of water and whether we needed a constitutional referendum?  Whether something could be done was obviously discussed.  The Government had the advice from the Attorney General and knew this was an issue and that there was demand from the public for it.  Why was the option of a mini constitutional convention not agreed at the Cabinet then so that we could have that debate and a recommendation could be made, which the Government could accept or reject?</p><p>I welcome the commitment the Minister is now giving to go back and look at that, but my problem is all of the promises made and the number of times previous Ministers have said that if we pass a Bill, they will reconsider the situation.  We were told that in regard to the water charges plan.  I remember a lengthy debate last year in the Seanad when we said we wanted to know what the water charges plan involved and how it would work and we were told to trust the Commission for Energy Regulation and let it make the decision.  However, the Government came along and ripped that plan up and did its own thing anyway.</p><p>If the Minister is serious about going back to his Cabinet colleagues and asking them to reflect on this, the logic is that we would not pass this Bill.  Why would we pass the Bill and then hope the Minister will get something from his Cabinet colleagues?  What the Minister has done is to let the cat out of the bag.  What he said up to now is that this was not possible and that he had gone as far as he could.  However, he has now said that he will go back and talk to his Cabinet colleagues about the possibility of some forum that could look at this.  This indicates to me that the Minister has not gone as far as he could have gone.  Clearly he has not; otherwise, why is he giving this commitment now?</p><p>I welcome the commitment at one level, but I question why it was not made a lot earlier and wonder whether it is just another attempt to get some of the Independent Senators on board.</p></speech>

This was good as we should hear every opinion here.  He had an addendum to his contribution, that when the Minister came in today, he would hold his counsel until he saw the reaction we would get from the Minister on the amendments being put before the House.</p><p>Many of us get weary of the cut and thrust of political debate here and of the &quot;them&quot; and  &quot;us&quot; syndrome between government and opposition and the posturing and choreography inevitably and invariably ends up in a cul-de-sac.</p></speech>

However, the Minister is beginning to hear positions here that he did not hear in the D&aacute;il.  I watch the body and face language and the responses we are getting and get the feeling a new narrative is being provided here to the Minister.  The first chink of light I got out of all of this that gave me some hope came from Senator Gilroy today, when I heard him put forward a new position.  He suggested that while it may not be in the legislation, he would support a forum like a constitutional convention.</p><p>This has broadened the debate beyond our expectations and the Minister's response also came as quite a surprise to me.  I agree fully with Senator Cullinane that if we had received those responses yesterday and before the Bill concluded in the D&aacute;il, we would be having a totally different debate.</p></speech>

What would be helpful at this stage to decide our position on the amendment - this is up to Senator Byrne to decide - would be for the Minister to formalise what he has said in some way.  That might provide a worthwhile position to Senator Quinn and would certainly help Fianna F&aacute;il.  Above all else coming up to Christmas, it would send a message from Seanad &Eacute;ireann to the people who are waiting to know what is going to happen that we realise that if they went out in their tens of thousands of people in inclement weather and at short notice, that was only the tip of the iceberg.  If we went down to the communities, we would see the same situation and that way the figure of those who say they will not pay the water charges is way beyond the 30% stated in the polls.  It could be 50% or 60%.  Therefore, we cannot treat this legislation in the normal posturing way when we come in here to debate it.  We cannot just know the Government's position and then just do what the Whips tell us.</p><p>I hope that, for once, Seanad &Eacute;ireann, which was saved by the electorate, will now respond to its concerns.   The lack of trust, the suspicions of the people and the 4,000 messages that we have been getting from the public are only the tip of the iceberg.  I have been a Senator for 17 years and I have never experienced anything like this before.  We are dealing with a totally new position.  If what the Minister is now saying is that there is a possibility, if not in the forum, in the Constitutional Convention, we can, after eight hours debate, take some consolation from the fact that we are taking steps towards an inclusion of a provision in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann and we are making progress.  Can the Minister formalise this in some way for us today?  This would be the best thing the Seanad ever did and would reflect what the people expect of us.  Above all else, it would return, rescue and salvage some credibility for the political system if this was to happen here in this august assembly this evening.</p></speech>

He was not aware that two Members of this House are in favour, to some extent, of privatisation and thought everybody was in favour of the forum.  I am not a bit in favour of it and believe it is a waste of time.  It is a talking shop - a load of hoo-ha.</p><p>I have a bit of news for the Minister; the Constitutional Convention is over.  It is kaput.  This caring, listening Government did not pay a blind bit of odds to something that went through with 98% support in the convention, the opening up of the Presidency to the will of the people and to nomination, in some form, by the people.  I was accused by a Government spokesman of having a personal interest in that, but I have no intention of going next nor nigh the Presidency again.  I am far too bloody old for a start.  It is up to younger people to do that job.</p><p>I have an issue with regard to the use of the word &quot;customer&quot;.  Customers are usually voluntary.  We have not volunteered for this.  We did not all rush up to Irish Water and say, &quot;Please, take us on as customers&quot;.  We were involuntarily enlisted into this damnable entity.  The Minister has said he will reflect on the issues and consider them.  I am sure he will look at them, but he will do damn all.  He cannot do anything.  I know the Minister's hands are tied, but they are pretty firmly tied if he cannot even take a proposal to allow the forum to &quot;consider&quot; an appeal.  Hello, is there anybody out there?  That is not extravagant and should not stretch the political muscles too far.  I am not taken in by this charade at all.  In fact, I am considering going home quite soon.</p></speech>

I am not going to match that style of speech.</p> <p>This was a genuine attempt to use a vehicle in the Bill to come halfway between our position and the position of the Government.  Labour Party Senators did a brave thing in supporting a Seanad motion calling for the non-privatisation of Irish Water.  This is one way we can put that into action.  We cannot initiate legislation in the Seanad, but let us have some action.</p><p>Like Senator Norris, I hate the word &quot;customer,&quot; but that is the word used in the legislation.  The forum is tasked with complicated functions, including providing comments and suggestions to the Commission for Energy Regulation on the performance by Irish Water of its functions, and commenting on any policy document produced by Irish Water or any consultation document produced by the commission in respect of public water and waste water services.  That is highly technical work, as the legislation recognises in the provision that the commission shall provide the forum with administrative services, including technical advice.  The legislation envisages that the forum will carry out a wide range of complicated and technical work, and I am simply mandating it with one other function pertaining to the Constitution.  I presume the commission will be able to provide the legal advisors necessary to help the forum with that task.</p><p>I think it is a reasonable amendment and I thank my colleagues for their support.  I fear some Members opposite are trying to kill the amendment with kindness and I urge them to be radical.  I ask the Minister to forget about 23 December.  I presume he will be in Dublin that day.  If the Parliament is called, Members have to be here.  That should not be a consideration.  The Minister has one other option under section 7, which allows him to order the forum to carry out activities in respect of such other matters as specified by ministerial order.  He could order the forum to consider my proposal without amending the legislation.  If he was able to assure me that he will have a draft order prepared by Monday, I would certainly withdraw my amendment.  Otherwise, I am afraid I will have to press it to a vote.  I urge Labour Party Members to think carefully about their previous vote and ask Independent Senators to carefully consider what I have done.  This is their only opportunity to put their kind words about the amendment into practice.</p></speech>

As we tire, he is becoming more reasonable and we are becoming more demanding.  It is not a big demand.  Senator Byrne's amendment does not seek a recommendation on a constitutional referendum from the forum; it merely provides that the forum may consider the matter and bring a recommendation to the Government.  I understand the Minister has to take his instructions.</p></speech>

I have stated that a referendum is a red-line issue for me.  It is a red-line issue in all the text messages I have received today.  This is an opportunity to get over that hurdle.  If it is the case that, as Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; observed, the Government has no intention of accepting any amendment, I ask the Minister to tell us now so that we can all go home before taking Report Stage on Monday.  That would put us all out of our misery.  There is no point in continuing this charade if none of our amendments will be accepted.

The Minister has repeatedly claimed that he is sincerely and genuinely listening and that he will accept any reasonable amendment.  With respect to Senator Byrne, he is offering the weakest possible amendment.  The Minister need do nothing but consider it.  If he does not have the power to permit a forum to consider something, it is absolutely pathetic.  He indicated that the forum was about customer feedback rather than constitutional issues.  Has he heard the cry of the conscripted customer who does not want water to be privatised?  That cry is loud and clear.  Is he listening to that feedback?  He has just said "No."</p></speech>

At the end of the day, actions will speak louder than words.  This amendment would allow the forum to consider the issue of keeping water as a public resource.  It will be given seven months to consider that issue.  If the Minister does not have that power, I am concerned.  I accept that he may wish to consult his Cabinet colleagues on this, but we will press the amendment.  We cannot let anybody have the right to our water.  We cannot allow a chink that would make further room for privatisation.  That fear exists.  The Minister's words matter, but he must act on them.</p></speech>

The Minister acknowledges that it may provide a way of responding to public concern in this regard.  I suggested earlier to Senator Byrne that this might not be the correct section for the amendment.  Given that it is about the public forum, perhaps it should be in section 7.  The Minister indicated that an amendment of this nature might not be appropriate to the terms of reference of the forum.  As Senator Byrne noted, the terms of reference for the forum provide that it can carry out activities in respect of such other matters as the Minister by order specifies.  The Minister suggested that it might not even be possible to give that kind of order to the forum, but under section 7 he has the power to request it to carry out other activities.  I welcome that he ended his contribution by indicating that he would explore this issue with his colleagues.</p> <p>That is what the Minister said when the Labour Party Senators voted in favour of the Government bringing forward legislation for a constitutional referendum to ensure public ownership of Irish Water.  The motion was not that the Government would consider bringing forward legislation but that it would bring forth legislation.  The Minister said that he would explore that with his colleagues and he did so but that did not work out and we now find ourselves here again debating the issue.  </p><p>I would be more satisfied - perhaps my colleagues would be too - if the Minister were to tell us that he is determined to find a way for this issue to be discussed within some kind of public forum and will bring recommendations in that regard to the Oireachtas.  The Minister said that he went as far he could in terms of getting Government agreement on a plebiscite.  Unlike Senator Cullinane, I do not believe that if the Minister went to Government and indicated he was determined to find a way to do that, he would be contradicting what he said earlier.  I would love to hear him say that he is determined to find a way for this issue to be discussed within some kind of public forum and will bring back to the Houses of the Oireachtas a proposal in that regard.</p></speech>

The Minister is a young man.  Some of the comments made appear to hint that because he is a young man he is easy capture and prey for the officials.  I have known the Minister for 20 years.  He is no easy prey for anybody in the Customs House.  Anybody there who thought they could capture the Minister got a surprise.  I would prefer if Senators do not allow that tone to creep into the debate.</p></speech>

In my view, Senator Zappone has probably made the most sense today.  I would welcome the Minister's comments on what she had to say.  For the Minister to say that he will consider the possibility of a referendum or appoint a person or body to do so does not mean that he has backtracked on anything he already said.  It is only possible to speak to the amendment as drafted.  If we want to do our job properly, that is what we have to do.</p></speech>

I suggest that the proposer of the amendment go away and redraft it in a way that, perhaps, Labour Party Senators, who have supported the idea of a referendum, might well be able to support.

I have been involved long enough in local government and the Seanad for some years to be realistic and pragmatic.  We could debate this issue until 6 a.m. or, as stated earlier by Senator Craughwell, the Minister could put us out of our misery now by stating what to me is becoming apparently obvious, namely, that the Government is not prepared to give an inch on this.  Government wants this House to conclude its debate on this legislation by Monday, with no reconvening of the D&aacute;il.  We all know the truth: let us move on.</p></speech>

For that reason, if we cannot formalise it somewhat more, the possibility is that the amendment might be passed by the House.</p><p>The Minister is filling the role well for us.  As he rightly said, he has sat here in the Seanad with us.  I have never seen him being cynical about Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  If there were some way of bridging that distance between us, it would be certainly good for the Seanad.  It would also be good for democracy.</p></speech>

However, the Minister is genuine in his attention to this issue.  He has gone some way to meet our concerns.  I regret the fact that it was not done sooner and we could have been in a different position today.  The Minister has said he will consider some forum to consider a constitutional amendment and make a recommendation to Government as to whether it should be done.  The difficulty is if we pass this Bill by Monday but the Minister has not come back with anything solid.  If he came back with something solid on Report Stage on Monday, he would have genuinely listened to Seanad &Eacute;ireann and met us halfway.  He would give expression to what he has said and it would give expression to the sincerity of what he has said.  Is it possible for him to come back with a government amendment for Report Stage on Monday?  If he did, I would see that as a huge step forward and to be commended.</p></speech>

The intentions of both sides of the House are identical.  It is the matter of achieving them that we are examining.  We need to pay close attention to Minister&rsquo;s comments on the establishment of a forum model to discuss other constitutional issues.  By pushing this vote on a matter on which there is very little distance between us risks shutting the door on the innovation the Minister has demonstrated.  I urge the amendment is not pressed.  It is not reasonable for Senator Cullinane to ask the Minister to come back by Monday with the cast-iron guarantee he needs.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-12-19a.964" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1131" speakername="Fidelma Healy Eames" time="18:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014121900057#GGG00400"><p>I move amendment No. 17:<blockquote><br />In page 6, line 7, to delete &ldquo;1 January 2015&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the date of completion of the national water meter installation programme&rdquo;.</blockquote>The Bill states: &quot;Where a dwelling is provided with a water meter installed by Irish Water and, at any time after 1 January 2015...&quot;.  The Bill references everything commencing on 1 January 2015.  I am not objecting to the substance of this paragraph but I do object to the commencement date.  I am proposing that that line be changed from 1 January 2015 to the date of the completion of the national water meter installation programme.<br/>Yesterday the Minister said that over 530,000 meters have been installed and that we are about one third of the way through that process.  In other words, two thirds of the country remain to be covered with meters.  I listened to the Minister say he believed that metering was the fairest way forward and that the OECD confirmed that.  I agree that metering is the way forward but this programme should not start in any shape or form until the national water meter installation programme has been completed.  That is the thrust of my amendment.<br/>One of the features of this Bill from the start of the entire water programme is that it has been rushed and pushed, and that has got people's backs up.  People need time to consider such a major change.  It is universal.  It is not just piecemeal; it has to be universal.  <br/>In the course of this debate this evening I got an e-mail from a family who asked me to please persist.  It stated they were really scared, that they have an eight year old autistic son with chronic eczema and that they run four baths a day.  He has to change his clothes a few times a day as he destroys himself at meal times.  They asked me to imagine their water bill.  That is just one person's story.  That is extreme in terms of having to run four baths a day to manage eczema.  I had a niece with eczema.  I saw what my sister's family had to go through to deal with that.  Thankfully, in some cases they grow out of it.<br/>People need to get used to the idea that they will now have to budget for water.  We know there is a flat charge proposed to 2019.  I asked the Minister yesterday if he could confirm that that charge could be maintained post-2019 and that at the same time there could be an investment in infrastructure.  I did not get an answer.  I put that question to the Minister of State because people are afraid what the costs will be once the embargo on the flat charge is lifted, and I believe with some reason.<br/>The amendment simply seeks that this provision would not start on 1 January 2015 but when the national water meter installation programme has been completed.  This is a huge change for everybody to come to terms with and if we are to be fair and serious about conservation we need to give people the opportunity to have meters to measure usage and that after their meters are installed they would be given at least two terms during which they would get readings.  The first reading would show what they used in the previous three months and would indicate whether they were above or below the national average for a family of that size.  If they were above that it might perhaps be due to leaks because leaks cannot be detected by the naked eye.  Many of them can be underground.  I presume Irish Water staff will be equipped with leak detection equipment and would move then to fix that leak.  The second reading would indicate to a family that their usage is now at the average for that family size.  After that it is fair that there would be a charge for water.<br/>Time is needed for this and in that regard this is a reasonable amendment.  It states that once the national water meter installation programme is finished, it should then commence allowing two readings to be given to each family in the country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-12-19a.965" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1133" speakername="David Cullinane" time="18:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014121900057#GGG00500"><p>I will be supporting the amendment.  Unfortunately, any amendment which sought to remove the water charges completely has been ruled out of order, so that is that.  We might return to those discussions when we get to the section but the amendments still in play, which have not been ruled out of order, seek to delay the introduction of the charges.  Any amendment that seeks to delay the introduction of the charges should be welcomed, and I will support it.</p><p>Thirteen months ago when we discussed the first Water Services Bill one of the difficulties I had with being asked to pass that Water Services Bill was that we were not being told what the water charges would involve.  During the lengthy discussion with the Minister at the time, which was the then Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, who did most of the hearings, he said we had to trust the Government and the Commission for Energy Regulation, which is the independent body that would examine water charges.  He said it would come back with a fair proposal, as he saw it.  It was a case of nothing to see here.  There was no concern or panic.  The view was that any concerns raised in respect of the charges were irrational, that we were being hysterical, whipping up sentiment and so on.</p></speech>

We have had a long day and Senators are getting all hot and bothered.  We had the same nonsense when we debated the previous two Water Services Bills.  Afterwards Senators put up their hands and said they had made a mistake, but they did not allow proper scrutiny of the legislation at the time.  I ask them to at least respect the fact that other Members have things to say and this is the place in which to do so, not when the Bill has been passed.  I do not want anyone to ask afterwards, "Why did you not raise the matter?"  We should, therefore, be respected, as we have a job to do and we will do it.  If any Senator does not like this, that is a matter for him or her.</p><p>The amendment seeks to delay the introduction of the charges because by replacing the date of 1 January 2015, the day on which the Government wants to introduce them, with the words &quot;the date of completion of the national water meter installation programme&quot;.

When Members of the Opposition raised concerns and issues about the Bill, the Government replied by saying, &quot;Trust us; there is not going to be an issue with charges.&quot;  There are huge issues with them.  I have monitored the debate all day and have made to contribute when I felt it was important to do so.  The crux of the issue concerns when water usage will be metered and when people will be charged.  As Senator David Cullinane has said, we oppose the notion of imposing a water tax in the first place, but we sense that the Government will railroad the Bill through in order to introduce charges.  Any measure that would delay the process would be welcome; therefore, we support the amendment because it proposes to postpone the charges until &quot;the date of completion of the national water meter installation programme&quot;.  This is a very important amendment.</p><p>The Government has not grasped, from the marches in Dublin and in regional towns, that the people oppose the principle of it charging them for water and the commodification of water.  I do not think the issue is how little or how much the Government will charge, a point on which Sinn F&eacute;in differs very much with Fianna F&aacute;il. There are other ways of raising revenue to run the water system, rather than imposing a water tax.</p><p>Another problem with a water tax is that it is completely regressive and unfair.  I am sick to the back teeth listening to some Government representatives say in the national media and in the Houses that it is only &euro;3 per week.  Yesterday on Second Stage I relayed the point which had been made by a woman who had telephoned me about the matter.  She has nothing to do with and is unconnected to my political party, but she was involved with one of the other parties.  She is a single mother and has two teenage daughters.  She is in a very difficult position because she is not working and depends on the State to help her to make ends meet.  We are in the run-up to Christmas and she has asked me to relay her story.  She has asked me to state &euro;3 per week makes a huge difference to her, that it is an awful lot of money in her pocket and is the difference in not putting a meal on her table one day a week.</p></speech>

I think the issue of people's ability to pay has not been grasped by the Government.  I suggest that if it pushes this Bill through, it will see an escalation of the campaign of peaceful protests in housing estates across the country against the installation of water meters.  That will work against the Government's hope that people will back down and this thing will go away after Christmas.  If there is an escalation of this campaign, the Government will come under more pressure.  It is possible that people who have been in favour of registering with Irish Water and paying their bills will turn against that principle.  That is why I support this amendment.  It would have been preferable if a Bill had been introduced to remove water charges completely and establish a utility as we have suggested.  Obviously, the Government is not doing that.  As parliamentarians who represent all the people who have contacted us on this issue, our job is to propose measures that can be taken.  The Minister has not grasped the inability to pay question.  As my colleague, Senator Reilly, outlined yesterday, people out there are really strapped, especially coming up to Christmas.  The Minister really needs to rethink his strategy.</p></speech>

We all accept and understand that metering is an integral component of what we are trying to achieve in terms of conservation and usage.  The removal of the conservation and usage elements of this project weakens precisely what we are trying to achieve.  It seems to me that it would make a great deal of sense to pull out all the stops and push forward with all the metering.  I know there are difficulties in accessing the meters because they are underground and difficult to access.  I found that hard to understand.  I really saw a great deal of merit in metering, particularly for families.  I thought that people should have been able to see their meters quite easily - they should have been very accessible - just like any other meter they might have in their houses.  I think we should put that at the top of the agenda at this time.  I believe the only way we can do that is through the amendment that has been put before us here.  I think that if we delay overall the implementation of what is required, all the stops will be pulled out in that regard.  I have to say I am a little worried about what will happen if we do not prioritise in this case.  I think it will be sidelined and put on the back burner.  Then we will move ahead again with a very fragmented and disjointed plan.  An integral component, like the engine of a car, will be missing.  I look forward to hearing what the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, has to say on this as well.  The knee-jerk reaction to the difficulties we have and the protests on the streets does not necessarily give us the best way forward.  I think we will come back here in a year or two to ask for an update on metering.  Questions will also be asked about how we measure conservation.  That will be an ongoing debate.  Families will be worried about the whole question of usage.  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh referred to the point made by a person who contacted him.  We heard a similar anecdote earlier from Senator Healy Eames.  These are human reactions and human issues.  They are not grandstanding like us.  It is none of that really.  These human issues relate to people who have serious problems with children and so on.  I would love to get down to the human aspect of this-----</p></speech>

Some strong views have been expressed from all sides.  This debate has focused everyone's attention on the real value of water as a precious resource.</p><p>I would like to pay specific attention to the case raised by Senator Healy Eames.  There will always be exceptional cases involving people with medical conditions.  The measures taken by the Government through the capped charge will address such cases.  People with medical needs or conditions who need to use additional water will have certainty that the maximum charge will apply until 1 January 2019.  I would like to make it clear to the Senator that the Bill also allows the maximum charge to apply after 2019.  Provision has been made in section 3(5) of the Bill to address the Senator's concerns in that regard.</p><p>I would like to contribute to the argument about why metering is needed.  Senators will accept that meters are in every country in Europe at this stage.  I understand that 35,000 of them have been installed in Northern Ireland.  It is recognised nationally that when meters are installed, water conservation measures improve, water usage reduces and people's minds focus on their individual use of water.  That is important.  People with meters will get their bills capped at &euro;160 for individual households and &euro;260 for multiple households.  This could be lower if metered water usage is monitored.  As people get their meters, they can qualify for a rebate if their water usage is below the level at which the capped charge applies.  We do not want such people to be disadvantaged.</p><p>On the specific question of the Senator's amendment, this subsection provides for a system whereby a rebate can be made to a customer on a capped charge where they have a meter installed after 1 January 2015.  That is the correct date as no charges can be levied before that date.  The acceptance of this amendment would lead to a delay in the availability of the rebate to people.  If the date was to be pushed much further back, it would be unfair to people who have meters, are monitoring their water usage and are entitled to a rebate.  In our view, this would not be acceptable.  For that reason, we cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-12-19a.1063" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1136" speakername="David Norris" time="18:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014121900059#JJJ00700"><p>I would like to deal specifically with this amendment.  Section 3(13) of the Bill provides that "where a dwelling is provided with a water meter installed by Irish Water and, at any time after 1 January 2015, the average annual volume of water provided by Irish Water to that dwelling is found to be such that the charge for that volume, calculated in accordance with the approved water charges plan as provided for in this section, would be less than the maximum charge provided under subsection (3) which has been paid by a customer of Irish Water, then the customer who is charged for the provision to that dwelling of the water consumed is entitled to one and one only rebate".  The effect of this amendment would be to push that date out further.  Nothing could be clearer than that this causes a potential charge on the Exchequer.  I stand on that.  It is absolutely blindingly obvious.  I ask the Cathaoirleach to accept that with the best will possible, there is an error in his ruling.  If he is not able to accept that, could this be referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges?  I am tired of many judgments and decisions of the Chair which seem to be arbitrary and capricious.  There is no question of doubt, as far as I am concerned, that this creates a potential charge on the Exchequer.  It must do because if the intention of this section is to avoid the payment of more than one rebate, the deferral of that provision would clearly, absolutely and obviously cause a potential charge on the Exchequer.  There is no question of doubt about that.  I say this without wishing to be impertinent or to challenge the Chair's ruling in an aggressive way.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, for answering the questions.  I am grateful that he has acknowledged the difficult circumstances that some families are in.  The effect on me when I heard the charge was not coming in on 1 October and then perhaps on 1 January was striking.  I was relieved and took the view that at least it was not another thing to worry about, if only for a few months.  I will explain why.  I was talking about myself, but let us imagine what is it like for families who are trying to juggle so much, including mortgages, debt and the costs associated with children.  To be honest, water is well down the pecking order, but it is another thing to worry about.</p><p>Of course, the biggest issue for families is that we do not know how much leaks will cost to repair.  I realise the first leak is meant to be paid for, but unless there is a gradual lead-in to the charge, instead of bringing it in in one fell swoop, it will be a worrying time for families.  The Minister of State commented on how, in respect of a family with a sick child or a child with difficulties who needs large amounts of water, the maximum charge could apply post-2019.  Can the Minister of State explain that?  I do not fully understand it.  Will the Minister of State outline the maximum charge and clarify whether it could apply post-2019?</p><p>More worrying is another point that shows the inequity in this Bill.  It is something I had not noticed before, although perhaps others have.  Is the Minister of State suggesting that the rebate would only apply after the meter is installed?  I heard the Minister say that.  Does everyone else have to pay the full charge without a rebate because they do not have a meter installed?  If so, it is blatantly unfair to all of us who do not have meters, especially if we have to start paying on 1 January.  In fact, it is a total outrage.  Everyone in this country is of the understanding that a family of more than one adult and two children will pay &euro;260 less &euro;100.</p></speech>

The Water Services Bill parts one, two and three are all a shambles and have not been thought through.  The logic behind metering does not stand up to scrutiny, as we are seeing here.  I take a similar reading to Senator Healy Eames from what the Minister of State said.  It struck me as rather strange logic for the Minister of State to suggest that the reason for opposing the amendment was that people would lose their rebate.  The Senator's point is valid.</p></speech>

The Minister of State made a point about metering.  He argued that metering should be brought in as a conservation measure.  I have a question about district metering and how much thought has been put into that.  Surely that would be a far more cost-effective way of dealing with the issue of water conservation and the amount of water that is being lost.  District metering is carried out in other countries.  The Minister of State raised the point about the need to bring in metering.</p></speech>

Furthermore, we could use the technology to find out whether there are leaks along the system - for example, in a given cluster of houses.  Surely that would be a far more cost-effective way of installing the metering system.  That is a system we have proposed for several years.  Furthermore, the money we could save by not having to install a meter at every house could be invested in the infrastructure.  I am keen to hear the thoughts of the Minister of State on why we are not proceeding with a district system rather than the system proposed.  This goes back to the original point we have been making.  Really, the only reason metering is being introduced is so that the charges from 2019 onwards will provide for people to be hammered.</p></speech>

It affects the timing of rebates from Irish Water to customers.  The relevant section specifies that 1 January is the stated time.  There is one rebate and one only as people move from no meter to having a meter.  There is one opportunity.  I reiterate that Senator Healy Eames's amendment affects when a person can get a rebate.  The subsection as currently drafted will ensure that householders will be able to receive a rebate in respect of a lower volumetric charge at the earliest opportunity as a result of the date specified in the Bill.  The effect of the proposed amendment from Senator Healy Eames would push the date back to the end of the metering programme and delay the rebate.  Essentially, we are not accepting the amendment for that reason.  We do not see that as being fair or reasonable.</p><p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh raised some good and valid points, but fundamentally we all agree that we have a water system that is broken and needs investment.  The disagreement is on how we propose to invest in that water infrastructure.  The Government is clearly laying its cards on the table.  It is suggesting that we establish a national utility and that we should install meters to help conserve water but also to raise revenue to allow us to leverage funding that we can invest in the water infrastructure.  If we do not leverage that funding, it has to come from the Exchequer directly.  Therefore, either it has to come from other sectors such as health, education or social welfare, or we have to raise taxes elsewhere to secure the necessary funding.</p><p>We are not reinventing the wheel.  I have often pointed to the case of ESB Networks, another national utility that has used the same model to raise funding off-balance-sheet as a national utility and a semi-state company.  ESB Networks has undertaken a network renewal programme in the past 15 or 20 years.  It attracted over &euro;7 billion of investment to the electricity network.  A similar model is being proposed by the Government.  We believe it can and will work.  No one can justify spending &euro;1.2 billion per year on a system that has almost 50% leakage into the ground.  The more pipes we fix, the more pressure is created, resulting in further leaks down the road.  The infrastructure requires major investment and asset management, and that is what the Government is about.  I hope the Senator will understand why the amendment is not being accepted.  It is a question of timing.  We believe that Senator Healy Eames's amendment would delay the rebate for customers.</p></speech>

Section 3(13) says that the customer "who is charged for the provision to that dwelling of the water consumed is entitled to one and one only rebate".  That implies clearly that without this amendment a customer could be entitled to more than one.  That is the obvious implication of the language.  Perhaps it is badly drafted.  Anyway, it means that a deferral of this scheme would clearly create a charge on the Exchequer.  Will the Minister of State address the point about the use of the phrase "one and one only"?</p> <p>Does that not clearly imply that there could be more than one?  Why is that phrase in there otherwise?</p></speech>

On a flat charge basis, a family of more than one will pay a gross charge of &euro;260.  Everyone will receive a water conservation grant of &euro;100 at the end of 2015 regardless of whether they are conserving, which means a net charge of &euro;160.  Is it correct that once a meter is installed, the householder will also have an opportunity for a rebate?</p></speech>

For example, a single adult household with no water meter will pay a capped charge of &euro;160 in 2015.  If the water meter is installed subsequently and showed that the customer only used &euro;100 worth of water, he or she would be entitled to claim a rebate of the difference, which would be &euro;60.  If we accept the amendment, rebates will be pushed back until the metering programme is completed.  It is a timing issue rather than anything else and that is the reason we are not accepting it.  It is an once off rebate to recognise people's water usage during the period they had no meter.</p></speech>

His logic for bringing in the metering was that it was a water conservation measure and meters had to be installed throughout the country to enable this type of conservation.  I do not agree with that.  He is incorrect.  District metering could be introduced.  I know from dealing with Irish Water on a number of local issues that it has reviewed every project that was on the slate.  Has this project been reviewed by the company?  Have staff examined whether this can be done through district watering?  It could save a great deal of money and hundreds of thousands of meters would not need to be installed because other technologies could be used to check the leaks between the district meter and the domestic user.  The money could be used to fix the system as opposed to using water meters as a cash register to collect taxes from people.</p></speech>

The meter has been installed and the customer could establish that even based on the meter reading, the volume of water would really only cost &euro;60, so he or she could be due another &euro;100 refund from Irish Water.

Section 3(2)(a) sets out a water charge of &euro;160 for one adult and section 3(2)(b) sets out a water charge of &euro;260 for two adults.  This is all based on the very first cent of income.  At least under the universal social charge, USC, one can earn &euro;12,012 before tax is incurred, although Jack O'Connor wants to reform this and I support him.  This water charge measure imposes a poll tax on those with the lowest incomes.</p><p>As Senator Crowne pointed out, we will now fund the water system through these charges and income tax; we will not receive an income tax refund.  The system was previously funded entirely through income tax and four people earning &euro;100,000 each paid 14 times more income tax than four people earning &euro;15,000 each.  A sixfold increase in income-----</p></speech>

This measure has been transferred from Thatcherite England and has been embraced by parties I knew as the Labour Party of Noel Browne and the Fine Gael Party of the just society.  Why are these parties addicted to this poll tax?  When water was financed through income tax, it was a progressive form of taxation - as income increased so too did tax rates.  This is how things worked historically and it will continue, to an extent, because the measures in this Bill will work in conjunction with income tax.  When society got together, income tax was made progressive so that a sixfold increase in income for a family of four would see a fourteenfold increase in income tax.  Progressive taxation means the redistribution of wealth from those with incomes well above the average to those less fortunate.  It is appalling that the same water tax will apply to all people, regardless of income.</p><p>The anti-water charge protesters in Maynooth were poor people who were on their uppers.  They do not have the money that the Government seeks and they resent the fact that the established political parties have deserted people with low incomes and are imposing these taxes at the behest of the water industry.  These protesters pose the same threat to the Fine Gael and Labour parties as bankers to the last Government.  This Bill is about water engineers and not ordinary people, and that is why hundreds of thousands of people have protested.  A similar situation arose around the referendum on the abolition of the Seanad when 68% of people in working class areas of Dublin voted to retain this House.  People are disillusioned with the Government parties because they have deserted them.</p><p>Irish public life has always had broad-based political parties that seek to help the badly-off.  There is much support in working class areas for Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Labour Party but these parties are deserting the people.  The Minister should look out the window at the next march because he will see people who do not have the money to pay these charges.  Progressive taxation is enshrined at the heart of social policy in this country but this is an extremely bad piece of social policy.  This measure is worse than the USC, which Jack O'Connor is trying to reform, because at least one can earn &euro;12,012 before the USC is imposed.  After one earns &euro;12,012, the tax is imposed on every cent.  It is very regressive to deal with people on low incomes as this section does.</p><p>Section 3(12) is also strange as it states that &quot;a child allowance provided under the approved water charges plan applies to a person who is not an adult&quot;.  Have there ever been babies or children in the houses of those who framed this Bill?  Do they know that infants require washing just as much as adults?</p> <p>When children play football outside, they need to wash themselves afterwards.  Why does this ageist discrimination exist?  It proves to me that the people who framed this part of the Bill are out of touch with families.  The ESRI has been pointing out for several years that budgetary policy is increasingly regressive.  Those who protested against water charges were not rich people who left the Mercedes at home while they walked into town.  They were badly off and they have been shunted towards the Independents and Sinn F&eacute;in.  I prefer a more broadly based political system, but hitting those who have hardly any income betrays everything we should be celebrating in a couple of years' time.  Why is the Minister targeting people who do not have &euro;260 to spare at the end of the charging period?  This is extremely bad social policy and extremely bad economics.  This is the chance for those Independent Senators who claim to cherish people while they are down on their luck to throw out this regressive section.  That is why I oppose the section.</p></speech>

While a considerable proportion of the population have a difficulty with the ownership of water, I accept that there are people who have no difficulty paying water charges.  However, a significant number of people have a difficulty with the notion of paying a second time, or else they simply cannot afford to pay.  I was chastised earlier when I tried to raise my concerns about amendments to this section, but this is my opportunity to raise these concerns.  It feels like Groundhog Day.  We raised similar concerns 13 months ago during our debate on the Water Services Bill 2013.  These concerns were shared by the citizens we represent and others outside the Chamber, but we were dismissed by the then Minister.  We repeatedly made the point that we were not prepared to buy a pig in a poke.  We wanted to know exactly what we would be buying and how much people were expected to pay before we would even consider voting for the Bill.  We were told that we would be consulted, but the decisions were farmed out to the Commission for Energy Regulation, which in turn was swept to one side when the Government was forced into a humiliating climbdown.  One of the arguments we made at the time was that the Government should have been responsible for that element of the legislation rather than leaving it to the commission.  In the end, however, it was the Cabinet rather than the commission which came up with the new pricing structure.  At least the matter was taken back into political control.</p><p>We were told that a plan for water charges would be put in place.  The essential point we were making was that people already pay for water through their taxes.  We argued about what should or should not be paid indirectly, with speakers offering the example of the ESB and other utilities.  That might be the case, but traditionally in this State we have paid for water through our taxes.  People are angry.  There are sighs from Government Senators when we raise these issues.</p></speech>

The Senators opposite do not have to agree with me, but people are e-mailing us in their thousands, and I have a responsibility to articulate their concerns to the Minister.  This is the section in which these concerns can be addressed.  The Minister and other Senators may respond if they wish, but we should at least be allowed to make our point.  I acknowledge that the Minister is willing to listen.</p><p>I am concerned that we are moving away from the notion of progressive taxation, whereby taxes are based on ability to pay.  We are paying more tax than ever before, and the revenue from those taxes should be used to pay for basic services.  The Government is introducing a raft of indirect taxes, which gives rise to the question of why we are moving away from the principle of progressive taxation based on income.  Indirect taxation is disproportionately levied on people on low incomes and, as such, is regressive and a form of poll tax.  The property tax is similarly regressive because it takes no account of ability to pay.  Two of the Independent Senators tabled a good amendment which was ruled out of order.  The amendment proposed that the charge would correspond to no more than 0.5% of household net income.  I am against the charge in its totality, but at least that amendment attempted to take account of ability to pay.  There is something fundamentally wrong with a multimillionaire paying exactly the same amount for water as someone on low pay or in receipt of social welfare.  A recent OECD report ranked Ireland as the second worst country in the OECD for low pay.  We know that many people are so trapped in low pay that they have no disposable income after putting in their week's work.  This Bill requires them to pay for their water separately.  Many of these families cannot afford another household bill.  Senators Healy Eames and &Oacute; Clochartaigh rehearsed some of the personal experiences outlined in e-mails they have received.  I am sure every Senator can give examples, even from their own families, of people who have no more money to give and cannot afford to pay basic bills.  Nobody in this House needs a lecture on poverty and inequality, because we all see these issues in our communities, our housing estates and our families.  The problem is that we are not prepared to do anything about it.  We refuse to tax wealth or to impose additional income taxes on those at the top, but we have introduced a number of indirect and regressive charges, the property tax being one.  We were told that the property tax was to pay for local services and local authorities.  No sooner was the property tax in place than we were asked to pay separately for water.  People are being asked to pay property taxes and water charges in addition to paying income tax and paying separately for bin collection, health insurance and sending their children to third level education.  There is a difference between progressive taxation and a regressive tax such as a water charge.  This debate dominates Europe at present.  The trend in European policy is liberalisation of public services and forcing people to pay regressively for services.</p><p>There was a huge public campaign of opposition not only to privatisation of water services but also to the charging regime introduced by the Government not long ago.  The initial report from the Commission for Energy Regulation was accepted by the Government.  An average family with two or three children was going to pay between &euro;400 and &euro;500.  The Government was subsequently forced into a climbdown, with the result that it has come up with the most convoluted scheme for water charges that any of us could imagine due to the hames it made of this issue from day one.  The proposed new charges are &euro;260 for a family and &euro;160 for someone who lives alone.  People will have to apply through social welfare to get &euro;100 back, thereby creating more bureaucracy.  It will cost more money to administer that scheme.</p> <p>In terms of overall tax, we are going to take in &euro;90 million next year.  We have not even factored in how much the administration will be.  It is mad to say it is &euro;260 and &euro;160 but we will give &euro;100 back through the back door, all because the Government made a complete hames of it.  I agree with the other Senators that it should not be up to the Department of Social Protection to give back that &euro;100.  In fact, it should not be charged at all.  People should not have to pay for their water.  Given the fact that we are bringing in the charge, it certainly should not be the Department of Social Protection.</p></speech>

We spent a long time on our feet debating this with the previous Ministers, Deputies Hogan and O'Dowd, and they told us then that the central issue was water conservation because we were wasting too much water.  They said what we needed was a system where we had water meters and people would pay for usage.  They said there would only be one year of a capped charge and then it would be metered, because that was what the Bill and the charge were about.  Of course, that went out the window when the Government extended the capped charge up to 2019.  So much for the water conservation element.  They are continuing with installing the water meters.  I said at the time, and I stand over it now, that the meters were simply a cash register outside people's doors so they could introduce their poll tax, as Senator Barrett said.  They are continuing with the meters anyway.  The option of district metering should have been looked at as it would still allow the Government and the Department and Irish Water or whatever utility, to deal with wastage of water.  It is cheaper to install, there are fewer meters, the technology is there.  If it was really about water conservation and not charges we should have done that.  It would have saved the State hundreds of millions of euro which could then have gone into fixing the systems which the Government Senators are blue in the face telling us are redundant, archaic and in need of upgrading.  We all accept that they are.  The PPS numbers have been abandoned.  That was another major concern we raised with Ministers and we were told there was no concern.  All of the amendments we tabled on that issue were dismissed.  Independent and Fianna F&aacute;il Senators also tabled amendments and all were dismissed out of hand.  That is what happened.</p><p>If this Bill passes, and I hope it does not, the Government will bring in &euro;95 million.  That is the total amount that will be brought in next year.  The problem I have with the charge and the so-called concessions is that this is only an introductory offer.  What they really want is to get people to buy into the principle of the charge.  Like the previous discussion on whether section 2 on holding a plebiscite is worth the paper it is written on, the commitment to cap the charges until 2019 is also not worth the paper it is written on.  If we have a new Government in 2016 there is nothing stopping any future Government changing the charge.  We would then end up having to pay more.  The European policy, let us be very clear about this, is that there would be full cost recovery for water for domestic users over time.  The full cost of treating water is then paid for----</p></speech>

In time, that is where this is going to go and people know that.  That is why people are not going to be fooled or bribed into the principle of it.  Once they buy into it and start paying it will go up and up.  Once that does happen, and this goes right to the heart of the Sinn F&eacute;in concern, notwithstanding the fact that it is unfair to tax people twice for water, there are families out there who cannot afford to pay and are making real choices every day about what bill to pay.  Leaving that aside, there is a real danger that once we commodify and commercialise water and once the price goes up and up, the profiteers, sharks and billionaires out there who are eyeing up our water infrastructure will be very quick to swoop in and buy it up.  I would not trust any future right-wing Government at least not to sell our water infrastructure at some time.</p></speech>

We did put forward an alternative in our alternative budget this year.  I will not go over the details of it but I am quite happy to give the Minister a copy if he has not received it.  We proposed a whole range of wealth taxes and an increase in taxes on high earners.  We want water to be paid for through direct taxation through the local government fund along with the continuation of full collection of the commercial water charges, which are still being paid.  We are completely against regressive taxes that are not based on ability to pay.  It sickens my stomach, to be quite honest, that we have so many people in this State living in poverty.  I spoke at length on this issue on Second Stage.  We have structural inequality and real poverty.  We have people making real decisions every day about what bills to pay.  We have had ESRI report after report critiquing this Government's four budgets and they have shown that the top earners have benefited the most and those at the bottom have benefited the least.</p></speech>

That is outrageous considering the lack of capacity to pay which is not taken into account at all.  It is even worse considering the money to pay for this laughably described conservation grant is to be taken out of social welfare.  I pointed this out three or four hours ago and this debate has gone on for about nine hours.  It is utterly fatuous and complete nonsense.  I will just leave it at that.  We are punishing all the children of the nation equally.  People who can pay are being treated the same as the people who cannot pay.  I am probably among the higher income brackets because I have income from this House and a pension, even though I gave up a State pension into which I contributed because I thought there were people who were more deserving of it.  I would have no objection to a higher tax rate for myself.  I have always believed it is the responsibility of those who are privileged to bring less advantaged people with them and provide them with as many benefits as possible.  That is something close to socialism.  I noticed that my great friend and dearly lamented colleague, the late Dr. No&euml;l Browne was invoked.  No&euml;l Browne would be turning in his grave at the idea of a Labour Party that claims to be socialist supporting this doubly unjust measure.  I completely agree with Senator Barrett that this is a poll tax.</p></speech>

I do not regard it as excessive and would be prepared to pay more.  However, as a citizen, a republican and a socialist, I feel guilty because by making it easy for me to pay it, I am depriving children of poor families of their food.  That might seem dramatic, but if we do not accept it as the truth and the reality, we are out of touch with the people.</p><p>Some will make hay out of this issue, but there are so many genuine people whom we have heard on radio and seen on television.  They are straightforward and honest people who are saying they have no money and cannot pay any more.  The only reason we have what Senator Sean D. Barrett refers to as a poll tax is there was a debacle.  There was a knee-jerk reaction and we knew that the metering programme would not be finished on time.  We also knew that we had to win over the masses who were on the streets protesting.  We came up with this solution, but in so doing all we did was to increase the divide between rich and poor.  It is as simple as that.</p><p>I do not understand why we are allowing this to happen and not going down the road towards progressive taxation.  I may be in a minority, but the PAYE system is sufficient to handle all of these hidden taxes.  There is no logic to the argument that raising income tax undermines employment opportunities.  One is still paying it, but the manner in which we have constructed this measure is the reason we have had this reaction.</p><p>In the early days of the recession I was wondering about the patience of the people.  When I looked at Portugal, Greece and other countries and saw the public reaction, I thought about how disciplined we were as a people.  We did not want to make matters worse or engage in violence as a result of what was happening.  I am talking about the results of the austerity measures, but we eventually let loose the frustration and anger that had built up.  We are now dealing with this legislation and the new approach and really witnessing the frustration people are feeling and exacerbating the situation.  Any open-minded person would have to admit we have not got this one right.  While I hope we do not, I know that we will see the results when we try to implement the legislation.  We all agree that we must upgrade the water system, conserve water and control its usage to have a quality water supply.  All of these things seem to be agreed to by both sides of the House.  Even though we agree on this, we are not prepared to take on board the responsibility that we have to act in a courageous and radical way, if necessary, to supply the funding needed to upgrade the water system.  </p><p>Any outsider looking at what we have been debating yesterday and today and not being aware of how it happened, if he or she saw it as a starting point, he or she would be seriously wondering about what type of parliament we had because it does not make any sense.  Above all else, it does not make any social sense either.  Why would we want to make people who do not have the money suffer any more than they already have?  It is the straw that broke the camel's back.  Very often they are the ones left without a voice here and, to some extent, the D&aacute;il.  They created a voice of their own on the streets, but as we all know, it is transient.  It will get the headlines for one week and the issue will be discussed on current affairs programmes on radio and television, but nevertheless it is transient.  We must try to hear that voice on the floor of this Chamber, but - I mean this sincerely - not in a confrontational way.  No matter what Government was in place, it would also have an unenviable task.  We cannot genuinely move forward with the charges and methodology for them without expecting some reaction.  </p><p>Senator Sean D. Barrett has tabled a cogent and well thought out amendment.  He has no partisan axe to grind.  In every contribution he has made in the House he has not tried to take any Government out of the equation.  I do not want to be alarmist, but if we move forward with this methodology, we will truly have lost our way in creating a new society by closing the gap between rich and poor.  In making unpalatable decisions which may not necessarily win votes we must do so for the good of the country.  Any stop-gap legislation which is not well thought out, measured or fair is unwarranted.  It would be unfair to charge me so little, if I could afford to pay more.  That applies to most people.</p></speech>

The people have not been fooled by it this time, nor were they on the last two occasions, yet the Government is still pressing ahead with water charges.  They are being delayed, but they will still be introduced in 2019.  Once they are brought in, they can be increased and, as has been pointed out, any new Government could introduce an amended water services Bill to bring forward the date for their imposition.  </p><p>From what the Minister has said today and what has been said on all Stages of the legislation, it is clear that the water meter programming will continue and that charges will be brought in.  We still do not have any constitutional right to water, despite all of the discussions about holding a plebiscite on the issue.  This, therefore, is only a introductory offer from the Government.  We saw the stick approach in the first and second water services Bills, when the people were told about all of the charges and penalties that would be imposed, including repair and call-out charges to fix leaking pipes.  The Government then saw the huge mobilisation and anger in the community.  I agree with Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.  I have visited Portugal and Greece where public anger at the way austerity measures were being imposed was much more visible on the streets.  The Irish were a little late in demonstrating their anger publicly.  However, when they saw the great Irish Water scam, it was a move too far.  That is why we have seen such a mobilisation.  It was due to that mobilisation that the Government had to row back and bring forward the third item of legislation before us.   It will not, however, solve the problem either.  </p><p>The Minister needs to seriously re-think this matter because people do not agree with the commodification of water.  They realise they are being asked to buy a pig in a poke and being set up for the introduction of water metering and charges in the future that will lead to the commodification of water and the privatisation of water services, although the Minister and the Minister of State may tell us that is not the Government's aim.</p> <p>I believe that is the intention of policy makers at a European level, that the Irish Government is being forced to do this and that the ducks are being lined up for commodification into the future.  If the Minister cannot see that, it is a sad day.</p></speech>

What was important was what they had to tell us.  They told us that they were the ghosts of water future in that this type of commodification has occurred in Detroit.  They were warning the people of Ireland not to go down the same route.</p><p>It has been stated that the reason for the introduction of water charges is to allow for future investment in this area.  I do not buy that.  By way of example, I cite the regional water scheme in Casla, which comprises most of south Connemara, where a campaign has been ongoing for many years in respect of clean water provision.  After 40 years, permission was finally granted for that regional water scheme.  The first half of the scheme, in terms of pipe installation, has been put in place but the second half, which had the agreement of the county council and the Department and in respect of which planning permission had been granted, has now been scrapped by Irish Water.  Irish Water has told the campaigners of that scheme that it will not be opening up any more sources and that it will provide water from regional water schemes.  In the case of Casla, the water will be pumped from Galway.  When we inquired of Irish Water what exactly was meant by that, we were told that it is proposed to replace the current approximately 400 water schemes throughout the country with 30 regional water schemes on the basis that this  will be better for conservation and ensure better quality water.  I know that what is really going on is that the ducks are being lined up for commodification of water services.</p><p>It might be suggested that Irish Water will always own the assets, etc., but we all know what will happen in that scenario.  We know that in a number of years time private companies will seek to tender to operate the regional water schemes.</p></speech>

We have seen this happen in respect of a plethora of different services, including refuse collection and so on.  The Minister cannot tell us and the people of Ireland that is not what is happening.  If he cannot see it, he needs to engage in a little more consideration of what is actually going on.  If the Minister is not aware of that, he is being taken for a ride and so is the Government because that is the agenda.<br/>A number of other issues arise around the charging for water.  There has been many references to urban myths.  Another myth is that people on group water schemes have been paying for water for years.  They have, but what has not been clarified during this debate, which is important in the context of how much it will cost the household and a dwelling for water, is what will be the impact of water charges on those group water schemes.  I have discussed this issue with a number of people in Galway and Mayo.  I have been told that Mayo County Council did not charge the group water schemes for all the water they used and in some cases gave them rebates of up to &euro;30,000 to &euro;40,000 per year.  In Galway, a flat charge was applied which meant that a person connected to the water supply from Galway County Council was charged only a flat rate for use of the scheme regardless of how much water he or she used.  We know group water schemes have in many cases been very successful and have been able to keep their costs down.  Therefore, the charges to the householder have been relatively low even though the schemes have been a burden on rural communities.  What will happen now that Irish Water will be supplying the water?  Will households and group schemes be charged the full whack for water or will they get a rebate similar to those provided by the county councils?  That is very unclear.  This also relates to the water charges on dwellings in that if the group water schemes cannot afford the upkeep of the schemes, Irish Water will gain control of those schemes and take over the remainder of the network, which feeds into all of the schemes eventually being brought together under one umbrella, leading to the future privatisation of Irish Water.  That is what is happening whether or not the Minister believes it.  It is important to point that out.<br/>There are a number of other issues arising from this section which need to be looked at.  Section 3(2) states: &quot;<i>Subsection (1) </i>does not to apply non-domestic water supply and waste water charges made under the approved water charges plan in respect of the period from 1 October 2014 until 31 December 2014.&quot;  Will a similar regime be put in place in respect of commercial charges?  Are they to be frozen until 2019 also and, if so, what are the implications of that for Irish Water and the local authorities?<br/>Section 3(8) states: &quot;The charging of customers of Irish Water for the provision of water services provided for in this section is deemed to be part of the approved water charges plan.&quot;  If I go to a restaurant for a meal, I expect it to be of a certain standard.  If I am buying a service and product from Irish Water, can I expect quality water and a quality service?  If Irish Water does not provide me with water of a sufficiently high standard, should I be expected to pay for it?  In this regard, I again cite the Casla regional water scheme.  The reason that scheme was being put in place was because Ireland has been in contravention of EU directives on water in Carraroe for 40 years.  The water supply in that area comes from Loughaunwillan and has been contaminated for some time.  Following an outbreak of e-coli last year, up to &euro;1 million was spent to upgrade that water system.  We were then told that the water was top quality and we had nothing to worry about.  However, in the past few months - this is on Irish Water's watch - we found out, in the main as a result of some good journalism by Radio na Gaeltachta, that in 95% of the tests carried out since 2008 the level of TTHMs in the water in Carraroe exceeded the levels agreed by the EPA.  In some cases, the level of TTHMs was 200% above the acceptable level.  This does not indicate supply of good quality water.  TTHM levels of that order can be carcinogenic.  People can die from drinking water of that quality.  It is unfair to be asking communities whose water, in terms of TTHM levels, exceed the levels acceptable by the WHO and the EPA, to pay for water.  It is obvious this has been an issue prior to 2008.  The only reason we do not know if the levels were higher previous to 2008 is because measurement of TTHM levels only commenced in 2008.  I would argue there has been an issue with water quality in that area for a much longer period.  I would like the Minister to comment on the issue of water quality.  If I purchased a drink in a bar and I found out it was not of good quality and might do damage, I would not be expected to pay for it.  Why should people be expected to pay for water that is not of sufficiently high quality?  I hope the Minister will respond with specific answers to the very specific points I have raised.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-12-19a.1220" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1159" speakername="Mark Daly" time="20:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014121900068#SSS01400"><p>I welcome the Minister back to the House.  I share previous speakers' concern about the lack of fairness in the section.  The lack of regard for ability to pay, which also arose with the property tax, is most unfair aspect of the section.  As other Senators noted, it is unfair that Members of the Oireachtas and people on higher incomes are being charged the same as everyone else.  The fact that someone may have a swimming pool, five houses, five bedrooms or five bathrooms makes no odds to the Government.</p><p>This is all part of the Government's U-turn.  I cited the statement made by the former leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, that he did not believe in metering or flat charges.  We see both, in black and green, in the Bill passed by the D&aacute;il, which provides that charges of &euro;160 and &euro;260, respectively, will apply to the principal private residence occupied by one adult and two or more adults.  </p><p>Many of the technical questions raised by citizens or customers, as they are described by the Government, have not been answered because the entire scheme has not been thought out.  The installation of meters as a conservation measure is a fig leaf that is of no real consequence.  A previous section provides that the Minister may make amendments as he or she sees fit, as is always the case in legislation.  This section does not provide for justice or fairness but creates a get-out clause for a Government that has already done a U-turn.  While the current proposal is to charge citizens a small amount for a short period, in 2018 Irish Water will start charging people by the litre to make money.  Moreover, the Government will not be able to borrow money to build water infrastructure.  </p><p>I find most disturbing the assurance we have been given that this is the best that can be done on the issue of privatisation.  We receive assurances that a flat rate would not apply and investment would be made in infrastructure.  A flat rate has been introduced and investment in infrastructure is unlikely to take place.  The Government will be lucky to reach the point where it covers the cost of this colossal monster. </p><p>According to the Irish League of Credit Unions, 500,000 people do not have any money at the end of each month.  People simply do not have the &euro;260 or &euro;160 they will need to pay the charge.  Previous speakers described the water charges as the straw that broke the camel's back.  Irish people were not late to the game in this regard.  While people in Greece and Spain vented their anger on the streets and it looked good on television, the numbers involved were not especially large.  What we are seeing here is a mass mobilisation, with people gathering in large numbers in Dublin and many other parts of the country to engage in peaceful protest.  This protest will also be seen at the ballot box because promises were broken.  Deputy Gilmore deserves to be mentioned again in this regard.  He stated he did not believe in charges for water because it is a necessity that should be delivered as a public service.  A flat household charge, he added, would be unfair as it would not discriminate between houses with five bathrooms or none, and metering, he continued, would be unworkable.  To give the Deputy some credit, he was right about metering.  It is unworkable.  Metering will be a cash cow and bonus for those at the top and a burden for the 10% of the population who do not have any money at the end of each month.  </p><p>Those at the top - the elite and members of the commentariat - are doing all right and getting by. </p> <p>They will be able to pay the bill, and that is why it is not of concern to them.  I refer to the Ministers who say it is only &euro;3 a week and what is the problem; &euro;3 is a lot of money for someone who does not have it.  It is the same in Italy, in Spain and in Greece, with regard to those at the top, those in the media, those in the establishment, those in positions of power and influence in the Civil Service, the public service, the unions, the employers, the politicians.  Those at the top are fine and are happy with the <i>status quo</i>.  They are happy to put this burden on people because they think &quot;It is only &euro;3 a week,&quot; and anyone who disagrees with them is obviously irrational and unreasonable.  It is not irrational and unreasonable for people to protest when they do not have the money because of all the other incremental charges that have been put in place in recent years.  Yet those at the top - as we have seen in the most recent budget - are the ones who seem to have less of a burden placed on them.  Some of my colleagues have made the point that they would regard it as fairer if more were paid in tax than paid to what has turned out to be the monster of Irish Water, which, depending on who is doing the figures, may never pay for itself and will only pay for the bonuses of those who are at the very top, who are quite happy for the fiasco to continue.<br/>However, it will be the ballot box at the next election that will give us the answer to the comments that politicians have made - they were true when they made them - about metering being unworkable.  Some said they were against the flat charge and said that water is a public service.  When one considers that all those politicians and their parties will be before the electorate-----</p></speech>

Section 3, and the fig leaf of a standard charge, is like a stay of execution for those who cannot afford water.  The charge is only &euro;3 a week in some cases.  However, for those who do not have it, they will not be able to pay it.  There has been a U-turn on the facility to have a consultation with the people, which has now become a plebiscite, which is not worth the paper it is written on.  Section 3 also shows the cost imposed upon people and the next election will allow the people to give their judgment.  Just as was the case in Spain, Greece and Italy, the people will vote against those who broke their promises, those who said this was a public service and stated that a flat charge would be unfair.  The opinion that a flat charge would be unfair was reported in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>in 2010.  I wonder what has changed since 2010, when a former T&aacute;naiste made that statement.

That is a flat charge.  It is &euro;160 for one adult.

If the Government wished to court popularity or to do the right thing, I am surprised it did not engage in a national debate.  I acknowledge that those in government have to make tough decisions and they must be responsible.</p></speech>

A charging structure is being introduced but there is no clarity for the taxpayer on whether there is any reduction in taxation as a result of the introduction of charges.  That is what is annoying people and getting their backs up.  It is being referred to on the streets as double taxation, that people regard it as paying twice.  We have all seen the placards.  The people who wrote those placards are very genuine and they are deeply concerned that they should not pay for a public service twice.  That is the core issue.  They are being asked to pay twice because the funding model is a confusing mixture of charges and this was highlighted by Senator Healy Eames in her contribution.  There was complete confusion in the debate and I was not clear on the precise level of charges.  I do not think the Minister of State is completely clear either.</p></speech>

Why move away from that model and move towards a model that does not conform to the equity we seek to achieve in a taxation system?</p> <p>The founding principles of any tax system are administrative simplicity, effectiveness and equality, or equity.  The system proposed does not honour the principle of equity.  Equity is measured in two ways, vertically and horizontally.  Where there is vertical equity, everybody pays the same amount, irrespective of income.  This measure does not apply in this case and, therefore, the Minister is introducing a charge.</p><p>We are talking about water as a utility.  If the Members opposite were living in a house with 50 light bulbs that were on all the time and I were living across the street in an apartment with one light bulb on all the time, one would argue the Members were paying 50% more in their big mansion across the road.

Therefore, it does not meet the basic requirement of a fair taxation regime.  It is against all the international standards that have been established, as outlined by Senator Barrett.  It is deeply unfair and regressive and does not stand with the progressive nature of the PAYE tax system.<br/>Consider the position in other countries that charge for water.  A UN declaration in 2010 accepted that if there is to be a water charge introduced based on consumption, no income decile should pay any more than between 1% and 2% of disposable income.  The percentage of disposable income paid for water services by the lowest income decile varies across the OECD.  In Turkey, for example, it is 10.3%.  In the Czech Republic it is 3.9%, and in Canada it is approximately 1.3%.  Even with the changes introduced by the Government, a two-person household in Ireland will be levied with a charge greater than what the United Nations defines as fair.  In other words, it will be above 2% of the disposable income of the lowest income decile.  Even by introducing the charge at this early stage, and with the Minister bringing in the lowest possible charges and doing his utmost, we are still not getting it right.  What hope will we have in 2018 when there is a revisiting of the charging policy, when the regulator will be pushing up the prices and when the private interests of outside forces will be pushing up prices by lobbying the regulator?  This will be inevitable because it will make the company more profitable.  By making the company more profitable, it will be able to increase the amount of money required to fix the pipes that are broken.<br/>The Government is setting up a system that will skin people, particularly those with a low income.  It is bringing in a flat-rate grant across the board, which makes no sense at all.  I agree with Senator Cullinane that the system does not even meet the basic requirement of being simple to administer.  Perhaps the cost of administering the grant will be as great as what it is worth.<br/>There has been no thought put into this and it has been rushed.  I appreciate that the Minister, Deputy Kelly, has done what he could in a short period.  However, what was talked about here last night, a period of reflection, is required.  The best brains should be employed.

He should learn from where poverty and the provision of water go hand in hand.  What will happen is that the Government, even with the best will in the world, will vote through legislation that will create huge problems not only for the country, but also for its citizens long into the future.  This is wrong.  Senator Barrett said this is effectively a poll tax.  It is Thatcherite and wrong.  It is hitting those who can least afford to pay it more because the percentage of their disposable income needed to pay will be greater than that of those earning &euro;150,000 per year, even though they may use much less water.  What is occurring is very wrong.</p></speech>

There is no question about that; it is demonstrable.</p><p>If we can remove water charges and any others we can from the cost of general taxation, it will leave space for the reduction of the universal social charge, and that is my reason for supporting water services charges.  The universal social charge is a punitive charge, a tax on work.  It was introduced as a temporary measure and it brings in &euro;4 billion per year, which no Government would say it does not want.  What we must do is try to reduce the universal social charge incrementally and the burden it places on people and work.  The only realistic way to do that is to replace the income from the charge with other income.  I refer to reducing the cost to the Exchequer associated with the provision of water, at a very modest cost to the public, namely, &euro;60 per year.</p><p>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill&rsquo;s sums are terribly wrong, unless mine are.  He referred to 2% of income.  A charge of &euro;160 per year represents an income of &euro;8,000, unless my sums are totally wrong.  That is well within the margin the European Union has set out.</p></speech>

The section is about charges, and I was asked a specific question about water quality by Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh.  If the EPA or HSE issues a boil water notice or a restriction on water no charge will apply for that water supply.  The Senator also asked about district metering.  Some local authorities already use district metering to get a picture of consumption in larger areas.  This is widely applied.  District metering does not promote conservation as accurately as individual meters.  Individual meters can identify leakage on private property.  We have already seen that substantial leaks are being discovered through meters being installed.  I hope these points clarify these issues.</p><p>The Government has listened to the people who have displayed concern in recent months.  We have introduced clarity and certainty in the charging system.  It is capped at &euro;160 per annum for a one occupant household and &euro;260 for multiple or family households.  The charge has being made that this is not clear and is confusing.  Every household in the country, irrespective of whether it is on a public water supply, well or group scheme, will be entitled to a conservation grant of &euro;100.  Senator Cullinane opposes this, as do many other Senators, but this grant has been introduced by the Government to assist people who have been paying for water for many years and those who will become customers of Irish Water.  They can use it for water-saving devices and conservation measures-----</p></speech>

I have no problem with constructive debate and factual debate, and these are the facts.  Several months ago the Sinn F&eacute;in leader was in full agreement with paying water charges.  Suddenly he stated he will not pay and now he states he is totally opposed to water charges.  This is a huge transition in a very short space of time.  I have heard criticism of the metering programme this evening.  It is also a fact that in Northern Ireland, where Sinn F&eacute;in is in power, 35,000 water meters have been installed throughout the system.  Why is this?  It is for the very same reason we are doing it here.</p></speech>

This framework will be in existence until the end of 2015.  Then Sinn F&eacute;in, in power in Northern Ireland, will have to revise how it wishes to sustain the water networks.  I suspect the water meters being installed will be rolling and the charges to which Sinn F&eacute;in is so opposed to here will be collected.</p><p>I am amazed and gobsmacked at the transformation which has occurred in Fianna F&aacute;il.  On page 77 of its national recovery plan of 2010, Fianna F&aacute;il agreed to introduce water charges by 2013.  In the agreement with the troika it agreed to raise more than &euro;500 million per annum, which equates to &euro;400 per household.  Now it is very convenient for Fianna F&aacute;il to oppose the charge because it wants to outflank Sinn F&eacute;in.  Senator Gilroy made a very good point when he stated it is transforming in front of our eyes.  I served on local authorities with Fianna F&aacute;il members who adopted responsible budgets.</p> <p>I can see no responsibility in the current position being adopted.  I am quite surprised and the Senators should rethink their position.  This country has spent &euro;1.2 billion per annum on a water structure that is creaking and breaking down.  We now have clear choices.  Do we want to see raw sewage being pumped into our rivers, lakes and bays, as that is happening as we speak?  Senator Cullinane knows Waterford estuary well, and it is happening in Dunmore East and Ballyhack, with raw sewage going into the clear water.</p></speech>

How do we finance the water system, as the Minister asks us to?  We address the &euro;2 billion that Professor John FitzGerald has estimated for the excess of personnel.  The Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government sat on the McLoughlin review which indicated massive over-manning at director of services level and county manager level.

The investment record was hopeless but we did not ask engineers to explain how water supplies had cryptosporidium.  We have decided to blame old people in the country because the county engineers have not been up to the standards we want.  We have let these people off the hook far too much.  We heard much about waste but we found out yesterday that only 6% of the waste is in houses.  All of the rest was down to the county engineer.  There is the scandal of bonus payments and expenses and we must tackle the cost base of Irish Water before imposing a burden on low-income people.</p><p>There were start-up costs of &euro;168 million, with &euro;500 million for meters and &euro;2 billion arising from over-manning of posts.  All these are being visited on low-income people, which is why they protested outside.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is being towed around backwards by water engineers who have not been called to account.  We need far more accountability in Irish life, including among economists, but definitely among water engineers.  We should not argue that the system is useless when those engineers collected fancy pay, increments and benchmarking.  There was not much money left to spend on pipes but the bloated bureaucracy of local government in Ireland did very well for itself.  Elected representatives should tackle the issue.  This is where we could get the money required.  The Taoiseach argued that the savings in the budget would be gone if we did not impose water charges but maybe that would be a more progressive approach.  Let us see the numbers.  Perhaps we will see benefits at some stage but there is a fear about what will happen with these charges, and that is what concerns people.</p><p>I will return to the tremendous support that this House received from working class people in Dublin.  All the constituencies were wonderful and they stood by this House, so I am calling on this House to stand by them now and not to impose charges on them.  They were wonderful and we would not be here if it were not for low-income urban people in Dublin, who sometimes voted against the advice of every single Deputy.  They want the Seanad to do something for them.</p></speech>

They expected much more from us.  I deeply regret the Water Services Bill as it has been presented.  The Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Kelly, are genuinely trying but they are not being allowed to listen or they are failing to hear what we are saying.  The bottom line is the people of Ireland want water to be owned by the people and they cannot afford the money we are talking about right now.</p><p>Let us be totally honest, as part of this is a bravado in that we can implement legislation charging for water.  We are not even going to be able to pay for the loans we have taken out with this.  The Government has kicked the issue down the road to 2019 before it can start to make any serious charges.  I know there are people watching this debate on television as they have contacted me all night.  They are saying they want to pay for water but they should not be paying a double tax; they are saying they are taxed to their throats.  Government Members may complain but in the end, people do not have the money.</p></speech>

We indicated how they were unfair and I spoke about progressive taxation versus indirect taxes.  There were a number of specific questions and we raised genuine concerns but none of these was addressed in the response.  All we got was an attack on Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in.  That is exactly what happened in the last Water Services Bill and we have got the same right through Second and Committee Stage of this legislation all day.  The Government will not stand over its policies.</p> <p>The Minister of State will not answer any real questions that are being asked.  He bats them all away and then just comes back with this nonsense about the policies of Sinn F&eacute;in and Fianna F&aacute;il.  It gets boring.  People out there are not interested.

My questions are direct questions to the Minister of State.  We are paid to come in here and ask questions of the Minister and this is what I will do because I know people out there want me to do it.  They are not interested in interruptions.  How is it fair?  Why has indirect rather than progressive taxation been used?  Why are none of these policies poverty-proofed?  There is no point in coming back in two, three or six months time when we have more reports telling us that more people are in poverty because of an indirect tax.  Why is that the case?  Why has there been no poverty-proofing of this policy because if there was, we would not be introducing it?  That is a genuine question.</p><p>The Minister of State has not responded to the ESRI report because this budget included the water charges.  The ESRI said that the top 40% benefit the most and the bottom 60% do not, so could the Minister of State address that point?  That related specifically to water charges which are linked to the poverty measures.  The Minister of State has not dealt with the wasteful spending of Irish Water.  </p><p>It does not matter to me how long we sit here.  I would want to be at home like everybody else but it is always the same.  When over 100,000 people took to the streets, why are we being asked to rush through on the Friday before Christmas one of the most important Bills to face this Seanad?  Yes, there is no guillotine but it is all on one day and then people get cranky.  People stand up and make contributions because they all want to get home.  Yet we will be asked afterwards &quot;what did you do?&quot;  We will be asked what we said to the Minister.  We will be asked what questions we asked so I am asking the questions.  I have asked them and I will sit down and listen to the Minister of State.  I think they are genuine questions about the unfairness of the charge and the regressive nature of it as opposed to progressive taxation.  I look forward to the Minister of State's response.  </p></speech>

Someone said to me the Chair was made for me, I should go to the Lower House and try the Chair because I was more qualified for that as well.  I thank whoever made that unknown request.  I do not get requests like that.</p><p>The Minister has inherited an unholy mess from the previous Minister.  It is quite clear that the Government is trying to unscramble a scrambled egg at this stage.  This Bill is an effort to undo a bit of this.  I have never come across a Bill so close to another Bill that went through the Houses and became law.  This Bill aims to pull back from that.</p><p>I see two different elements in this situation.  There are people in contact with me who said that they are prepared to pay water charges provided the water is in public ownership and is not privatised.  They are absolutely terrified of this.  Another group of people have said that they will never pay.  One third of the population-----</p></speech>

The Government has spent &euro;530 million on meters, which I think are quite inadequate.

I wonder whether somebody from Irish Water should be here.  They are being well paid.  There are top executives there-----</p></speech>

People are asking public representatives these questions.  I have not filled out the form as yet.  I am very compliant legally and I suppose I will have to fill out the form before the end of the year.  The point is that I have not filled it out yet.  I sympathise with the Minister.  He walked into this situation and I cannot understand why a Labour Party Minister took on this mantle at this point in time.  People will not accept it.  The rejection will be larger as a result of such unfair charging.  When people realise how it will work, they will rebel.  They will be on the streets again next year.  There is a total rebellion in this regard.  This is regrettable.  It is destabilising and damaging the country internationally.</p></speech>

I have outlined what is a sustainable model that will attract investment in our Irish water system and infrastructure, which we all agree is a vital resource.  I repeat that we have put our cards on the table in respect of how we intend to establish it, how it will work and how we will fund it.  It is essential that any Government shows responsibility and leadership in this regard.  I know it is quite unpopular to impose what we are doing at the moment.</p> <p>I am convinced that over time people will see that this is the proper thing to do to sustain and protect our natural resources, especially water.</p><p>Senator Cullinane asked me questions about poverty proofing.  I tell him straight that the Government has done everything in its power to keep these costs as low as possible to make them as affordable as possible and to establish certainty to allow people to budget for a water infrastructure they can use.  If we fail to invest in this, those same people will not thank us where there are boil-water notices, water restrictions and the capacity issues experienced by Dublin city last year continue.  Last year, Dublin was at maximum capacity.  We must stand up here and be straight with each other.  I have no problem with constructive debate as Senator Cullinane knows, but we must say where the money and investment are coming from and how we propose to spend.  The Government has been very clear in all of this.</p><p>To address some of the other issues the Senator raised, the Government is very conscious that people have gone through a very difficult time.  It is only from January onwards that people will start to see money coming back to those same citizens who have made huge sacrifices to save this country.  That is recognised by all of us.  The Government's initiative to introduce a conservation grant is to address the very issues Senator Cullinane raises around affordability.  He and many other Senators are opposed to the payment of the &euro;100 conservation grant.</p></speech>

He was opposed to it.  This is a genuine initiative to assist people to adopt efficient measures in their households to reduce water consumption.

With regard to the general payment of water charges, I agree that there are two categories of people out there.  There are those who have said clearly that they will not pay under any circumstances.  Many of them can well afford to pay.  There are those of whom I am very conscious who cannot pay and they are the ones that the Senator has spoken about.  This utility, like any other, will have oversight from the Commission for Energy Regulation which acts at all times in the interest of the customer.  It is the same as the situation with other utilities including Bord G&aacute;is and the ESB whereby the customers' interests are protected through a customer charter and oversight of expenditure and operational costs.  A lack of efficiencies, some of which have been recognised and in respect of which targets have already been set for Irish Water by the regulator, the utility will be obliged to act on foot of the regulator's instructions and to find those efficiencies within its structures.  That is happening on behalf of the consumer.  The CER has a very important role to play.<br/>We have debated the matter <i>ad nauseam</i>, in particular section 3.  For those who do not want to pay even though they can afford to, penalties will apply.  I must state clearly that some Opposition Members held public meetings advising people not to pay the household charge or the property tax.  Those same people then attracted liabilities and penalties and were deserted by the Opposition Members who advised them in that.  That is not good political leadership.  In government, we must make decisions.  In government, we have certain resources and a certain budget we must spend as we see fit in the best interests of Irish citizens.  We are introducing a model that is sustainable to invest in Irish Water to ensure that people have quality water over time, that cities like Dublin, Cork, Galway and Waterford have the capacity to serve the growing industries starting to come into the country, and to stop the raw sewage that is flowing out into our waters in 2014 in a modern economy.  We all refer to the blue flags we would like to see on our beaches, but have chosen to neglect over many years to address the lack of infrastructure to treat that raw sewage and to provide for a modern economy and infrastructure of which we can all be proud.<br/>Senator Cullinane asked me specifically about standing over my policies.  I stand over every policy I make and every vote that I take.  While I acknowledge the criticism we attract, I look at the long term.  I hope my children and grandchildren will look back at history and see that this Government took responsible decisions, stood by our country when it needed to be stood by, brought it back from the brink of bankruptcy and invested in our economy again.</p></speech>

I am impressed by the Minister and the Minister of State's attempt to try to introduce some humanity into this.  We all appreciate the dreadful situation they inherited.<br/>This concerns late payment charges of &euro;30 and &euro;60.  Earlier, we discussed the imposition of these charges on people with very low incomes. </p> <p>In respect of the late charges I think the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, was agreeing, can we distinguish between those who will not pay and those who genuinely cannot pay?  Can the Minister think of some way in which it could be linked with community welfare officers but not to pursue people who are on low incomes trying to find &euro;260, that we would be benign towards them as I think that is the inclination of both the Minister and the Minister of State?  We do not want to clog up courts or legal proceedings against people who have suffered during the recession and for whom &euro;260 is a very large amount of money.  If we can deal in a considerate and kind way with those who have problems with late payment it might make the Bill slightly less unpalatable.</p></speech>

It is good to see that Senator David Norris has gone home.  This section deals with the penalties and sanctions.  I said a number of times it is not the choice of any of the Opposition Senators to be here or to be debating the Bill in the manner in which we are doing so.  We would have preferred this debate to be over a number of days but the Leader has organised the business in such a way that Committee Stage is to be done in one day, at the end of the year.  That is not our fault.  We have questions to ask on the sections.  That is our job.  I will certainly do it as will Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Senators are also doing it.</p><p>The section deals with late payments and the sanctions in place.  The Government had a sanction in place earlier in terms of turning people's water down to a trickle.  I am glad that sanction has been removed because it would not be fair.  It would have been despicable if we had a situation where people's water pressure had been turned down.  However, there are still sanctions in place.  </p><p>There will be penalties for those who do not pay after a year or enter into a payment plan.  It will be August 2016 before the penalties can be applied.  A single adult household will face a &euro;30 penalty and &euro;60 will apply to other households.  Court attachment orders will not be used to collect unpaid water charges.  The only method to be availed of is to place a charge on the property.  That will happen to many families who cannot afford to pay or to older people where the levy or the charge will be put on the property itself.  That will only become relevant when the house is sold.  We also know that the Government and the Minister have not dealt with this issue and explained how it will work.  </p><p>There is a commitment to introduce legislation to allow landlords to deduct unpaid water charges from tenants' deposits if necessary.  The Minister has not explained how that will work and when he will introduce the legislation.  That is a specific question, to which I would like an answer, because there was a reference to it in the budget speech of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  We have not yet seen the details of it but we should as people were concerned about it.  A memo was sent to council CEOs instructing them to collect unpaid water taxes.  How will that be done?  What was contained in that memo?  What are local authority managers being asked to do?  This is the stick element.  Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh spoke earlier about the carrot element of the Government reducing the charge to try to entice people in and once the principle of the charge is introduced it will be increased.  The stick for people who do not pay, who cannot pay and who genuinely cannot pay is that they face these sanctions.  Obviously we will not support such sanctions.  That is why we oppose the section in its entirety.  How is it fair that those people who cannot afford to pay will face those sanctions?  </p><p>We heard from the Minister of State, Deputy Paudie Coffey, earlier that the Government is interested in fairness, that it will listen to those people who genuinely cannot afford to pay.  If that is the case how will it work in theory?  That is the level of detail we want from the Minister.  That is what the people will be asking us.  If they genuinely cannot pay what will the Government do?  It has said it will be sympathetic and so on but specifically what will it do for those people who cannot afford to pay?  If the Bill passes, these  are subject to all the sanctions, including fines, penalties and attachment orders on their homes.  What mechanisms will be put in place for those people who cannot afford to pay?  The other specific question was in relation to landlords taking the money from people's deposits.  When will that legislation be introduced?  Is is still something the Government will do or has it gone by the wayside?  What was in the memo that issued to the CEOs of local authorities and what instruction is being given to local authorities to collect unpaid water charges from tenants?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-12-19a.1433" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1126" speakername="Jim Walsh" time="21:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014121900076#AAAA00900"><p>On this section I will take a different view from what others may put forward.  The difficulty with the imposition of this charge is the fact that it is coming on top of a ream of charges, stealth taxes, that have been applied over the past six years which has brought people to a position where they simply cannot afford to pay.  That is the issue before the House.  My concern is that the late payment charge is watering down, pardon the pun, the incentive for people to meet the charge.  Senator Sean D. Barrett rightly said there will be two categories who will not pay - those who cannot afford to pay and those who simply will not pay under any circumstances.  There will always be an element of that.  In fact there are three categories.  The third category is the one about which I am concerned - those who will pay.  If the predictions in the various polls being conducted are correct at between 60% and 75%, it means there will be very significant default in regard to the charges.  I heard what the Minister of State said about the imposition of the property tax and the fact that people responded.  People only responded when they discovered the powers of Revenue for recovery.  Revenue could go directly to people's bank accounts if they were in default incurring the sanctions and penalties which are onerous and, probably, too onerous.  In this instance there is not a great financial incentive for those who decide not to pay to change their minds.  The consequence of that will be that the people who pay will incur a much higher charge going forward that they would otherwise.  We need to know what the Minister intends to do to ensure that if the charge is applied that it will done fairly.  Fairly means that the burden should not fall on a certain section of society who pay everything, the people who pay all their taxes and who do not rely on the State for their medical costs.  They are the people who have been crucified by the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Health, by the imposition of public bed charges imposed on private health insurance which has seen a huge escalation in the health insurance costs which has lead to a haemorrhaging of about 300,000 people from private health insurance.  The time has come for politicians of all hue, and particularly the Government, to stand up for the hard-pressed people who will drive any recovery.  They are the people in the middle class who share the burden of everything that is imposed by Government.  This Government has done so without any recognition of the hardships and difficulties they have incurred. There should be an offset for those people if the Minister is to continue with the water charges.</p> <p>An obvious way of doing that would be to gradually remove the universal social charge.  When that charge was introduced by the late Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan, he clearly explained that it was an emergency measure aimed at fixing the fiscal deficit.  It was temporary and the intention was to remove it as the economy recovered and our fiscal circumstances improved.  That was a commitment to the Irish people on the part of the State but it has been abandoned by this Government.  The Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, spoke about the need to support the Government in its efforts to save this country.  I was in this Chamber when the Minister of State was an Opposition Senator.  He and his colleagues in Fine Gael and the Labour Party opposed almost every measure the then Government took between 2008 and 2011 to address the greatest emergency this State since 1922.  It rings hollow now to hear such urging from the Minister of State, when he previously opposed measures for political reasons even though his opposition was detrimental to the interests of the Irish people.</p><p>I ask the Minister to bring this back to the drawing board and to defer any further imposition on the Irish people until such time as the measures have been thought through.  I do not object to water charges in principle but in the current circumstances they are the straw that breaks the camel's back.  An offset should be provided to allow the people to see that while a new charge is being imposed on the one hand, the severe emergency measures introduced previously will be ameliorated on the other.  There are many areas in which we need to take account of the difficulties people are experiencing.  We have an opportunity to take the first step in that regard.  It would add insult to injury for those who have signed up already and who pay everything if a significant cohort are happy to trawl along on their coat tails.  That is not good enough.  I refer to people who pay for their children's education without getting grants and who subscribe to the Exchequer to meet the cost of the public service.  Many of them are on salaries and remuneration packages far less generous than those paid to the Members of this House and many people at medium to senior level in the public service.  None of them get the benefit of the pension scheme we enjoy as public servants.  It is not good enough for us to abandon their interests.</p><p>The water charge is relatively small compared to the other impositions on these people since the emergency began in 2008.  I remind the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, that more than two thirds of the heavy lifting were done in the &euro;20 billion correction of the fiscal deficit made by the previous Government, for which it received nothing but opposition and criticism throughout its period in office.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party were left with the smaller proportion of adjustments.</p></speech>

He has impressed me since taking over his portfolio.  He has worked hard to resolve the homelessness issue, which should have been dealt with long ago.  The measures he introduced in this Bill deal with water charges in a more realistic and reasonable way than the legislation introduced by his Fine Gael predecessor.</p></speech>

Two thirds of the population will probably bear the burden of the full complement of households.  That is simply not acceptable.  How does the Minister propose to ensure that does not happen?  The Government needs to move away from its regressive budgets to a more progressive system that takes into account those who have been affected by the downturn.</p></speech>

Somebody who does not pay the &euro;260 charge could be fined &euro;60 at the end of the year.  The total after two years would be &euro;640.  Whatever chance the Government has of getting &euro;260, it will have very little chance of getting &euro;640.  Will the local authorities be able to post the charge on a dwelling in the event of its sale?  I want water charges to be removed but the House has a wonderful opportunity to examine the Bill line by line.  I make no apologies about the time we take to do that because this is a once-off opportunity.  People can see that we, at least, are making the case for them.  We are the voice of the people of Ireland.  We are the last voice on this Bill.  The D&aacute;il did not give proper consideration to the legislation  It should have continued its deliberations into January, February or March of 2015.</p> <p>There was no panic, crisis or rush.  I am becoming more familiar with the details in going through it tonight.  I cannot understand how the Minister, as deputy leader of his party, got this through the parliamentary party because it is anathema to the Labour Party I know.  I have never been a member, nor do I intend to be, but I have great respect for its members.  The Labour Party-Fianna F&aacute;il Government was one of the most progressive Governments in the past century.  We introduced free university education.</p><p>The Minister should pull back and drop the Bill.  Let us go back to the drawing board and look at this issue.  He has inherited a crisis and the worst Bill ever introduced in the House.  It is the worst plan for the establishment of a semi-State company ever devised and putting that company under Bord Gais Energy which is being privatised------</p></speech>

Certain people will always pay for everything, while there will be always be others who cannot pay.  Is there a means test through which those who cannot pay can make their case that they are down to their last &euro;5 per week?  Is there any way they can say to the community welfare officer that they cannot pay?  Has provision been made for the handicapped, the disabled, separated people or single mothers with children to be exempt from this charge?</p></speech>

Both the Minister and the Minister of State have acknowledged throughout the debate that they believe there are people who can pay, people who will not pay and people who genuinely are in a position that they will not be able to pay.  The Minister has said the measures he has introduced will support them.  However, where somebody cannot pay, will he outline how imposing a late payment charge will make his or her position better rather than worse?  If someone is so badly strapped that he or she cannot pay the initial fees, imposing a late payment charge will exacerbate his or her position, as well as putting severe mental pressure on him or her because he or she is worried as it is about the other bills he or she has to pay, food, etc.</p><p>A number of related issues have not been raised.  I met the leaders of a students' union in a third level institution recently on a different issue and I asked them what was the most pressing issue for students.  I was taken aback that it was water charges because I could not understand why that was an issue.  They said students were being put under pressure by landlords on water charges because they were still unclear as to where they stood on the issue and whether they would be hit with the charges, late charges and fines.  They are, therefore, flagging this issue with students and threatening to withhold deposits.  Students also do not know where they stand in this regard.  They also highlighted that where numbers of students stayed in a house together, some were exemplary students and tenants but others might not be; some might be good at paying the rent, while others might be a little slow.  Where the late payments fall one year after a group of students have left a house, who will be left holding the can for the payment of the late charges?  Where does the landlord stand, etc?</p><p>This goes back to the piecemeal manner in which the legislation has been introduced.  If I wanted to put a kitchen in a house, I would draw up a plan.  I would not go to IKEA this week, buy a piece of furniture and return another week for another piece and so on and hoped it all worked together.  There does not seem to be a plan for water charges.  We have had three water services Bills with severe changes in each one.  We have been told legislation will be brought forward in the future to address the position of landlords, etc, but what is the overall plan?  Why is the Minister asking us to buy into a piecemeal approach to the legislation where he is giving us a number of pieces of the jigsaw but not showing us the overall picture?  That is the part of the reason people find it hard to believe and trust the Government's plans on these issues because it is chopping and changing so much and there does not seem to be an overall plan into which people can buy.</p><p>Senator David Cullinane raised another issue in this regard, to which he did not receive a reply.  This relates to local authority housing and late charges.  Who is responsible for the collection of property taxes on local authority housing?  Are local authority managers being directed to collect and increase rents on local authority housing, as has been mentioned by some local authority chief executive officers?  Are rents being increased in order that the water charges can be collected in that way?  If the local authorities experience late payment issues, do they pay the charges, or does it fall to the tenants to pay them?  If it is the tenants, how will the matter be administered?  Local authority housing is within the Minister's bailiwick.  What discussions are taking place with local authority chief executive officers on administering it?  What agreements have been reached?  I understand there are substantial issues involved.  If we could receive specific answers, it might be a help.</p></speech>

I appreciate the time he and the Minister of State have given.</p><p>It has been reported to me in the past hour that the Exchequer has taken over the debts of Irish Water to the tune of &euro;460 million.  Is this true?</p><p>On the issue of people not being able to pay, I recall my father who was a gas fitter travelling around the country to repair gas cookers.  When he went to the poorest areas, he was paid first time every time and if the customer had to walk up to every house on the street to get the money to pay, he or she did so.  We are good at paying our bills.  We now have a movement who use the motto &quot;Can't pay, won't pay&quot;.  The people who will not pay are a problem, but ordinary, decent people have always tried to pay their debts.  </p><p>Two questions were posed to me and I will put them to the Minister.  Will it be possible for the poorest of the poor to pay their water charges in stages, perhaps quarterly?  If so, will they be penalised in the way they would be if they were to pay their motor tax in this way?  Will it be possible to buy saving stamps on a weekly basis to pay water charges?  It tore the heart and soul out of me when I was asked that question.  This involves people asking to buy a &euro;1 or &euro;2 stamp each week to cover their water charges.</p> <p>These are decent and genuine people who want to meet the charges, regardless of the rest of the furore about Irish Water around the country.</p><p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh asked about the adding of water charges to rent by local authorities, a serious question that has come our way tonight and needs to be answered.  I know we are all tired at this stage but these questions are coming into me as the debate goes on.  I feel the people who are raising these questions are entitled to an answer.</p></speech>

Is it not possible to take on board some of the amendments brought to the Minister by the Opposition?  Does the Minister intend to take any amendment on any Stage?  I am quite happy to stay here until the sun comes up, goes down again and comes up again.  I have no difficulty with that.  Many is the time in my life I did a 48-hour stint.  If the Minister is not going to take the amendments, will he do us the favour and tell us he cannot?  Then we can all go home and come back to Report Stage on Monday when we can see what we can do with him after having a weekend to consider it.  Like some of our learned judges have said in recent times, maybe the Minister should go outside and consider his position.  When he has had time to do so, maybe he will come back in with a whole new approach to matters.</p></speech>

Is there a provision for a means-test so they can prove they cannot pay?  Will there be a facility for community welfare officers to assist those who cannot pay?  Simply, one cannot get blood from a stone.  There are many people in tough situations with debt.  We have moved on from that debate about the numbers with serious issues with mortgage payments and in fear of their homes being repossessed.  Banks are much tighter now and are refusing to take interest-only arrangements from their clients.  They are now writing to people to repossess their homes.  I am talking about people who have fallen on tough times, marriages split up, not able to get maintenance, getting occasional part-time work and doing everything to fund the mortgage interest but now the banks are writing to repossess their homes.  Putting a water bill on top of this will make it unsustainable for those in such circumstances.  These people may just need three years support to get back on their uppers.  Is there a means for them to get a waiver from the water charges or support from their community welfare officer?</p></speech>

In the event people do not pay and with the new section on the prohibition of the reduction of supply, Senator Barrett will agree that sections 4 and 6 would go against the laws of economics.  On the one hand, one cannot turn off the supply so there are no consequences if one does not pay for it.  I am not as knowledgeable as Senator Barrett when it comes to the laws of economics but maybe he will enlighten us as to whether, like the Government&rsquo;s policy on Irish Water, this not only defies the laws of economics but the laws of rational thinking.</p><p>I am, of course, opposed to the section.  Has the Government done a regulatory impact assessment on this section, coupled with section 6?  What is the likelihood of people not paying?  The Minister referred to the law of unintended consequences with regard to the plebiscite and the demand for a constitutional amendment.  Yesterday, we were informed that only 8% of civil servants in the Department of Finance are actual economists.  Surely, someone in the Department has looked at this section, coupled with the provision that supplies will not be turned off.  Surely, a regulatory impact assessment has been carried out as was stated in the programme for Government for all future policies and legislation.  To date, only one assessment has been carried out by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which introduces a whole new level of comedy when one thinks it is meant to be the lead Department in this regard.  Has any economist looked at section 5 and the fact water supply will not be turned off?  I will venture a guess that-----</p></speech>

I am sure someone in the ESB has done a little rule on this.  Can one imagine if there were no consequences for not paying an electricity bill?  There was a time, I accept, one could ratchet it up but it would never be cut off for a couple of years.  In the same regard, if electricity supply was not cut off, how would the ESB fare if the majority of its customers did not pay?</p> <p>How big would the bad debt provision be?  There are unanswered questions also in regard to landlords and tenants and the fact that the bill for the property seems to be the responsibility of the landlord, which is a situation the ESB has learned from.</p><p>We were told Bord G&aacute;is was the repository of all wisdom and the oracle of all knowledge when it came to how to run a service.  Being the geniuses they are in Bord G&aacute;is, have they a policy of not turning off the gas of customers who do not pay or of only adding a charge of &euro;60 per annum to a bill for non-payment?  Would anybody believe Bord G&aacute;is would have a small bad debt provision?  Does anybody believe that neither Bord G&aacute;is nor the ESB would have gone broke at this stage?  Of course they would have gone broke, because, as no doubt Senator Barrett would point to first year economic students, if there are no consequences for an action, it is likely people who might get advantage from the action will carry take that action.</p><p>If a report has been carried out on this, I would like to see it.  What are the consequences of section 4 when we couple it with the fact that nobody's supply will be cut off?  Has anybody followed the Government's policy and carried out a regulatory impact assessment?  I would be amazed, but pleasantly surprised, if someone can produce such an assessment.</p></speech>

The purpose of the section is to address the issue of those people who simply refuse to pay charges.  The late payment fees that will apply are of &euro;30 for a dwelling occupied by not more than one adult and &euro;60 for an unoccupied dwelling or a dwelling occupied by two or more adults.  These charges will apply for each year that arrears have been unpaid.<br/>A number of questions relating to this section have been raised.  There is a distinction made here between those who cannot pay and those who will not pay.  Those who are paying need to be treated fairly, but we must also ensure there is a process in place for those who will not pay.  This is that process.  A number of Senators asked about those who continue not to pay and raised issues relating to local authorities, landlords and deposits etc.  Senators will be glad to know provisions regarding all of these issues will be outlined in a Bill that will be presented in the new year.  I presume we will have another late night for that debate.</p></speech>

A question was asked as to whether I gave a direction to local authorities and the answer is &quot;No&quot;.<br/>In regard to payments, a range of flexible payment systems will be put in place for those who find it difficult to pay the charges.  Senators will be glad to know that I have insisted on An Post being used as part of the payment plan option, a suggestion raised in this House on many occasions.  Various payment mechanisms will be used by An Post and there will also be a number of other easy pay options, such as Payzone and direct debits.<br/>The late payment charges are focused on those who refuse to pay or to engage with Irish Water.  I assure the House that those who have affordability difficulties will be treated sympathetically and measures will be put in place to ensure that.  Community welfare officers will, of course, be asked to help people with issues.<br/>I cannot recall the date on which I announced in Cork that I believed it was inappropriate that anybody's water would ever be turned off.  I made the decision that this was not the right way to go and changed that provision.  I wish to make it clear to the House that no household will be disconnected from the water supply due to inability to pay.  I believe it was important to take this step.  <br/>No memo has gone to local authorities in regard to the second piece of legislation which will be introduced in the new year.  This legislation is being drafted currently and I hope to publish it early in the new year.<br/>To be clear, if a person has difficulty paying water bills but is in communication with Irish Water and is entering a payment plan or process, that person will be treated sympathetically and late payment charges will not apply.<br/>I believe I have answered all of the questions.</p></speech>

Why is there a separate Bill?  When we pass this Bill, we will then deal with all of the other issues, but why is there a need for a separate Bill on this?

Our main concern is affordability.  Our concern is not for those people who can afford to pay but who are taking a principled stand and will not pay - like myself - but for those with real affordability issues.  I welcome that the Minister has said the Department will be sympathetic, but there are no specifics supplied in that regard.  This is a completely vague response and there is no specific proposal in the Bill that sets out what the Minister is going to do to help those people.<br/>There is no point in telling us this will be provided for after the Bill has been passed.  People will be sitting in our offices explaining they cannot afford to pay, but all I will be able to say to them is that the Minister said he would be sympathetic.  They will go to their community welfare officer, but as we know, community welfare officers are under fierce pressure as their budgets are being cut.  In the past, community welfare officers were able to provide support, for example in getting deposits together for people getting rent supplement for private accommodation, but that support has almost dried up now.  In other areas where they supplied financial support in the past, they are no longer able to do so because of the lack of resources.<br/>We need more specifics from the Minister on this, because affordability is one of the critical issues in regard to the charges.  Some people cannot afford to pay, yet the promise of sympathy is extremely vague and there is no specific measure or proposal in the Bill in regard to how they will be helped to pay the charges.  Can the Minister be more specific in regard to how the sympathetic approach will work?  How will it translate into action?</p> <p>In tangible terms, what does that sympathy mean?  I certainly do not tell people in Waterford that the Minister has a bag-load of sympathy for them but nothing else.  The Minister has not explained it to me.  He said people could go to their community welfare officers and there would be sympathy, but he should explain exactly what that will mean in specifics.</p></speech>

Is that the idea that is coming before us?  If a penalty is levied on people who have not paid, and further penalties apply, at what stage does the build-up stop?  What is the methodology for recouping that money?  It is not clear to me?  Is that part of what will be in the new Bill?</p><p>Am I correct in saying that the Revenue Commissioners can play no role in this, as it could with the property tax, because Uisce &Eacute;ireann is an independent company?  When the Minister replies, he might outline if the methodology for recovering the money will be in the new Bill and how long it can go on for.  Is any other penalty envisaged?  Can the Minister confirm that the Revenue Commissioners will not be involved in collecting that money indirectly?</p></speech>

How many do they expect?  I am sure those figures must have been done and somebody in Uisce &Eacute;ireann must have carried out that assessment.  It would be imprudent not to make budgetary provision for bad debtors who will not pay, as well as for those who are unable to pay.</p><p>Will the Minister make available to the House on Monday the assessments that were carried out by Uisce &Eacute;ireann due to the change and the fact that people's water supply will not now be cut off?  What effect will this have on the figures?  Fundamentally, it will have an enormous effect on the figures.  For Uisce &Eacute;ireann to tell the Minister otherwise would - let me put this as diplomatically as possible - be misleading the Minister to the point at which it will require the Government and therefore the taxpayer or consumer to make up the loss.  There must be figures on this somewhere.  They must have been done by Uisce &Eacute;ireann, but has it made them available to the Department?  If not, there is a serious accountancy error, because the books will not balance.  The figures must have changed and there must be a bigger bad debt provision now as a result of sections 4 and 6.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-12-19a.1490" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1140" speakername="Terry Leyden" time="22:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014121900081#FFFF00500"><p>The Minister is sympathetic to people who are unable to pay, and I accept his goodwill and bona fides in this regard.  To be quite clear, however, it would be in the Minister's best interests to include a provision on Report Stage, on Monday, to put that into hard fact and recall D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to sort this out.  I make no apologies to any colleagues in the Lower House.  I was a Member of the D&aacute;il and was recalled from a family holiday abroad to bring in emergency legislation, so it is no problem at all.  I left my family in some part of Europe and flew home to be here, although I am not going to make a song and dance about it.  It was more important than some of the stuff before us.  We were brought home to save a major employer in this country.</p><p>I accept the Minister's goodwill, but Ministers come and go.  His sympathetic heart is clearly identifiable at this stage; he sounds very Christmassy, like Santa Claus.  He certainly does not sound like Scrooge, though most of the Bill is more like Scrooge than Santa Claus. </p><p>Will the Minister elaborate on the situation?  Is he saying that if a person is unable to pay, he or she will be exempt from the surcharge and, I presume, the charge?  Who will decide on that?  Is it a sympathetic Irish Water employee earning &euro;100,000 a year or whatever he or she is getting?  Or will it be decided by the Department of Social Protection, which is being brought into the scheme later, for some unknown reason?</p><p>I accept the bona fides of what the Minister is saying, but what he says cannot be cashed in.  The Minister may say that a person put to the pin of their collar, with no food to put on the table, and who cannot send their children to school, will be exempt.  I accept that this is very considerate, but I want it in black and white in this Bill.  I and my colleague intend to table an amendment on Report Stage to try to bring this about.</p></speech>

This is a poll tax of &euro;260 on a couple and &euro;160 on a single person for what was previously financed by progressive taxation.  We have changed the basis for financing the water business, and that presents serious poverty problems.  The Bill is so heavily based on engineering that it does need a social dimension.  I hope the Minister's Department will liaise with those studying poverty in this country.</p></speech>

It is worse for those on low incomes, who have taken a bigger fall.</p><p>In dealing with other Ministers, I have come across a school of the new right in the Department of Finance.  They say that what is wrong with the Irish tax system is that so many people are exempt.  I had discussions with the former Minister, the late Brian Lenihan, about that.  They designed the USC and the water charges.  A Canadian expert at the banking inquiry the other day said that about 50% of Canadians are outside the income tax code.  There is a view that what is wrong with the Irish tax code is that low-income people are not taxed enough, but the reason they are not is that their incomes are low.</p></speech>

I hope the Minister, MABS and community welfare staff will help deal with this.  It is a new trend in taxation that will cause poverty, although I know this Minister is committed to tackling it.  He will certainly have my support in that regard.</p></speech>

I am not convinced by the points he made earlier, however, about a new Bill in future.  I appreciated that when I made my earlier contribution.  It is as though I am buying a suit, and the Minister is asking me to buy the jacket today and return after Christmas to buy the trousers in the hope that they will fit together.</p></speech>

I clearly asked the Minister what his blueprint was.  It is not good enough to give us this bit of the jigsaw today and ask us to buy into it.  If we purchase this part of the Bill, the Minister will come back with another piece of legislation which will have a serious impact on what is being decided here today.  The Minister is therefore asking us to make decisions on legislation while not knowing the implications for landlords and private rented dwellings.</p><p>The majority of accommodation in the State comprises local authority houses and private rented dwellings.  This will have a massive impact on the people, so it is absolutely ludicrous to ask us to make decisions on this legislation at this stage.  I would go further than most other Senators and ask the Leader of the House to come back in.  I think we should report progress on this Bill.  The Bill should then be shelved until after Christmas.</p> <p>We are being asked to buy a pig in a poke, as was done by previous Ministers on similar legislation.  We should have the full picture and both pieces of legislation before us before we are asked to make a decision on them.  We should be reporting progress at this stage.  The Minister should come back and give us a full picture unless the Minister can clarify the issues around landlords and private rented accommodation and so forth and what is in his plan.  Surely he is not working in the same type of a vacuum and is not making it up as he goes along.  Surely he did not just come up with this Bill and is going to figure out how to do the next Bill as he goes along.  That is simply not good enough.  I propose that, at this stage, we shelve this Bill and come back to it when we have the full picture.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-12-19a.1500" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1196" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="22:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014121900082#GGGG00200"><p>I will not keep the Minister long.  I just want to get a couple of facts straight.  I asked the Minister about the &euro;460 million.  He has not answered that.  I would appreciate it if he would deal with this.  Is that &euro;460 million in loans to the company?  There is an additional &euro;165 million which is part of the conservation grant and there is &euro;60 million for rates.  When we add up all of those, I am not sure why it is we are even floating this idea establishing this company at all.  This company cannot pay for itself.  I agree with my colleague, Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh.  Shelve the thing.  We are only playing games.  Are we putting this company together to say we have started to charge for water in Ireland and satisfy some head over in Europe?  I cannot see the company making one cent to put into infrastructure.  More important, I can see the Exchequer having until 2019 to pay to keep this company afloat.  I ask the Minister to deal with those issues.  I appreciate the Minister is tired, but I am tired myself - tired of not getting answers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-12-19a.1501" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1123" speakername="Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill" time="22:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014121900082#GGGG00300"><p>I agree with the last comments of Senator Craughwell.  They are well made and well-founded.  We talk about being able to fund infrastructural investment off balance sheet.  However, ultimately someone has to pay for it.  Just because it is off balance sheet does not mean that someone out in Europe is going to pay for it.  The customer is going to be fleeced to pay for it or it will be paid for through general taxation.  Just because the Minister is setting up this quango called Irish Water does not mean that there is a fairy tree under the rainbow that will pay for it.  The money has to come from somewhere.  It will come from the people who will have to pay the bill and through general taxation.  In the meantime, however, we are going to fund this semi-State organisation which is going to gain unprecedented powers, and the individuals working within this organisation are going to have very cosy numbers on 12-year contracts.  It is only a financial moving exercise, so the Minister can charge people.  That is all that is involved here.</p><p>However, sticking to the section we are speaking to - I apologise for straying - I have one or two questions for the Minister.  On the late payment charge, I agree there will be two elements here, possibly more.  There will be the people who genuinely cannot afford to pay and there will be the people who will not pay.  However, what will happen is the people who genuinely cannot afford to pay are going to get caught.  The people who can afford to pay will eventually pay and they will pay the &euro;60 or &euro;30 extra because they will see that the accumulation of that over time would not be economically viable for them.  They will just pay it.  The poor people who genuinely cannot afford to pay it are going to be caught by this trap.  It is the people who should be supported who will be caught.  Income support is made available for low-income households in the policies that are in place in 30 OECD countries.  It is not provided for in this Bill.  The ability to pay principle, for those who genuinely cannot afford to pay, is nowhere to be seen in this legislation.  Those people are going to be screwed by this legislation.  </p><p>This section, and the Bill itself, flies in the face of the principle of conservation.  The Minister speaks of a conservation grant.  It is a flat rate grant.  It has nothing to do with conservation.  It is a flat rate across the board, irrespective of whether one conserves water or not.  There are elements to it which I feel have not been thought out and which have not stood up to scrutiny.  Senator Leyden made the point that the Minister should go back and give a period of space.  No one is going to criticise a Minister for doing that.  It would be a very plausible thing for any Minister or Government to do.  If we are genuine about doing politics in a new way and looking at how we fund our country in a new way, we should be open to these sorts of things.  It should not be a case of the politics of the past continuing into the present.</p><p>I have one additional question about the figures used by the Minister's Department.  According to its 2014 figures, there are 1.35 million dwellings in the country.  However, according to the latest census figures, there is 1.65 million dwellings.  I heard an interview with the Minister during which he said the figure was the assumed number of those who would register.  Are we assuming that 300,000 households will not register?  Will they be caught under this section?  Will the Minister provide some clarification on this?</p></speech>

The Minister has put on the record that there will be supports available through the community welfare officer.  It is critical that the Bill will be poverty-proofed.  Has the Minister tied that in with social protection and has the Minister for Social Protection agreed with that, or is the Minister at liberty to say this without consulting with the Minister for Social Protection since it would be a charge on her Department?</p><p>I did not vote for water charges last year because I learned that &euro;1 billion came out of general taxation to pay for water.  Some &euro;490 million of that, or half a billion euro, is now going on a subvention to Irish Water.  However, there is still half a billion, or &euro;510 million, left.  Where is that gone or going?  How is the taxpayer being credited for that?  This argument is being used by those who will not pay.  To be fair, it is a reasonable question to ask.  We need an answer to this.  We can accept a lot in Ireland if we get answers.  If we do not get answers, we dig in our heels and we get entrenched.  That is the reason I did not vote for water charges last year.  I got no answer to that basic question and I still have not got one.  I want to know how that &euro;510 million which is still being collected in taxes, that up to now was paying for water, is being credited to the taxpayer.  It is taxpayers' money.  </p><p>What is the contingency plan if Irish Water cannot collect or is not viable?  Will it fall back on the Exchequer to keep it afloat?  Will the &euro;510 million that is not right now being credited to Irish Water kick in?  It points to a fundamentally flawed model.  I accept that there have been improvements, but all we are doing all the time is trying to do the wrong thing a little big &quot;righter&quot;.  </p><p>I have put three questions.  I would appreciate three answers. </p></speech>

It would be inappropriate to do so in respect of legislation that will not be introduced until early 2015.  I repeat that a major distinction has been made between those who cannot pay and those who will not pay.  Those who are paying also need to be treated fairly.  A range of options will be provided to anyone who is in difficulty and such persons will be treated fairly.  The Commission for Energy Regulation will be responsible for customer service issues and oversee how Irish Water's handles its customers.

I outlined that An Post can play a significant role in providing a service.  We have all heard about the need to protect post offices.  Provided customers engage properly with Irish Water, they will not be subject to late payment charges.<br/>On the role of community welfare officers and social protection measures, these are a matter for the Minister for Social Protection who will deal with issues that arise if people have a problem with regard to how they pay the charge.  Social welfare legislation provides for exceptional needs payments and those who are in difficulty can also be covered through those payments. <br/>I am not sure who asked a question about the Revenue Commissioners but I do not envisage a role for the Revenue Commissioners.  <br/>The other questions raised by Senators relate to other sections.

It is &euro;100 per house and we have 1.65 million houses, so that amounts to &euro;165 million paid out of the Exchequer, out of general taxation, which means money is going to be taken from the budget for hospitals, schools, roads, etc.  I have difficulty, as I said earlier, that it is not coming out of Irish Water.  Here we have the Government shoring up Irish Water again.  It has already got &euro;490 million of a subvention and now it is shoring up Irish Water with the water conservation grant, which is really an inducement to sign up.  It is a sop to the electorate.  What proofs will there be that conservation is happening?  How will conservation be verified?  Let us take my own case.  I pay &euro;260 and by the end of year I will claim back &euro;100.  How will the Government assess that I am conserving water?  Why is this called a water conservation grant when we do not see any means by which it is going to be measured?  Given that the water conservation grant is paid by the Exchequer, who is actually responsible for evaluating the effectiveness of this measure?  Is it the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Department of Social Protection, or Irish Water?  If this is not a water conservation grant we should not call it that.  Let us call it a water rebate levy to thank people for signing up.</p></speech>

Strangely enough, the Commission for Energy Regulation was very involved at the start of this legislation and all of a sudden it disappeared.</p> <p>The Government said it was a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation to set the costs and charges and said it had nothing to do with the Minister or the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.

Senator Healy Eames is correct to suggest this is all about getting people to sign up and nothing else.  I cannot understand how the Minister will gather whether we have conserved anything.  Are we going to employ inspectors to check what conservation measures have taken place in each house?  Do I simply sign up and state that I have conserved water or carried out water conservation in my house?  One explanation is that it will contribute towards bringing the network up to standard to meet metric tests established by the Commission for Energy Regulation.  We are moving around between different Departments.  It is a question of sliding mirrors and smokescreens.  It is just another scam to get people to sign up, nothing else.  We induce people with &euro;100.  We get them in for &euro;260 for a couple of years but then we will have to double, triple or quadruple the costs to pay back the money that the Government will have borrowed in the meantime.</p><p>All of this is assuming the company lasts past its first year.  I believe it will be insolvent within a few months because no one is going to pay.  This is my problem - no one is going to pay.  Where do we go then?  We have a vast quango with thousands of employees and no way of paying them or no way for the company to pay for itself.  The Minister should not try to cod us.  People are watching this tonight and wondering what we are playing at.</p></speech>

If not, then those in charge should let us all go home to bed.  Then, we will come back on Monday and have a discussion on Report Stage during which the Minister will probably take no amendments either.  Let us stop the game-playing.

She has put a good deal of work into her amendments and they are thoughtful.  From my perspective they are rather helpful, in particular, the amendment currently tabled because most of the debate on Second Stage and throughout today was on the question of conservation.  Since all the meters are not in place there is no way of saying what we are achieving in the area of conservation at the moment.  However, it was supposed to be one of the main selling points of Uisce &Eacute;ireann from day 1.</p><p>I cannot see how this amendment is not seen as being helpful, not only to Members making contributions but to the Minister and the Government as well.  At this stage there may not be any idea as to how it would be done.  However, this amendment would focus and challenge us over the coming months to come up with some methodology to tie down this issue once and for all.</p><p>I am not keen for us to encounter a sudden realisation when this legislation is being implemented that conservation has gone out the window and is no longer part of the agenda.  I know the Minister does not want to see that, the Government does not want that and no reasonable person wants to see it either.  All the contributions I have heard from all the positions on this legislation put conservation high on the priority list.  This amendment would help us to focus on doing that.  Even at this late hour, I call on the Minister to consider whether he sees any merit in the amendment.</p></speech>

It is clear there is a potential flaw, not so much in the legislation but because of the disincentive to conserve.  We are full of contradictions in this House.  First, we do not want to cap usage or the charge on usage.  However, this section gets to the heart of the philosophy behind the Bill, which is about conserving water.  Certainly, for the first period or up to 2018 there is no incentive to conserve water and yet we are all going to get &euro;100 for doing so.</p><p>In one way the other side of the House need not worry about it because it means we will all pay less.  It will reduce the amount for water on a weekly basis in the first place and it will be utterly uncapped.  In other words, there is no incentive to conserve water.  We could keep the taps running between now and December 2018 and that is a concern.</p><p>The other issue I want to raise on this section-----</p></speech>

How does that fit in?  I seek a general policy statement from the Minister on where he sees rain harvesting contributing to conservation.  In particular, where does he see it in this Bill?  If he does not see it within the Bill then where might he see it as part of future legislation?  The concern I have, which I also raised on Second Stage, relates to the possible punishment of customers and if rain-harvesting is used particularly in replacement of wastewater.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-12-19a.1542" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="22:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014121900085#KKKK01600"><p>There are many problems with this conservation measure.  First, it is not related to conservation.  The memorandum states that people get &euro;100 per household which people "can use to assist with water conservation in their homes".  They could use it to buy watering cans, garden sprinklers or to buy &euro;100 worth of Ballygowan water.  I am unsure what it is supposed to be conserving.  It is all over the place.</p><p>Second, it is unrelated to income.  We are paying this out to millionaires for their swimming pools and so on.  Subsidies of this kind have no place in an economy that is still borrowing &euro;8 billion per year.  It gives the same to people on social welfare as sur-taxpayers.  It is an unconstrained transfer and has nothing to do with conservation.</p><p>It is paid from the Department of Social Protection.  I have argued in the House many times that the universalism of benefits like child benefit paid in this unconstrained way right up the income scale of sur-taxpayers, millionaires and so on is wrong.  The redistribution of social welfare in particular should be towards low-income people.  We should pay more attention to the couple who must pay the &euro;260 poll tax that Irish Water has imposed.</p><p>The Commission for Energy Regulation is supposed to be advising on the matter.  It put up the public service obligation by over 50% for electricity.  The commission has already given us the highest prices for electricity found anywhere in Europe.  The belief of some Ministers in quangos for the purposes of serving consumer interests is extraordinary.</p> <p>The Central Bank could not regulate banks.  Bus fares have increased massively and they are supposed to be regulated by the National Transport Authority.  Health insurance costs increased by 58% when we have the Health Insurance Authority.  It suits civil servants to say there is a quango to deal with something but they appoint the quango which does what it is told and never represents the consumer.  The idea that the Commission for Energy Regulation should have any role in this is unacceptable.  It has done enough damage already to consumers of water and energy in this country.</p></speech>

I am dumbfounded by what I am hearing from the Ministers on the questions we are raising.  This is a bona fide amendment into which there has been a good deal of thought.  I am confused as to the reason the Department of Social Protection has been chosen to make the payment on the conservation grant scheme.  From what we have heard it is clear it is not really measurable as a conservation measure.  We are told that the Department of Social Protection is so strapped we had to see cuts in fuel allowances, respite care, child benefit, mobility grants, etc., but all of a sudden the Government can turn around and offer every household in the country this &euro;100 grant.  I wonder about the implications of the cost of that.  What is the actual cost?  How many households are involved?  What is the estimated total cost of the conservation grant?  The amendment is about publishing a report outlining how it is being implemented-----</p></speech>

I am asking the Minister very clear questions.  What are the projections?  How many households do they intend to pay the grant to?  How much of a hole will that leave in the social protection budget, and has that been signed off on by Cabinet and by the Minister for Social Protection?</p><p>In terms of the principle of this, it is like borrowing money from a loan shark.  It seems like a good idea at the time but in the longer run we will end up paying much more and being a lot more indebted.  This is the carrot being used again.  It is just another Irish Water scam by this Government and it no longer has any credibility in my view.  The Minister should give us detail on this because we got very little detail on most of the questions we have asked so far in this debate, and it appears there has been very little thought put into most of the measures in the Bill.  It strikes me that Irish Water 1, 2 and 3 are episodes of another debacle.</p></speech>

It is so dishonest it is outrageous.  It would be far better if the Government and the Minister put their hands up and said that they were hoping to charge people more.  The Commission for Energy Regulation, as  we know, published our water charges plan.  The average cost was to be &euro;400.  People came out and marched on the streets and rebelled against the tax and the charge.  The Government had to do something about it. It floundered around trying to come up with some way to reduce the charge, and it came up with the water conservation grant.  That is what it is; it is not a conservation grant.  It was the Government's way to reduce the charge.  We should at least be honest about that.  There is no honesty here at all.</p><p>I would imagine the Minister will not be able to point to a single scrap of evidence as to how this conservation grant will lead to water being conserved.  Why in God's name would the Department of Social Protection provide people with a grant to conserve water?  Surely that is a matter for the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  It is not a conservation grant.  There is no relationship between water conservation and this so-called grant which is being paid.  People will get that and they can do with it what they choose.  The reason they are getting it is so that they can do with it what they choose because it is purely designed to reduce the cost of the charge to the user.  If we had a bit of honesty about this-----</p></speech>
