    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-11-10a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1118" speakername="Michael Mullins" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015111000002#B00400"><p>I also welcome the Minister of State.  I am delighted she could attend to discuss this matter regarding Ballinasloe Social Services.  It is a wonderful organisation that provides an amazing service to the elderly in Ballinasloe and in the outlying areas of Kiltormer, Lawrencetown, Clontuskert, Kilconnell, Aughrim, Cappataggle, Taughmaconnell, Moore and Clonfad.</p> <p>Ballinasloe Social Services has a minibus and it brings people to the centre four days a week.  People who avail of the services are referred by the general practitioners, GPs, public health nurses, social workers and family carers.  Ballinasloe Social Services has a range of activities.  It provides lunch for the elderly, music every Tuesday, exercise programmes, computer classes, arts and crafts and card playing.  A Health Service Executive, HSE, community physiotherapist visits on a regular basis to maximise the independence and support or improve the quality of life of the older person.  A chiropodist provides a clinic on a monthly basis.</p> <p>There are two elements in the service.  There is a day care service which is availed of by 62 elderly people.  There is currently a waiting list of 13 for this service.  The meals-on-wheels service is availed of by 65 elderly people, 27 of whom also avail of the day care service.  Approximately 100 elderly people can remain in their own homes and communities as a result of the service provided by Ballinasloe Social Services.</p> <p>The centre is staffed by a HSE nurse and a part-time social services nurse.  However, since January 2013 the HSE post has not been filled on a permanent basis.  Cover is provided from St. Brendan's community nursing unit in Loughrea on a daily basis from a pool of seven or eight nurses.  The inconsistency gives rise to uncertainty as a different person could be there every day providing the service.  That is not the best type of service to provide to elderly people.</p> <p>With regard to its funding, the section 39 grant from the HSE has decreased over the years from &euro;146,700 in 2008 to &euro;131,000 in 2015.  In 2014, it cost approximately &euro;259,000 to provide the service to the elderly.  This figure is similar to the figure for other years as the centre watches its costs very closely.  A balance of &euro;128,000 must be raised through fund-raising and service charges.  This is unsustainable in the long term and puts enormous pressure on the staff and volunteers.  Much time and effort is spent fund-raising each year which could be better spent in providing much needed services to the elderly citizens.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael Mullins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2368"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2368&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMullins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is compounded by the fact that Ballinasloe is a RAPID programme town, in which there are high levels of deprivation and where the opportunities to fundraise are limited.  We are looking for two things: for the nursing embargo to be lifted in this exceptional case to allow one person to be appointed to this post and for an immediate increase in the section 39 grant to enable Ballinasloe Social Services to continue providing the necessary services for the elderly people of Ballinasloe and surrounding areas.</p><p>Ballinasloe Social Services provides an amazing facility.  The staff and volunteers are kind and caring and provide a warm and homely environment for the elderly persons in their care.  I pay particular tribute to the staff but also to the large number of volunteers who give generously of their time to improve the lives of others.  There is a wonderful atmosphere in the place which I have seen on the many occasions I have been there and I want it to continue to develop.  Through this wonderful service, many elderly persons are enabled to remain in their homes, something the Minister of State and the Government are promoting very strongly and as a result of which, there are significant savings to the State.</p><p>To repeat my request, we want a nurse appointed on a full-time basis and an increase in the section 39 grant to enable the huge burden of fundraising that has to be borne by staff and volunteers to be reduced in the coming years.  I thank the Minister of State for attending to deal with this matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-11-10a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015111000002#C00200"><p>I thank the Senator for raising the issue.  The overarching policy of the Government is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible and to support access to quality long-term residential care, where this is appropriate.  The Health Service Executive is responsible for the delivery of health and personal social services, including home help an home care packages, meals on wheels, respite or day care and a range of other community-based services.</p> <p>Day centres such as those provided by Ballinasloe Social Services provide invaluable support, advice and social interaction for older people who may, for any number of reasons, be experiencing isolation and loneliness.  Ballinasloe Social Services has been operating as a social outlet in the area since 1972 and operates Monday to Thursday.  Traditionally, the services provided have included services within the remit of what is now Tusla, Ballinasloe Social Services and the HSE.  Personnel, including public health nurses and physiotherapists, have collaborated in the provision of services for older people.</p> <p>The day care service is provided four days a week and staffed on a full-time basis by one nurse whole-time equivalent.  This post is filled by a number of nurses from the pool at St. Brendan's CNU, Loughrea, as the Senator outlined.  There is no embargo on the filling of this post.  On the basis that the post of permanent, full-time nurse is a stand-alone position, the HSE has experienced difficulties in filling it.  However, every effort is made to provide continuity of care through the pool of nurses.</p> <p>Since 2011, the HSE has provided &euro;131,000 annually for Ballinasloe Social Services through a section 39 grant.  As we are all aware, the Health Service has been through a number of very difficult years, probably the most difficult in modern times.  However, there is good news on the resources front and we have a little more money than previously.  This year we secured the first increase in health spending in seven years and next year we will have nearly &euro;900 million more compared to budget 2015.  Notwithstanding the better economic news recently, resource availability remains tight across the health service.  However, the Government remains fully committed to using the resources available in the most effective way possible and in a way that best matches the needs of service users.  The HSE is continuously working to develop services on this basis.  A priority for 2016 will be the development of an integrated model of care, with a strong emphasis on home and community care.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Kathleen Lynch:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=656"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=656&amp;amp;pid=KathleenLynch&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The level of services to be provided by the available funding will be set out in the HSE's 2016 national service plan which is currently being prepared by the Executive.</p><p>While I welcome the increase in funding for the health services in 2016, I do not underestimate the continuing challenge of delivering the services required against a backdrop of growing needs.  It is essential that we continue to focus on cost containment, productivity and efficiencies, as these will continue to be a major cost pressure on the health service into the future.  These pressures include an increased and aging population, an increase in chronic conditions and new and expensive medicines and treatments.  </p><p>The HSE acknowledges the significant and valuable contribution made year after year by Ballinasloe Social Services and it looks forward to continuing its collaboration in the future with the mutual goal of providing the best possible care for older people in that area.  The negotiations on funding are always carried out between the service and the HSE on a service level agreement.  The service provided is appreciated. </p></speech>

The service is appreciated and I welcome the fact that there is no embargo on filling the post.  I assume that efforts will continue to be made to fill the post on a permanent basis because it is not sustainable to have somebody coming every day from the service in Loughrea.  I hope to see some progress there.  I welcome the fact that there are additional resources available this year.  I hope that the negotiations and discussions between the service providers, Ballinasloe Social Services, and the HSE management will result in a significant increase in the resources it receives in the coming year.  I thank the Minister of State for coming in and I would like her to visit the service if she is in the area.  It is a model service and is certainly something that can be replicated in other areas of the country.</p></speech>

It exists across the range, including in some of our very high tech hospitals, where one would imagine nurses would want to work.  It is getting easier.  That is all I will say.  There are still vacancies but not as many as there were.  If the right person becomes available the post will be filled.</p></speech>

I want to raise the plight of small rural GP practices.  They seem to be in a state of crisis.  I am not concerned with practices that have 1,600 or more patients.  Many small rural GPs have fewer than 600 patients.  There are 21 vacancies for full-time GPs in rural Ireland - 22% have been vacant for two years and 17% have been vacant for one year.  Recruitment seems to be the problem.  It appears that our investment in rural practice only amounts to 2.5% of the health budget whereas in the UK it is up to 9%.  During the crash, rural GPs lost approximately 40% of their income.  That included the rural practice allowance that was taken away and travel allowance to call-outs, which was put in place 35 years ago.  A higher rate was paid if a longer distance was to be travelled.  Now that things have improved, I ask the Minister of State to reverse the financial emergency measures that were introduced in 2008 and 2009 in order to entice GPs into rural practice.  Their present situation is being reviewed but the outcome of that review will not be known until the end of 2016.</p> <p>There is another problem.  If rural GPs are forced out because their practice is unsustainable, patients cannot transfer to another local doctor.  They are at the mercy of various locums who will be at their disposal and who are not familiar with them to the same degree as the full-time GP.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Kelly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2348"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2348&amp;amp;pid=JohnKelly&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am also aware that some GPs are earning less than their practice nurses.  There is a crisis and investment is the only thing that can solve it.  We are talking about the resuscitation of general practice in rural Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-11-10a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015111000002#E00200"><p>We need to be careful about the language we use.  There are 18 vacancies in total and percentages can often give a false view when one is talking about a small cohort of people.  All 18 vacancies are covered by locums.  In some cases, as this has been on a prolonged basis, they will not be unfamiliar to the people they see on a daily basis.  There is, however, an issue, with which we are not unfamiliar.  We recently had two meetings on the subject.</p> <p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue, as it provides me with an opportunity to update the House on it.  I am very much aware of the issues facing general practice in rural areas.  My colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and I recently held separate meetings with the Irish Medical Organisation and the National Association of General Practitioners, at which we discussed general practice in rural areas, among other things.  Under the general medical services capitation contract, GPs are eligible for a rural practice allowance when they live and practise in an area with a population of less than 500 where there is not a town with a population of 1,500 or more within a radius of 4.83 km of that centre and where the HSE considers it necessary to pay an allowance to retain a doctor in the area.  The rural practice allowance under the capitation agreement is currently set at just over &euro;16,000 per annum.  GPs who satisfy the criteria for payment of the allowance are also entitled to claim practice support subsidies towards the employment of a practice nurse, secretary and manager at the maximum applicable rate which they would otherwise only be entitled to claim if they had a panel size of 1,200 and over.  Qualifying GPs can also claim the maximum applicable contribution towards locum costs for periods of leave such as sick, annual, study, maternity and adoptive leave.  </p> <p>The HSE has recently reviewed its guidelines for dealing with applications for a rural practice allowance from GPs applying for a GMS contract in a rural area.  The purpose of the new guidance is to ensure consistency, transparency and fairness in decision-making in respect of the relevant discretionary provisions of the GMS contract pertaining to the granting or otherwise of the allowance to new applicants.  The new guidance does not, however, affect existing holders of the allowance.  The HSE, the Department of Health and the IMO are engaged in a review of the GMS and other publicly funded health sector contracts involving GPs.  The review is taking place within the context of the framework agreement which was signed by the parties in June 2014 and the memorandum of understanding signed in February 2015.</p> <p>Among the topics comprehended by the review is the issue of supports for general practice in rural areas.  With regard to the reversal of fee reductions introduced under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009, FEMPI, I recognise that general practice has contributed its fair share under the Act, some &euro;122 million, but others in society, including other health professionals, have also played a pivotal role in the country's recovery.  A review will take place shortly of the fee adjustments introduced under the FEMPI legislation for contracted professionals in the health sector, including GPs.  This follows on from engagement earlier this year between the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and public sector unions on an orderly unwinding of the legislation.  </p> <p>There is a lot of information included in my reply.  This is not an issue about which we are unconcerned or with which we are unfamiliar.  We hope that, through negotiation and regular contact, there will be some improvements.</p></speech>

I will not go into the detail but there is a severe difficulty from a practical point of view in my home town of Bantry where approximately six different offices provide various social welfare services.  We all want the one-stop-shop facility but when somebody goes into a particular office the file might be in another office, and people end up swapping files.  In terms of security and an onus to be fair to the general public, the system in our town is 40 or 50 years out of date.  Ten or 15 years ago it was mooted that a new premises should be acquired where the various branches of the relevant Department would be located under the one roof.  I ask the Minister of State for an update on that and hope the response I receive will be more positive and enlightening than the one I got 20 months ago.</p></speech>

The Office of Public Works has been working with the Department of Social Protection to support this process.</p> <p>This vision has been given expression under the Intreo programme.  Intreo is a very important step in transforming the way income and employment supports are provided.  The role of the Office of Public Works in assisting the Department of Social Protection to deliver the Intreo programme is to provide appropriate, modern and efficient accommodation that meets the Department's business requirements and allows it to deliver its services to customers efficiently and effectively.  This programme of works represents a very significant investment in terms of both funding by the Government and the allocation of administrative, architectural and technical resources by the OPW.</p> <p>I am pleased to inform the House that by the end of 2015, the OPW will have modified or fitted out 73 buildings for Intreo in 61 cities and towns throughout Ireland.  While priority has been given to delivering the Intreo programme, the Department of Social Protection has also commenced a programme of consolidating services in a number of towns, such as Bantry, where traditional signing services are provided under contract by a branch office, rather than a local office, and where other services such as community welfare and employment services operate from separate locations.  This will likely result in a further programme of works for the OPW that will be delivered over the next two years.</p> <p>It is a feature of the model of integrated services developed by the Department that the public facing side of operations such as waiting areas, serving hatches, interview rooms and group engagement rooms is significantly larger when compared with traditional local social welfare offices.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ann Phelan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2293"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2293&amp;amp;pid=AnnPhelan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->While this is a welcome development, it also creates its own challenges for the Office of Public Works.  In some locations, particularly smaller regional towns, the size of existing office accommodation required to deliver the range of consolidated services may simply not be available, or may be in a less central and readily accessible location in retail parks on the edge of town.  This can make access for those dependent on public transport more challenging.  It may also be the case that there may be several years left to run on existing leased accommodation.</p><p>In such cases, the OPW and the Department are trying to balance the aim of consolidating services with the desire to avoid paying rent on premises that would be vacated prematurely if all services were consolidated in one location.  This is particularly relevant where there is no alternative requirement for the accommodation that would be vacated.  These types of considerations, together with the underlying demand for services in the various towns and the availability or lack of suitably-sized and located buildings, is feeding into the prioritisation of individual projects.</p><p>The Senator has outlined the particular circumstances that exist in Bantry where, in addition to the branch office on Bridge Street which is operated under contract by a third party, the Department's own staff deliver services from four other locations around the town.  It is unfortunate, however, that none of the existing OPW-leased properties in Bantry is big enough to support an integrated operation.</p><p>A search for viable accommodation has been under way in Bantry for some time, but a lack of suitable buildings has hampered progress.  Recently, however, the situation improved and my officials are now in preliminary negotiations with four potential landlords.  Officials were in Bantry on 8 October to inspect these properties and meet their respective owners.  This search process is ongoing, so if the Senator is aware of potentially suitable premises he should please feel free to forward the details to the Minister of State, Deputy Harris.</p><p>As the House will no doubt appreciate, I would prefer not to say anything more specific about the options identified to date, as doing so could inadvertently undermine discussions with potential landlords.  Having said that, I am hopeful the OPW is moving to a position where it will be able to secure a suitable building in Bantry that will support the delivery of integrated social welfare services in the town and surrounding region.  I trust this clarifies the situation for the Senator.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State.  I hope events have moved on since I tabled this motion, which was to be taken last week.  Due to pressure on the Cathaoirleach, it was deferred until today.  I hope this extra time means the clarification required has already been given.</p><p>Since the ruling by the Court of Appeal on 21 October in the case of the DPP <i>v</i>. Perennial Freight Limited, Freight Transport Association Ireland, FTA Ireland, has been active in this regard.  It has been in receipt of multiple queries by telephone and e-mail on whether articulated tractor units should now be weighed separately for the purpose of calculating motor tax.  Despite the fact FTA Ireland has contacted the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Department of Finance, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Revenue Commissioners it has received no clarification.  I understand that at the beginning of this month there was some further clarification on the amount the owners of articulated tractors will have to pay, and the rate for articulated vehicles is now &euro;333, which is the rate for non-agricultural tractors.</p><p>I have a number of questions on this, which are combined, and I hope the Minister of State will address them in her response.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paschal Mooney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1990"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1990&amp;amp;pid=PaschalMooney&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Is the &euro;333 an annual rate for articulated vehicles from now on?  Will the Minister of State confirm this sum is the rate applicable for vehicles whose tax is to be renewed in November and December before the tax reductions announced in the budget kick in?  This is important.  Does it apply for November and December?  Will the Minister of State confirm this to the local tax offices?  I understand they are being forced to handle calls from confused hauliers nationwide.  I have heard a few of these responses and there is most definitely confusion in the local authority offices.  Different answers have been given to queries raised by hauliers.  When will the Minister reflect the announcement in law?  Will it be done in a statutory instrument or amending legislation?  As a result of the successful case taken, will the Minister of State confirm that the several thousand prosecutions outstanding against hauliers for under-taxation of articulated units will now be dropped by the DPP?  Will the Department refund the motor tax unlawfully overcharged on hauliers due to this misreading of the legislation by the local authorities and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?</p><p>The conclusion of Mr. Justice Peart is summarised in paragraph 42 on page 28 of his judgment.  He stated that the practice which had seen hauliers such as the appellant bring a trailer to be weighed in association with the tractor for the purpose of being licensed for the coming period had in his view no statutory basis.  That was the reason the case was won by the freight company.  That more or less sums up what I am attempting to find out and what Freight Transport Association Ireland members are attempting to find out.  I will be grateful for the Minister of State's response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-11-10a.36" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/964" speakername="Ann Phelan" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015111000002#H00200"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  Last month in budget 2016, the Minister for Finance announced that the rates of motor tax on larger goods vehicles are being reduced.  The reductions apply to goods vehicles with an unladen weight exceeding 4,000 kg and will take effect for vehicle licences taken out with a commencement date of 1 January 2016 or after.  As part of the changes announced, the rate structure of 20 bands is being simplified to five bands of motor tax, which will range from the current level of &euro;92 per annum for electric goods vehicles up to &euro;900 per annum for all goods vehicles in excess of 12,000 kg.  The cost of the reductions is some &euro;43 million annually.  This change will benefit the owners of more than 28,000 goods vehicles.</p> <p>A week later, on 21 October, the Court of Appeal made a judgment on a case between the Director of Public Prosecutions and Perennial Freight Limited.  If I was to summarise briefly the import of the judgment, it is that only the mechanically propelled element of an articulated vehicle - in other words, the cab of the vehicle - falls to be taxed on the basis this is the only part of the vehicle that is independently capable of mechanical propulsion.  Up to that point, articulated goods vehicles had been taxed based on the weight of the cab and the heaviest unladen trailer or combination of trailers that would have been drawn by the cab.  The judgment further ruled that articulated vehicles are more appropriately taxed as a different class of vehicle than had been the case up until this judgment.  This is the category under which non-agricultural tractors are taxed and it has a single annual rate of tax of &euro;333.  The judgment does not affect rigid trucks which continue to be taxed on unladen weight.</p> <p>The necessary technical adjustments have now been made to the national vehicle and driver file to apply the &euro;333 rate.  This has been done pending fuller consideration of the implications of the judgment and the appropriate response to it.  Legal advice on certain elements of the judgment has been sought by my Department through the Office of the Attorney General and once it is received and considered, a decision on how best to proceed will be taken.</p> <p>On that basis, I hope the Senator understands that at this point in time, I am not in a position to comment further on the matter.</p></speech>

I appreciate that this matter is not within the her direct area of responsibility and that she is therefore relying on what her officials are telling her.  I understand from the latter part of her reply that because legal advice has been sought, many of the questions I have raised in terms of refunds probably cannot be answered.  My reading of the situation - perhaps the Minister of State can confirm this - is that the necessary technical adjustments have now been made to the national vehicle and driver file, NVDF.  This would answer the question as to whether the local tax offices have now been informed of the change, which would eliminate any confusion in this area.  The only question I can ask is if the Minister of State has any idea at all, or got any extra information apart from the response, as to how long it will take for the legal advice to work its way through the system so that there can be further clarification.</p></speech>

Against its own ethos, Aurivo now plans to produce butter in Cork instead of Connacht.  It was originally the North Connacht Farmers' Co-operative Society.  In addition, 37 jobs will be lost at Avantcard.  If we add up all the retail businesses, restaurants and bars in the small towns of the north west, we can see many hundreds of job losses that have not reached the national media in recent times.</p> <p>I am calling for the establishment of a strategic employment task force for that region, a proposal I am sure is supported by many colleagues throughout the north west.  Some 46% of Ireland's total GNP is produced in the greater Dublin region.  This is not sustainable for the Dublin region and is not fair on the rest of the economy.</p> <p>I would like to see the establishment of a strategic employment task force with clear powers in respect of strategic investment in broadband, motorway infrastructure and the urgent development of the north west university of technology.  These are three tangible inputs, as opposed to glossy brochures filled with promises, that can take pressure off this region which is responsible for almost 15% of our national GNP and create much-needed employment in the north west.  It is not too much to ask for.  Indeed the same could be done for the Leader's region and some of the pressures taken off the greater Dublin area.</p> <p>This is urgent and should be done.  It should not just be a strategic task force in name only but should be one that is empowered and provided with the significant resources that are required to do those three things: broadband, motorway infrastructure and the university of technology for the north west.  These are three issues of access: education, transportation and information technology.  I ask the Leader to take that on board and pass it on to the Taoiseach.</p> <p>The main point I want to raise today concerns the commission of inquiry into IBRC.  It is simply not credible to this side of the House that the Department of Finance, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance are saying that problems only emerged last Thursday relating to whether or not documentation or evidence would be treated as private in the context of documentation provided to Judge Brian Cregan by the Department of Finance or IBRC.  I have a copy of a newspaper article from 22 August 2015 written by Cliff Taylor.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marc MacSharry:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2010"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2010&amp;amp;pid=MarcMacSharry&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The headline read, "Legal issues could delay statutory inquiry into IBRC".  Clearly, it is not credible for the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and his officials to claim that they were unaware of these issues until last Thursday.  That is factually incorrect.  What is the position as things stand?  How quickly can emergency legislation be introduced to ensure this work can be completed by the end of the year?  Clearly, there was advice from the Attorney General.  I suggest the State would benefit from that advice being published, given that almost &euro;1 billion of the people's money is involved.  Perhaps there is nothing to see, as Ministers have suggested, but evidence elsewhere in the public domain gives us cause to wonder.  At an absolute minimum, the people are entitled to know why a write-down of &euro;119 million was afforded in the context of the sale of Siteserv.</p><p>Obviously, the commission of investigation is also to investigate 37 other IBRC transactions of over &euro;10 million.  It is imperative that the Siteserv transaction, in particular, be fully investigated and the outcome published in advance of a general election.  With due respect to the Government, the Minister for Finance, the Department of Finance and IBRC, the people are entitled to know how &euro;119 million of its money was potentially thrown away and squandered by the actions of departmental officials, the Minister, people in IBRC, the receivers or whomever.  I ask the Leader to impress this point on the Taoiseach in the first instance.  As soon as is humanly possible, we should debate the issue in the House.</p></speech>

It is long-awaited legislation and I know that it will receive a broad welcome from everyone in the House, as it did in the D&aacute;il.  I know that we will have a full debate on it.</p> <p>I also welcome today's announcement of the new package of housing measures to give some rent certainty to tenants.  It has just been published and is entitled, Stabilising Rents: Boosting Supply.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, has described it as a significant overhaul of tenants' rights.  I know that colleagues will very much welcome that we will see real protections for tenants, in particular, an increase in the rent review period to two years.  There must be at least 24 months between all rent reviews.  Therefore, if somebody has had his or her rent increased in 2015, he or sh e will not see another increase until 2017.  That will be inserted in legislation.  As has been heralded, we will also see a requirement for landlords to sign a statutory declaration of intent to sell to avoid any abuse of procedures in raising rent.  We will see new procedures in dealing with rent arrears.  We will also see some tax relief measures to assist landlords and increases in some of the housing assistance payment limits.  It is a really welcome package of measures and some doubted if it could be put in place.  Senator Aideen Hayden, in particular, staunchly said for some time that we would see a decent, adequate and effective package of measures put in place.  It is welcome that we have it today.  I hope we will have an opportunity to debate these measures in more detail once we have had a chance to absorb the measures to be put in place, noting, of course, that nearly one in five families is in private rented accommodation and that, therefore, we need an overhaul of the private rental sector.</p> <p>I certainly welcomed the establishment of the commission of investigation into IBRC transactions, about which issues had been raised in the other House.  The issue that has come to the fore puts the spotlight on the 2004 Act.  The difficulty is that there was no better mechanism to carry out the inquiry that needed to be carried out into these transactions.  The net point that has arisen concerns a difference of legal view on whether the commission has the power to overrule the confidentiality of documents in the public interest of disclosure.  Mr. Justice Brian Cregan is reported as having accepted the legal view of the special liquidators for IBRC that there was no such express power.  It has certainly been reported that he accepts that there is an inherent power to conduct a balancing exercise for the chairperson of the commission.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Indeed, the Department of Finance and the former Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, directors and management apparently have legal advice to that effect, namely, that the commission does have the power to override implicitly.  We should recall that the process of commissions of investigation was set up in 2004 to replace the costly and cumbersome tribunals of inquiry.  Previous commissions have been hugely successful in inquiring into delicate and sensitive matters around, for example, child sex abuse in institutions, and have navigated the balance of interests in these procedures.  Of course, any commission of investigation is always subject to legal challenge by individuals who may be affected.  I would urge a word of caution to those rushing to judgment.  I do not believe there was an alternative mechanism that could have been put in place to effectively investigate these transactions.  I believe the commission of investigation is the right method.  Nobody can rule out the prospect of individuals taking a legal challenge to any commission of investigation.</p></speech>

It highlights the utter inability, or unwillingness, of the Government to take on board any question whatever of Seanad reform.  There is an electorate of a couple of hundred voters, almost entirely from political parties, who are directed by head office on what way to vote.  In other words, it is a nomination process; by no stretch of the imagination is it an election.  For that reason, it is very regrettable that we have this in the dying days of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</p> <p>I listened to a debate between three of the candidates on "The Late Debate".  There was a very articulate young woman from Sinn F&eacute;in, a decent doctor from the west and Mr. Beades.  I thought they were excellent and the debate was terrific.  It was a real vote of optimism and hope in the Seanad that people of this calibre should put themselves forward.  Of the fourth candidate, there was no sign whatsoever of Ms Ma&iacute;ria Cahill who is a nominated person for the Labour Party.</p></speech>

It is fitting, therefore, that we come together on World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims to remember those who tragically died on the roads and think of their families.  Many generations and thousands of families, including my own, have been devastated by the grief of loss and the heartache of road tragedies.  We must all play our part to do everything possible to prevent this loss and suffering from touching more lives.  We all have a responsibility to make the roads safer.  In addition to those to those who lost their lives, thousands more have suffered serious, life changing injuries.  The world day of remembrance will remind us of how easily tragedy can happen but by making small changes to our own behaviour on the roads, we can all help to prevent future tragedies.  The number of people killed on the roads since statistics began is the equivalent of the population of Drogheda or Dundalk, which is alarming.</p></speech>

It has been 27 years since the club last achieved the double and it was worth the wait as most of the people of Dundalk and surrounding areas attended the match to cheer on the Lilywhites.

That the Government parties could state they were not aware of the issues around the inquiry into Siteserv and related matters was quite incredible as issues around the terms of reference for the commission of inquiry had been raised as far as back as June in the Houses.  There were specific media reports in September on the particular issue that has arisen.  It is an absolute disgrace that, when we have an issue as significant as this, with hundreds of millions of euro of taxpayer's money in question in the context of how the deals were made, the Government has botched it yet again.  However, the Government parties were dragged kicking and screaming to set up the inquiry in the first place.  It was pointed out previously that this inquiry was not fit for purpose.  There are also concerns around other institutions such as NAMA.  The House has an important role to play and the person who should show leadership on this issue and come in to address the House is the Taoiseach.  He should come to make a statement to clarify exactly what will be done to ensure the commission will be put back on the right track and that whatever legal impediments there are will be overcome as quickly as possible to make sure the Siteserv issue and related matters will be dealt with this side of a general election.  The obvious claim being made is that the Government parties are trying to kick to touch, that they do not want the truth to come out and that this has been the track from day one.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2363"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2363&amp;amp;pid=TrevorOClochartaigh&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It would be appalling if that were to happen.

Aung San Suu Kyi has made tremendous progress in securing a move towards a democratic system.  In the first speech I made to the European Parliament in 2008 I called for her release.  She was under house arrest for over 21 years and was eventually released in 2010.  It shows that taking the road of peaceful means and the democratic system is best.  She should be congratulated for the work that has been done by the party with which she is working.  May the change she is trying to bring about be achieved in the not too distant future.</p> <p>I am aware that Senators are tired of me raising this matter on an annual basis, but in November the issue of the recruitment of junior doctors arises.  A simple issue has changed for them over the last four to five years.  In 2009, the average junior doctor was able to get approximately &euro;1,900 every six months to go on training courses.  That is now reduced to the provision of less than &euro;2,000 over a four-year period.  We are anxious to keep junior doctors in this country but we are not doing enough to achieve that.  Junior doctors must train to progress their career.  It is a very simple matter that could be resolved.  It must be dealt with, particularly when one considers that more than six hospitals in this country are now paying doctors under agency contracts, with over 50,000 hours per annum under agency contracts.  There appears to be no joined-up thinking for dealing with this issue.  Very little progress has been made in the last four years since I first highlighted it.</p> <p>We are burying our heads in the sand on this matter.  There must be a review of what has been done, what can be done and how fast it can be done.  It is important that the Minister come before the House to outline the plan to deal with this extremely important issue during the next 12 months to two years.  We cannot get the doctors we require to provide the health care that is needed by the people of this country.</p></speech>

By taking the secret route behind closed doors, the insider dealings become tied up in knots and involve huge numbers of accountants and lawyers.  Open auctions are superior.  They are open, the transaction costs are low and the time lapse is much quicker.  It is not out of the question to suggest that something be put on eBay or that an auctioneer be found to sell things.  We have tried the hugger-mugger method for too long and it always becomes tied up in knots.</p> <p>Regarding the powers at the centre of the current dispute, Members will have received copies of the Finance Bill and the explanatory memorandum relating to it.  Regarding section 71, the explanatory memorandum states, "In particular, this Chapter provides the Revenue Commissioners with the power to seek records and documents from taxpayers and other third parties, including financial institutions."  I do not know what is at stake in this regard but certainly the indication is that we must find a new way of selling these assets because it always appears to end up with insider dealing leading to political controversies.  In addition, it takes far too long.  Keeping it simple might be one of the ways we should proceed in the future.  It appears there are powers in the Finance Bill to ask financial institutions to provide information.  Certainly, my reading of the Bill, which will be brought before the House in a matter of days, is that bank accounts do not have the secret status that appears to be assumed in the current debate.</p></speech>

I know many colleagues have made written representations on this issue to the Taoiseach and various Ministers.  I would particularly like to thank our Fine Gael colleagues because, while the media have presented this as a Labour Party-Fine Gael battle, I know many Fine Gael colleagues have been behind the issue and very keen that a resolution is found.  I also know the media have presented it as a very one-sided situation which is a new deal for tenants and nothing for landlords.  I want to make the point that there are issues that will be in the package in terms of a better tax relief situation for landlords and improved operations of the PRTB, for example.</p><p>The fact remains we have discussed this in this House on many occasions.  Tenants are being driven into homelessness because of rent increases, and that is the bottom line.  The only question we have to ask ourselves here today is whether the measures that are being announced by the Cabinet are going to help or hinder that situation.  I am absolutely confident they will help to stem the flow of people entering homeless services.  That is the only question we have to ask.  Does that mean we finish here?  No, it does not.  One in five Irish families lives in rented housing so it is a major issue going forward.  More needs to be done in order to secure the future of those households, and I have personally asked the Minister, Deputy Kelly, to ensure we put in place a formal review in regard to the private rented sector.  It is not the Cinderella of Irish housing any more.  It is where a very significant number of Irish families live and will continue to live in the future.</p><p>I want to thank colleagues because I know representations were made on this issue right across the House to everybody concerned, in particular to Ministers, the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste.</p></speech>

The acting leader in reply said, &quot;As I understand it, there is a Government implementation body and I am afraid I will not be able to accept the amendment.&quot;  I am sure the acting leader spoke in all honesty, believing what he was saying to be true.  However, a member of the public has contacted me and has had correspondence with the Taoiseach's office, asking questions about this implementation body.  The reply from the Taoiseach's office is as follows:</p><blockquote>I refer to your recent email to the Office of the Taoiseach, Mr. Enda Kenny, T.D., regarding the membership of the proposed Seanad Reform Implementation Body.<br /><br />As you will be aware, the Taoiseach established an independent Working Group on Seanad Reform earlier this year and gave it a wide remit to propose Seanad reform within existing constitutional parameters.  When the Group's Report was published, the Taoiseach welcomed it, saying it was innovative and radical and contained some far-reaching recommendations on the way members are elected to the Seanad and on how the Seanad should perform its functions and that there needed to be public and political discussion and consultation on it.<br /><br />In that context, the Seanad debated the Working Group's Report On 5 May last and again on 8 July; also the Taoiseach met with the opposition party leaders in July to discuss its contents.<br /><br />Arising from that meeting, the Taoiseach gave a commitment to having a debate in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on the Working Group's Report.  No decision has been taken in advance of the D&aacute;il debate on the establishment of an Implementation Body on who the membership might be.</blockquote> <p>I do not believe anybody set out to deliberately mislead the House but we need to be told straight out whether there is an implementation body in place.  If there is not, that needs to be made clear in the House today.</p></speech>

Her record in that regard stands on its merits.  </p><p>Senator Sean D. Barrett always makes very interesting comments and contributions which demonstrate a lot of common sense.  I agree with him, as I would love to see the way of disposing of assets being much more open and transparent and it being done through public tender or auction.  I assume the scale of the crash and the level of distressed assets must have been the reasons the previous Government established NAMA and for all of the difficulties we have seen since.  In the cool calm of day I would like to have a debate in the House on the lessons to be learned from what happened and how we can avoid them in the future, as well as how we might deal with issues such as this if they were to arise in the future.</p><p>I support my colleague, Senator Terry Brennan, in welcoming the fact that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe; the Minister in Northern Ireland, Mr. Mark Durkan, MLA, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, local authorities and road safety groups are coming together to call on road users throughout the island of Ireland to reflect on the number of lives being lost on the roads as we mark international day of remembrance for road traffic victims.  As the Senator said, 38,500 lives have been lost on the island of Ireland during the decades, which is a frightening statistic.  We can all play our own small part in ensuring we heighten awareness.  We have discussed the issues of drink-driving and speeding, but small things such as checking our lights, brakes and the state of our vehicles as we head into winter would certainly make a contribution.  I urge people to attend the various commemorative events being organised throughout the country and ask all of us to think long and hard when we sit behind the wheel of a car.  It is so easy to end our life of that another person.  This winter and Christmas we should ensure no family suffers the loss of a loved one through our carelessness or negligence.</p></speech>

We need to be reasonable about all of this.  It was only last Thursday or Friday that the judge came to a conclusion on the matter.  The Senator should not be distracted so much by speculation and half-baked idle gossip.  Of course there was all of that over the past few months but we do not have to rise to any of it.  The judge has come to a conclusion on the matter.  There was legal argument, which we all understand.  I have no doubt the right and correct mechanism will be found.</p></speech>

We have been hearing that across the board.  I read with interest in the past few days that the journalist, Billy Keane, suggested hotels sign a pledge not to increase prices for certain events in this city.  We are in the process of recovering from the crash.  Hotels obviously suffered during it but no one benefits in the short term, other than the hotels, from huge prices being charged for particular events in the city and there is no long-term gain.  The special 9% VAT rate for hotels introduced by this Government has been a major benefit to the tourism sector in general.</p></speech>

One does not need to be the Minister for Finance to see that hotels are overcharging in Dublin on an ordinary day in many cases.  However, when there is a special event on in the city, they seem to really go for it.  Billy Keane's idea is a good one and I agree with it.  It would be good if we were able to get hotels to come together and pledge they would not charge extortionate prices for certain events.  We do not want to be shooting ourselves in the foot.  The tourism industry has recovered and is booming.  We do not want to get the international reputation for being a city, or a country, that is very expensive again.  It took a long time to get rid of that reputation.  Hotels are shooting themselves in the foot by this sort of behaviour.</p></speech>

This issue has been alluded to on a number of occasions but it is fairly obvious from recent events - I will not personalise the issue by mentioning the name of the doctor or the hospital - that there is still grave concern that there is a culture of shooting the messenger rather than dealing with the problem in our health service.</p></speech>

N&iacute; m&oacute;r sin a dh&eacute;anamh go pr&aacute;inneach, ach c&eacute;n chaoi?  Sin an cheist.  Creidim gur ch&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn &eacute; seo a phl&eacute; sa Teach seo ach taca&iacute;m go m&oacute;r leis an &eacute;ileamh a rinne Conradh na Gaeilge ar na mallaibh maidir le coiste seasmhach Oireachtais ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge agus an Ghaeltacht.  D'fh&eacute;adfadh an coiste sin a chinnti&uacute; go gcomhl&iacute;onann an St&aacute;t a chuid dualgais reacht&uacute;la i leith an phobail agus go mb&iacute;onn na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; cu&iacute; curtha ar f&aacute;il ina theanga f&eacute;in do phobal na Gaeltachta mar at&aacute; dlite d&oacute; faoin mBunreacht.

In that context, Conradh na Gaeilge's campaign to have a standing Oireachtas committee for the Irish language and the Gaeltacht is very laudable and one which I support.  It is not a question of talking about the Irish language for the sake of it but of ensuring the State fulfils its statutory duties to the Irish-speaking public and those who wish to conduct their business through Irish.  The State has a duty to ensure services are available through the medium of the people's own language, the first official language of the State.  That is their constitutional right, as well as their human right.  A full Oireachtas committee could help to achieve this objective.  It really is important to ensure there are enough Irish speakers in the public service to provide for for people's needs and meet their aspirations.  We often find that Government and public policy leaders speak out of both sides of their mouths in this matter.  Everybody is for the promotion of the Irish language, but when it comes to providing the necessary resources and institutional change, we do not see it happen.  I would like to see progress on this matter and think we should debate it in the House at the earliest opportunity.</p></speech>

I will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton.  I remind the Senator that 125,000 jobs have been created.  We still have a long way to go to reach the 200,000 jobs lost in the three years prior to the Government taking office, but we are making progress.  Some 70% of the jobs created last year were outside Dublin.  We all agree that it is a case of "A lot done.  More to do," as the Senator's party stated many years ago in one of its election slogans.  I can assure him that job creation is our number one priority and that it will continue to be prioritised in the coming months.</p> <p>On IBRC, the letter was received last Friday by the Taoiseach.  Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh and several other Senators have mentioned that there were rumours in July and August that there were difficulties.  Regardless of whether there were difficulties, the Taoiseach was only written to and informed by the judge last Friday.  Senators have said it is incredible that nothing was done about the matter, but one cannot do anything until one is notified.  The judge only came to the conclusion and wrote to the Taoiseach last Friday.  The Government will be examining the matter and will deal with it as promptly as possible.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maurice Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2003"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2003&amp;amp;pid=MauriceCummins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Senator Bacik questioned whether there is a better mechanism than the 2004 Act to investigate transactions in IBRC.  Obviously, it must be dealt with.  The Government is totally committed to accountability and transparency on this issue and will do whatever is necessary to ensure that this happens.  </p><p>Senator Norris spoke about Clerys workers and the need for consultation with workers prior to any liquidation.  I agree with him that workers need to be protected in this regard.  I know the matter has been brought to the Minister and I will raise it again with him.  I will not comment on the question of the Seanad election, which was raised by some Members, because it was ruled out of order by the Cathaoirleach.  </p><p>Senators Brennan and Moran spoke about Dundalk FC.  We all compliment the team on winning the double after 27 years.  Senators Brennan and Mullins also reminded us about an event to remember all those who died in road traffic accidents since statistics began and the need for all of us to be more vigilant on the roads, particularly during the winter.  </p><p>Senator Mooney spoke about the Social Welfare Bill.  I expect that it will be in here in a fortnight's time.  I think I have addressed the point raised by Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh.  Senator Colm Burke spoke about Myanmar and the victory of Aung San Suu Kyi.  Let us hope her victory and that of her party will bring about the necessary changes and prosperity for her people, which they certain deserve after so many years of dictatorship.  Senator Colm Burke also raised the plight of junior doctors and called for the Minister of Health to come up with a plan to address it.  I will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister.  </p><p>Senator Barrett spoke about IBRC and the need to find new ways to openly sell assets.  He also argued that section 71 of the Finance Bill should be looked at in this regard.  Senator Hayden spoke about the new deal for tenants and the proposals that will come from Cabinet today.  She welcomed the proposals and suggested they will stem the flow of people becoming homeless.  A question was asked about whether we will have legislation to deal with that.  I am sure we will have legislation - be it in the form of amendments to the Residential Tenancies Act or a stand-alone piece of legislation to deal with these matters.  I have not been informed about the situation but I am sure we will see action in the coming week and it will be clearer whether it will involve amending the Residential Tenancies Act or not.  </p><p>Senator Craughwell spoke about the Seanad Electoral Reform Bill and the proposed implementation body.  He mentioned the report of the independent working group on Seanad reform led by Maurice Manning, which was discussed in this House.  I have been informed that there was an intention to set up an implementation body to deal with that report but to the best of my knowledge, this body has not been set up.  </p><p>Senators Mullins and Paul Coghlan spoke about housing and complimented the work of Threshold and Senator Hayden.  Senator Healy Eames raised a health matter that was ruled out of order.  Senator Noone spoke about the need for hotels to be more vigilant regarding their prices and the raising of prices for special events.  People should remember that the 9% VAT rate is not there in perpetuity.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maurice Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2003"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2003&amp;amp;pid=MauriceCummins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Hotel owners should remember that they have it good now when tourist numbers are at a record high, which is due to the 9% VAT rate and should not be hiking prices to exorbitant rates when special events take place.</p><p>Senator Crown spoke about whistleblower protection and intimidation of whistleblowers.  He called for No. 48, the Seanad Electoral Reform Bill 2013, to be taken before No. 1 but I am afraid I cannot accede to that request.</p><p>Senator Mullen spoke about Conradh na Gaeilge proposals for the Irish language and setting up an Oireachtas committee.  I certainly agree with those sentiments.  There were also some comments about having a full-time senior Minister for the Irish language.  I do not know whether that is necessary.  The current Minister of State has shown that one can lose the Irish that one learnt at school and get it back after practice.  There is certainly a question as regards the teaching of the Irish language when people can be in school for so many years and lose the ability to speak the Irish language in a short period of time whereas people can take up other languages and learn them in a matter of months.</p></speech>

This is a ground-breaking Bill which fulfils the commitment in the programme for Government to introduce mental capacity legislation in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The Government's aim has been to reform the law on mental capacity to ensure the greatest degree of autonomy for people with intellectual disabilities or suffering with mental illnesses.</p> <p>The Bill proposes a fundamental reform of Ireland's laws on capacity.  It is intended as a key element in enabling Ireland to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The philosophy underpinning the Bill is one of respect for the rights of those with capacity difficulties.  The Bill focuses on enabling them to exercise their decision-making capacity to the greatest extent possible.  The archaic laws which have governed this area for too long will be repealed.  Accordingly, the Marriage of Lunatics Act 1811 and the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871 will be repealed.  Wardship will be abolished for those over 18.  We will consign to the past the system under which a person's decision-making capacity could be removed absolutely.  Instead, the Bill will enable a person to take the decisions he or she is in a position to take, while putting supports in place to cover situations were the person is unable to take decisions in general or to take a particular type of decision.</p> <p>We have sought to underpin the enabling philosophy of the Bill with guiding principles that must be taken into account for all actions foreseen under this legislation.  These are the heart of the Bill and will reach into every decision taken under it.  They require the actions taken under this legislation to reflect what the person would have wanted.  They also require that any actions taken must intrude as little as possible onto the person's autonomy.</p> <p>This is a very complex area.  The people that it will benefit are vulnerable and their needs are diverse.  It is difficult to find the right solutions that will suit everyone.  When the Bill was published, I undertook to listen to the concerns of people with capacity difficulties, their families and organisations working with them to see how we could improve the Bill.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Kathleen Lynch:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=656"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=656&amp;amp;pid=KathleenLynch&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A consultation symposium was organised in September 2013.  The Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality organised a call for submissions on the Bill in spring 2014.  I thank the committee for its key role in enabling stakeholders to communicate their priorities and concerns.  The Bill I am now introducing is fundamentally different from the version published in July 2013.</p><p>The co-decision-making option, which allows a person with capacity difficulties to appoint another person as a co-decision maker to take decisions jointly with him or her, has been moved from the courts.  This restores the person's right to choose the co-decision maker that best suits him or her and to decide on the type of decisions which will be covered by the co-decision-making arrangement.  I see this as a key change to protect the person's autonomy.  It enables the person to have control of the process at all times.  The Bill provides for the establishment of the office of the public guardian in the Courts Service as the body designated to undertake the functions arising from the Bill.  I have responded to criticism that the name of the body was overtly paternalistic by proposing that it will be called the decision support services.  The name change is designed to reflect the purpose of the body which will be to provide services to people with capacity difficulties, to those taking decisions for them and to those interacting with them in a professional capacity.  </p><p>I propose the removal of provisions on informal decision making in response to concerns that they would have allowed informal decision makers to circumvent the safeguards built into the Bill.  I have also sought to improve the safeguards to protect vulnerable persons against abuse, particularly financial abuse.  New offences have been introduced which will enable a co-decision maker to be prosecuted, for example, for exercising undue influence or coercion over a person with capacity difficulties.  The director of the decision support service will be given the necessary powers to investigate complaints.  Those responsible for taking decisions on another person's property and affairs will have to submit detailed accounts as part of their report to the director of the decision support services.</p><p>A new part has been inserted into the Bill which provides for advanced health care directives.  An advanced health care directive is a statement made by a person with capacity setting out his or her will and preference regarding treatment decisions that may arise in the future and in the event that he or she lacks the capacity to consent to or refuse those treatments.</p><p>I proposed a series of amendments on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il to the provisions on wardship which clarify that the property and income of a ward will be restored to him or her when he or she is discharged from wardship.  Where a decision-making representative has to be appointed to take decisions on the ward's behalf, he or she will have responsibility for the management of the ward's funds.  The decision support services will be able to point the representative towards financial expertise but will no longer take a role in managing the ward's funds.  The amendment fulfils the obligation under the UN convention to enable a person with a disability to maintain control over his or her own property and income.</p><p>I have also proposed tighter provisions on the circumstances in which constraints can be used or authorised.  Decisions on the restraint are restricted to decision-making representatives and attorneys only.  No other category may use or authorise restraint.  Decision-making representatives and attorney may use or authorise restraint only in exceptional emergency circumstances.  Where there is an imminent risk of serious harm to the person with capacity difficulties or to another person, I proposed and secured agreement on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il that the definition of restraint should include chemical restraint.  The strict conditions on the use of restraint reflect my intention that restraint should be kept to a minimum and used only in exceptional circumstances.</p><p>I will now provide a detailed outline of the provisions of the Bill.  Part 1 - sections 1 to 7 - provides standard provisions relating to criteria, commencement and laying of regulations.  Section 3 provides for a fundamental approach to determining capacity.  This is a significant step forward from the current wardship model which totally removes the person's capacity to take decisions or to enter legal transactions.  Instead, this new approach assesses capacity in a time-specific and issue-specific way.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Kathleen Lynch:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=656"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=656&amp;amp;pid=KathleenLynch&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It allows for a person to have capacity in one matter but not in another, enabling the person to retain the possibility of taking such decisions even when needing support on more complex matters.  The fundamental model of capacity represents the most widely accepted modern capacity model internationally and is fully consistent with the UN convention.  </p><p>I proposed a series of amendments to section 4, which addresses decisions on the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment, organ donation and non-therapeutic sterilisation.  All decisions on the donation of an organ from a living donor who lacks capacity will have to be determined by the High Court.  Similarly, where an application in connection with the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment from a person who lacks capacity has been made it will be determined by the High Court rather than the Circuit Court.  The Bill will prohibit anyone from giving consent for a non-therapeutic sterilisation procedure on behalf of a person lacking capacity.  This provision will strengthen the Bill's protection for vulnerable adults and bring it into compliance with international human rights conventions.  </p><p>Part 2, section 8, sets out guiding principles which apply to every intervention under the Bill.  They are intended to embed the ethos that the person's autonomy is to be safeguarded to the greatest extent possible.  The first guiding principle is that a person is presumed to have decision-making capacity, unless it is proven that this is not the case.  Legal capacity is, of course, presumed.  The second guiding principle is that all practical steps have to be taken to support a person's decision-making capacity before a decision can be taken that he or she lacks capacity.  The third is that a person cannot be deemed to lack decision-making capacity just because of a risk that he or she might make an unwise decision.</p><p>The fourth principle is that interventions should be made only if absolutely necessary.  The fifth principle is that interventions, where necessary, must be made in a way that is least restrictive of a person's rights and freedom of action.  They must respect the person's right to dignity, bodily integrity, privacy, autonomy and control over his or her financial affairs and property.  The sixth guiding principle is that the person must be permitted, encouraged and facilitated, as far as possible, to participate in these decisions.  The next principle is that any intervention must give effect, as far as possible, to the person's current will and preferences.  The interveners must also act in good faith and for the benefit of the person.  Finally, no action should be taken if the matter is not urgent, or if the person is likely to recover capacity shortly.</p><p>Part 3, sections 9 to 12, provides a statutory framework for decision-making assistance agreements.  These are formal agreements under which a person with capacity difficulties can appoint a trusted person to act as their decision-making assistant.  The person retains control over his or her decisions.  The decision-making assistant's task is to access information or to help the person to understand, make or express a decision.  The form and formalities of decision-making assistance agreements will be set out in regulations to be made by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  </p><p>Part 4, sections 13 to 31, outlines the provisions on co-decision-making that will apply.  A person with capacity difficulties will have the option of appointing a trusted family member or friend as a co-decision maker to make joint decisions with him or her.  These provisions are considerably different from those contained in the Bill as published.  I considered that the provisions needed to be reformed fundamentally to ensure the person had the right to enter voluntarily into a co-decision-making agreement.  I wanted to ensure that co-decision making could not be imposed on a person.  Furthermore, I wanted the person to have the choice of co-decision maker.  The option has now been moved from the courts.  The director of the decision support services is now tasked with verifying that everything is in order with the agreement and that the agreement reflects the will and preference of the appointer.  There is no requirement for a declaration of capacity from the courts in order for someone to enter into a co-decision making agreement.  However, an assessment of capacity by a medical professional and another health care professional is required in order to have an agreement registered by the decision support service.  A capacity assessment is needed because the co-decision-making option should be selected by a person only if necessary.  This is in line with the Bill&rsquo;s philosophy and the option chosen should be the least intrusive possible.  If a person has significant capacity to make his or her decisions the suitable option is that of assisted decision-making.</p></speech>
