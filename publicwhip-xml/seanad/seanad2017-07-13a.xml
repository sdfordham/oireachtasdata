The higher grant is &euro;75 per week per child, but it still does not cover the cost of providing the service.  Many services are facing closure as a result of the lack of funding.  Parents have to send their child for three hours per day which is covered by the scheme.  I understand that point, but the rate of inflation, together with the significant increase in rates, are a burden.  All businesses pay rates and have overheads such as ESB and other bills.  As such, this is becoming a major issue for providers.  Providers are subsidising the scheme because of the poor pay rates and working conditions.  Recently the Minister stated the budget for the affordable child care scheme this year was &euro;466 million, yet there is non-contract time, for which the provider is not paid.  However, last week for the first time since the scheme was introduced a small contribution was made.  The provider has to download, print, process the paperwork for the scheme on behalf of the Department.  Providers are doing the Department's work, but they are also helping parents, for which they receive no funding.  This adds another cost for providers.  This is a serious issue which needs to be addressed.</p> <p>The biggest issue is that the period of payment for the provider is for 38 weeks,  The provider is not paid at Halloween, Christmas, during mid-term breaks and the Easter and summer holiday periods, which means that they must go to the Labour Exchange and sign on for the dole.  Because of this, they cannot get a mortgage.  A number of people who work in this area are coming to me because they are not eligible for a mortgage because they are lucky to be coming out on average with &euro;10 to &euro;10.50 an hour.  That is not right.  If a child is booked in for five days and, for some reason, is missing, let me give as an example a child who misses four Fridays in a row through no fault of his or her own or that of his or her parents.  The money is taken back from the provider who is at the loss of the money for the days missed.  Who is to blame when a child is not present?  The answer is nobody  There is a need for balance, but it is not even looked at and the provider is punished where, through no fault of the service, a child is sick and the parent cannot him or her to the provider.  These are issues that need to be addressed.</p> <p>The information being given to providers and parents on the affordable child care scheme is constantly being changed, which is not good enough.  As recently as yesterday morning, there was was another change announced.  There is a major issue with the PIP programme which provides the implementation platform in registering the names of the children and inputting their details, based on which the provider receives payment .  More often than not, the system crashes.  It crashes constantly.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2470"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2470&amp;amp;pid=JenniferMurnaneOConnor&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It does not calculate the payments correctly and then one has to follow up with the Department to try to sort it out.  These are the main issues, which need to be addressed.  I was disappointed that a review was never carried out before this new scheme was announced.  That is unacceptable.  We kept getting announcement after announcement, but no review.  I believe this programme's implementation platform, PIP, is now being looked at to try to sort out the payments, but the Minister says it could take up to 12 months.  When we have that kind of money, it is unacceptable that is not happening.</p><p>On the non-contract hours and paperwork that was increased, when the Minister originally announced this, it was going through the parents.  The parents were going to get all the paperwork and then they could decide what providers to go to.  It has gone back to the provider again, so now the provider is doing the paperwork.  It was announced on the website during the week that 173,000 pages were visited by people looking at the website.  Of these, two thirds of the queries came from Dublin.</p></speech>

Some of the issues she has raised do not relate to the question that was submitted, so I may not have the answers here, but I will comment on some afterwards.</p> <p>On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Katherine Zappone, I am very pleased to provide an update on the measures which are being put in place to make child care more affordable for families from September.  I will also outline the progress that has been made in developing the affordable childcare scheme, ACS.  On 11 April, the Minister, Deputy Zappone, announced a range of measures, which will make child care more affordable for families from September.  These measures include universal subsidies of up to &euro;1,040 per annum per child, which will be available for all children aged between six and 36 months and targeted subsidies of up to &euro;7,500 per annum per child, which will be delivered to families who need it most.  It is these targeted subsidies that will open up opportunities for jobs, training and education for parents.</p> <p>As a result of these measures, up to 70,000 children will benefit from child care support this September.  This is the first big practical step to changing one of the most expensive child care systems in the world into one of the best.  By addressing the affordability issue we will ease the burden on many parents for whom child care costs have become a second rent or mortgage.  To ensure uptake by families and by child care providers, a public information campaign has been under way since mid-May.  Contracting with child care providers is now under way and registration of children for all these subsidies will go live from 21 August.</p> <p>Significant progress continues to be made on the development of the ACS.  A project board, chaired by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, meets every three weeks to oversee this development.  Work on the drafting of legislation is currently in progress.  It is anticipated that a draft Bill will be brought to Government by end of the third quarter, with a view to enactment in the autumn.  The main development of the ACS project is now subject to the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, OGCIO, peer review process.  The peer review group, which was established in early May 2017, is currently reviewing the ACS business case.  The next stage of this process is the request for tender, RFT, for the procurement of the ICT development.  It is anticipated that the RFT will be presented to the peer review group by the end of the third quarter.</p> <p>Other preparatory work includes the development of an ACS communications system, the development of a governance and compliance framework, the development of a data protection strategy and the finalisation of data sharing arrangements with the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection.  Major consideration is also being given for the phase when the ACS is developed, tested and ready for launch.  With the above factors in mind, the project board has advised the Minister, Deputy Zappone, that it is not in a position at this point in time to guarantee a timeline for delivery of the ACS.  The RFT stage of the peer review process represents to some extent the biggest milestone of the ICT development, and drives the beginning of the timeline for full project development.  The Minister, Deputy Zappone, will revert with a specific delivery date as soon as possible.  In the interim, the measures being introduced this September to make child care more affordable will ensure that children and families benefit from the additional investment secured.  I will come back to the Senator on the other matters.</p></speech>

We all know affordable child care is crucial for families.  It is also important for the providers.  I am disappointed, however.  The fact the Minister, Deputy Zappone, did not do a review before she announced or launched anything, which is her second or third time doing so, does not seem right.  There is &euro;466 million and it is crucial that the families and children benefit, but also that the providers get their share as well.  It is important for everybody to work together to make sure families get the best results from this.</p></speech>

I will raise the matter of the review of child care to the Minister's office straight away when I leave here.  There is, as the Senator said, a substantial amount of funding being put in place over the next number of years for child care.  We all know how important child care is for many young people, in particular where both partners need to work, and how important it is to have proper child care facilities in place.  The contributions made by other agencies and, in particular, the Minister, Deputy Zappone's Department are an assurance that the Government is very serious about making child care a huge priority into the future and that is why so much money has been identified over the next couple of years.  I will come back to the Senator on those questions.</p></speech>

Last week, a report from the University of Limerick's school of sociology entitled, Exploring Homophobia and Transphobia in Primary Schools in Ireland, was published, further highlighting the issue of derogation of LGBTQI aspects of the relationships and sexuality education in social, personal and health education, SPHE, curricula by ethos-based schools.  As the Minister of State is aware, the Education Act 1998 states that an ethos-based school can derogate from certain aspects of curricula in order to uphold the characteristic spirit of the school.  In practical terms, this means that many pupils across the State are not taught and informed how to have safe sex, the boundaries of consent, relevant health information or how to have healthy relationships because of their sexuality or gender identity.  This serves to cement the stigma and isolation that a young person feels during his or her formative years, when his or her sexuality or gender identity is not perceived as a norm, or moral as dictated to him or her by the ethos of a school.</p> <p>The LGBTIreland report finds that must LGBTQI young people discover their sexual orientation or gender identity for themselves at an average age of 12 years.  Many of the same young people who may have their first sexual experience before leaving secondary school are forced to attempt to piece together an informed, but potentially distorted, view of relationships and sexuality from heteronormative teachings in the hope of staying safe.  Many relationship, sexuality education and SPHE teachers are on the record identifying their fear of the narrow confines of the syllabus and how best to deliver it.</p> <p>I want to talk briefly about organisations like ShoutOut, BeLonG To and commend all organisations which support our young people.  I want to point out that not all ethos-based schools confine their relationships and sexuality education, RSE, models to heterosexuality and that many work hard to ensure that their pupils are informed in an inclusive and equal setting.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fintan Warfield:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2458"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I also want to remark on the great work done by ShoutOut and BeLonG To in providing informative workshops and compiling teaching resources to aid schools in informing their students on these issues.  I welcome the fact the Department has been proactive on the baptism barrier.  While I may disagree on logistics, the steps taken will help secular families to access education.  Similar steps must be taken to ensure that no child is denied informative health and welfare-based education.  Are the Department and the Minister with responsibility open to a legislative remedy for this issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-07-13a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1307" speakername="Catherine Byrne" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017071300002#C00200"><p>I thank Senator Warfield for his remarks.  I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, who cannot be here this morning.  I thank the Senator for providing this opportunity to outline to the House the position on the teaching of the LGBT+ aspects of the social, personal and health education, SPHE, and the relationships and sexuality education, RSE, curriculums in schools.  As the Senator is aware, A Programme for a Partnership Government, which was agreed in 2016, included the following commitment, "We will develop an LGBT Youth Strategy that will encompass education, youth services, mental health and other issues."</p> <p>The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has established an oversight committee to develop proposals for such a strategy.  The oversight committee has an independent chair, the journalist Una Mullally.  The Department of Education and Skills is among the Departments and agencies represented on the oversight committee.  Civil society and relevant stakeholders are also represented on the committee.  I understand the oversight committee has held a number of meetings.  It has also conducted a series of public consultation events and last month held a more focused stakeholder consultation in Farmleigh House.</p> <p>The LGBT youth strategy will come under the overall policy framework of Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, the Government's national policy framework for children and young people.  As the Senator no doubt knows, Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures identifies the achievement of full potential in all areas of learning and development as a key outcome under the framework.  This outcome will also be an important strand of any recommendation arising from the work of the oversight committee on the LGBTI+ youth strategy.</p> <p>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures recognises the centrality of education and learning in the lives of children and young people.  However, it also recognises that learning extends beyond formal schooling and encompasses the range of experiences and learning processes that enable children and young people to develop.  A key element of the work in schools on working with LGBTI+ students arises from the national action plan on bullying.  The Programme for Government 2011-2016 included a commitment "to encourage schools to develop anti-bullying policies and in particular, strategies to combat homophobic bullying to support students".</p> <p>In May 2012, the Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs jointly hosted a forum to explore ways to tackle the problem of bullying, including identity-based bullying, such as homophobic bullying and racist bullying, in schools.  Following this, the Minister for Education and Skills established a working group on tackling bullying in schools.  The working group included representatives from relevant Departments and agencies, along with representatives of civil society.  It produced the action plan on bullying, which was launched in January 2013.  The actions contained in the action plan focus on supporting schools, education and training, research and awareness raising, with the aim of ensuring that all forms of bullying are addressed.</p> <p>Implementation of the action plan is ongoing, and as part of the implementation of the recommendations included in the action plan, national anti-bullying procedures for all schools were published in September 2013.  These procedures require that the prevention of bullying must be an integral part of a school's anti-bullying policy.  The education and prevention strategies that the school will implement must be documented in the anti-bullying policy and must explicitly deal with the issue of identity-based bullying including, in particular, homophobic and transphobic bullying.</p> <p>The Department of Education and Skills supports anti-bullying initiatives aimed at young people, such as the Stand Up! campaign against homophobic and transphobic bullying, organised by BeLonG To, the national youth service for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender young people in Ireland.  Last November, the Minister for Education and Skills launched Stand Up! 2016, and a number of post-primary schools across the country participated in the campaign for the week.</p></speech>

This morning I lay in bed scrolling Twitter while trying to wake up, and there was a tweet from someone called Harrison Guy, who has just married his partner, Adrian Homer.  When I read his tweet the penny dropped.  He said that at 13 he realised he was gay and told himself he probably would never know love, but he was happy to say today that he was wrong as he married his partner.  When LGBT young people realise we are LGBT we often spend five to ten years in the closet.  After I realised I was gay I spent a period during which I told myself I would never love a partner, and today I am still trying to undo that erosive period.  Schools, our homes and our communities are the places where we can change this, and the State has a direct responsibility for the lives of young people and their development and education.  Speak to any member of the LGBTQI community and they will reiterate what I am saying.  I was left out of something that I needed more than most.  I am still struggling to negotiate intimacy and communicate love.  LGBT young people deserve better and at present we are letting them down.</p></speech>

My thoughts on it are very clear.  Anybody who lives in a country and any child who goes to school has the right to be educated on all sexual relationships, no matter what relationship that is.  We are living in a very different country from that in which lived in the past.  Not too long ago, we a passed a referendum on gay marriage.  It was a real opportunity to state this country has changed immensely over the past ten years.</p> <p>Nobody who goes to primary school, secondary school or college should be discriminated against because of his or her sexuality, never mind the colour of his or her skin or the language he or she speaks.  We live in a very different world.  When young people feel they cannot openly speak about their sexuality in school and speak about who they are through their families, communities and, above all, through the education system will be a sorry day for us all.  I have visited many schools, and teachers and principals have done a wonderful job in all the SPHE programmes, such as Walk Tall, to identify young people who may have, as the Senator said, come out of the closet.  We are changing.  Perhaps we do not have all our ducks in a row, but it is incumbent on us all, in particular the education system, to ensure no person is discriminated against because of his or her sexuality.  Things are changing rapidly and we must continue this.  I thank Senator for raising this very important issue.</p></speech>

Yesterday, the health committee heard presentations from the HSE and the body which approves drugs under the reimbursement scheme.  There were also presentations from other organisations which expressed their concerns about delays.</p> <p>Orphan drugs are drugs for small groups of people who have rare diseases.  The Minister of State was on the health committee with me and knows that there are over 6,000 rare diseases.  There could be 20 or 25 people with a particular rare disease and the medication they require is what we mean by orphan drugs.  Directly or indirectly, there are around 375,000 people affected because their child or relative has a rare disease so orphan drugs is a big issue.</p> <p>Several organisations here have raised the delay in processing applications for drugs for approval under the reimbursement scheme.  Some 148 different orphan medicines have been approved at European level.  In Ireland, only 53 have received approval under the drugs reimbursement scheme.  In England it is 68, it is 75 in Spain, 84 in Italy, 116 in France and 133 of the 148 have been approved for reimbursement in Germany.  Those are big countries and so the market is quite big, so something that might affect 2,000 people in Germany might only affect 20 people in Ireland, so we are not in the same bargaining position.</p> <p>I fully accept that all the processes in the HSE and the Department are complicated because we are dealing with pharmaceutical companies which are a powerful lobby group in their own way but the result is that people who need medication are left sitting there.  The average timescale from the date of application for one of these orphan drugs to it becoming available under the reimbursement scheme is 23.6 months.  That figure was worked out for me by the pharmaceutical companies.</p> <p>I am asking the Minister that we could look at the mechanism for this assessment and that we try to put in place a procedure which can fast track it and deal with it in a far more efficient manner.  I am not criticising anyone involved in this and I know it is a complicated area, made more complicated again by the number of people doing the assessment and the people who are producing the drugs.  For instance, yesterday the health committee was told that there was one drug which, if given approval, will cost &euro;1 million per annum per patient.  That is the kind of money we are talking about at the higher end, but there are also many drugs at the lower end.  We need to try to improve the processing mechanism and that is why I raise this matter.</p></speech>

Orphan product manufacturers have exclusive patents and are monopoly suppliers.  They can, and frequently do, seek extraordinary prices for these products.</p> <p>The HSE seeks, where possible, to give patients early access to new treatments.  However, it must work within the budget provided by the Oireachtas.  The prices manufacturers seek for new and orphan medicines make this extremely challenging.</p> <p>In the statutory reimbursement process, supported by the 2016 framework agreement with the industry, the HSE makes decisions on objective scientific and economic grounds.  Criteria include the population's health needs, the product&rsquo;s cost and clinical effectiveness, opportunity costs, the budget impact and available resources.</p> <p>HSE decisions are supported by health technology assessments, HTAs, which systematically assess whether a drug is a cost-effective health intervention.  Currently, most new medicines, including orphan products, undergo HTAs.  However, not all applications have sufficient information for assessment and this must be sought.  In addition, as HTAs frequently cannot demonstrate value for money for items at the price sought, lengthy price negotiations may be needed.  These factors contribute significantly to the length of the approval process.  Put simply, some manufacturers, as monopoly suppliers, use markets like Ireland to set very high prices which may not reflect the drugs' effectiveness and are unsustainable for our health service.</p> <p>Under the 2016 agreement for very expensive treatments, especially where the price does not reflect therapeutic value, the HSE may negotiate price and supply conditions.  As seen with some high profile drugs, reaching a sustainable pricing structure can be a long process.</p> <p>Where the HSE decides to reimburse a medicine but considers it cannot do so from existing resources, it may inform the Department of Health.  The Minister may, if deemed appropriate, bring a memorandum to Government on the funding implications.  However, the price should still reflect value for treatment.</p> <p>Since July 2016, when the agreement was introduced, the HSE has referred ten treatments, including Orkambi or Kalydeco, which it decided to reimburse in May.  There are currently nine products under consideration, with a five-year cost of &euro;120 million, of which eight were referred since May.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, expects that the process will be completed shortly for these items.</p> <p>It is right to exercise diligence when considering such huge commitments.  With the sums involved and the competing demands across the health service, every effort should be made to secure the best outcome for the health service and the taxpayer.  This includes seeking realistic and sustainable pricing and supply models for new treatments.</p> <p>I am pleased to inform Senators that, as well as pursuing better pricing within our system, Ireland has this year begun working with other member states, through Beneluxa and the Valletta Declaration, to explore ways to share expertise and resources, so we can all gain access to new treatments in realistic time frames and at fair prices.</p> <p>I have read the report of yesterday's health committee meeting and will report back to the Minister later today.</p></speech>

The drugs which are going for approval have already gone through the whole scientific process.  First, there is no doubt that the drugs have been approved and would be of benefit.  Second, there is the mechanism that comes into play thereafter.  I accept where the HSE is coming from, that if a particular price is required for a drug then that influences its cost effectiveness.  Nevertheless, if, for instance, a drug costs &euro;50,000 for a patient, when assessing whether the drug is cost effective, we should look at how many weeks of the year that patient will be hospitalised.  All those issues must be taken into account and I am not clear if they are.  If a patient can be given a drug that means he or she will spend less time in the care of a hospital, there is a saving for the State.  All those issues need to be considered.</p> <p>Finally, we are looking to work with smaller countries.  Would we be far better off working with a country such as Germany which has a far bigger population?  If we could tie in with them to agree prices we might come out far better.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colm Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2353"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am not clear on it but it is something we should look at as well.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Harris, expects that the process will be completed shortly for these items.</p> <p>I will stress to the Minister when I see him later that the five, as the Senator stated, particularly the ones ready to go, have gone through all the tests and should be brought into the system as soon as possible and help those people who are waiting.

She is able to avail of a medical card.  She has multiple medical issues and a number of carers come to the house on a daily basis.  In terms of his own application for a medical card, they are over the limit as a couple.  However, what is not taken into account is the fact that he has to run the heating 24-7 and there are many things that he pays for.  His wife is entitled to carers so many hours in the week but he himself pays for extra carers out of his own money.  I have come across a number of couples in the same situation.  I note the amount of money that he is saving the State by caring for his wife at home.  She is in her late 70s.  She rarely goes to the nursing home.  She receives all her care and attention at home.  A medical team comes regularly to her.  This man, by making the choice to look after his wife at home, is saving the State a great deal of money.</p> <p>However, the man himself is, unjustly, being disenfranchised by not being able to avail of a medical card.  He has so many outgoings that at the end of every week a lot of the money that he receives is gone out in payments.  I have come across a number of couples who have been in a similar situation.  When people, especially those over the age of 66, and even into their 70s and 80s, are caring for loved ones at home, it is not taken into account that they have outgoings, nor is the time that they have to give taken into account.  The day I met this gentleman he was coming back from a walk with his dog.  He was able to go out for the walk with the dog because two of the carers were there at the time.  Other than when they are there he does not move outside the door.  He has had to give up his golf.  He has had to give up his social life because he is at home with his wife 24-7.  Consideration should be given that if a person is caring for somebody at home, he or she should equally be able to avail of the use of a medical card.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-07-13a.33" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1307" speakername="Catherine Byrne" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017071300002#E00400"><p>I apologise for the Minister, Deputy Harris, who could not be here.</p> <p>I commend those carers who are over 66 years of age and, indeed, all carers who are caring for loved ones at home.  This 24-7 duty of care is one that faces many families throughout the country and I understand the difficulties carers face financially, physically and emotionally, particularly for those who are older carers.</p> <p>There is no doubt that carers make a significant contribution to the lives of those they care for.  Their tireless and selfless work enables their loved ones to continue to live independently in their own homes and within their own communities.</p> <p>As the Senator will be aware, under the provisions of the Health Act 1970, as amended, assessment for a medical card is determined by reference to financial means, including the income and expenditure of the applicant and his or her partner or dependants.  The current income thresholds for persons aged 66 to 69 are those which apply under the general medical card scheme, which is a net weekly income of under &euro;201.50 for a single person, or &euro;298 for a couple.  It is important to note, however, that there is a separate scheme for the assessment of persons aged 70 years and over.  The income threshold for this cohort of people is under &euro;500 for a single person or under &euro;900 for a couple.</p> <p>Carers should, therefore, apply for a medical card to the HSE and provide all supporting documentation for a full assessment to be made.  In certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances.  If a carer over the age of 66 years is the sole carer for his or her loved one at home, the carer might be enduring extra expenses, such as medical or social expenses.  They should include all such information in their application.</p> <p>There are no current plans to extend the provision of a medical card to carers over the age of 66 years who are caring for loved ones at home.  The eligibility requirement for a medical card for this group will remain as a means test.  The Senator might recall that the report of the expert group on medical need for medical card eligibility in 2014 recommended that a person's means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.</p> <p>There are a number of other supports also available to carers.  Carers over 70 years of age are automatically entitled to a GP visit card and this is not subject to a financial means test.  Additionally, carers who are aged over 66 years may be entitled to the carer's allowance.  This weekly payment by the Department of Social Protection is made to those on low incomes who are looking after a person who needs support because of age, disability or illness.  Carer's allowance is not taken into account during the application for a medical card.</p> <p>I hope the information provided regarding the medical card options for carers is of assistance and will assist them in their application for a medical card.</p></speech>

In this case, the man applied and made the case of what he was providing at home but, unfortunately, he was refused.  I will now go back to him to encourage him to reapply.  Consideration needs to be given to the fact that persons in their later years are looking after their loved ones.  I understand that there is a bit of leeway there and I will be encouraging him to apply again.</p></speech>

I know what it was like when my two brothers looked after my Mam, who had dementia and other ailments, before she passed away.  It is unconditional love - that is the only way of putting it.  They were not paid for their services but they did it because she was their mother and they were able to have her at home and give her as much independence as possible.</p> <p>It is difficult when older people are in the position where they have to look after their loved ones, and choose to look after them as well, which is very important to them.  As the Senator stated, it does, in many ways, save the State a lot of money.  I will relay back the Senator's request and the concerns that she raised, particularly when older people are looking after their loved ones as well, that maybe there should be some kind of criteria provided for them as well.</p> <p>On the particular case raised, perhaps I missed a note but I want to ask the Senator did she say they already had a carer but it was not the person who was caring for the lady?</p></speech>

We had a very positive engagement with the Minister and the Department yesterday over five hours.  I thank Senators for their support on this issue.</p> <p>In regard to the summer economic statement, while I know we are having discussions on it, I want to touch on the issue of capital expenditure and infrastructure.  We are all aware that the budget will be predicated on Fianna F&aacute;il's confidence and supply agreement.  While there has been a lot of kite flying about tax cuts, we have been quite clear on the issue of tax cuts that, for whatever tax cuts there are, there must be twice as much investment in the economy and in services.  Wherever the Government seeks to find those tax cuts in terms of the USC, if there is to be a tax cut, it should be only for low and middle income earners, not for those at the top.</p> <p>With regard to investment in broadband, housing, roads and critical infrastructure in our hospitals, the Government is lacking ambition, especially when it comes to the issue of public private partnerships and the 10% rule, which it has not sought to change.  If we changed that rule and sought to pursue the issue of public private partnerships, we could draw down funding from the European Investment Bank.  We could also look at re-investing in the domestic economy the &euro;6.3 billion the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund currently has invested around the world.  However, we need to change our focus and emphasis in regard to public private partnerships.  We cannot let the issue languish and be predicated on the current 10% rule.  We need to pursue this because our infrastructure, such as roads and in particular broadband, is absolutely dependent on further investment.</p> <p>We see that the fiscal space is not going to be large and, depending on who is doing the numbers and what the Government intends to do in regard to tax cuts, it will be about &euro;300 million.  We have to ensure we have investment in our economy.  I ask the Leader to outline whether the Government is looking to change the 10% rule and to make sure there are more public private partnerships, which have worked well in regard to many other infrastructure projects in the country in recent years.</p></speech>

A subject that has not been well covered in these Houses and which needs some attention is the question of diversity within our public broadcaster.  One of the most striking aspects of Irish television news programming currently is the absence, or near absence, of presenters, correspondents or reporters from ethnic or minority backgrounds.  I am open to correction but from my observation of prime time news bulletins on RTE, TG4 and TV3, there are pretty much no non-national Irish journalists on screen.  There may well be journalists of particular ethnic origin working in the respective newsrooms but none appears to have on-camera roles.  By comparison, and allowing for the difference in scale or news operation, Channel 4 and Sky News have a large number of visible ethnic-origin journalists.  I would like the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, to outline what measures his Department is taking to ensure there is on-screen diversity for all licence payers who consume television news.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I paid my television licence recently and, as I was doing so, wondered if I ought.

One area in which it could do so is diversity.  Earlier this year, RTE advertised for a company to design and deliver diversity and inclusion awareness training to its staff and management.  In February, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, launched the Broadcasting Association of Ireland, BAI, strategy statement which said that the BAI wants to facilitate a mix of voices, opinions and sources of news and current affairs in audiovisual media.  However, strategies are redundant unless demonstrable action is taken to ensure that presentation on news programmes on Irish television is truly representative.</p><p>Deputy Eamon Ryan of the Green Party caused a considerable stir recently when he brought a bag of recyclables into the D&aacute;il.  He was making the laudable point that despite all the discussion of recycling, there is still a huge amount of wastage.  The Green Party is to be commended on its efforts in terms of proposing deposits on plastic bottles and the outlawing of certain types of coffee cups and so on but there needs to be a discussion about what happens to the items we recycle.  How much of the plastics and Tetra Paks and so on is going into landfills and how much is being recycled?  There is a public policy problem if the public senses that it is being told to wash out the milk carton but the carton will end up in the same place as ordinary rubbish.  That produces disrespect and cynicism about the whole area of environmental awareness and recycling.  We need to know what is happening.  A related issue is the labelling of goods.  It is not always clear how to dispose of the wrapper of a person's convenience food or spaghetti Bolognese for his or her much-delayed dinner.  There needs to be a far greater level of public awareness and also far more levelling with the public about what is happening.  I would welcome a debate on that issue as soon as possible, though not necessarily before the summer recess.</p></speech>

There were reports at the weekend regarding the allocation of the mackerel quota.  Several spokespersons from various organisations involved in the fishing and processing industry have aired concerns that a legal challenge may be brought against the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, if he intends reviewing the mackerel quota for it to be allocated in a different manner to the current situation, which is that 87% of the quota is hived off to 23 fishing ships in the north west of the country.  The bigger issue is that the Minister must stay independent in his decision making and that the processing industry and the jobs it provides and the fishing fleet, particularly in the west and south west, are very dependent on this quota.  For a very long time we have been calling for a more equitable redistribution of the quota.  It is unacceptable that threats of this type are being made before the Minister makes a decision.  I call on him to stand firm and to make the right and equitable decision in regard to the quota.</p> <p>The bigger picture is that a review of the Common Fisheries Policy is needed.  Is Ireland getting its fair share of the overall fishing grounds and the available stock of fish in European waters?  By reference to many of the available figures, it is not.  There are huge implications to the British Government pulling out of the London Fisheries Convention and Brexit will have further massive implications for the fisheries quota.  The Minister should come to the House to give Members a clear picture of what the Government's stance will be in those negotiations, particularly in terms of Brexit, and why the Government is not willing to engage in a re-negotiation of the Common Fisheries Policy.  The scale of Ireland's fishing grounds compared to the minuscule quotas for different species that have the result of pitching different fishing organisations in the country against each other is totally and utterly unacceptable.  There needs to be a review of the Common Fisheries Policy.</p> <p>I note that the OECD review of the Government's second public service reform programme says that outsourced initiatives, including JobPath, are questionable and have not emerged as systemically-viable options for public service provision.  Many Members have heard in their constituencies of huge issues in regard to the JobPath programme and that it is not progressing people to employment.   Several weeks ago, I raised the issue of a 62-year-old woman who was asked to make a 90 km round trip to attend an appointment with JobPath and there was no public transport available for that journey.  Thankfully, she got a letter to say that she would no longer need to apply but her sister got a letter saying that she would have to go to a JobPath interview.  That shows how ridiculous the situation is, that JobPath must be addressed because it is not working and that the outsourcing to private for-profit companies of such job activation schemes is not the best way to go.  I call for a debate on both JobPath and the OECD review and also the renegotiation of the Common Fisheries Policy.</p></speech>

I understand from this morning's newspaper and a conversation I had with Councillor Deirdre Kingston of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council that Clonkeen College, a Christian Brothers school, has sold its land.  This is of huge disappointment to the local community because there has been significant State investment in the school, including an upgrade of the playing pitches that are now to be lost to the local community as a result of the school's decision to sell.  Two schools in my constituency have made similar decisions.  St. Paul's College, Raheny, was given land by Dublin City Council in the 1950s on the understanding that it be kept for recreational use but that land was sold to a developer several years ago, and St. Mary's Holy Faith, Killester, is currently selling its lands.  It is disappointing that the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, is taking a hands-off approach to this issue.  Even though the State has invested money in these schools and had a relationship with them, he does not seem to have any interest in getting involved or commenting on the fact that local communities are losing facilities in the schools.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to the House when he is available and it is appropriate in order for the issue to be discussed because if there are two schools in my constituency and one school in Councillor Deirdre Kingston's constituency in which this has happened in a very short period of time, I am quite sure that every area of the country will have a similar problem in the months and years to come.  I would appreciate if the Leader could facilitate that debate.</p><p>On a lighter note, I wish two journalists from TV3 the very best in their retirement.  To hear that Vincent Browne is to retire from his role as the presenter of Vincent Browne Tonight is a little like hearing of the retirement of a teacher who used to give one detention all the time.  There is the same emotion that he is moving on and a guarded regard for the fact that even though there were battles, one will be sad to see him go.  I also want to acknowledge Ursula Halligan, who has announced that she is to leave TV3.  My greatest memory of Ursula was not necessarily a journalistic one, although I do remember she forced Deputy Enda Kenny to trip over a flower pot while asking him how strongly he felt about the marriage equality issue.  I also remember an incredible article she wrote that was published in <i>The Irish Times.</i>I vividly remember sitting outside a gym at around 7 a.m., reading online her article about her life, sexuality and journey to the realisation of who she was and openly weeping, touching my face and feeling tears coming down my cheeks as I read her words.  It was a very powerful statement and she stepped outside the journalistic sphere for that referendum.  What she did that week touched the hearts of a huge number of people in Ireland.  I wish to acknowledge that she has moved on from her position in TV3 and wish her all the best for the future.</p></speech>

The issue is that of the deprivation index, the manner in which it is put together and the assessments which flow from it in terms of the needs of communities.  This is very important because it impacts on funding for a range of areas, including For&oacute;ige, drugs task forces and the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, which is another social inclusion initiative.</p> <p>The problem is that one of the main criteria used to assess this index is housing, social housing and the number of people who are in social housing rented to them by the local authority.  As we know, as a result of the recent homelessness problems, the economic crash and the lack of new houses being built, local authorities in many areas are being forced to rent houses and become involved in other schemes such as the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme.  There are also long-term and short-term lettings.  None of these are included in calculating the index which, of course, skews the figures considerably.  If one takes a town like Balbriggan, which has approximately 25,000 people including 7,000 children, the services available to that community may be negatively impacted by the manner in which the deprivation index is currently put together.  </p> <p>I will be calling on the relevant Minister, although I have not yet been able to figure out which Minister that might be.  I will inform the Leader which Department is responsible for this matter afterwards.  I know that Pobal is involved but Pobal works with several different Departments.  I will be calling on the Minister to correct this issue because it is disadvantaging communities around our country.  As I have said, the example which springs to my mind straight away is the town of Balbriggan.  Not only does Fingal have the youngest population in the State, but Balbriggan has the youngest population of any town in the State.  </p> <p>We need to give our children the best chance in life.  We want to ensure a fair distribution of resources to disadvantaged communities so that we can give all our citizens the best opportunities.  I call on the Leader to invite the relevant Minister to the House to address this matter.  Perhaps as a result of raising the issue here today it will come to the attention of Pobal, which may pre-empt the relevant Minister and have the matter resolved by the autumn.</p></speech>

These meetings could help both Parliaments develop a joint approach.  The two Houses of Parliament and the Assembly could meet jointly with the Seanad, whether in Armagh or some other location, to discuss the effects of Brexit, because it is a very important issue.  I ask the Leader to request that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade with special responsibility for Brexit negotiations, Deputy Simon Coveney, come here early in the autumn to update the Seanad in respect of the negotiations between Michel Barnier and David Davis, the Member of Parliament representing the British Government in the negotiations.</p> <p>One would have to be concerned that the British Government is introducing what is being described as a great reform Bill to the House of Commons before the negotiations are completed.  The negotiations are just under way and bringing forward the Bill in advance of an exit is pre-empting the discussions .  If anyone had any doubt that the exit will happen, when this reform Bill is passed there will be no going back.  In the meantime, the United Kingdom is benefitting from the European Union agreement with Japan, from the EU-Canada comprehensive economic and trade agreement , CETA, and from the EU's relationship with the United States even though it is arranging bilateral meetings with Donald Trump and so on.  It is all somewhat confusing.  </p> <p>I am delighted that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, has been given this special responsibility and is being supported by the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, who was here yesterday.  From our point of view I would suggest he establish a centre in Ireland dedicated to the Brexit situation, especially in light of the threats to &euro;1.2 billion a week in trade and the 500 km open border.  People would know that there was a dedicated team of high-powered civil servants.  I feel that former taoisigh like Enda Kenny, John Bruton, Brian Cowen and Bertie Ahern would be supportive.  They would be the four horsemen of the apocalypse.  They would work with the Government in order to support it.  There would be very qualified envoys involved.  </p> <p>The new Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, should go on a tour of the capitals over the summer months to acquaint other leaders of the situation.  I have just returned from a meeting of the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs of Parliaments of the European Union, COSAC, in Estonia and Brexit was not really on the agenda.  It was not of great concern to Estonia and other countries throughout Europe.  We have to keep focusing on the issue and  I put the focus on it at the meeting.  I said that it must be discussed at the November COSAC meeting in Tallinn.  If people representing Ireland were not at all these meetings Brexit would play second fiddle to all other issues.  </p> <p>I commend the Seanad committee, including Neale Richmond, the Chairman, and all the Members who participated.  It is an excellent report and is worth selling.  I propose that the document be circulated to all parliaments and European committees.  It is not a big effort but it should be sent to each committee and to the parliaments of each of the 26 countries.</p></speech>

I believe we would all agree with his points in respect of that deprivation index.</p> <p>The EU Brexit negotiator, Guy Verhofstadt, MEP, made a very positive suggestion yesterday.  He was addressing a parliamentary committee which was looking at how to redistribute Britain's seats in the European Parliament.  He suggested that those with Irish passports living in the North of Ireland should have the right to vote in European elections across the Border.  He said it could be done by increasing the number of European Parliamentary seats in the Republic of Ireland.  It should be the case that all of us in the Chamber would support the rights of our fellow citizens in the North to continue to have representation in the European Parliament.</p></speech>

We have a problem here.  To be clear, I hope that the chair of that committee is mistaken.  I expect that our Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade would be very supportive of the idea of ensuring representation in the European Parliament for our citizens in the North.  It is very important that we have clarity on that before we go into recess for the summer because we know that there is an open door from the EU Brexit negotiator to this idea and that the committee would be open to the idea.  The committee, however, is under the impression that the Irish Government would not support it.  It is very important that we hear from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  In fairness, I expect he will endorse the idea and I expect that we will have all-party consensus around the idea.  It is very important that we do not let ourselves slip into recess without clarity on that very important issue.</p></speech>

A particular case has brought it to my attention.  It is the case of a couple caring for a child who has severe special needs.  Each of them would qualify for carers' benefit which, as we know, requires stamps or a social insurance contribution to be paid.  Each of the parents would be entitled to 24 months payment in their own rights, which is equivalent to four years in total.  A situation has arisen whereby the mother is looking after the child.  It is basically a 24-7 requirement, or bordering on it, with a lot of support being given.  She is coming to that end of that 24-month period and, if they are to continue on with carers' benefit, her husband will have to leave work.  That does not suit the family arrangement whatsoever.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michelle Mulherin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I ask for the rules to be changed to allow for his entitlement to carer's benefit to be transferred to his wife.  The change will not impose an additional cost on the State but it would make a world of a difference to the family.  I envision that this situation would apply to not just a child with special needs but elderly parents or somebody that a couple are looking after.</p><p>More flexibility is required.  We all know that the profession of carer demands a big commitment.  We should make things easier when something is highlighted that does not cost the State.  I want the rules to allow for a right that already exists to be transferred.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Health to debate this issue in order to resolve the matter.  In this case the wife has been refused the entitlement to take on her husband's credits. </p></speech>

This morning <i>The Irish Times</i>published an article about the O'Devaney Gardens, St. Michael's Estate and Oscar Traynor Road.  The article highlighted the fact that 1,644 affordable and social units will be delayed because the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment has not designed an affordable housing scheme.  I find that totally unacceptable.  In addition, the 900 units that were planned for the former Irish Glass Bottle site in Ringsend will also be delayed because no scheme has been designed to provide affordable housing.</p><p>On 2 March I raised this matter with the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy English.  On that occasion I asked him to develop a pilot scheme that would enable this type of development to progress.  I was told not to worry, that the Department was working hard and there was no need for a pilot scheme as a national scheme would be put in place.  I realise now that there was a reason to worry as nearly 2,500 units for this city have been delayed and no scheme has been put in place. </p><p>As I walked up the stairs to this Chamber I thought that I would ask for the Leader to invite the Minister to come here today but I decided to be reasonable.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to attend here next week to discuss this very important issue.  Badly needed social and affordable housing for this city should not be delayed just because the Department has not designed a scheme.  On 2 March I was given a commitment in this House that the scheme would be developed and reassured that there was no need for a pilot scheme.  We cannot adjourn for the summer knowing that 2,500 badly needed units for this city have been delayed due to a lack of action by the Department.  I ask the Leader, at his earliest convenience, to invite the Minister to attend here next week to debate this important matter.  We know work on these sites has been delayed but many more projects could have been delayed, which is totally unacceptable.</p></speech>

When one needs a national car test one telephones the appropriate body for an appointment, a suitable time is confirmed and one attends with a vehicle for the test.  When one needs a passport one gets an appointment time to meet somebody from the Passport Office.</p> <p>On two occasions I have had to bring two relations to hospital.  One one occasion I had to bring a relative to Tullamore Hospital for an appointment.  On the second occasion I had to bring a relative to St. James's Hospital for a scan.  On both occasions I talked to the people who were seated around me.  Like me, they had waited for a couple of hours.  I discovered that 30 people had been given the same appointment time to attend St. James's.  I also discovered that around 20 people had been given the same appointment time to attend Tullamore Hospital.  Such a practice is scandalous.  Our sickest and most vulnerable people have been and are being treated with utter contempt, which is not good enough.  I will be very disappointed in the HSE, which has a lot of senior management, if it cannot sort out this mess.  I ask the Leader to bring pressure to bear on the Minister for Health to resolve the problem.  Furthermore, I talked to a consultant about the practice.  He told me that some people do not turn up for their appointment, etc.  I bet that anyone who gets an appointment to attend an oncology ward shows up on time.  The consultant's answer was unfeasible.</p></speech>

We took very detailed legal advice on the matter and it was found that the Bill had serious defects.  It is important to convey the message that medicinal cannabis is available where a medical consultant is satisfied that it would benefit a patient.  That consultant can apply to the Minister for a licence and once a licence is issued the product can be used.</p> <p>It is a myth that medicinal cannabis is not available to anyone for medical reasons.  The Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, issued a detailed report on the matter earlier in the year.  It set out three areas where medicinal cannabis can be used.  It is important to convey the message that the decision by the Oireachtas joint committee is not about preventing medicinal cannabis being used.  The system has been set up whereby a medical consultant can apply for a licence and the product can be used once he or she is satisfied it will benefit the patient.</p> <p>I wish to clearly state that there is no scientific evidence to support the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes.  There is a question to be answered when a GP prescribes it.  Would a GP's professional indemnity policy adequately cover him or her if there was a subsequent claim against the GP for giving incorrect advice?  A view exists that the committee took the wrong decision.  I can confirm that all of the members who attended the meeting took the unanimous decision that the Bill, brought forward by Deputy Gino Kenny, was not the way to deal with this matter.  The Minister has effectively dealt with the matter over the past six to eight months.  It is important that we get that message out. </p> <p>My colleague in the Seanad raised the issue of hospital appointments.  I agree with him that there is a need for change in the area.  Some hospitals have brought forward a change.  There is a problem with people not turning up for appointments.  I heard about one clinic recently where only three people turned up for the six available appointments.</p></speech>

On that occasion it was thought that the company had hoarded a large amount of recyclables as they had been deemed valuable.  Some recyclables are deemed more valuable than others.  I am concerned about where all of our rubbish goes and what we are doing with landfill.</p> <p>I wish to refer to broken promises.  A protest by disabled people and their families is taking place today at the front gate from 12 noon until 4 p.m.  I urge all of the Senators to engage with the protesters.  They have christened their protest "Broken Promises" because they feel that they have never been listened to and their views have not been taken on board.  A lot of people have talked about the issue.  We must recognise that the Government has failed for ten years to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities that was adopted in 2006.  As a result disabled people have waited ten years.  The Government has failed to reintroduce the transport and mobility grant that was cut in 2013 so disable people have waited four years.  Fine Gael promised in its manifesto of 2011 to fund a personalised budget.  The Government has failed to implement the initiative so these people have waited six years.  The Government has failed to implement in full the Disability Act 2005 and, therefore, these people have been waiting 12 years.  I respectfully ask all of the Senators to go out and engage with the disabled people and their families at the front gate.  I urge them to find out what these Houses can do to improve their lives.</p></speech>
