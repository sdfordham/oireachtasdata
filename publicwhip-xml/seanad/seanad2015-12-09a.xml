    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-12-09a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1174" speakername="Mary Moran" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015120900002#A00600"><p>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to take this Commencement Matter.  Once again I am raising the issue of medical cards.  I understand the task force has stated eligibility must be assessed on the basis of financial means but I deal with the whole area of discretionary medical cards every week.  People who have been diagnosed with terminal or very serious illnesses are coming to me.  They have never claimed from the State, always paid their taxes and have children in college without a grant or any form of assistance from the State and yet when they are extremely ill, having been diagnosed with cancer, and look for support to cover their medical expenses, their applications are refused.  I have raised the case of one family in my area.  The person has been diagnosed with stage 3 cancer.  This person applied for a medical card earlier this year and the application was refused.  Additional and pertinent information was submitted and the application was again refused.</p> <p>This person applied for a medical card as an individual.  The application was not on behalf of an additional member of the family, a spouse or anyone else and yet when the response came back, the whole family was ruled ineligible.  The point being made was that the application was not in respect of the family but rather the individual and that, please God, when the person would recover, that would be it.  The card was wanted for the duration of the illness alone.</p> <p>We should be examining the issue.  There was a time when things were examined at a local level, people knew the genuine cases and they were looked on favourably.  It is an additional stress for people who have been diagnosed with terminal or very serious illnesses that the card is not afforded to them.  The circumstances as such do not matter but it is particularly stressful for people who have worked all their lives, paid all their taxes and done everything for the State.  These people have never claimed anything.  Several of these families have pointed out to me that if they had never worked and spent their lives on the dole, they would automatically be entitled to a medical card.</p> <p>Will the Minister of State re-examine the situation?  Also, when these medical cards are being applied for, what exactly is being applied for should be examined.  This case did not involve an application for a family medical card.  The application was on behalf of an individual and yet every time that was pointed out, a letter was received stating it is family related.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-12-09a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015120900002#B00100"><p>I thank the Senator for raising the issue.  We have the details of the particular case to which the Senator refers but it would be inappropriate to discuss an individual&rsquo;s circumstances in public in the Seanad.  I know Senator Moran agrees with that.  However, I understand from the HSE that this application was unsuccessful as the means were in excess of the qualifying threshold for a medical card or GP visit card.  I have been advised by the HSE that additional information has been provided and the case has been referred for a discretionary review.</p> <p>The Senator will be aware that, in accordance with the Health Act 1970, as amended, full eligibility and a medical card are awarded to persons who are, in the opinion of the HSE, unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and their dependants.  That is the reason the letters received by the individual refer to dependants.  In accordance with the Act, the assessment for a medical card is determined primarily by reference to the means, including the income and expenditure, of the applicant and his or her partner and dependants.  Where deemed appropriate in particular circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines but where they face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.</p> <p>The Senator is aware of the Keane report, to which she referred on several occasions, on the expert panel on medical need for medical card eligibility, published in November 2014.  A key recommendation of the report was that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.  That was the main issue of contention.  It has been repeatedly stated that one cannot issue medical cards or GP visit cards for condition-specific reasons alone.  It also recommended that it is neither feasible nor desirable to list conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility.  The rationale behind the recommendation will be clear to the Senator.  On foot of the report, my Department and the HSE are undertaking a suite of measures to improve the operation and administration of the medical card scheme.  A number of those are already in place and are having a positive impact on how the scheme operates.</p> <p>A key element of the programme is the work of the clinical advisory group on medical card eligibility which was established by the director general of the HSE.  The group has been tasked with developing a framework for assessment and measurement of the burden of disease and appropriate operational guidelines for the medical card scheme.  The clinical advisory group made an interim recommendation to award medical card eligibility to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer.  The director general of the HSE accepted that recommendation and it has been implemented since 1 July 2015.  The clinical advisory group is continuing its work on the development of guidance on assessing medical card applications involving a significant burden due to an illness.</p> <p>I am pleased to advise the Senator that, on foot of these reforms, the HSE is exercising greater discretion.  That is evident in the number of discretionary medical cards in circulation which increased from approximately 52,000 in mid-2014 to nearly 96,000 at the beginning of November this year.  Until we have universal health care and everyone has eligibility for health services, one will always have anomalies.  There will always be someone who is just above the means threshold, who does not have the prescribed disease or whose condition is not sufficiently severe and, as a result, those individuals will not meet the assessment criteria.  Universal health care, to which I am committed, is the only solution to address this issue.  However, as Senator Moran can see from the reply, we are taking another look at this application.</p></speech>

The Irish Cancer Society figures show that when a person has cancer, it can cost up to &euro;10,000 extra a year.  It has been pointed out to me that in some cases, after expenses for treatment are taken into account, some people would be better off on welfare.  That should not be the case.  Given the additional expenses in the case I have outlined, including for heating, transport to consultant appointments and treatment, I am very pleased with the Minister of State's response.  I hope the outcome is favourable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-12-09a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015120900002#B00300"><p>I understand the value of a medical card.  Sometimes it is not a case of what it can provide but the security it represents in terms of a person not having to worry about medical expenses.  People have enough things to worry about but when they have a medical card that is one less thing to worry about.  I read the Irish Cancer Society's report on additional costs.  Most costs relating to cancer treatment are met by the State whether or not one has a medical card because the treatment is in a hospital setting.  That is right and proper and that is why we have such success in terms of treatments and outcomes.  I hope Senator Moran's friend will have an equally good outcome.  The security element of the medical card is really what it is about.</p> <p>I accept there are additional costs for transport and being out of work.  That is understandable when one has an illness that impacts as much as cancer.  I also understand the security of not having that particular worry is essential in terms of how one faces the illness.  We are taking another look at the case.  Senator Moran is aware that I do not promise anything.  The number of discretionary cards in the system is incredible, and rightly so because there are people who do not meet the criteria and probably never will but we must take other elements into consideration.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-12-09a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1200" speakername="Averil Power" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015120900002#B00600"><p>I have tabled the matter to highlight the urgent need for Howth Harbour to be dredged in order to ensure its long-term viability as a commercial fishing port, leisure harbour and tourism destination.  The harbour has silted up to such an extent in recent years that the situation in Howth is bordering on being dangerous.  Even medium-sized fishing trawlers cannot enter the harbour at low tide whereas a few years ago, the harbour was accessible in all but the worst of weather.  Now boats have to lie off before entering the harbour for fear of catching the bottom and damaging their vessels.  Also, movement around the trailer basin at strong low tides is impossible.  Groundings are now more commonplace and can result in serious engine damage.</p> <p>The silting has also created problems for the Dublin Bay ferry service which has found it cannot keep to its schedule because it is restricted in terms of entering the harbour at Howth.  The ferry also uses Dublin Port and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Port and does not have such problems there.  Leisure boats encounter difficulties, which is likely to have a seriously detrimental effect on Howth Yacht Club's ability to hold major national and international sailing events.  I have also been told that it is now a regular occurrence for visiting boats, in particular, to run aground in the entrance channel and within the harbour.  I have been warned that it is only a matter of time before the harbour is blocked by grounded vessels, compromising safety and potentially preventing the operation of emergency services, including the lifeboat.</p> <p>I understand that even after a decision to dredge the harbour has been made, it may take two to three years to carry out the dredging programme as the necessary permits and licences will have to be obtained.  In the meantime, the crisis will get worse with more groundings and more risk to harbour users.  The annual accumulation of silt may cause some harbour activities to completely cease within two to three years.  Potential future business opportunities and proposed leisure activities and events will not be given a chance without a scheduled commitment to dredge the harbour.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Averil Power:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2351"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2351&amp;amp;pid=AverilPower&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->For these reasons and others, it is essential that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine commits now to dredging Howth Harbour as a matter of priority and immediately sets aside funding for this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-12-09a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1089" speakername="Tom Hayes" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015120900002#C00200"><p>I thank Senator Power for raising this important issue.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine is responsible under statute for the six fishery harbour centres located at Howth, Dunmore East, Castletownbere, Dingle, Rossaveel and Killybegs.  All six fishery centres are first and foremost working fishery harbours, which provide essential services and facilities to the fishing industry around the coastline of Ireland.  Each fishery harbour centre has unique features which facilitate a broad range of other diverse activities which are important from both an economic and social perspective.  The Department is conscious of the need to facilitate and further develop the fishing and non-fishing activities at the harbours.  This involves day-to-day operational support by harbour staff and management and development and repair of infrastructure subject to available financial resources.</p> <p>I am happy to advise the House that, notwithstanding the prevailing economic environment in which we operate, in excess of &euro;4.2 million has been invested in maintenance, development and upgrading works at Howth as part of the Department's annual Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme from 2011 to 2014.  For 2015, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, approved funding of &euro;1.79 million for the maintenance and development of Howth Fishery Harbour Centre.  Major works for 2015 include the continued upgrading of the electrical system, provision of a small craft pontoon and traffic management works.</p> <p>Siltation in Howth is recognised as an issue, as the Senator rightly pointed out, and is being kept under review.  It has been discussed with various stakeholders and officials from the Department attending the Howth Harbour Users Forum on 29 January 2015 used the occasion to have a number of meetings with users, where the issue of dredging was discussed.  A further meeting with Howth Yacht Club was held on 17 July where again the question of dredging was the main item of discussion.</p> <p>As part the 2015 fishery harbour centre development programme, the Minister sanctioned &euro;150,000 to carry out site investigation works in Howth for the west pier pontoon and the middle pier upgrade.  The site investigation contractor commenced work on site in early November and that is expected to be substantially completed by the end of this year.  It is anticipated that the report on the site investigation will be issued in early 2016.  This report will include information on the nature of the material to be dredged and extent of contaminated material within the dredge footprint.  This information is required to prepare a dumping at sea licence application, which will be necessary for the commencement of any dredging project that is needed in the area.  It will also provide the basis for an informed estimate of the cost of dredging the harbour at Howth.</p> <p>As with all other developments in the six fishery harbour centres, a dredging project at Howth Fishery Harbour Centre will be considered under future capital programmes on the basis of available Exchequer funding and competing priorities.  The suite of projects for inclusion in the 2016 programme is being considered at present and the Minister will make an announcement on these in due course taking into account what has been said here and the value of Howth, particularly given its location on the east coast.  I would be confident that it would be included because it stands up as a project.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-12-09a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1200" speakername="Averil Power" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015120900002#C00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State's confirmation that Howth stands up as a project and that dredging is needed.  As I said, there is evidence to support that.  The Minister of State said that the 2016 programme is still being considered, therefore, it has not yet been finalised, so there is still time for Howth to be included in it.  That is essential and consideration of it should not be deferred until the investigation is complete.  As the Minister of State said, the case for dredging is already clear.</p> <p>With regard to the scope of the works and what exactly needs to be carried out, the investigation will be helpful in determining that but we all know that Howth Harbour needs to be dredged.  I can give the Minister of State visual evidence of trawlers that have run aground in the harbour.  I have photographs of such trawlers.  It is very clear that the work needs to be done.  The key issue is to get a commitment to get the work started as soon as possible because things are getting worse all the time.</p> <p>From the perspective of the yacht club, some major international sailing events have been held in Howth in recent years, including Etchells sailing competition which is a major international prestigious competition.  As matters stand, the yacht club is concerned about pitching for future events to be held in two, three, four or five years' time until there is a commitment in place that the harbour will be dredged because it does not know if it will able to deliver on hosting such events.  Leisure boats are constantly running aground, especially when manned by people who are not familiar with the area.  It is very important that a commitment is given now.  I urge the Minister of State to talk to his officials and make sure that Howth is given serious consideration for the 2016 programme and that this is progressed as soon as possible.</p></speech>

I agree with her, and we are at one on the need for this work to be done.  It comes down to the availability of funding.  Howth has very strong case.  It is the only harbour in this category on the east coast and it has great potential.  It would be great if they could all be done together and if we had endless resources but we do not.</p> <p>The case has been made for Howth and the strong case the Senator has made this morning will also help.  I will relay what she said to the officials and also to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, who is certainly very committed to this whole issue.  It is one of the priorities and we want to get this work done as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

When speaking last summer, the Minister, Deputy Howlin, was quoted as saying: &quot;Under our Constitution pensions are preserved property rights. I can no more take somebody's pension than I can arbitrarily decide to take their house&quot;.  That comment was published in <i>The Irish Times</i>in June 2015.  While this may be true, for some it is not true.  Some 80 former garda&iacute; who despite having the required five years minimum service, did not have their pensions preserved until the age of 60 because they were dismissed or resigned from the service prior to 1976.  This group, the majority of whom are now aged over 70 with many of them now partners or widows of former garda&iacute;, are naturally very aggrieved at this injustice and are seeking an immediate legislative remedy.</p><p>The background to this is that in 1978 the Garda Representative Association, GRA, reached an agreement with the Departments of Justice and Finance that members of Garda rank who resigned from the force on or after 1 October 1976 would have their pensions preserved to the age of 60.  This is the agreed report No. 218 of the Garda Conciliation Council.  This was followed by agreed reports Nos. 530 and 543, which provide for the preservation of pension entitlements for members who left the force for any reason after 1 October 1976.At the heart of the injustice is the fact that the details of the agreed reports, to which I referred only, came to light when members of the pre-October 1976 group approached the age of 60 and were informed by letter from the Department that they had been excluded without their knowledge.  Since then a group, led by councillor Pat Hynes from Galway, has been actively engaged in seeking justice and has made innumerable representations to the Department of Justice over the years but to no avail.  It is further notable that since 1976, these agreed reports have operated on an administrative basis only and have not been incorporated into a statutory instrument or underpinned by any amendments to the primary legislation, the Police Forces Amalgamation Act 1925.  It is therefore easy to revise them via legislation.<i></i>In the opinion of Mr. Gerard Hogan, senior counsel, &quot;members of the Oireachtas ought in justice, to rectify this wrong by means of the enactment of legislation to cater for the very discrete category of pre-1976 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&quot;.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2402"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2402&amp;amp;pid=GerardPCraughwell&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Mr. Justice Hogan also reminded us that there is a precedent as legislation was passed retrospectively to enable a former Minister to apply to preserve his ministerial pension entitlements, even though he had not done so on time in the past.  This refers to the case of the former Minister for Education and Science, Dr. Michael Woods, who missed out on applying for a pension entitlement by the date provided for in the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act.  It would appear that where there is a political will, there is a way.  <br/><br/>I do not believe there is a citizen in the country who would begrudge these men their pensions.  To have their pensions restored to them would be viewed favourably by all as an indicator of a compassionate, paternalistic Government.  When one considers that &euro;7 billion was taken from the National Pension Reserve Fund to bail out two banks, the sums involved here are a drop in the ocean.  In terms of administration, resolution of this issue does not have to be done on a case by case basis.  It is more than an administrative issue; it is a constitutional right issue for which there is legal precedent.  In Lovett <i>v.</i>Minister for Education, 1997, Mr. Justice Kelly held that the right to a statutory pension was a property right protected by the Constitution.  In the past, former Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter and others have defended the Government's decision to stand over the agreed reports, saying they were decisions reached through negotiations between the Garda representative body and the Department of Justice.  In light of the Lovett case, this defence no longer holds water as the fundamental constitutional rights of citizens cannot be negotiated away through union or any representative association.  The agreed reports amount to an unreasonable and unjustified interference in the rights of 80 people affected by this decision.  They are seeking nothing more than the justice they deserve.  They did not voluntarily agree to forfeit their pensions.  Most of them were not even aware that this had occurred.  <br/><br/>In the course of the judgment in Cox <i>v.</i>Ireland, 1992, Chief Justice Fennelly referred to certain property rights protected by the Constitution, such as the right to a pension gratuity and other emoluments already earned.  The pensions to which I refer have already been earned and it is unreasonable to withhold them any longer.  I respectfully ask the Minister of State to revisit this issue as a matter of urgency.  It is a matter of dignity and due respect to those who have served the State as members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for many years.  The Government is to be complimented on the number of long-standing injustices that have been addressed over the past five years.  Will the Minister of State give a commitment to bring legislation before the Oireachtas in the next session to deal with this as many of those affected are well over 70 and have waited long enough for justice?  It is not only former garda&iacute;, most of whom are men, that are missing out.  Their widows are also missing out on this entitlement.</p></speech>

As the Senator is aware, I am taking this Commencement Matter on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  I will not be making any comment other than what is contained in the written reply but I am sure the Senator's remarks will be duly noted.</p> <p>On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, who unfortunately cannot be here, I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  The issue was addressed in this House by the Minister's predecessor in April 2012 but I am happy on her behalf to set out the position to the Senator.  The terms and conditions of pension schemes have evolved over the years and continue to do so.  New terms and conditions are introduced with effect from a specific date and apply to members of the scheme from that date onwards.  Prior to 1 October 1976, where a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na resigned or was dismissed before reaching the age and service at which he could retire on pension, that member forfeited all superannuation benefits under the then Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na superannuation scheme.  This situation was changed following discussions at the Garda Conciliation Council, the industrial relations machinery for members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It was agreed at that time by both sides - the official side and the Garda representative associations - and endorsed by the then Minister for Finance that the new arrangements should apply to members of the force serving on or after 1 October 1976.  By extension, these new terms did not and cannot apply to members who had left the force prior to that date.  These discussions concluded in what are known as agreed reports.  Generally speaking, these agreed reports provide that a garda who resigned or was dismissed on or after 1 October 1976 can have the superannuation benefits that had accrued to the date of resignation or dismissal preserved until they reached 60 years of age.  There was no provision for the preservation of superannuation benefits in the case of members who resigned or were dismissed prior to 1 October 1976.  </p> <p>The then Department of Finance, and now Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which continues to have overall responsibility for public service pension matters, agreed with the proposals for a cut-off date for eligibility for preserved benefits.  This date varies depending on the particular organisation involved and the conclusion of negotiations between management and the relevant staff interests.  The cut-off date for civil servants was agreed by all parties to be 1 June 1973 and the cut-off date for members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was agreed by all parties to be 1 October 1976.  I must stress that this was an agreed date between all of the parties involved in the discussions and was not imposed.  It is an inevitable consequence of the introduction of improvements in pension schemes that members of that scheme who had left it prior to the effective date cannot avail of that benefit.  </p></speech>

I know the Minister of State to be a fair-minded person and I think she will agree with me that to deny a small number of people a constitutional right is totally unacceptable.  I feel there is some cynicism on this issue in so far as the relevant parties are aware that these elderly people, who are over the age of 70, are in no position to mount a constitutional challenge to a denial of their entitlement.  I would like the Minister of State to relay the matter back to the relevant Department.</p> <p>Pensions are something I hold very dear to my heart so I will not leave the matter alone.  If I need to find somebody to raise this as a constitutional issue for these people, I will do it.  I would much rather see it resolved than see people suffer the loss of what they paid into and what they were entitled to.  Will the Minister of State to relay that back to the Minister?  I do not expect her to make any comments.</p></speech>

The Minister would like to thank the Senator for raising this matter and wishes to assure the House that the education of children with special educational needs remains a key priority for the Government.  She welcomes the fact that even in the constrained economic circumstances faced in recent years, we have been able to continue to meet the needs of children with special educational needs attending our schools and to increase provision to address emerging needs in this area.  The SNA scheme, in particular, has been a major factor in ensuring the successful integration of children with special educational needs into mainstream education and in providing support to pupils enrolled in special school and special classes.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Kathleen Lynch:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=656"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=656&amp;amp;pid=KathleenLynch&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I hate that term.  It should be changed to &quot;specialist schools&quot; - that is a personal view.  In July last, the Minister secured Government approval for an additional 610 SNA posts to the end of 2015, in addition to the 365 SNA posts provided in 2015, to take into account increased demand and demographic growth and to ensure children can continue to have access to additional supports in school.  There is now provision for 11,940 SNA posts in 2015, which is the highest level of SNA provision that we have ever had, and is an increase of 13% on the number of posts available since 2011.<br/><br/>The Minister assures the House that schools which have enrolled children who qualify for support from an SNA will continue to be allocated SNA support in a manner appropriate to their needs.  The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, through its network of local special educational needs organisers, SENOs, is responsible for allocating resource teachers and SNAs to schools to support children with special educational needs.  The council operates within the Department's criteria in allocating such support and these criteria are set out in the Department's Circular 0030/2014.  All schools were asked to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2015-16 school year by 18 March 2015.  Of course, the NCSE continued to accept applications after this date in recognition of the fact that enrolment may not have been completed or where assessments were not completed.  Details of SNA allocations to schools for 2015-16 is available on the NCSE website at <i>ncse.ie</i>.  Each school's allocation of SNA support can change from year to year and may be increased or decreased as students who qualify for SNA support enrol or leave a school.  New students with care needs may enrol to replace students who have left, for example, or SNA allocations may be decreased where a child's needs have diminished over time.<br/><br/>The Senator's specific query relates to the allocation of support to an individual school.  The Minister can confirm that the NCSE has advised the Department that the school currently has an allocation of 0.5 SNA for the 2015-16 school year.  This represents no change over the SNA allocation to this school in the previous school year.  The NCSE has also advised the Minister that this allocation to the school was not the subject of an appeal and it has received no new applications for additional SNA support for this school.  On this basis, the council is happy that the school currently has the appropriate level of SNA support to meet its needs  The Minister would like to thank the Senator once again for the opportunity to clarify the position.  From time to time, the information the Department has is different from the information public representatives receive.</p></speech>

I, therefore, propose an amendment that the relevant Minister come to the House for an emergency debate on the flooding issue.  As we know, the forecast this evening for counties Clare and Kerry, all counties in Connacht, County Donegal and other parts of the country is again very bad.  In 2012 the Taoiseach spoke about the need to have much more sophisticated early warning systems and a system that would operate to best advantage for everybody.  After 2013, during which we saw the worst storms for 143 years, we heard the first calls from Met &Eacute;ireann for additional staff.  I see that, as part of the Government's announcements in recent days, the extra staff needed can be recruited by Met &Eacute;ireann, but it is too little too late.  An allocation of &euro;14.5 million for flood relief schemes for this year alone remains unspent.  While we welcome the provision of &euro;15 million to aid communities under siege because of recent floods, it is truly disturbing to listen to communities throughout the country, including in Athlone and Bandon and farmers along the western seaboard.  Last evening I spoke to somebody in Sligo whose house was completely flooded and who was in urgent need of somewhere to rent in order that they and their family could begin preparations for Christmas.  We are not ready for this and never have been.  Despite a series of measures announced by the Government in 2012 and specifically in 2013 when we witnessed the worst storms for 143 years, it seems we are as unprepared as ever.</p> <p>The Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris, said there had been unanticipated delays in providing the funding required to deal with this issue.  What is the reason for the delays?  The Army needed to be called out much quicker to prepare by providing sand bags and making other preparations to mitigate the effects of the disaster that has taken place.  It is our contention that an urgent debate is needed.  The House is entitled to know that all hands are on deck and what measures will be taken in the coming days as conditions continue to worsen.  As we know, many families do not even have insurance because of what happened in 2012 and 2013.  Following very bad floods in the United Kingdom in 2013, the Government there undertook to sign a memorandum of understanding with the insurance industry in order that people who had experienced flooding in the past would still be in a position to take out insurance on their homes at affordable rates.  That is not the case here and one of the questions we want to put to the relevant Minister is whether there has been such contact with the insurance industry and whether a scheme is being prepared to ensure families will have this protection into the future.  </p> <p>We will push the amendment proposed to the Order of Business to a vote and I hope the Leader will be in a position to bring the Minister to the House to reassure us on what is taking place to mitigate the effects of a disaster that may get worse if the forecast as outlined is true.</p></speech>

I also welcome the clarification from the Department of Social Protection of the scope of the humanitarian assistance scheme.  I note that the Government has not set a limit on the amount that can be paid to individual households under the scheme, again in respect of flood damage.  All Members will be watching with great concern to see what happens regarding the predictions of rainfall and flooding across the midlands and along the River Shannon today.  While it is clear a great deal of work has been done to try to minimise any damage, it is certainly a matter of grave concern.  However, I welcome the measures which are already in place and which have been announced this week.</p><p>I also welcome the announcement made yesterday evening by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, that she intended to delete Rule 68 for primary schools.  This is the rule that enables religion to permeate the school day, which has been a huge issue for many parents across Ireland in the schooling of their children and which may not be in accordance with their conscience and lawful preference.  This change is long overdue and the deletion of the rule was recommended by the national forum on patronage and pluralism in the primary sector established by the former Minister, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn.  I welcome the announcement made by the Minister that she will do this in the new year.  I also note the passage through the D&aacute;il last week of the Private Members' Bill that had started as a Labour Party Private Members' Bill in this House to amend section 37 of the Employment Equality Act to ensure schools would no longer be able to discriminate against teachers on the basis of lifestyle or because they offended or were seen to offend their ethos.  This is hugely welcome, particularly for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, LGBT, teachers and I am glad that it has been done.  The deletion of Rule 68 is a further step in making the school system more reflective of the reality of pluralism in society.  I ask the Leader for a debate on this matter in the new year because the Minister also has stated she recognises that an amendment will be necessary to equal status legislation to ensure schools will no longer be able to discriminate against pupils or prospective pupils on the grounds of religion.  I will be speaking this Saturday at the launch of a new campaign, Education Equality, which has been established by a group of parents who have been relatively prominent in the media in recent weeks, that is seeking to ensure this change will be made and that schools will no longer be able to discriminate on the basis of religion in their admission policies.  I also note that the Minister has stated, regretfully, the likelihood is she will not be able to get the admission to school legislation through in the lifetime of the Government.  This is a reform that must happen.  I commend the organisers of Education Equality for putting together a campaign in which it will seek to bring it about early in the lifetime of the next Government, if not before.</p></speech>

It is absolutely appropriate that the Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris, come into the House as a matter of urgency to explain what measures have been taken.  Government Members may not be aware that the amount of capital funding for flood defences this year is being cut from the amount allocated last year.  There was a reduction in the funding allocated prior to the storms and Members need to know what is happening.  I assure the Leader that there has been a cut in the budget and the figures are available.</p> <p>I wish to deal with a couple of items.  First, on 29 November I referred to three cystic fibrosis drugs that had been approved by the European Medicines Agency, EMA, on 20 November.  As I wrote to the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, on 1 November, in advance of approval by the EMA, I was on top of this issue before the recent issues arose in the funding of these drugs.  The Minister issued a statement yesterday that he was considering funding these drugs, which I welcome, but all Members should remember the nature of cystic fibrosis.  It can be a highly debilitating and life shortening illness.  These three drugs offer enhanced quality of life and extended life expectancy and if the figure is &euro;92 million, it would be &euro;92 million well spent.  There should be no further delay on the part of the Department of Health in approving them to make sure they will be available to the thousands of cystic fibrosis patients and sufferers in Ireland, many of whom are children.  I, again, ask the Leader to use his good offices.  I have written to the Minister, but I have not had a response since 6 November.  However, I intend to follow up on the matter.</p> <p>In the light of Senator Ivana Bacik's remarks, while some people in Ireland believe religion might be an offence, may I remind Members that it is an entitlement of educators to protect their religious ethos?  On foot of the proposed deletion of Rule 68, I ask Senator Ivana Bacik and others how Church of Ireland schools will protect their religious ethos in what is a minority religion?  How will the single Jewish school in the State be able to protect its religious ethos?  I remind colleagues opposite that in the most recent census 82% of Irish people declared themselves as Catholic, while a further 8% declared themselves as Protestant.  There are people with religious beliefs which also must be respected.  While I am all for equality in this regard, I do not desire to have a situation such as obtains in the United States of America or Britain where those who want their children to be educated within a certain religious ethos must choose private schools.  I do not want that to happen.  Has the Government agreed to the deletion of Rule 68?  Senator Ivana Bacik, as leader of the Labour Party in this House, has welcomed the proposed deletion of the rule, but that is a serious step forward.  I agree with Archbishop Diarmuid Martin in that under no circumstances do I believe children should be baptised or included in any faith community simply to obtain a school place.  That absolutely should not be done.  However, what about the millions of people who hold fast and firm and respect their religious ethos?  The Labour Party, in particular, appears to think anyone who holds a religious belief is inferior to its members and their views.</p></speech>

I am not offended by anyone's religion and I am not offended if someone decides not to hold any religious belief.  However, I must tell the Leader that any proposed deletion of Rule 68 must be debated fully and must not be a knee-jerk reaction to a few hundred parents who have found themselves in a difficult position.  What about the millions of people, the hundreds of thousands of parents who want their children to be brought up and educated in a religious ethos school, as I do with my daughter, to give them a good grounding in life?</p></speech>

It has finally come to people's realisation that we have a serious problem with flooding, be it coastal flooding or rivers bursting their banks.  I wrote about this extensively after the flooding that took place in 2014 along the coast of County Clare and all along the west coast.  Up until a few years ago, approximately &euro;30 million to &euro;40 million per year was being spent on flood defences.  While, thankfully, this figure has increased, it is now necessary to engage with the European Union to have an aggressive flood defences mechanism and programme under which the investment of hundreds of millions of euro is envisaged.  The same approach must be taken to flood defences in Ireland as was taken to building motorways during the era of the Celtic tiger.  Ireland has a fantastic road network because billions of euro was invested, rightly, to ensure its provision.  It is now necessary to spend billions of euro on flood defences.  We are an island nation surrounded by water and people live in coastal communities nationwide.  The homes of people in Clonlara, County Clare and other counties are being flooded and the people affected will be in a worse position in a few hours time.  Members must up the ante and there must be a realisation of the necessity to spend billions of euro on flood defences.  Moreover, such a programme must be put in place urgently.  While the State does not have the money to do this, we are a member of the European Union.  As an island nation at the extremity of Europe, we have as many rights as citizens of Germany, France, Italy and every other member state.  We must exercise these rights and apply for billions of euro in EU capital funding to ensure our citizens will not, from one month to the next, be fearful of inclement weather.</p></speech>

I support the call for a debate on flooding, which is serious in the west, in particular, and the south.  It has come to light that many of the issues arising in local areas are due to a lack of maintenance work being done during times when the weather is not bad.</p> <p>During recent briefings given by the local authorities in Galway city and county, we heard about the frustration of the management of both authorities in respect of their lack of resources and funding as a result of all the changes introduced by this Government under the Putting People First policy of former Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Phil Hogan.  I have never seen local managers as agitated as they have been in the past two to three weeks.  For example, there are huge issues around housing and a lack of forward planning in terms of the hand-over of the administration of the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme.  We are told that owing to inadequate numbers of staff to handle the transfer of thousands of applicants from the Department of Social Protection to the local authorities, serious issues will arise after Christmas.  </p> <p>Many of the flooding issues arising in local areas are due to blocked drains and work in that regard not being done during the summer.  Owing to the reduction in the number of staff on the ground and a lack of funding for maintenance work - such as drain unblocking and road-sweeping and fixing - this work is not being done.  When we approach local authorities about these issues, we are told there is no money available to do the work.  We are also told that Irish Water is putting pressure on the local authorities to cut job numbers and that this is likely to occur in the next couple of months.  Instead of increasing staff numbers, there is a huge push to get rid of people who are working on contract for Irish Water in the local authorities.</p> <p>There has been much debate in recent times with regard to housing and so on.  We need to continue that debate because of the lack of social housing, the homelessness crisis and so on.  Following the terrible tragedy in Carrickmines, we heard that many local authorities had returned unspent allocations for Traveller accommodation.  This was refuted last week by Galway County Council.  According to that council, its applications for funding under the Traveller accommodation programme were turned down.  We need clarity on this issue.  Somebody is not telling the full truth on these matters and we need to address that.</p> <p>A debate on the issues relating to storm damage and to the need for ongoing maintenance work to be carried out between storms and for the requisite resources to be provided is vital.</p></speech>

Global Flood Solutions, a company based, in part, in Athlone, County Roscommon - ironically, one of the worst hit areas in terms of the flooding - sells flood relief products all over the world yet the Irish Government will not do business with that company in the interests of solving the problems that are being experienced in places such as Athlone and Athleague.  It beggars belief that nobody from Government is willing to engage with this company, which could assist us in solving the problems - albeit temporarily - of the many families and businesses throughout the country that are suffering today because of flooding.  I would welcome a debate on this issue as soon as possible.</p></speech>

I also support the call by Senator Kelly for the Government to engage with Global Flood Solutions, Athlone, of which Mr. Shane Curran is the director, in this regard.  I understand that this company has been seeking engagement with the Office of Public Works for many years about its products and that its requests have been refused thus far.  In 2009 I spoke in this House about the village of Athleague, which was under water at the time.  Three public houses in that village remained closed until after Christmas that year because they were under water.  Two of those pubs have since ceased trading, which is illustrative of the affect of flooding on an area.  Athleague village is now under water again.  While local people are assisting each other in terms of the clean-up of houses, etc., the local pub remains closed.  The local butcher shop, a chemist's premises and other shops are also closed.  The situation is distressing.  The proposed budget to address this crisis is inadequate.  One fifth of the money being allocated could be spent in County Roscommon alone, where Golf Links Road and Lanesboro Road are, for a second time in six years, flooded.  This Government has stood idly by since 2011 and has not put any investment into addressing this issue.</p></speech>

It is important that this issue be resolved.  It is also important, in the context of the negotiations relating to the drug, that we get value for money.  There has been much coverage in the past couple of years with regard to the availability of particular drugs and the fact that the latter comes down to the bargaining positions adopted by those involved, which is unfortunate.  I accept that a great deal of time and money has been spent on researching and producing the drug in question but it is important that we get value for money from the process.  I agree with Senator Darragh O'Brien that this drug should be made available at the earliest possible opportunity.</p> <p>Two recent requests by me for a Commencement matter debate on the issue of two facilities in Cork that can cater for 35 homeless people but have been lying vacant for four or five years were ruled out of order.  These properties were purchased by Cuan Mhuire and were to be used to provide accommodation for people who have completed treatment for alcohol addiction and who are now on the road of recovery.  It is sad that these facilities remain vacant.  I sought to have the relevant Minister address this issue by way of Commencement debate, such that these facilities could be brought into use at the earliest possible opportunity at a time when we need them.  It is unfortunate that my requests were ruled out of order.  While I fully respect the Cathaoirleach's ruling on this matter, I believe that, given the urgent need for these facilities, the relevant Minister should come to this House to explain why they remain idle.  I ask that the Leader inquire from the Minister why there has been no co-ordination between the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the relevant local authorities in this matter.  One of the units is located in Cork county and the other is in Cork city.  As I said, these facilities, which can cater for 35 people, remain vacant.  We need those facilities up and running as soon as possible.  Given my requests for a Commencement debate on this issue have been ruled out of order, I ask that the Leader raise the matter with the Minister on my behalf.</p></speech>

We should find time to debate this document as it is quite a balanced report.  Our colleague, Senator Cullinane, was the rapporteur for it and balanced it very well.  One of the concerns is that in attempting to bring the living wage up to a level that would be acceptable, we could damage jobs.  Employers might find that if they had to pay an awful lot more, they would not be able to do what they would like to do.  I believe this discussion did take place in organising the report and it would be very valuable to have a debate on the topic in this House in the new year.</p> <p>I am stunned that, although some time that has passed since the last floods took place in 2009, very little has been done to attempt to solve the problems.  Is it possible to get help from abroad?  I think particularly of the Netherlands, which lie very low, below sea level.  The people there do not have this problem as they solved it many years ago.  There must be expertise around the world, not just in Athlone as Senator Kelly has said.  We should have a debate on this quite soon.</p></speech>

The forum on patronage and pluralism reported two years ago and recommended dissolving rule 68.  That report went to the Minister back in 2012.  It is not throwing out the baby with the bathwater.  The rules for national schools, of which rule 68 is one, were devised 50 years ago.  The language used in all of the rules should and will be revised, presumably, along with rule 68.  We would not have any problem at all with reviewing the language used in another piece of legislation from 50 years ago.  One of the rules states that junior infants should be taught by the mistress - a woman.  Maybe that was a good idea or maybe it was a bad idea.</p> <p>I would go along with looking at all the rules.  When we are doing so we must pay attention to what we put in their place.  There is a new articulation of language recognising that there are many types of children, as Archbishop Martin has said himself.  Baptising a child just to get him or her into a school is not the way to do it.  I would go along with retaining a lot of rule 68 but under a new guise.  It has good things like charity, justice, inculcating truth, patience, obedience - there are lots of good things there and it is not all bad.  We want to ensure that we include all children of no religion and some.  </p> <p>I call for a debate on the Growing Up in Ireland survey, particularly on one aspect of it.  Some 28% of all deaths among children between 0 and 3 years of age in the EU are due to injuries.  A particular report in Ireland targeted accidents involving children between the ages of 1 to 3 and asks for a review of education of parents, how to avoid accidents or whatever.  The percentage of children in Ireland who are hospitalised is very high.  The Growing Up in Ireland study called for a review.  I would like a debate on how we are going to address this issue.  Accidents are also higher in boys than girls.  Recklessness would come to mind.  Maybe we should be thinking about politics as well in that regard.</p></speech>

Last night I was contacted by a citizen and am absolutely appalled by what I learned.  It is backed up by evidence.  It is absolutely outrageous that there are companies employed by the pillar banks that are breaking into people's private property, accessing social welfare records and putting that information into the public domain.  I heard this on the radio once or twice but now I know these banks are hiring thugs - not reputable private investigation companies - who are climbing over people's back walls, filming and photographing them in their houses and bedrooms.  These thugs will threaten people and access private social protection records, which is a criminal offence.</p> <p>These companies are supposed to be registered.  If that is the sort of behaviour that is going on, the Private Security Authority is falling down in its duties.  This is a matter that needs urgent attention.  We have innocent citizens trying to negotiate with their banks who are being threatened and intimidated by these thugs.

Rule 68 is an archaic rule.  Children have a human right under the European convention to a neutral studying environment, and that is clearly not the case in this country.  There is a lack of choice for parents who do not wish for their children to receive religious instruction.  We have seen the difficulty this country has had over the years with how religion can take precedence over instruction and education.  We have seen the abuses which followed as a result.  No parent or child should be forced into a situation in which religious instruction underpins their day.  Having said that, I and the Labour Party respect entirely the choice of parents and families to have religious beliefs.  Should the Senator wish to have a debate on this issue, I think it probably could be useful as I am not quite sure that he understands exactly what rule 68 means.  Go raibh maith agat.</p></speech>

That person has been told the time limit has expired, although I was not even aware there was a time limit, and will now have to make a fresh application, which requires a voluminous amount of documentation.  This is a lone parent on social welfare with a sick child but the number of documents required in order to be considered is shocking.  Not only has the person now been advised to apply again, three or four months after they applied, but they have to supply more up-to-date documentation and a repeat of everything they supplied before because the centralised medical card agency in Dublin lost the documents.  Not only that, but when I asked, on this person's behalf, if they could have the documents returned, given these included a P45, of which there was only one copy, I was told the only way they could get the documents returned was by putting in a freedom of information request.</p><p>What sort of an inhumane system have we, as legislators, created?  When the medical card system operated at local level, it was a very simple matter, as anybody in this House who has experience of it will know, in that one could get through to the person involved in the local office and he or she was able to sort it out.  There were never difficulties surrounding medical card applications.  I am appalled at the manner in which this applicant has been treated.  A very inhumane system has been put in place.  As a result, I have initiated through the Oireachtas Library and Research Service a full review of how these regulations came into place, who put them in place, what statutory regulations have been put in place and what are the legal requirements that mean a person has to go through the freedom of information process to get documents back.</p><p>I want the Minister for Health to come to the House.  The buck has to stop with him because he is the person in charge, although he likes to think and to tell the general public that he is not in charge at all, that he is only passing through and that he is a commentator.

However, we should not get over-dramatic about it.  We are aware of the failings of past Administrations but we do not want to go down that road.  I very much welcome the fund that has been set aside and that will be administered on behalf of the Government by the Irish Red Cross for businesses that have suffered in towns recognised to be at flood risk and which are unable to get flood risk insurance, which is very important.</p> <p>It was said that the OPW is not involved.  Of course, the OPW is involved; it is monitoring the situation and will continue to do so.  The matter is being attended to and dealt with.  I recognise that Senator MacSharry likes to be dramatic, coming as he does from the Sligo school of amateur dramatics.  Let us be calm and reflect on this matter.  It is being dealt with and, please God, it will be dealt with satisfactorily, or as satisfactorily as it can be dealt with.  We cannot totally drain the Shannon and we cannot redirect it.  I suppose there will be a further debate about siphoning off some of the water for the east, which will resurrect its head again.  These matters are being dealt with, so let the show go on without getting overly or falsely concerned.</p></speech>

We have all seen the footage of the floods, ruined homes and businesses and the Christmas plans that have been destroyed.  There have been four Atlantic storms this year.  However, there are two things that are predictable, severe weather and the pathetic response from Government.  Each time it happens, we get too little, by way of a response, and too late.  It seems to have come as a revelation to the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, that legislation prevents flood relief compensation to businesses and that only households may benefit.  This is a Government that prides itself on getting the economy going again and getting people back working.  How can it be jobs-friendly if businesses are allowed to suffer in this way?</p> <p>When this crisis happened last year, along with others, I called on the Government and the then Minister, Mr. Phil Hogan, to take concrete steps to mitigate the harmful effects of future storms.  The Government should have applied to the EU solidarity fund but it did not.  It should have aided small businesses with a Government subsidised insurance scheme where people are not able to get private sector cover but it did not bother to do that either.  The  Government has chosen to do nothing for small businesses impacted by flooding.  It is too little, too late to be talking about frustration with the situation on the eve of a general election.  People are rightly frustrated with the lack of emergency funding for individual home owners and a lack of financial cover for businesses.  Any further delay is inexcusable.  Like others, I have been driving in east Galway where the flooding has been extremely difficult and frustrating for people.  It is time the Government realised it is in government and did something about this.</p> <p>Many of us grew up enjoying the romanticised versions of private investigators' lives - I think of "Magnum PI" and others.  When we look at the reality of what private investigators get up to, however, it can be more sordid and grubby.  Senator Craughwell's amendment, which I want to second, calls on the Minister for Justice and Equality to come to the House to tell us what she knows and what she is going to do in regard to the necessary investigation of not just the activity of private investigators but also of officials in the Department of Social Protection.  This is an important issue.  It is yet another example, perhaps, of the creep that goes on where banks and officials of State collude to subtract from people's rights, in particular, the right to privacy and the privacy of their data.  I want to second Senator Craughwell's amendment.</p></speech>

I made a request yesterday that we would try to organise it late this week or early next week.  Obviously, communities are going through great hardship, with people throughout the country trying to get to work when roads are closed.  We need to give this very serious attention.</p> <p>I would reject some of the criticism that is being made of Government.  Investment has taken place in flood alleviation measures in recent years.  I would cite Ballinasloe as a case in point, given significant investment was made there since 2009 and it has worked to a significant extent.</p></speech>

We need an update on the CFRAM study which will be the blueprint for flood alleviation measures and investment into the future.  I would like a detailed debate on the progress of that study and what funding is likely to be put behind it.</p> <p>We cannot praise enough the local authority staff who are working flat out and the wonderful work being done by the Army in helping to protect homes.  The next 36 hours are going to be critical but I know everything that can be done is being done to make sure as many homes as possible are protected from flooding.</p> <p>It is a time for everybody to pull together and to leave aside party political squabbling on this issue.  I am very encouraged by the wonderful work being done in communities by people coming together with public representatives and local authority staff, with everybody trying to ensure that business gets back to as normal a position as possible in the lead-up to Christmas.</p> <p>I hope we will have a debate with the Minister of State, who can update us.

I second the amendment to the Order of Business which was moved by my colleague, Senator Mooney.  I support everything that my leader, Senator Darragh O'Brien, said on rule 68.  Educators should be entitled to protect their religious ethos.  I agree it is unacceptable that people cannot get places in schools but perhaps that is because the Government has not provided enough school places and it has very little to do with religion.</p> <p>I wholeheartedly support the comments of Senators Craughwell and Mullen on private investigators.  The issue has been raised for a number of years.  It was raised previously by Senator Michael D'Arcy, by the Leader and by me.  On one occasion I brought to the attention of the House a situation involving a young man who had paid 75% of a loan he had on a truck to provide employment for himself and a number of other colleagues.  He fell on hard times as a result of the recession and missed two payments.  While he was attending an interview to seek employment, thugs arrived at his house, intimidated his mother - an ill elderly lady - robbed his truck and sold it for a pittance.  That is the type of activity that was going on a number of years ago but, unfortunately, it continues to go on.  So-called reputable financial institutions - I hesitate to use the word "reputable" due to their history - continue to use such practices and they are getting away with it.  That is totally unacceptable.  We must have a debate on the issue.  I call on the Leader to facilitate a debate with the Minister for Justice and Equality.  She is due in the House on Friday and perhaps she could stay on for an extra few minutes and we could discuss this very serious situation.  It is well known that private investigators are going around snooping, as Senator Craughwell said, on private individuals and leaking information to media outlets in order to embarrass them.  It would be worth examining the situation to find out what the State-sponsored banks are paying such individuals.</p> <p>I welcome the fact that the Government has handed the &euro;5 million in emergency aid to the Irish Red Cross to distribute.  It is a most appropriate organisation for that purpose.  I hope the red tape will be cut out because the last time such a crisis occurred and financial aid was provided, 95% of people received nothing because of the hoops they had to jump through and the red tape they had to comply with.</p></speech>

This is a very pressing at the moment for none more so than people living in east Galway who have been subjected to such an unmitigated disaster in recent days with the flooding.  It is clear that families' lives are being destroyed along the Dunkellin river and the Aggard stream all because we are awaiting a decision on planning for flood relief works to be carried out on the rivers.  I visited Craughwell and Athenry in recent days and met with families affected by flooding.  I am dismayed at what they have gone through.  Pensioners had to be saved and transported from their homes by fire and rescue services, four wheel drives and buses.  It is the second time in six years that those people have been rendered homeless because of flooding.</p></speech>

We must focus on families who are going through extraordinary hardship at the moment and who will not be in their homes for Christmas because of environmental concerns.  They are all very well and good but when one sees big companies throughout this country, elsewhere in Europe and around the world, which use a carrot and stick approach to off-set their pollution distribution, why can we not have the same for people living along rivers and let environmental considerations take second place?  Not only would that help solve issues relating to flooding, it would also safeguard people's basic human right-----</p></speech>

We are talking about lives and lives must come first.  The Government must please wake up on the issue.  I would appreciate if the Leader could communicate the issue to the Minister for Health.</p><p>I agree with Senator Lorraine Higgins on the issue she raised.  The flooding is most serious in Craughwell, a little bit south of where I live.  It is in east Galway but the very same issues arose in Carnmore, Claregalway and Oranmore.  Why are we not flooded out now?  It is because we got the work done.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la time limits must be looked at in cases of flooding emergency.  People's homes are ruined.  They are out on the street.  The very special project of Thoor Ballylee in which I was involved, which reopened this year for the 150th anniversary of the birth of W. B. Yeats, has been flooded again.  We opened it on the basis that it could be flooded again but it is wrong that the Government does not look at cases of repeated flooding.  I am not being overly dramatic.</p><p>My final point today is about the &quot;RTE Investigates&quot; programme.  I completely agree that using public office for private gain is wrong; it is unlawful and it is a disgrace but some of the techniques used by RTE were also less than honourable.  I question practices such as offering confidentiality.  One does not guarantee confidentiality if one does not give it.  It showed the reporter, Nina, promising confidentiality.  That is wrong.  Neither did the programme offer balance.  The reason I know that is because I understand from <i>TheJournal.ie </i>that Councillor Tom McHugh from Tuam was on record as saying to the journalist that he would not take anything for private gain but that was not shown.  Why was that balance not given?  This was a disgraceful practice but it brings every politician's reputation into disrepute.  RTE has questions to answer about its practices.  Equally, what is good for the goose is good for the gander.  If that was an acceptable technique, when pro-life groups brought undercover proof to the floor of this House that the Irish Family Planning Association and other abortion agencies were recommending-----</p></speech>

This rule states that religious education is by far the most important part of the school curriculum.  Currently, children spend 30 minutes per day, or two and a half hours per week, on religious education, which is incredible when one compares it with some other core subjects.  Even physical education gets less than an hour per week.</p><p>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is currently reviewing the national school curriculum with recommendations to be published some time next year.  I call on the Minister to ensure that the time allocated to physical education is increased and that the manner in which it is delivered changed in line with the Points for Life initiative that was introduced in the Seanad and delivered in a pilot programme in 2013 and 2014 under the guidance of the Professional Development Service for Teachers.  It is not just me requesting this.  There are teachers, parents, coaches and many people in our community who unanimously agree that it should be done.  We all know about the value and importance of physical education in a child's development and overall well-being.  It is now time to do something about it and I believe this is the way we can go forward.  I call for a debate on this issue at some time in the near future.</p></speech>

This is most timely.  It is something we announced a number of weeks ago.  The "RTE Investigates" programme was only the tip of the iceberg.  Corruption is endemic in public life and includes more than just three county councillors.  It stretches to the heart of what we do.  We have seen it in the past in respect of various tribunals such as the Mahon and Moriarty tribunals and issues relating to land rezoning.  There could have been a tribunal for each local authority in the country.  If one scratches the surface in respect of many of the land banks that could no longer be financed by local government, were bought at a premium level during the boom years and are now under the Local Government Management Agency, which is essentially a NAMA for local government, and if one saw the deals that were done in acquiring those sites one would draw some very interesting conclusions.  From issues relating to Anglo Irish Bank, which has become IBRC, to the sale of Siteserv and NAMA properties, one can see that it is rotten.  Some parties are decrying it when they have been complicit in it for many years.  Some of the more newer Members of Leinster House have been giving out about corruption.  Parties that cover up other areas like child abuse and sex offences cannot have any credibility when it comes to issues relating to corruption.</p></speech>

I call on Government Deputies and I call on my Senatorial colleagues to call on Government Deputies to support this motion to establish an anti-corruption agency.  It is essential if we are to restore confidence in Irish public life.  It is very timely measure and one that the public demands from politicians.</p></speech>

Most of the contributions on the Order of Business this morning concerned flooding.  I have a comprehensive document on flooding that I can read out to the House but I have no intention of doing so this morning.  In the other House, the Minister of State gave a comprehensive reply to a Topical Issue debate on the issue yesterday and I suggest that Members read it.  However, as so many people have asked for a debate, the Minister of State will be attending the House for two and a quarter hours to deal with the Finance Bill 2015 so I suggest that with the consent of the House, we give 15 minutes at the end of that debate to the Minister of State to make a statement on the question of flooding, what is going on, what has happened and what is about to happen.  This way, I am trying to facilitate the House.</p></speech>

I am doing my best to facilitate the House.  I do not propose to address the question of flooding, which so many Members have raised.  We will leave it for the Minister of State.</p> <p>Senators Ivana Bacik, Darragh O'Brien, C&aacute;it Keane, Eamonn Coghlan and M&aacute;ir&iacute;a Cahill spoke about Rule 68.  I hope we would have a debate on that matter early in the new year.  Certainly, respect must at all times be given to people's religious beliefs.  Everybody would go along with that.  The ability of people to have a religious belief and send their children to the schools they wish to send them to is sacrosanct.  In respect of repealing Rule 68 and all the other matters, the Minister for Education and Skills stated last night that she intends to do it some time in January so we might have an opportunity to discuss that matter and other educational matters in January when we come back.  </p> <p>Senators Darragh O'Brien, Fidelma Healy Eames and Colm Burke spoke about the new drug for cystic fibrosis sufferers.  I will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister for Health.  I do not know whether the Senator raised the issue as a Commencement Matter.  If he did not do so, I suggest that he raises it as a Commencement Matter and gets a full reply on the matter from the Minister.  One of the good things about this House is that we can call in a Minister to deal with a Commencement Matter, so if a Senator is not getting a reply from the Minister, I suggest he raises it as a Commencement Matter.  </p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh spoke about staffing in local authorities to deal with the HAP scheme, housing and Traveller accommodation.  I agree with him that if Galway County Council said it applied for funding for Traveller accommodation and could not get it, it should be investigated as a matter of urgency because we have been told that money is available for Traveller accommodation.  There is no question that there is more than sufficient money available for local authorities who wish to draw down funding for housing.  </p> <p>Senator Kelly spoke about companies dealing with flood relief in his constituency.  Again, this may be a matter for the Minister of State to deal with.  Senator Colm Burke spoke about accommodation for homeless people in Cork city and county and asked that some properties that are not in State ownership be funded.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maurice Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2003"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2003&amp;amp;pid=MauriceCummins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is a matter for the local authorities and the agency which owns these properties but I am sure that if they applied to Government for funding, it would be seriously considered by Government.</p><p>Senator Quinn called for a debate on a report compiled by the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, entitled Low Pay, Decent Work and a Living Wage.  I agree with him that we should debate the document in this House.  The Minister is due come to the House when we resume in the new year to discuss innovation and research, another area on which we had statements recently, and Government policy.  I hope he will discuss both issues.  Senator Keane called for a debate on the Growing Up in Ireland survey.  We will try to facilitate her request but it will not be before the end of next week.</p><p>Senators Craughwell, Mullen and Wilson mentioned the appalling way private investigation companies treat people.  The Minister for Justice and Equality was here practically all of last week and she will be here this week and next week.  If Senators want her to come to the House to debate private investigation companies, I suggest a Commencement Matter would enable them to get answers from the Minister.</p></speech>

The system whereby USC becomes payable on every cent earned once the person goes over the limit is quite unusual in the Irish tax code.  Usually an exemption is an exemption, as it is in the case of exemption from PAYE.  When people go over the exemption limit, has consideration been given to just applying the tax to the amount by which they exceed the limit rather than to the very first cent of money that they earn?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-12-09a.219" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1106" speakername="Simon Harris" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015120900002#R00800"><p>The Senator highlights a real difficulty with the USC.  It is a very crude instrument of taxation which is why we are committed to removing the burden of USC from hundreds of thousands of people and reducing all the rates of USC in this Finance Bill.  Ultimately, we are also committed to the abolition of the USC.  The priority of the Government and Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan is to abolish the USC over time.  His preference at the moment with the limited fiscal space available to him is to reduce the various rates.  The Bill provides for an increase in the entry point to USC from &euro;12,012 to &euro;13,000 from 1 January 2016.  It is estimated that over 700,000 income earners will not be liable for any USC at all in 2016.  The entry point to the USC was &euro;4,004 when we came to Government and this will be the third occasion on which Deputy Noonan will have increased the entry point.</p> <p>The number of income earners exempt from the USC is affected by the condition of the economy because as the economy continues to improve, more people will be earning more than the entry point to the USC.  The increase in the minimum wage from &euro;8.65 to &euro;9.15 per hour will increase the hourly income of minimum wage workers by over 5.7%.  It is preferable for an individual to pay some USC and have a higher net income than to be exempt from the USC and have a lower net income.  The changes announced in the budget will mean that all income earners who pay the USC will see a significant reduction in their USC bill from 2016 for the same level of income.</p> <p>I take the broader point that Senator Barrett is making but it is the policy preference of the Minister, Deputy Noonan, to work towards the abolition of the USC.  He is targeting the fiscal space available to him with that very aim of taking more people out of USC and reducing the three rates so we can have a tax system post-USC within a matter of years.</p></speech>

In the literature, that is called a poverty trap.  If somebody gets an income over that limit and then all the earlier income is taken into the tax net, it gives a very high marginal tax rate which should be avoided.  I agree with the Minister of State's emphasis in his response.</p></speech>

The Minister shall, within one month of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann a report on options available for removing the USC liability for all workers earning less than &euro;19,572 a year.&rdquo;.</blockquote> <p>The Minister of State mentioned that the Minister's commitment is to abolish USC over time.  We can only make recommendations here.  The purpose of this recommendation is to reduce taxation on low income earners who earn less than &euro;19,752 a year.  We came to that figure by way of our own proposal to raise the minimum wage by &euro;1.50.  At that level, we believe it would be at the threshold of a normal week's work for a worker.  We feel that the &euro;13,000 figure that the Minister has selected falls too short.  Those on minimum wage in the State are hit hardest with regard to the challenges of rent, education costs and the different expenditures that people have in terms of day to day living.  We believe there is a necessity to move towards a living wage and we seek to ensure that there is space available for people to be able to live on that wage.  Taking anyone earning less than &euro;19,572 a year out of USC would allow for that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-12-09a.226" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1106" speakername="Simon Harris" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015120900002#R01500"><p>I thank Senator O'Reilly for her recommendation.  It would appear from the wording of the proposed recommendation that it is the Senator's intention that all those earning up to &euro;376 per week, just over the earnings of a full-time worker on the new minimum wage of approximately &euro;357 per week, should be exempted from the charge to USC entirely.  It is unclear whether the Senator also intends that this recommendation would consider all income earners with income of less than &euro;19,572, rather than just workers.  I do not think that is what the Senator is trying to do but it is a little vague in that regard.  Such a group would also include pensioners and people with income from their investments.</p> <p>The Senator will be aware that the budget contained a number of measures specifically targeted at supporting those on lower incomes.  With regard to USC, the changes proposed to the Finance Bill include the extension of an exemption threshold to &euro;13,000 per annum.  This measure alone removes an estimated 40,000 low-income earners from liability to the charge entirely.  It is now estimated that over 700,000 individuals - 29% of all income earners - will not be liable to USC from 2016.  In addition to this, as a result of a reduction of the two lower rates of USC and the extension of the ceiling for the second rate of USC from &euro;17,576 to &euro;18,668, all those earning the increased minimum wage with an average working week of 39 hours will remain liable to the two lower rates of USC, notwithstanding the increase in their gross income.  Senators may also be aware of the new PRSI credit which was introduced in the budget in order to address the PRSI step effect, which otherwise would have negatively impacted on workers on the increased minimum wage.  This is a further measure aimed at supporting those on lower incomes, by smoothing entry into the PRSI system.</p> <p>With regard to the proposal from the Sinn F&eacute;in Senators who would like a report prepared on options to increase the USC exemption threshold to &euro;19,572, it should be noted that this would increase the entry point above the current entry point to income tax, which stands at &euro;16,500 per annum for a single employee.  As a result, such an individual would pay no tax, no USC, and would have a minimal liability to PRSI.  To do this would seriously undermine the original rationale for the introduction of the USC, so we need to look at it in the context of how one phases out the USC in a fair manner.  In addition, the USC was intended to ensure that for as long as it lasts most individuals would make some contribution towards the provision of services and towards assisting in restoring the public finances.  The removal of individuals earning up to &euro;19,572 would obviously not achieve this.  </p> <p>When the Government considers options for a budgetary tax package, it must take account of all the parts of the package and therefore single measures could not be contemplated in isolation.  Taking these factors into account, the Minister is not minded to expend resources of the Department on the production of the report requested by the Senator, and therefore cannot accept the recommendation.  On the issue of a living wage and how we ensure people earn a decent wage, there will obviously be different policy proposals from all parties on that.  I fear that increasing the minimum wage by the rate that Sinn F&eacute;in proposes would have the unintended consequence of stalling job creation.  We can debate that issue at another time.  </p></speech>

It has been made in this and the other House on numerous occasions and we are all very familiar with the arguments for and against it.  The Minister of State knows what I will say and I know what he will say but God loves a trier.  At the heart of the recommendation that a report be produced on options to introduce a third rate of tax, payable at 47% on income over &euro;100,000, is the question of how to have an income tax rate that would allow people work to hard and take home more money that would allow them to live comfortably, while contributing more.  It would put a brake on the growth of the income chasm between the and poor that we discussed on Second Stage.  We need to ask ourselves how this could be done in a way that would not penalise people on middle incomes and who might be squeezed.  On every &euro;1 over &euro;100,000 we suggest an extra 7 cent should go into the State's finances which would have the effect of creating a more equal society, putting a brake on the growing disparity in incomes and bringing hundreds of millions of euro into the State&rsquo;s finances to address some of the problems being experienced by those in the lowest third of the population&rsquo;s earners.</p><p>On Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il my colleague, Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, related this to the concept of price elasticity saying there was not necessarily a linear relationship between tax or price and behaviour.  He said if people were asked if they would be happy to pay a little more tax in order to have a health service in which patients would not wait on trolleys, 90 year olds would not have to wait days and children would not be forced to take painkillers for tooth pain because they had been waiting months for dental surgery, most would say they would be willing to pay a little extra if necessary and if they could afford it.  This recommendation proposes that those on high incomes could contribute 7 cent more.</p></speech>

I do not buy into the logic that if taxation was increased on something, it would yield more.  While accepting that everyone has to pay his or her fair share and that the system has to be progressive, there is significant evidence to suggest that if we want more of something, we should tax it less.  If we want more jobs and productivity in the economy, we should not hike up taxes, particularly when living on an island with two jurisdictions.  If the Senator is in favour of a united Ireland and having an all-Ireland economy, having two very different marginal tax rates, whereby somebody in Northern Ireland pays a much lower rate than somebody in the Republic, would not be good for investment in the Republic and would not make much sense in the promotion of an all-Ireland economy.  It is important to note that the top 1% of income earners pay 22% of the total income tax and universal social charge take.  That is up from 21% last year and 19% the year before that.  I am absolutely in favour, as is everyone in this House, of progressivity and people paying their fair share, but we need to ensure there are no unintended consequences.</p> <p>The basis for the recommendation is having a report laid before the D&aacute;il on the options for introducing a third rate of income tax of 47% on individuals&rsquo; income in excess of &euro;100,000.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment is not to increase top marginal tax rates.  A third rate of tax of 47% would increase the top rate of tax by seven percentage points.  It would also have the effect of increasing the top marginal tax rate to 59% for employees and 62% for the self-employed.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, discussed this proposal at length with Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.  He expressed his concerns, supported by research from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, that tax rates at such levels would be anti-competitive and could drive skilled workers out of the country at a time when we needed to battle to attract skilled workers and talents into the country and to stay here.  His view is that this recommendation would damage rather than support the economy.  Marginal tax rates influence individuals&rsquo; decision to work more or work at all.  Higher marginal tax rates for earners might also incentivise a greater level of tax evasion and contribute further to the development of a shadow economy.  As the Minister stated in his Budget Statement, it is his desire to have every worker progressively moving to a point where the marginal tax rate will not be more than 50% for all workers.  We think this would make Ireland more attractive for mobile foreign investment and skills, including for returning emigrants and attracting and keeping skills in the country.</p></speech>

In recognition of the importance of Ireland&rsquo;s film industry to the cultural economy he announced an increase in the cap on eligible expenditure to &euro;70 million in the budget.  This arose from a proposal within the Government from the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  The Minister&rsquo;s aim in doing this, based on his advice from that Department, is to try to attract higher budget films to Ireland.  He does very much intend to monitor the measure closely to ensure it has the intended effect.  The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht had indicated that the current cap made the scheme less attractive to big budget films and that a sizeable increase was needed to encourage film studios to invest in increased studio capacity.  I recently visited several film studios in my constituency and this issue came up, that they needed to attract more big budget films.  We are trying this on the advice of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, but the Minister for Finance will monitor it to make sure it has the intended effect of attracting more film productions and an expansion of film studios.</p></speech>

In such a scenario, the Commission could have requested the suspension of the scheme in its entirety and launched a full investigation regarding its compatibility with the internal market rules.</p><p>In allowing for state aid for risk finance investments, the Commission has moved away from qualification criteria based on whether an enterprise is in seed, start-up or expansion phase and has now set new criteria on the type of companies that can qualify.  These new European rules stipulate that a qualifying company must not have been operating in any market; have been operating in any market for less than seven years following their first commercial sale; or require an initial risk finance investment which, based on a business plan prepared in view of entering a new product or geographical market, is higher than 50 % of their average annual turnover in the preceding five years.  That is how we arrived at that.</p><p>In addition, regarding follow-on investments, the following three criteria must all be met: the lifetime limit of &euro;15 million is not exceeded; the possibility of follow-on investments was foreseen in the original business plan; and the company has not become linked with another company such that it would no longer be an SME.  The revised guidelines from the Commission take account of the fact that SMEs may face difficulties in gaining access to finance, particularly in the early stages of their development.  The Commission notes that business finance markets may fail to provide the necessary equity or debt finance to newly created and potentially high growth SMEs resulting in a persistent capital market failure, which negatively affects SMEs growth prospects.</p><p>The Commission, therefore, made the changes to the qualifying company criteria in recognition that newer SMEs find it more difficult to raise funding via traditional routes. Such companies typically create more employment than companies that have been operating for longer periods and this furthermore justifies the targeting of the relief.  Regardless of whether I agree with the recommendation, the hands of the Government are tied in this regard.  We need to make sure an investment scheme put in place to support start-ups and SMEs is compliant with EU rules.  If it is not compliant, we risk jeopardising the scheme.  The Commission had been monitoring this and its view is clear to the Department.</p><p>We published the detail of the changes in the financial resolution on budget day.  I am sorry I cannot accept the recommendation but that is the rationale behind it.</p></speech>

He stated the new EU rules or guidelines were recently introduced but I wonder when that was.  With regard to their transposition, were they rules or guidelines?  The Minister of State mentioned both words.  Were they transposed into Irish law by way of statutory instrument or was a report submitted?  How was it assessed by the Minister?  Were they referred, for example, to the Joint Committee on European Affairs, the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation or the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform?  Has there been legislative scrutiny of these changes?  Could the Minister of State provide detail on that?</p></speech>

My understanding is that these guidelines are from 2014.  The Commission has made it clear Ireland needs to make sure it is in compliance with them and we do not want to jeopardise the scheme.  I also understand that the action needed to be taken by the Minister requires reference in tax law to the existence of the guidelines and, therefore, the Minister did not need to sign a statutory instrument.</p> <p>I am not aware of a discussion by an Oireachtas committee.  I do not have that knowledge.</p></speech>

While I do not question the fact that the issue was raised by the Commission and it has sent guidelines to the Department, in legal effect guidelines are guidelines.  They do not derive from an EU directive.  Who made the decision in the Department?  I acknowledge that this is a niche issue, which will not affect a vast number of people overnight.  It appears there has been no scrutiny of this and if had not been brought to the attention of Senator Quinn, myself and a few others by an Irish company, we would not have known about it.   Perhaps that is also down to us.  More than 80% of our laws emanate from Europe and the scrutiny of EU legislation and directives is a broader issue.  What is the difference between a Commission guideline and a directive, and what we must do in respect of each?  Must the Government follow a guideline?</p></speech>

While a directive is something Ireland, along with every other member state, commits to transpose and implement in various ways through our national parliaments, we do not have to implement a guideline, but if we want Commission officials to approve our scheme from a state aid point of view, we have to be in compliance with the rules.  This did not need to be transposed into domestic law in the sense that it did not require a statutory instrument, legislative change or even pre-legislative scrutiny.  This is the Commission saying it is the policeman on state aid and if we want our scheme approved, we need to be in compliance with state aid rules.  It is the approving body and these are its guidelines.  That is the difference.</p> <p>The Commission has raised the importance of being in compliance a number of times and the Minister and the Department have left it as late as possible to bring in these further restrictions to ensure we are in compliance but we have to do it now or we run the risk of jeopardising the entire scheme.</p></speech>

If that is fair enough, I would like to read it.  At least I have clarity now on where this has come from.  If we had no choice but to do this, I understand that.  The Minister does not want to jeopardise the scheme on the basis of not following a guideline but, again, there is the distinction between a guideline and a directive.  I will withdraw the recommendation and table it again on Report Stage.</p></speech>

However, this also misses out on public transparency.  It is interesting that the public is not allowed to know what is happening.  In England, for example, when it was discovered that large multinationals operating there were paying low corporation tax rates, the public became annoyed and political pressure on those companies began to increase.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Kathryn Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2355"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2355&amp;amp;pid=KathrynReilly&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->These organisations then began to consider the necessity of maintaining good public relations with customers and of therefore stepping up to the plate in respect of a better corporation tax regime.</p><p>All Members are aware that society is a powerful leverage with regard to tax justice.  If the information is not made public, consumers are not making full decisions on the justice behind the behaviour of those companies and it is not good for the public not to have such power and knowledge.  Although we live in an information society, the information is largely withheld and that neutralises citizens' ability to effect change on these companies.  As such public transparency is important, I ask the Minister of State his opinion as to whether he considers it right there should be transparent public knowledge on country-by-country reporting.  Does the Minister of State think it is important that people are not kept in the dark with regard to their expenditure and the tax justice behind that?</p></speech>

However, I also greatly respect taxpayer confidentiality.  Where should one draw the line?  Do people want to see the Senator's tax affairs or my tax affairs?  While it is important that the Revenue authorities should see them, they are confidential, are independent and are held in high regard by the public.</p> <p>While understanding the rationale behind the Senator's recommendation, the main reason I am not in a position to accept it is the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process is a highly-positive step forward in that our tax authority, and indeed every other tax authority signed up to the OECD BEPS process, will be able to receive this country-by-country reporting.  That means not only will the Revenue Commissioners in Ireland know about the level of tax paid by certain companies here, they also will know about the level of tax paid in other OECD countries.  This can only be a good thing in respect of tackling aggressive tax planning, tax evasion and various other concerns that are shared by Senators on all sides of the House.</p> <p>I acknowledge this is an issue Senator Barrett raised in the Chamber yesterday.  However, were we to do anything that goes further than the OECD BEPS process, we would be giving a reason, an excuse or a way out to other countries not to share that information with our tax authority.  In other words, the agreement on the BEPS process is there will be country-by-country reporting and tax authorities will share the information.  The agreement is, however, that such information remains confidential to tax authorities.  What I do not wish to do, I respectfully suggest the Senator does not want me to do it either, is to undertake to do anything that would jeopardise receiving additional information which the Revenue Commissioners do not possess today but will have as a result of the OECD BEPS process.</p> <p>That said and in fairness to the issue raised by the Senator, it is a matter the European Commission is examining separately.  The Commission is examining the issue of public country-by-country reporting.  This would require companies themselves to make publicly available information about their operations, activities and profits in each country in which they operate.  As I am sure the Senator is aware, the Commission recently held a public consultation on the issue and has now commissioned an impact assessment.  The Government awaits the outcome of its impact assessment, which I consider to be the prudent thing to do.</p> <p>One must ascertain the impact of any of these measures on jobs and investment but in any event, the Government will continue to engage actively in the debate on this issue at a European Union level while proceeding, through this Bill, with the introduction of country-by-country reporting to tax authorities, as agreed at the OECD as part of the BEPS process.  In general, I believe that on this issue and all international tax issues, it is important to have a kind of global consistent approach.  This is what has been agreed in respect of country-by-country reporting.  It is a significant step forward and will provide a lot more information to our tax authority and many others.  However, the Government cannot take the next step the Senator proposes it should take for the reasons I have outlined.</p></speech>

The basis for many of the changes is that Ireland has been regarded as an outlier in respect of corporation tax, which some people state has cost us dearly in respect of the amount of tax we should have been receiving for many years.  While the changes that have been made are welcome, as is country-by-country reporting, when people such as the Trinity College academic Professor Jim Stewart, using information from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, estimates the effective corporate tax rate paid by foreign firms is 2.2%, the damage caused by this shocks to the bone and affects people's human experiences.</p><p>I acknowledge the Minister of State has observed that a change from the agreed negotiated position would reduce the ability of that to function properly.  While there is logic to that position, it would be important in this regard that public information be given and for this report on the effective rates of corporation tax to be provided.  Some people would contest the figures that have been put forward.  I believe the Minister previously has used a figure of 10.7% as being the effective rate but Members of the other House have contested some of the figures there.  The introduction to some of the papers set out a broad spectrum of different effective rates, depending on how someone chooses to calculate it.  However, it would be important to have a report on the effective rates of corporation tax, which would go a long way towards that issue of transparency.  It is a highly topical issue that has been raised within recent months in particular.</p></speech>

There are many valid reasons the rate might be lower than the standard rate.  This probably will be my only opportunity to make this point but in respect of the &euro;2.47 billion in additional tax revenues up to the end of October, I note that more than 80% of it was made up of corporation tax receipts.  While this is certainly welcome, I read further in details published in <i>The Sunday Times</i>last Sunday that ten of Ireland's largest foreign direct investment, FDI, companies are responsible for approximately 80% of the corporation tax revenue.</p><p>I need not tell the Minister of State that previously, there was an over-reliance on one-off taxes.  While these are not one-off taxes, the Department of Finance must pay close attention to over-reliance on certain multinational companies that are located in Ireland.  These companies are transient and if someone else offers them something better, they will consider it and will move.  I believe what is being done disproportionately, in this year in particular by way of the budget, the Finance Bill and the way in which money is being spent pre-election, is the use of a sizeable chunk of corporation tax receipts, which depend mainly on ten large companies.</p><p>We must be extremely careful in this regard and that is why there must be careful consideration of reporting, not necessarily on the effective rates of corporation tax, but the quarterly reports will come from Revenue and the Department.  I will conclude on this point but I simply ask the Department to give careful consideration to the top ten corporation taxpayers in this country, to how secure they are within this country and, therefore, how secure is that tax revenue into the future.  When the State is dependent on such a small number of companies for such a disproportionately large amount of its corporation tax receipts, it is at risk to the possibility of any of them moving, which then would change everything.</p></speech>

The concern I expressed on the last day in respect of section 35 is that it is a subsidy to ex-entrepreneurs.  Should there be some constraints that the money is reinvested in qualifying assets, not in property or other uses?  Otherwise, it is a subsidy to people to get out of what all Members seek to promote, namely, entrepreneurship, new products and additional employment.  Should constraints be placed on people qualifying for the 20% rate as to how the funds are used?  While the aspiration was that one would sell one's first business to reinvest in subsequent businesses, as that is how entrepreneurs are formed and they get better each time, supposing they simply buy property?</p></speech>

First, I always get nervous, I am sure it is not intended, when recommendations or amendments are tabled that appear to suggest the reason every multinational company is locating in Ireland is to do with corporation tax.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Harris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2338"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That does this country a disservice.  I am not suggesting Senator Reilly is but there are many reasons why companies make a decision to locate in Ireland, and taxation is one of them of course.  The personal tax levels are also a reason and something we will debate in the coming months.  Corporation tax is definitely one.  We define the reasons as the three Rs; rate, reputation and regime.  The rate matters.  I am not referring to a party political regime the Senator will be glad to know-----</p></speech>

Let us also remember the reputation we have in the delivery of excellence across a range of companies.  We have talent, a track record and tax which is three Ts.  Companies decide to locate here for lots of different reasons and while tax is an important one, it is only one reason.</p> <p>There are many figures bandied about regarding the effective rate of corporation tax.  Senator Reilly made reference to the United States BEA data but we do not accept this as valid in the Irish context because thee basic issue is that US data on the profits of subsidiaries of US companies are generally reported by reference to the place of incorporation of those subsidiaries, not by the place of tax residence of those subsidiaries.  For that reason the US data often overstates the profit made in Ireland by subsidiaries of US companies because significant profits arise to Irish registered companies which are tax resident elsewhere.  Therefore, I do not accept it is as clear cut as that.</p> <p>There has been reporting on this.  The Oireachtas finance sub-committee undertook quite a significant body of work on this topic.  In April 2014 the Department of Finance published a technical paper on the effective rates of corporation tax in Ireland.  The paper was jointly written by the Department of Finance and the well regarded economist, Professor Seamus Coffey of University College Cork, to ensure the work was as objective as possible.  It was published in line with the budget around that time and contained a comprehensive analysis of the effective rates of corporation tax.  It was prepared to provide clarity about the seemingly conflicting figures that are frequently quoted.  It is fair to say that it is an objective and excellent resource for those who seek to understand this complex and technical issue.  </p> <p>Over the past few years there has been a great deal of discussion about the effective rate of corporation tax.  Much of this discussion has been confusing and unclear because, as Senator O'Brien has said, there are many reasons for different rates.  It is important to note that there is no single measure of effective corporate tax rates which can claim to be the best or the most accurate - different measures are relevant depending on the task at hand.  The paper examined three different methodologies used in the calculation of effective rates of corporation tax generally.  The paper also analysed eight different figures which are quoted in great detail regarding Ireland.  Two of the rates often quoted are the EUROSTAT implicit tax rate of approximately 6% and the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, BEA, data of 2.2%.  However, this paper by Mr. Coffey and the Department of Finance concluded that neither of these rates were adjudged to be the most appropriate rate of effective corporation tax.  The EUROSTAT rate is based on national accounts which do not correspond to the actual or legal tax base in computing tax liabilities.  This methodology can therefore skew the effective rate and I have already outlined the difficulties with using the BEA rate.</p> <p>In attempting to assess the effective corporate tax rate applying to the total profits earned by companies in Ireland, the paper concluded that the approach based on the national aggregate statistics from the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Statistics Office is the most suitable.  The paper found that the effective rates of corporation tax as measured according to statistics from these two sources are reasonably close to the headline rate of 12.5% and that the difference is mainly accounted for by double taxation relief and a small number of other reliefs, including the research and development tax credit.</p> <p>The paper was based upon the analysis of effective rates across a ten-year period and therefore I do not believe there is a need to be re-examined it on an annual basis.  It was only published in 2014.  On the basis of this extensive analysis, we are comfortable that companies in Ireland are paying the appropriate rate of corporate tax on profits generated by those companies in Ireland.  Given that a detailed report has previously been prepared by my Department and discussed at length by the Oireachtas finance committee, I do not believe there is a need to allocate scarce resources to conducting another report at this time.</p> <p>With regard to the important issue of corporation tax raised by Senator O'Brien, he is correct that it needs to be monitored closely.  After all that this State has been through it is important that we continue to very carefully monitor very the Exchequer figures, where tax is rising and where revenues are ahead of profile.  The performance of corporation tax receipts has been unexpectedly strong in 2015.  At the end of November, corporation tax receipts were &euro;2.3 billion, or just under 60% higher than expected, at &euro;6.4 billion, and up &euro;2.2 billion, or 52% in year-on-year terms.</p> <p>As the House may be aware corporation tax is highly concentrated in Ireland with approximately 80% of receipts received from the multinational sector.  In addition, the top ten tax paying groups accounted for over one third of total corporation tax receipts.  Revenue has advised that approximately 60% of the surplus against profile is from a small number of large multinational companies, hence the importance of continuing to attract multinationals and, importantly, it is primarily attributable to improving trading conditions.  For example, at the end of October 2015 there was an increase of over 20% in the number of companies paying between &euro;100,000 and &euro;5 million compared with the same period last year.  This was reflected in the receipts which are also up by over 20% for this cohort of companies.</p> <p>Based on the information collected by the Revenue Commissioners, it would appear the vast majority, with the exception of around &euro;300 million, of the increase in corporation tax payments are not one-off - they are not windfall taxes.  They will enter the Revenue tax base for 2016 and beyond.  Importantly, the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners wrote this letter on 20 November to the Minister of Finance which the Minister published on the Department of Finance website outlining that about &euro;300 million might be exceptional payments but the remainder is expected to be part of our tax base for 2016 and beyond.</p> <p>I will conclude by saying that while corporation tax receipts are running significantly ahead of profile, it is also important to note that VAT is ahead of profile with almost &euro;1 billion extra collected this year than last year which can only be due to people spending more money in the real economy.  Income tax is ahead of profile also.  There are a number of areas ahead of profile.  That is the rationale behind the corporation tax.</p></speech>

In the section the qualifying business refers to activities such as development land and the letting of land and so on.  However, are there sufficient protections as to where the money goes after the business is sold?  Does it go back into a productive activity?  That is my concern.</p> <p>Of course we want entrepreneurship, products, employment and all of those but are there protections that this money will not be spent on property?  This was a concern of the Minister's when we discussed the Strategic Banking Corporation - that it would not lend money for property purchase.  That is what got the State into trouble before and is not something we want at this stage.  Is there protection if the money was to be spent on something which was less dangerous to the economy; if someone was to take up gambling or bought a deck chair and pipe and slippers and exhibited no further entrepreneurship ever, why would we give someone an incentive to do that?</p></speech>

The relief will not apply to disposals of chargeable business assets by companies or to disposals of development land - which I know is an issue raised by Senators in this House - or to a business dealing in or developing land, or to a business consisting of letting land or building or holding investments.</p> <p>Where a qualifying business is carried on by a private company, individuals seeking to qualify for the relief must own not less than 5% of the shares in the company or at least 5% of the shares in a holding company whose business consists wholly, or mainly, of holding shares in its 51% of subsidiaries, and those subsidiaries are wholly, or mainly, carrying out the qualifying business.</p> <p>The shareholder must also have been a working director or an employee of a qualifying business company or group of companies for a continuous period of three years within the five-year period immediately prior to the disposal of the chargeable business assets.  This entrepreneurship provision in the Bill is obviously replacing an earlier provision which only allowed relief on a second disposal.  It was also subject to considerable restrictions and, it is fair to say from our engagement with entrepreneurs and the business community, was seen to be ineffective.</p> <p>This new provision allows relief so entrepreneurs can invest in a new venture.  While there may be some who do not re-invest their gains, this is not considered in our view to be a significant issue for people who are clearly serial entrepreneurs.</p></speech>

I will probably table a recommendation on Report Stage to try to address this issue.</p> <p>A number of education facilities, particularly conference and retreat centres, that provide accommodation on a bed and breakfast basis, have been recently informed by Revenue that should revenues from their bed and breakfast activity exceed &euro;37,000 per annum all other revenue above that threshold, in respect of other activities at the centres, will be subject to VAT.  I thought that advice to be very strange.  I am speaking in this regard of retreat centres that hold weekend activities, in respect of which they provide accommodation on a bed and breakfast basis, whose income on that basis would exceed &euro;37,000 per annum.  I would have thought that once the threshold of &euro;37,000 was exceeded only the bed and breakfast activity would become subject to VAT.  According to the tax advice they have received, which could be wrong, once the &euro;37,000 per annum threshold is exceeded all of the activities, including conference and educational fees, are subject to VAT.  I accept the Minister of State may not be in a position to respond to my query today.</p></speech>

Most of us would be of the view that this is still too low.  I am not presuming that the threshold can be raised overnight to an appropriate level but the Minister of State will be aware that in the context of the sale of a standard family home and the dispersal of a will, the sale price would be well in excess of the set amount.  We believe that it is unfair on families to have to pay further tax, particularly when account is taken of the fact that payments on the house will in all cases have been made from net income.  </p><p>I am proposing in this recommendation that the Government go a little further and in this regard substitute &quot;&euro;280,000&quot; with &euro;300,000&quot;.  I do not think I need to say any more than that on this issue.</p></speech>

These changes were necessary to maintain the yield from capital taxes in a period of falling asset prices so that such taxes would continue to make a contribution to our efforts to consolidate our public finances.  As part of budget 2016, the Group A threshold applying to gifts and inheritance from parents to their children was raised from &euro;225,000 to &euro;280,000.  This represents an increase of approximately 25%.  This was done in recognition of the improving state of the national finances and in light of concerns expressed to the Minister by people making and receiving gifts and inheritance, particularly in the context of a rising property price market. </p> <p>In allocating limited resources for the budget choices had to be made.  If the Minister went further in this regard he would have had to do something less elsewhere.  As the economic recovery continues to take hold, available resources have been focused on reducing the burden of taxation on earned income and take home pay, where high taxes impact on our competitiveness and economic growth and job creation.  This was also the main focus of the last budget.  The Minister has indicated that the change to the Group A tax-free threshold in this year's budget is only the start of a process.  Subject to the outcome of the forthcoming general election and the consultation one must have with the people in that regard, this is an issue on which the Minister, if he is in a position to deliver another budget - which I hope will be the case - is willing to go further.  The Minister will continue to examine the scope for further improvements in line with that suggested by the Senator as our economic recovery continues.  There is a recognition among all of us that this is an area in respect of which more needs to be done.  That process was commenced this year.  The Minister has gone as far as he could and, therefore, I cannot accept this recommendation.</p></speech>

To put it to bed, it is important that a comprehensive analysis of the impact of the budget be made after it is announced.  This would go some way towards showing the full distributional impact.  If the Department does not want to accept the ESRI's analysis, it would at least then have the responsibility of publishing its own, one it could stand over.  </p><p>Equality budgeting is an internationally accepted method of dealing with inequality and poverty that is used in a number of countries.  We are not asking the Minister of State to introduce a new dawn.  There is this process which is used in other countries.  Therefore, we are not asking the Department to do anything other than to use a process that has been tried and tested.  One of the biggest benefits of adopting it would be that the Minister of State would not have to listen to me or my party colleagues bellyaching in the wake of a budget because he would be able to point out that equality budgeting objectives had been met.  This should allay fears of having to listen to me or Deputies Pearse Doherty and Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.  Perhaps, therefore, the Minister of State might look at this recommendation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-12-09a.302" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1139" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015120900002#Y00200"><p>Taca&iacute;onn mise agus mo ph&aacute;irt&iacute; leis an moladh seo freisin.  I agree with Senator Kathryn Reilly on this recommendation.  Fianna F&aacute;il submitted an identical recommendation which is included in this proposal which makes sense.  Not to repeat what Senator Kathryn Reilly said, promises were made previously about providing for transparency in the tax system.  The Fine Gael Deputy, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, championed it for a number of years, as did many other colleagues.  There is nothing to fear from it.  I believe it would make the tax system more palatable if people could see the effects of changes on different groups, as outlined in the recommendation.  Therefore, my party and I support it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-12-09a.303" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1106" speakername="Simon Harris" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015120900002#Y00300"><p>I would not want to do anything that would short circuit our exchanges on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill as it is an enjoyable experience.  The Senators will be aware that a similar amendment was proposed in the D&aacute;il and that it was the subject of significant debate on Committee and Report Stages.  During those debates both myself the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and I highlighted that a substantial amount of the analysis sought by the recommendation had already been published.  I brought a copy with me.  On 4 November the Department of Social Protection published a social impact assessment of the welfare and income tax measures included in budget 2016.  The social impact assessment was completed in consultation with the Department of Finance of the income tax elements of the budget and consistent with the Department's analysis of the impact of the budget package.</p> <p>Using the ESRI's tax welfare simulation model, SWITCH, the social impact assessment includes a breakdown of the impact of tax and welfare measures, respectively, as well as presenting the overall distributional impact of budget 2016 by income group and family type.  It also examines the impact of the budget on the at risk of poverty rate and work incentives, as well as the impact of the change in the minimum wage.  Expansion of the SWITCH model has also enabled the incorporation this year of investment in the early childhood care and education scheme into the social impact assessment.  The inclusion of the distributional impact by family type in the SWITCH model facilitates comparisons of the distributional impact of the budget on families with and without children, by employment or retirement status and for lone parents.  All of these comparisons are presented in the social impact assessment.</p> <p>At this time it is not possible to use the SWITCH model to assess the impact of budgets on groups of people based on their disability status, but that is something on which we should be working together.  As I have pointed out previously, there are significant efforts under way to further expand the capacity of this model.  This is evidenced by the work done in the modelling of medical cards and the early childhood care and education scheme.  For further information, the budget book also includes a range of material on distributional impact issues explaining the impact of the budget.  It includes a series of tables showing the impact of budgetary measures at a range of income levels for different income earners, a variety of illustrative cases providing examples of change in net income, for example, household types, the extent to which income is redistributed through the tax and welfare systems and the progressivity of the income tax system.</p> <p>That said, we have a SWITCH model which is delivering a social impact assessment.  It was published on 4 November.  We should be working to increase its capacity.  A number of new measures have been added to it this year, including the early childhood and education scheme.  This is the model we should continue to follow.  Therefore, I am not in a position to accept the recommendation.</p></speech>

At the outset, I join all Members of this and the Lower House in conveying my deepest sympathy to all those who have been affected by the flooding.  I have seen, at first hand, the devastating impact that flooding can have on people's lives and livelihoods and I want to assure all those affected that I, the Government and the Houses of the Oireachtas will do everything we can to assist people in getting their properties and lives back to normal again as soon as possible.</p> <p>Storm Desmond, which affected the entire country, but particularly the western seaboard and the River Shannon, was a severe weather event dominated by record high-intensity, short-duration rainfall, together with storm force gales.  The greatest impact from the storm was experienced along the western seaboard from Donegal to Cork.  Some parts experienced almost a month's worth of rainfall in 24 hours on the back on a November that was one and a half to two times as wet as November 2014.  The short-term impact of this extreme rainfall was predominantly pluvial flooding of roads, transport networks and hard surfaces in urban and paved areas.  As the road drainage and urban drainage systems became overwhelmed, the flooding extended to a fluvial event and affected properties in multiple urban centres of the north west, west and south, including, among others, places such as Ballybofey, Sligo, Crossmolina, Craughwell, Ballinasloe, Bandon, Skibbereen, Kenmare and Tralee.</p> <p>The national co-ordination group for severe weather, which is chaired by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, has been meeting on a daily basis since last Friday, initially to assess the forecast and the associated risks and later to deal with the aftermath of the storm.  The rising levels in the lower Shannon are a particular concern and the group has met twice today to ensure that it is kept fully informed of the evolving situation and can take whatever action is required in good time.  The Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, who has responsibility for the Office of Emergency Planning, and I will also be meeting the chairman of that group this afternoon.</p> <p>All relevant agencies are fully engaged in monitoring the situation on the Shannon and the relevant local authorities have emergency plans in place.  The Defence Forces, to whom I want to pay tribute, are assisting the local authorities where possible in mounting temporary flood defences and providing assistance to homeowners or helping to evacuate people.  Members of the Defence Forces are on the ground in Counties Limerick, Clare, Galway and Westmeath with the towns of Clonlara, Castleconnell, Ballinasloe and Athlone being of particular concern due to the rising waters.  I wish to inform all Senators that the Defence Forces are on standby and willing and ready to assist local authorities should they feel the need to request that assistance.</p> <p>The ESB is also monitoring the situation and, under its responsibility for operating water levels on the Shannon, has warned that it may have to increase flows from the Parteen Weir again.  This will have an impact on properties and towns downstream.  All local crisis management arrangements through local authorities were put in place last Thursday and the full services of Civil Defence and fire services as well as local authority staff were deployed at the weekend.  All local authorities were informed last Friday to activate their severe weather protocols.  I want to take this opportunity to extend my appreciation to all the emergency responders and volunteers in local communities who worked tirelessly over the weekend and commend them for their enormous efforts to deal with a very difficult situation.  We are hearing about the very difficult flooding situation and it is right and proper that our attention is on that.  However, I want to put on the record of this House the many potential incidences of flooding that were prevented or reduced owing to the hard work of our fire services, garda&iacute;, emergency services, mountain rescue people and volunteers all working together.  I have heard many heartening stories.  In Donegal, 97 Civil Defence volunteers were out working to help local communities, accompanied on occasion by the Northern Ireland fire service.  There has even been a cross-Border dimension in terms of assistance.  I want to pay tribute to them for their tireless work and enormous efforts, which are continuing.</p> <p>As I said in the D&aacute;il yesterday, the Government is fully aware of the problems of flooding and attaches huge priority to the need to find effective and workable solutions to the problem on a national basis.  In this regard the Government is starting the final part of its proactive planning programme to develop feasible flood risk management solutions for those 300 areas across the country at most significant risk from flooding.  Through the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme, the Office of Public Works has completed extensive and systematic hydraulic modelling and hydrological examination for each of these 300 areas, including 90 coastal locations, and has produced approximately 40,000 individual flood risk maps.  The OPW, informed by the draft maps, is currently and actively engaging with local communities towards developing feasible options for both structural flood defence schemes and non-structural solutions to address the known fluvial and tidal risks.  It is important to point out that CFRAM is not a report to sit on a shelf.  The CFRAM process is about making sure Ireland complies with the EU floods directive and, most importantly, that in the context of the 300 areas in the country that our experts have predicted are at risk of flooding, engineering solutions are identified and published by this time next year so that we can get on with the job of having a national flood plan for the first time.  I will get to funding in a moment.</p> <p>I want to assure Deputies that the following areas are being assessed by the CFRAM programme: Donegal town, Ballybofey-Stranorlar, Killygordan, Castlefinn, Lifford and Glenties in the north-western study; Charlestown, Swinford, Newport, Westport, Westport Quay, Castlebar, Ballina, Foxford, Oughterard and Clifden in the western study; Ballylongford, Moneycashen, Listowel, Banna, Abbeydorney, Tralee, Castleisland, Dingle, Milltown, Killarney, Glenflesk, Portmagee and Kenmare in the south-western study; and Castlerea, Ahascragh, Athleague, Ballinasloe and Portumna in the Shannon study.</p> <p>The flood risk management plans will include a prioritised list of feasible measures to address flood risk in an environmentally-sustainable and cost-effective manner.  Decisions on the best solution will be taken on an objective basis having regard to social and environmental factors as well as economic criteria.  That is the plan.  That is where we need to get to as a country.  We do not want to find ourselves in this situation where we continually have an emergency and are always one winter away from the next series of floods.  I am not being partisan on this.  It was started by the previous Government and progressed by this one.  We all need to drive it.  If we do not have a national plan and are not proactive, we will find ourselves constantly reacting to situations as they arise.</p> <p>Another central and key element of the Government's strategy to deal with flooding is the comprehensive flood projects capital investment programme which the OPW has been implementing since 1995.  There is no point having plans if there is no money behind them.  Since the capital programme began, over &euro;400 million has been invested by the OPW in constructing flood defence schemes in some of the major urban centres in the country including Dublin, Mallow, Clonmel. Kilkenny, Ennis and Fermoy.  The OPW estimates that up to &euro;1.2 billion in benefit has been derived from that investment to date in terms of properties protected and flood damages and losses avoided.  This is a major achievement and it is the Government's intention to continue to build on this major achievement and to prioritise investment in flood defence schemes.  On 29 September, I and the Government announced details of a &euro;430 million six-year programme of capital investment on flood defence measures as part of the Government's overall capital investment plan 2016 to 2021.</p> <p>This country will spend more on flood relief capital plans in the next five years than it has in the past 20.  That is right and proper as we are seeing more severe weather and know of the risk of climate change.  We have to really invest.  Nor are we sitting on our hands waiting for the CFRAM process to be concluded.  Work is continuing.  There are currently up to seven flood relief schemes at construction or substantial completion stage.  There are a further 27 schemes at various stages of design which includes such areas as Cork city - which will be the largest flood relief scheme ever undertaken in the State - Bandon, Skibbereen, Crossmolina, Claregalway, and Enniscorthy among others.  All these schemes must be subject to a rigorous consultation process and they need to be approved under planning legislation, whether under the Arterial Drainage Acts or Part 8 or Part 10 of the Planning and Development Regulations and may be referred to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for final approval if required.  We have got to level with people in terms of telling them the truth about how long a flood relief scheme actually takes.  There is a process and it is an arduous process because we have to get the schemes right.  We get one shot at this.  We cannot go back and retrofit a flood relief scheme.  We have to carry out the studies and consultation, obtain the lands we need, get the planning permission and, often, deal with challenges that come from a variety of sources.</p> <p>Most major flood relief schemes are carried out under the powers given to the Commissioners of Public Works in the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945 to 1995.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Harris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2338"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In some cases, flood schemes are undertaken on behalf of the Office of Public Works by local authorities using their powers under the planning and development legislation.  The consent authority for schemes carried out under this Act is my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  These schemes and the associated environmental impact statement must go through a formal public consultation or exhibition process before they are finalised and submitted to the Minister for confirmation or approval.  This usually takes place over a four-week period and allows people affected by the proposed scheme to make comments and observations on the scheme and raise any concerns they may have.  The OPW then takes all such comments into account in the finalisation of the scheme and it must also consult with a range of statutory consultees, including the National Parks and Wildlife Service and Inland Fisheries Ireland.  Issues arise from time to time during the public and statutory consultation process but in general, the level of pre-consultation engagement, which is a credit to the OPW, minimises these lengthy delays at exhibition stage.</p><p>When a scheme is submitted for approval to the Minister, he is obliged to carry out an independent review of the environmental impact statement.  This is a relatively new requirement arising from EU regulations and, to date, only two schemes have been submitted for approval under the new requirements.  The first such scheme was that proposed for the Clare river and I acknowledge that the independent environmental impact statement review took a lot longer than expected.  However, this was the first that had to go through the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and it is not something of which it had experience before.  I am confident that the Department has built up the expertise to ensure those processes can be carried out as quickly as possible.</p><p>Proposed flood relief schemes being carried out by local authorities are subject to the normal planning regime and where a scheme is referred to An Bord Plean&aacute;la - such as in the case of the proposed scheme for Dunkellin - the process involved is no different than that which applies to any development works.  The local authority must engage with and adhere to that process in the same way as any proposer for a development.  I am aware that An Bord Plean&aacute;la has a heavy workload but it is committed to determining the bulk of all planning cases within the relative statutory objective period.</p><p>As Members are no doubt aware, we are in the aftermath of a storm and its consequent damage.  There are options for funding available today to local authorities.  The OPW operates a minor works scheme for which any local authority can submit proposals for which cost amounts to less than &euro;500,000 and that could be of great assistance in the coming months for areas that have been badly affected by this storm.  The local authorities are well aware of the criteria.  I often get representations from around the country seeking funding for certain projects for which funding has not been sought before.  I encourage people to use the minor works schemes and engage with the local authorities.  Councillors should engage with communities and where a scheme fits the criteria, as not all will do so, it can be used.  The details are on the OPW website and councils are aware of it.  The OPW may grant-aid local authorities up to &euro;500,000 per application to try to help complete relatively minor works that could make a very impact in small towns, villages and communities around the country.  That may be of significant assistance in the coming months to a number of towns and villages badly affected by Storm Desmond.</p><p>As Members are also aware, the Government agreed yesterday to establish a fund of &euro;5 million to assist businesses that have suffered flood damage to their property.  The fund will be administered by the Irish Red Cross according to criteria for payment and assessment currently being worked out under the auspices of my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Coveney.  I warmly welcome the creation of this fund and I am pleased we could get it through Cabinet yesterday.  It sends an important message to the business community.  There is an existing humanitarian aid scheme that has been in operation for some years, operated by the Department of Social Protection, to assist householders with immediate needs and requirements.  This has not been available to small businesses, however, many of which are small family-run enterprises in towns such as Bandon and Crossmolina which have been badly affected by the floods.  The Government has now closed this gap in support and every effort is being made to get the fund up and running as quickly as possible, especially as we are so close to the busy Christmas period.</p><p>I welcome the comments of Mr. Tony Lawlor and the Irish Red Cross, which I heard in the media this morning.  He stated that he hoped to have the criteria finalised in consultation with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, in the coming days to ensure that this scheme can be the least bureaucratic it can be while ensuring accountability for public funds.  We need this in operation as quickly as possible and that is why the Cabinet made the decision yesterday.  I thank the Irish Red Cross for the role it intends to play in that regard.  I conclude by assuring the House that the Government will continue to ensure that measures to deal effectively with flooding through the development of the proactive catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme and plans and the continued significant investment in flood defence capital schemes will receive the highest priority and attention now and into the future.  We are not just talking the talk and we have put significant resources behind this.</p><p>The Taoiseach and I, along with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the rest of the Government are acutely aware that it is an extraordinarily difficult time for many towns and villages.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, and I will be briefed by the national emergency co-ordination committee at 4 p.m. today to see how things are currently.  I would like to say the worst of the weather is behind us but it is simply not the case and some of our rivers have not yet peaked.  We are continuing to do what we can.  I thank the Defence Forces, in particular, for the work it has done along with so many volunteers and local authorities to try to minimise the impact.  I thank the people for their resilience and the efforts of individual home owners and business people to try to protect their property.  The Government will do what it can to support that and that is why we took a number of decisions yesterday.  The minor works scheme is available to local authorities.  Although we cannot stop the rain, collectively and in a non-partisan sense, we can all pull together and do everything possible to help these communities.</p></speech>

I am pleased he is here to take this Bill because this is an issue I feel strongly about.  I was with Dr. T.K. Whitaker yesterday.  He was 99 years old yesterday.  I was congratulating him on that occasion and it dawned on me that he is the sort of man who has served this country well and the sort of person we should have been able to reward over the years.</p> <p>The Gradam an Uachtar&aacute;in Bill proposes to introduce Gradam an Uachtar&aacute;in, an official award from the President, to recognise people of standing who have done exceptional work.  Unfortunately, the State does not have a formal mechanism for recognising the achievements of its citizens or others abroad who make a great contribution to the State or to our society in general.  The means currently utilised to recognise great achievements are a range of more informal measures such as the conferring of honorary citizenship or the granting of the freedom of the city, the conferring of an honorary degree, people of the year awards or the Presidential Distinguished Service Award for Irish abroad and so on.</p> <p>While anybody should be privileged to receive such high accolades, and they do, it is only right that Ireland as a mature state which is facing into the 1916 centenary celebrations, should have the ability to sparingly confer an honour which recognises exceptional achievement.  When it comes to recognising the achievements of our citizens, as well as the contributions of others, we should not be dependent upon the grace and generosity of other nations to award Irish people who do something exceptional, or people who do something exceptional for the Irish State.</p> <p>The purpose of this Bill is to provide a mechanism in order that, in appropriate circumstances and with very strict criteria laid down in this Bill, the State can, in a very public and dignified way, honour not only the achievements of its citizens but also the achievements of people from other nations.  </p> <p>I would like to touch on a number of issues regarding the conferral of degrees and the constitutional position.  There is a myth that the Constitution does not allow for an honours system.  The Constitution does not preclude the State from conferring an honour on a person.  Article 40.2.1o provides that "Titles of nobility shall not be conferred by the State."  This reference to "titles of nobility" is clearly not a reference to an honours system and an honours system does not necessarily mean a title of nobility.</p> <p>It has been pointed out by Jim Duffy that the drafter of the Constitution, John Hearne, was careful, on &Eacute;amon de Valera's instructions, to leave open the possibility of the introduction of an honours system - that is totally unrelated to titles of nobility.  Rather than ruling an honours systems out, the Constitution left open the door for a system and it could be argued that it was almost expected that an honours would be introduced at some point.  This distinction between titles of nobility and an honours system is made clear in the subsequent article 40.2.2o which clarifies that, "No title of nobility or of honour may be accepted by any citizen except with the prior approval of the Government."  One of the effects of this provision is to impose a restriction on the right of a citizen to accept an honour and it makes the acceptance of an honour subject to the Government's approval.  Section 11 of this Bill gets over this constitutional hurdle by giving the Government the power to accept or reject, in full, the list of candidates proposed by the awarding council.  </p> <p>There is an argument that suggests that a republic should not give honours.  However, as other countries around the world have demonstrated, the public recognition of achievement does not compromise or dilute the values of a republic.  There is nothing incompatible with the concept of a republic and an honours system.  It is also not true to say that the conferral of an honour on citizens is usually limited only to former Commonwealth countries.  France, Italy and Austria are only some of the examples of European republics which confer honours.  Many nations around the world recognise achievements through the conferral of honours and awards, including Canada, the United States, New Zealand and South Africa.  It must be emphasised that we are almost alone in the world in not having a state honours system.</p> <p>In 2007, prior to him becoming Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny offered immediate support for the idea of an honours system, so it would appear that he is in support of the general principle.  Therefore, my hope is that in ironing out some details surrounding such an honours system we will achieve it.  In this respect, I am very much open to my Bill being improved so that we can come to a system that is acceptable to all.</p> <p>I would like to outline some of the key aspects of the Bill.  Section 1 states that the first awards will not be conferred until January 2017; there is a mistake in the explanatory memorandum, as it states 2016 because I prepared the Bill some time back.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Feargal Quinn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1972"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1972&amp;amp;pid=FergalQuinn&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I would like to change the year stipulated to 2017.  The Bill provides that it will come into force three months after it is passed by the Seanad and the D&aacute;il.  This will allow sufficient time for the various preparatory steps envisaged to be taken well in advance.  This has been set at January 2016 but which I now want changed to 2017. <br/><br/>The explanatory memorandum states: </p><blockquote><i>Section 2</i>defines the terms &ldquo;Awarding Council&rdquo; and &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; which are used in the Bill.<br /><br /><i>Section 3 </i>enables the Minister to make Regulations for a variety of purposes.<br /><br /><i>Section 4 </i>provides for the establishment of an honours system, to be known as Gradam an Uachtar&aacute;in.  The honours system will enable the State to recognise the exceptional achievements of its citizens and also the outstanding contributions of others to the State.<br /><br /><i>Section 5 </i>provides that the recipients of the honour will be presented with a medal which may be worn on formal occasions, and also a lapel button.</blockquote><p>Section 5 also provides that a person who has been awarded the honour of Gradam an Uachtar&aacute;in may use the letters &quot;G.U.&quot; after their name so as to indicate that the honour has been conferred upon them.  The section 5 also provides that the medal and lapel button shall be of the design which has been selected by the Minister following the holding of a public design competition.<br/><br/>The explanatory memorandum goes on to state:</p><blockquote><i>Section 6 </i>states that the honour shall only be conferred upon a maximum of 12 people per year and that in any one year, a maximum of four of the awards may be awarded to persons who do not hold Irish citizenship.<br /><br /><i>Section 7 </i>sets out the six broad areas of achievement in respect of which the award may be conferred, and those areas are as follows:(a) social and community affairs,<br /><br />(b) education and healthcare,<br /><br />(c) arts, literature and music,<br /><br />(d) science and technology,<br /><br />(e) sport, and<br /><br />(f) leadership and business.<i>Section 8 </i>states that the decision to award the honour of Gradam an Uachtar&aacute;in shall be solely at the discretion of the Gradam an Uachtar&aacute;in Awarding Council; no outside influence or interference will be entertained.<br /><br /><i>Section 9 </i>provides that the Gradam an Uachtar&aacute;in Awarding Council will have seven members.  Section 9 specifies the officeholders who are to be appointed by the President to the Awarding Council... <br /><br /><i>Section 10 </i>states that the nomination of persons to receive the honour of Gradam an Uachtar&aacute;in may be made by members of the public ...  In order to preclude the possibility of political interference, as well as perceived or actual bias in the selection of candidates to receive the honour of Gradam an Uachtar&aacute;in, section 10 states that a serving member of the D&aacute;il or the Seanad must not engage with any member of the Awarding Council with the intention of influencing the making of a decision in relation to the selection of a candidate.</blockquote><p>An appropriate offence is also provided in section 10 as well as to ensure that such unwelcome lobbying is minimised.<br/><br/>The explanatory memorandum continues:</p><blockquote><i>Section 11 </i>indicates the criteria which the Awarding Council will be required to apply when considering the nominations which it has received.  The Awarding Council will be required to satisfy itself that a proposed recipient of the honour has demonstrated exceptional achievement at a high level, or has made a valued contribution and above what might be reasonably expected in respect of one or more of the six broad areas of achievement which are listed in section 7.  In deference to the requirement contained in Article 40.2.2<sup>o</sup>of the Constitution, a list of the proposed candidates who have been selected by the Awarding Council to receive the award will be submitted to the Government for approval.  The Government will not have the power to make or suggest amendments to the list of proposed candidates.  Instead the Government will have the power to accept or reject, in full, the list of candidates proposed by the Awarding Council.</blockquote><p>I would like section 12 to read as follows, although as explained earlier, the explanatory memorandum states &quot;2016&quot;: </p><blockquote><i>Section 12 </i>directs that, beginning in January 2017, and in January of successive years, the award of Gradam an Uachtar&aacute;in will be conferred by the President of Ireland on the candidates who have been selected by the Awarding Council.</blockquote><p>To summarise, we are well aware that we have incredible people who have done a huge service to the State, both at home and abroad, who should be formally recognised by the State.  I am sure that every member of this House can think of several people.  It is somewhat ironic that exceptional Irish people are given awards for their work by other states but not by their home country.  The idea of an honours system is not just to recognise achievement.  It is something that could spur more people to do greater good for the nation.  As mentioned, parties from across the political spectrum, as well as the Taoiseach, have previously expressed their support for the introduction of an honours system and, in the lead-up to the centenary of 1916, I hope that we can get consensus on this Bill.  In this respect, I am open to my Bill being improved upon so that we can agree upon a sensible honours system that is acceptable to all and one that reflects the modern and confident society that we now have.<br/><br/>I urge the Minister of State to give this Bill every consideration.  I am very confident that an honours system is the right direction to go in and one that will have the approval of the nation.  I believe that because of the manner in which it has been suggested, and with any amendments that  are proposed, the legislation will be improved upon in the years to come.</p></speech>

It is an honour to second what has been said by Senator Quinn.</p> <p>On Monday, in Dublin Castle, the President presented 47 Gaisce awards to young people like those who are visiting us this afternoon and are seated in the Visitors Gallery.  They are very welcome.  The Gaisce scheme applies to people aged up to 25 years.  The recipients of the awards have performed 10,000 hours in which they helped communities, developed skills and achieved personal goals.  This year is the 30th anniversary of the scheme.</p> <p>There are other awards such as the All Star awards and the Tidy Towns competition.  All of these schemes celebrate success, effort, community and commitment.  For example, various counties and associations host person of the year events, Aosd&aacute;na honours artists, Comhairle na Mire Gaile acknowledges acts of bravery, the Scott Medal is awarded to members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for distinguished behaviour and, as mentioned, the Gaisce awards are for people aged under 25 years.  We have an honorary Irish citizenship list which includes people like Alfred Chester Beatty, Tiede Herrema, Tip O'Neill, Alfred Beit, Jack Charlton, Jean Kennedy Smith, Derek Hill and Don Keough.  We are mature enough to have an honours system.  As that list of distinguished people shows, an honours system will recognise merit, contributions to this society and demonstrate how much we value community efforts.  </p> <p>In the past there have been fears that an honours system would, in some way, hanker after a colonial era - which we do not - or it would be liable to be influenced by party politics, jobbery or some kind of consideration.  We already have a distinguished record in granting awards.  As an Irish phrase says, Mol an &oacute;ige agus tiocfaidh s&iacute;.  Bhuel, mol an duine me&aacute;naosta agus mol na seandaoine freisin.  We should reward people for service to this community which has worked very well in the areas that I have mentioned, such as honorary degrees and active citizenship awards.</p> <p>In 1998, the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution said that the honours system issue had been raised "in a desultory manner by governments since 1930".  Various people have mentioned, along the line, that a system has always been pending.  Michael Finucane suggested that there should be an Irish honours system when Christina Noble received an award from Prince Charles.  A number of Irish people have received British awards such as Daniel O'Donnell, Niall Quinn, Pierce Brosnan, Pat Eddery and Orla Guerin.  Can we be as optimistic, happy and generous towards people who have been generous towards us and leave behind fears of cronyism or post-colonialism?</p> <p>This society is comprised of many splendid people.  I am sure, with all-party agreement in this House, that we will put a scheme together.  Look at the various distinguished Presidents who have run the Gaisce awards in conjunction with the Duke of Edinburgh.  For those who have a different tradition on the island, we can extend that.  President Hillery started it off and he was followed by Presidents Robinson and McAleese.  I am sure that President Higgins will continue the tradition if this House, on an all-party basis, supports Senator Quinn's motion to establish an honours system.  The idea has been around for a long while.  Let us reward the distinguished service that is given on a voluntary basis in this society.  This Bill must be commended and I am honoured to be the seconder.</p></speech>

I also welcome the Bill presented by Senator Quinn.  I agree with him that there should be a civic honours system in Ireland whereby we can recognise the merits of people who have achieved phenomenal things for this island of ours, not just at home but throughout the world.  I cannot understand why we do not have an honours system particularly when there is one in the United States, France and Italy, just to name a few countries.  Why can we not have one?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Eamonn Coghlan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2382"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2382&amp;amp;pid=EamonnCoghlan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I have a few friends who received honours in their respective countries.  Lord Coe and Sir Roger Bannister received honours for obvious and good reasons.  Sir Paul McCartney, Sir Elton John and even the great Sir Ian Botham received awards of the highest calibre.  Another great man, John Walker, a former Olympic champion in 1976, was honoured.  He was a gold medalist and a great competitor of mine throughout the years.  A number of years ago, at the same time I was fortunate enough to be nominated to the Seanad by An Taoiseach, which was quite a shock for me, John Walker was knighted in New Zealand and became Sir John.  We had a brief conversation on the telephone.  I congratulated him on being knighted and becoming Sir John and he congratulated me on becoming Senator Coghlan.  I said I am only a Senator but he said I was a Senator in the Irish Government and that was a phenomenal achievement.  I said to him that the bottom line was that I would only be a Senator for a very short time in my life but that he would be Sir for ever.  He proposed that perhaps Senators should keep their titles for life.  He said he would always refer to me as Senator Coghlan.</p></speech>

I have been at numerous sports awards and banquets in the past week and even today there are <i>The Irish Times</i>awards.  Next week the <i>Irish Independent</i>awards will be announced.  We will have the RTE awards and the BBC sports personalities awards.  We will even have the Queen&rsquo;s list coming out in the new year.  Only last week, we had the People of the Year awards in Dublin, which I watched on television.  I was proud of the achievements of those people who made phenomenal contributions to this country.</p><p>Some of the higher awards that recognise people in this country include the freedom of the city, be it Dublin, Cork, Galway, Belfast or wherever else.  A number of years ago, the Lord Mayor&rsquo;s award was initiated in Dublin.  I was one of the first recipients of the award and I was very proud of the honour bestowed on me by the Lord Mayor.  There are also the Gaisce awards.  However, those awards come and go and people forget about them.  I believe we need an awards or honours system in this country where people can gain tremendous recognition for their achievements.  I accept it will not be easy to do that because there will be many different views on who should get such an award.  People will also have different views on who will make the award and who will form the membership of a committee to establish a national awards programme.</p><p>I never paid much attention to a national awards <i>per se</i>until I had to speak on the subject today.  I decided to do some research on why we do not have such an awards system in this country.  It was easy to find the answer.  All I had to do was google <i>Wikipedia </i>and the information was before my eyes.  Irish republicans were opposed to the British honours system.  Irish nationalists were opposed to its Britishness and there was republican opposition to its monarchist underpinnings.  Now I know why.  I searched further on <i>Wikipedia</i>and discovered Article 5 of the 1922 Constitution which states: </p><blockquote>No title of honour in respect of any services rendered in or in relation to the Irish Free State (Saorst&aacute;t Eireann) may be conferred on any citizen of the Irish Free State (Saorst&aacute;t Eireann) except with the approval or upon the advice of the Executive Council of the State.</blockquote> <p>I began to wonder why that was the case but I soon found out.</p></speech>

Efforts were made by numerous people throughout the years to restore it.  &Eacute;amon De Valera and Se&aacute;n Lemass both considered reviving those awards, as did Brian Lenihan senior in the 1960s.  Following the Belfast Agreement, the media reported suggestions that the order might be awarded jointly by the President and the British monarchy but nothing ever came of it.</p> <p>Many attempts have been made to establish a national honours system but no conclusion has been reached and such a system has not progressed.  I would like us to find a solution.  The former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, wanted to award P&aacute;draig Harrington a special honour when he won the British Open.  I wonder why that win prompted him to bring up the matter again.  The former Taoiseach also stated that it was unfair that an Irish person should go abroad to receive an award rather than receive one at home.  We need cross-party co-operation on the matter.  Attempts to introduce a national honours system failed in the past.  It is time to get the right people around the table to discuss the matter.  It is important to identify who will decide on the system and what committee we can form.  Should the President, the House or the Council of State decide whether we will have an honours system?  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Paul Kehoe, for being present and I look forward to hearing his remarks.  I congratulate Senator Quinn on introducing the Bill to the House today.</p></speech>

T&aacute; s&eacute; thar a bheith soil&eacute;ir go bhfuil machnamh domhain d&eacute;anta aige air.  Mar duine a bhfuil cl&uacute; agus c&aacute;il air cheana f&eacute;in, tuigeann s&eacute; go maith d&iacute;reach cad t&aacute; i gceist anseo.  T&aacute; seans againn anois sa tSeanad agus ceapaim-se gur ch&oacute;ir an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht a bheith anseo againn sa tSeanad.  N&iacute; fh&eacute;adfainn d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht mar seo a shamhl&uacute; agus &iacute; ar si&uacute;l i nD&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</p> <p>With all due respect to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, I just could not imagine this type of discussion in that House because it would be overtaken by cynicism and partisanship.  That is the reason the Seanad is the place where this matter should be discussed.  T&aacute; seanfhocal ann:  You are never regarded as a prophet in your own land.  That is one of the reasons this should be given careful consideration.  It is very interesting the number of Irish citizens who have received Nobel peace prizes, for instance.  People of Irish extraction appear on the Queen&rsquo;s list.  One of the reasons for that is precisely because we do not have the type of award which is being recommended in this Bill.  It is also clear from the amount of detail in the Bill that Senator Quinn foresees what the negative reactions might be.  He has covered all of them particularly well.  There could be no question of letting this slip into a political mode.</p> <p>Senators Eamonn Coghlan and Sean Barrett correctly outlined all the other awards that exist in the country.  That is why this award must be different.  It cannot be similar to a person of the year award or anything of that nature.  Like Senator Eamonn Coghlan, I too received the Dublin Lord Mayor&rsquo;s civic honour award, as did Gay Byrne, Jackie Charlton and others.  I felt a particular pride on the night precisely because it was happening in this country but even that in itself is a regional-type of award, although we all welcomed it and saw it as some form of imprimatur or acknowledgement of the work we were doing.  Small though it is, I cannot think of any country in the world that is more suited to the type of award that is being proposed.  When one looks at our place in the world, whether in sport, literature, good works of charity or in education, we are among the top and we certainly punch above our weight.  There is no question about that.</p> <p>An honours system is important not just for the person getting the award but because it designates role models for another generation.  By doing that, the State, with all the apparatus behind it, agus an tUachtar&aacute;n chomh maith, in addition to the selection committee which would act in an advisory role, would be indicating the respect we have for the service of the person who has been selected.  At the end of the day, it is about service and achievement.  I do not think Senator Quinn has omitted anything in the categories he has outlined.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1968"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1968&amp;amp;pid=LabhrasOMurchu&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Again, that is an indication of the detail which has gone into this.  I am delighted we in the Seanad have an opportunity to debate it.  I have no doubt the Minister of State could name 20 people in Wexford who would be entitled to this award already because a huge body of people could be considered.  How often has it been seen, when people are presented with an award that they are magnanimous and say, "I am accepting this on behalf of all those who have supported me" or, if it is a team, it is accepted on behalf of the whole team, and so on?  That would be the ethos attached to an award like this.</p><p>Of course, fine tuning may be required with some of it but, graciously, the Senator has made that very point.  It is the one area where we need consensus.  If there is not consensus in initiating this award, then to some extent it is tarnished as it goes forward.  Having examined it here and had the opportunity to make a presentation on it, and by putting it into a kind of gestation period, I have a feeling that, when it goes to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, it will be debated in an entirely different way.  Any of us here today could make smart remarks about what it might mean going into the future but that is not the spirit of the debate.  Fianna F&aacute;il, and I personally, fully support this Bill.  I believe any Senator who comes in here, irrespective of party affiliation, will approach this in the spirit in which Senator Quinn approached it.  I believe he is doing a great credit to this House by bringing it forward.  While we will always have the cut and thrust of politics and different ideas on legislation, I cannot see us having any different opinion on the intrinsic element of this legislation.  I hope it will be wholeheartedly accepted and embraced by the Government and that we act urgently on it.  It is timely because of the commemoration of the centenary of the 1916 Rising next year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-12-09a.329" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1208" speakername="M&aacute;ir&iacute;a Cahill" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015120900002#FF00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State.  I thank Senator Quinn for initiating the Bill as it is great to be discussing something positive.  I believe there is a very interesting debate to be had around the merits of the system and I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute on the topic today.  I recognise the positive intentions of Senator Quinn in proposing it.  There are many Irish citizens who have made important contributions to society and the Irish have historically made a contribution to the world far above our relative size, and these achievements should, of course, be celebrated.  The idea that there could be an official system by which we recognise and celebrate these people and their achievements is noble and worthwhile.</p> <p>Under this Government, an awards system for the achievements of the Irish abroad has already been established.  This was announced in 2012 by my Labour Party colleague, the former T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Eamon Gilmore.  Since its establishment in 2012, it has honoured people such as George Mitchell for his important contribution to peace and reconciliation through his key work on the Good Friday Agreement, Chuck Feeney for his work with Atlantic Philanthropies and Sally Mulready for her tireless work with the Irish community in Britain, among others.</p> <p>There are undoubtedly merits to extending such a system to the achievements of people in Ireland.  However, I also have a number of concerns, which are not criticisms in any shape or form, as to how this is taken forward.  There is a constitutional ban on the awarding of titles of nobility by the State.  I appreciate the distinction that Senator Quinn makes between his proposed system and the awarding of titles of nobility.  However, I would suggest that an honours system may be closer to this than he suggests.  Senator Quinn proposes that awardees would be entitled to have the letters GU after their name, which of course brings the UK honours system to mind.  The distinguished awards system for the Irish abroad is explicitly not an honours system.  Perhaps it is by staying closer to this structure that we would better serve both the public and those who are to receive these awards.</p> <p>I also have a slight concern about the dangers of populism in regard to such an award.  There is a provision in the Bill for the awarding council to receive nominations from the public, which is welcome.  However, I would need further reassurances from Senator Quinn about how frivolous nominations would be batted out of the process and prevented.  I do not want to go down a road where we would celebrate awards for rock stars and personalities but that it would be solely for people who have made a key, lasting and proper contribution to shaping and changing Irish society.  If those concerns are taken on board, it would be a very positive system.</p> <p>I have some questions regarding the groups that Senator Quinn proposes would make up the awarding council.  Of course, they are all excellent organisations and I am not in any way suggesting they would not be entirely capable or that they would not perform the task to a very high standard.  However, I suggest the groups are perhaps too narrow in terms of representing the true diversity of Irish society.  I propose that groups such as migrant communities or councils would be included and that sports organisations and community groups would further round out the council.  I would also suggest that having some Northern representation would be very important.</p> <p>It is also important to prevent such an honours system from becoming an outlet for political patronage.  On that, Senator Quinn and I completely agree and it is good to see he has a provision in the Bill in this regard.  I hope Senator Quinn will consider the points I have raised, as well as the other very positive comments from Senators.  I look forward to further debate on this issue as it advances to later Stages.  I believe that, as Senator Quinn wishes, he will gain consensus on this Bill, which is a very positive contribution to the House.</p></speech>

It is my first time to address him in the House so it is a particular pleasure.  I think it highly appropriate that Senator Quinn would be the person to bring this Bill before the House.  Nobody anywhere could accuse him of being partisan in any way.  Senator Quinn is one of the most independent, free-thinking people in this House and he has crossed all party lines to facilitate Bills and to argue against Bills, so there is nothing political in this.  He has gone out of his way to ensure the awarding of the honours would be as far as possible removed from the political arena, and I compliment him for that.</p> <p>I believe the Bill is a great idea and it is high time we had this.  Senator Eamonn Coghlan should not worry as he will perhaps get an award yet from the State which would in some way be superior to his senatorial appointment.  I agree with Senator Cahill that one or two of the criteria might be changed.  Senator Quinn's list suggests all of the fine things about Irish society, albeit that some of them are a little capitalist and we are missing the labour movement in there.  I would offer one or two amendments to the Bill to ensure we get a fair representation, and in addition to having IBEC, I would like to see ICTU in there arguing its corner as well.</p> <p>I ask the Minister of State to accept the Bill.  We can amend it on Committee Stage if there are any serious amendments to be made.  It is high time we put down the cross we have been carrying for our colonial masters for over 800 years.  They are gone nearly 100 years next Easter, so it is time to forget them.  The Irish memory is too long; it is time to forget that.  There is nothing in this Bill that suggests it is in any way associated with the monarchy we threw out of here 100 years ago, although I am hoping I might get an old knighthood there myself at some stage.  I ask the Minister of State to accept the Bill, which is brought forward in the best and truest Irish spirit.  I thank Senator Quinn for it.</p></speech>

I am very happy to be associated with this initiative by Senator Quinn.  Down through the years of serving with Senator Quinn, I have always admired his imaginative approach to legislation.  We can always be assured that when he brings a Bill before the House, there will be plenty of meat and drink in it, and it will not be just a common or garden Bill.</p> <p>I had the pleasure of taking part in the 1996 debate in this House on the National Cultural Institutions Bill.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paschal Mooney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1990"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1990&amp;amp;pid=PaschalMooney&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Interestingly, that debate was taken by the then Minister for Arts, Culture and Gaeltacht and the current President, Michael D. Higgins.  Former Senator Joe Lee and I argued the toss about the merits or otherwise of merit systems.  I was of the view, which I still hold to a certain extent, that it was a pity, as Senator Craughwell noted, that the revolutionary fervour of the Young Irelanders in the new State swept away all of what they believed to be the vestiges of colonial power.  It was not just in the context of nobility awards.  Some of the fine houses of Ireland were burned out and much of our heritage was lost in the immediate aftermath of 800 years of colonial rule.  Perhaps, from this remove, one cannot be critical of the people and what they did at the time because they had their reasons.  However, I always drew parallels with what happened in the immediate aftermath of the French Revolution when the revolutionaries - the<i>sans-culottes</i>- did not destroy anything of the nobility that was left.  They kept the houses, the presidential palaces and many of the titles.<br/><br/>The Republic of Ireland is pretty close to being unique in the European context in not having a state merit system.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Government that took power in 1932 was full of revolutionaries who had a particular agenda and who were virulently anti-colonial.  As a result, the 1937 Constitution reflects that.  I am not sure if Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; referred to this but in the debate surrounding awards in 1996, we argued that it is at least partly due to the 1937 Constitution that Ireland has no formal honours system.  The explicit provision of Article 40.2.1 of de Valera's Constitution seems to have been at least partially motivated by calls at the time of the 1932 Eucharistic Congress that an official honour be conveyed on the papal legate to Ireland.  The new Fianna F&aacute;il Government was strongly opposed to the conveying of such titles of nobility based on the experience of such patronage titles under British rule.  The initial draft of Article 40.2.2 of the 1937 Constitution stated that &quot;Titles of nobility shall not be conferred by the State.&quot;  However, it also stated that &quot;Orders of Merit may, however, be created.&quot;  Unfortunately, that draft did not survive, which was probably due to the ideological approach de Valera and his Government took at the time.  They wanted to remove any vestiges of colonial power.<br/><br/>Even at this remove, I think that was a mistake.  At the time of the debate we had on awards in 1996 in respect of the Cultural Institutions Bill, I said that there was an argument for restoring the Order of St. Patrick, a singular honour that was abolished in 1921 on the foundation of the State.  Those who have an interest in it will find the family flags of those who were conferred with the Order of St. Patrick in St. Patrick's Hall in Dublin Castle.  I thought we could have reintroduced that.  The then Minister and current President, Michael D. Higgins, was not particularly enthusiastic about even that approach so we agreed to disagree on it.  In my opinion, matters have moved on.  Senator Craughwell is right.  It is almost 100 years since the British left Ireland.  We are a sovereign independent republic.  One of the highest civilian honours the US President gives to a civilian is the Order of Merit, while France has the <i>L&eacute;gion d'honneur</i>.  Many other countries have state honours.<br/><br/>The main argument for me - I do not know whether Senator Quinn would have reflected on this - is that we now have a plethora of awards in this country.  They are all well-meaning.  We have the Person of the Year award and various other awards.  I saw on Google that various institutions have merit awards for their members.  I am not suggesting that there is anything wrong with that but the bestowing of so many awards at a national level dilutes the impact of such awards.  I am of the view that all of this could be addressed by the State - specifically in the person of the President - taking on the role envisaged and outlined in the proposals contained in Senator Quinn's Bill.  I do not for one moment have any fear that it would be politicised.<br/><br/>If one considers the merit system in Great Britain - I am not suggesting that we go down that road - one can see that it is not the Queen who decides.  It is decided by a panel of mostly anonymous civil servants who proceed on the basis of submissions received from the general public.  Anybody can write in and say that, for example, Senator Mullen is entitled to receive an award because of the great work he has done or that Senator Eamonn Coghlan should receive one because of his contribution to athletics and the arts.  Members of the general public write in, all of the material is collated and the decisions are made by a group of people.  I do not think there has ever been any suggestion in Great Britain that there is a political motivation behind it, even though it is a very complicated system.  I know the Prime Minister awards his or her own titles but that is separate.  <br/><br/>I thank the Chair for indulging me on this.  I fully support the concept behind the Bill.  I also support the detail of the Bill because it covers all the angles and I see no reason why we should not proceed along the lines outlined in it.  I give the Bill my full and enthusiastic support.</p></speech>

I am delighted to see the Seanad progress this Bill and, hopefully, we can get it through this Chamber and on the books so that it does not die in the event of this Government not being returned.  I see tremendous merit in this.  It is something I called for in the wake of the retirement of Henry Shefflin this year.  I argued for it on the international retirement of a great Limerick man, Paul O'Connell.  It is needed.  While we can confer honorary doctorates and degrees from universities, it does not quite equate to an honour given by the State.  The non-political office of Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann is exactly where the power to bestow such honours should be placed.</p> <p>Senator Quinn is a recipient of honours from the Vatican and France.  He may be putting himself in line for an honour here.  I would not be surprised.  There are so many people who would be deserving of such awards.  I recall Christine Buckley when she came in here to meet us.  This was somebody who did tremendous work in uncovering the scandal of large-scale abuse in industrial schools.  She was a terrific woman.  Brother Colm O'Connell could be honoured for the work he has done for athletics in Africa.  Fr. Charlie Burrows has not really been recognised by anybody in this State but does a huge amount of work in the area of social justice.  He is somebody about whom we do not know much but the work he does in Indonesia is remarkable.  He has built roads, hospitals and schools.  He runs his own social bank to give money to people who cannot afford to go to college and start a business.  The contribution of the fiddle player, Martin Hayes, to traditional Irish music is second to none.  The work done with the homeless in our cities by Sister Stanislaus Kennedy is another example.  These people should be recognised for the very hard, dedicated and often voluntary work they do.  This type of work highlights all that is good about being Irish.  As has been said previously, it gives us role models.  We need these very positive role models who have always fought the good fight and spoken about truth, justice and reconciliation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator James Heffernan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2362"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2362&amp;amp;pid=JamesHeffernan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->These are the types of people we should be putting up on pedestals and this is a great way of doing that.</p><p>I would have a small concern about the abbreviated title, GU, which brings to mind the first half of an acronym that is well known in Leinster House.  All sorts of unwelcome images are conjured up when one adds BU to the end.  I welcome the fact that the awards will be secular and will essentially be rewarded by the Republic.  This Bill is particularly timely given that the centenary of 1916 is almost upon us and it is appropriate that the State would honour its citizens in this fashion.  </p><p>Senator Mooney said earlier that it is 100 years since the British left Ireland but there are many people living on this island who would disagree with him and argue that there are still some British here who should go home.  </p><p>I welcome the fact that the award will be non-partisan, secular, non-political and will have an input from the public.

I thank the Senator for his work on the Bill and for raising the issue.  Senator Quinn has served with distinction in this House since 1993 for the National University of Ireland panel.  In his 20 years of service, he has always seen the role of a Senator as that of a legislator.  This Bill is the latest in a long list of legislative proposals that the Senator has brought before the Oireachtas.  Since 1993, governments involving different political parties and led by five different taoisigh have considered legislation proposed by him.  Some Bills have passed into law and others have been opposed, but each Bill has highlighted an issue deserving of debate.</p><p>The House will be aware that Article 40.2.1 of the Constitution provides, <i>inter alia,</i>that titles of nobility shall not be conferred by the State.  The purpose of this Bill is to provide a mechanism to facilitate the conferral by the State of an honour to be known as Gradam an Uachtar&aacute;in, to recognise the exceptional achievements of its citizens and the outstanding contributions of others and to provide for related matters.  The Government is not opposing the Bill, although that should not be taken as implying acceptance of all the details of the Senator's scheme.  </p><p>The Bill proposes the establishment of an honours system to be known as Gradam an Uachtar&aacute;in, which will be marked by the presentation by the President of a medal which may be worn on formal occasions and a lapel button.  The award recipient would be able to use the letters GU after his or her own name.  An awarding council of seven persons would be nominated, comprising the Secretary General to the President, the serving presidents of the National University of Ireland, the Royal Irish Academy, IBEC and the ICA and two current lay serving members of the Council of State, nominated by the President.  A maximum of 12 persons would be honoured per year and not more than four of the awards may be conferred upon persons of a nationality other than Irish.  There would be six broad areas of achievement for which the award could be conferred: social and community affairs; education and healthcare; arts, literature and music; science and technology; sport; and leadership and business.  The award would be conferred in January each year beginning in January 2016 and candidates to receive an award would be nominated by members of the public or the awarding council.  The Bill would prohibit a serving Member of either House of the Oireachtas from engaging with any member of the awarding council with the intention of influencing the making of an award.  Failure to comply with this prohibition will incur a class A fine.</p><p>The issue of an Irish honours system has been considered on a number of occasions in the past and efforts were made to reach a political consensus on it.  However, none of these efforts were successful.  As far back as 1963, the then Government approved in principle the idea that a State decoration of honour be instituted and subsequently, the then Taoiseach wrote to party leaders.  However, general consensus was not reached and the matter was not pursued.  The issue was revisited in 1991 when the then Taoiseach wrote to party leaders inviting them to exploratory talks.  However, the talks did not take place as the political climate was not right at the time.  Again in 1994, the then Taoiseach wrote to Opposition party leaders asking for their views on the introduction of an honours system.  The issue was not progressed as it did not obtain all party agreement.  </p><p>The introduction of an honours system has been raised on a number of occasions since this Government took office in parliamentary questions in the D&aacute;il on October 2011, May 2012 and November 2013.  A further parliamentary question was put down on 31 March this year by Deputy Derek Keating.  Following that, the Taoiseach wrote to all party leaders to establish if all parties would be willing to engage in discussions on a national awards scheme.  Only one party has responded.  The Taoiseach has repeatedly said that all-party consensus is required before considering an awards scheme.  In any event, the timing of any such consideration would have to take cognisance of other political priorities.</p><p>It should be noted that there are already in existence a number of award schemes through which the State recognises and awards merit, distinction or bravery in particular areas.  Gaisce, which is also known as the President's Award, is a scheme to challenge young people to use their leisure time for positive development and the betterment of their communities.  Gold, silver and bronze medals are presented by the President as recognition of achievement.  In 2012 the Presidential Distinguished Service Award for the Irish Abroad was introduced.  The award is presented by the President to persons living abroad, primarily Irish citizens, those entitled to Irish citizenship and persons of Irish descent who have made a sustained and distinguished service to Ireland or Irish communities abroad.  Ten awards are made each year.</p><p>Aosd&aacute;na is a scheme to honour artists whose works have made an outstanding contribution to the arts in Ireland.  The scheme offers a basic level of financial security to those who need it to enable them to devote their energies fully to their art.  The National Bravery Awards are awarded for deeds of bravery.  The Deeds of Bravery Council awards gold medals, bronze medals and certificates.  Another example is the Scott medal for bravery.  This is in the gift of the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and is awarded by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The Volunteer Ireland Awards are presented to recognise people who are unsung heroes and have given time volunteering throughout Ireland.  The President is patron of these awards.  Nominations can be forwarded by members of the public and the categories for awards include arts, culture and media, sports and recreation, health and disability, children and young people, campaigning and awareness raising, community, education and training, social work, animals and environment, and international development.</p><p>In addition, as the House will be aware, there are commercially sponsored awards ceremonies which recognise contributions to sport, business and charities.  Examples include the Rehab Person of the Year Award, the Irish Film and Television Awards, <i>The Irish Times</i>Intertrade Ireland Awards for young innovators and small businesses and the RTE Sports Person of the Year Award.  </p><p>As I said earlier, the Government will not be opposing this Bill.  However it should be noted that not opposing the Bill does not necessarily imply acceptance of all the details therein.  As mentioned previously, the Taoiseach has made the point on several occasions that all-party support is required before considering an awards scheme.</p><p>I thank Senator Quinn for putting this Bill to the House.  The Government will take on board the contents of the Bill and will not oppose it.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, I was not in the Chamber to hear the Minister of State's contribution in full but I am delighted to hear that the Government is not opposing this Bill which I support because I believe the extraordinary contributions of ordinary citizens in this country to their communities, families and so on should be recognised.  I understand the reason some people are reluctant to have an honours system, which I think is based on our history in terms of the abuses of nobility here in the past.  However, that is not a reason why, as a republic, we should not have here a mechanism, similar to that in place in other countries such as France, through which the outstanding contributions of ordinary citizens are recognised.  For this reason, I am anxious that Senator Quinn's Bill be supported by this House.</p> <p>I commend the Senator on introducing this legislation and thank the Minister of State, on behalf of the Government, for not opposing it.  I look forward to its speedy passage through this House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-12-09a.337" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1174" speakername="Mary Moran" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015120900002#JJ00200"><p>I, too, welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, to the House.  I support Senator Quinn's Bill, which proposes the putting in place of a mechanism that should have been put in place many years ago.  I agree that like many other countries, we should have in place a mechanism to recognise the outstanding contributions of people to this country.  I have no doubt that there are many Senators who have made outstanding contributions to this country.  Very often it is the unsung heroes that go without recognition and, sometimes, do not even seek it.  I know of many such people within my own field of music, including Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, who does terrific work for Irish traditional music in this country. While not wishing to single out particular people, I know Senator Quinn has also done great work on behalf of this country.</p> <p>I welcome that the Bill provides that people will be awarded this distinction on the sole authority of the appointing council, membership of which will not include political appointees.  That is important.  I agree that the use of the abbreviated title, GU, after a person's name warrants further consideration.</p> <p>I congratulate Senator Quinn on bringing forth another excellent Bill.  I am delighted that the Bill is not being opposed by Government.  Leaving aside that there are a few issues with it that need to be ironed out,  I wish it a swift passage through this House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-12-09a.338" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1145" speakername="Feargal Quinn" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015120900002#JJ00300"><p>I appreciate the Minister of State's remarks and welcome that the Government is not opposing this Bill.  I was anxious that we would have a good Second Stage debate on the Bill and that has been the case.  I welcome that there is all-party support for the Bill.  I am confident that this is the right direction to go and I am pleased with Senators' contributions on the Bill.</p> <p>I believe in honouring people who have given a lot to their country.  I believe also that this recognition should not be limited to any one area, as in the case of the People of the Year and other awards.  I would very much like to see the Bill complete its passage through this House prior to the forthcoming general election.  The construction contracts Bill which I put forward in 2011, which is now the Construction Contracts Act, passed Final Stage in the Seanad 12 hours before the previous Government was dissolved.  The incoming Government then took it on board and it has since become law.  Given this Bill has all-party support I would very much like if it could be passed by this House between now and the calling of the next general election.  </p> <p>I accept that there will be some necessary changes to the Bill.  Senators Heffernan and Moran mentioned that the abbreviated title of GU after a person's name might not be popular, which I understand.  However, that is a relatively minor issue.  The title "An Post" was first proposed during my time as chairman of that organisation.  Many people were totally against that change but it has been very successful.  I am a great believer in teasing out issues to see what can be achieved.  In regard to the concerns around the giving of titles of nobility, we must ensure that the impression is not given that we are giving such titles.  What will be given are awards of recognition based on what people have achieved.  </p> <p>When I drafted this Bill some months ago, I referenced in it the date of 1 January 2016.  As it is highly unlikely that it will be possible to do anything between now and 1 January 2016, that reference will have to be changed to 1 January 2017.  I propose to table an amendment in that regard on Committee Stage.  I accept that as outlined by the Minister of State, there may be a need for other amendments.  I am open to that.</p> <p>I am confident, based on the cross-party support today for this Bill, that this is the right direction for us to go.  I welcome that the Government does not propose to oppose the Bill and I thank all Senators who have contributed to the Second Stage debate and, in particular, the Minister of State, for their support for it.  I urge the Minister of State to ensure all that is possible is done to ensure the Bill passes all Stages in the Seanad prior to the calling of the general election, following which it can be taken up by the new Government in the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

It is a consequential technical amendment that should have been made in tandem with an amendment made to the definition of "relevant person" on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il.  References to "appointer" were deleted from the definition of relevant person and, as such, a definition of "appointer" is no longer required in the general interpretation section.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-12-09a.351" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1136" speakername="David Norris" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015120900002#PP00700"><p>This seems to be a fairly technical matter.

That is fine.  However, I will say this only once to the Minister of State.  This whole Bill is dreadful in a sense.  I do not blame the Minister of State.  I blame the Department and the draftspeople.  This is the third or fourth time we have had Government legislation with several hundred Government amendments after it has been passed by the D&aacute;il.  I never recall anything like this previously in nearly 30 years in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  There is always a big rush coming up to Christmas, but I never remember anything like this.</p> <p>There were more than 300 amendments to the Legal Services Regulation Bill, including amendments to amendments that were made a week previously.  It is horrendously bad conduct of business.  Here is another one with a couple of hundred Government amendments.  I know some of them just remove one word such as getting rid of the "to" in "to appoint".  For God's sake, those are such obvious drafting matters that they really should have been taken care of before the Bill was presented to the D&aacute;il.  If they were not, surely to God, they should have been amended in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</p> <p>However, on the other hand, of course, what a wonderful thing that we managed to preserve Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  Where would the Minister of State be without the Senate?  Where would her 200 and something amendments be?  They would be floating around in mid-air and she would have to go back to the D&aacute;il and do all kinds of high jumps and I do not know what else.</p> <p>I am making a protest on behalf of doing good business.  I ask the Minister of State to take it back to the draftspeople and her colleagues and all the rest of it.  I see absolutely no reason for this Gadarene rush every single Christmas.  That is bad enough, but to have three or four Bills with a couple of hundred Government amendments after being through the D&aacute;il, and in the case of one of the others through the Senate and amended in Committee to be followed by 300 Report Stage amendments, is absolutely unheard of and scandalous.</p> <p>That is all I shall say on the matter.  I feel it very deeply.  We should do our business in a proper and business-like manner that allows everybody participate and has the orderly progress of legislation through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I make it clear that I am not pinning personal responsibility on this Minister of State.  It is a feature across Departments and seems to particularly hit the Department of Justice and Equality - for what reason I just do not know.  I believe this is also a Department of Justice and Equality Bill.  This is the third Bill we have had from the Department of Justice and Equality - the third Bill from the same Department.  I rest my case.</p></speech>

However, I want to approach this matter from the other side.  Senator Norris is saying that if people come with good ideas after the Bill is published the Minister cannot listen to anything and it is passed in the D&aacute;il, end of story.  Having the Senate here leaves the Minister open to accept good amendments when they come.  So really----</p></speech>

It does not look anything like it did at the outset and even at this stage there are still amendments to be made.

The provisions on enduring powers of attorney have remained for the most part untouched since the Bill was published in July 2013.  Part 7 of the Bill largely restates the provisions of Part 2 of the Powers of Attorney Act 1996.  The proposed amendments are required to align the provisions with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and current international best practice.  The proposed amendments are also required for textual consistency and alignment with the rest of the Bill.  The House will see that many of the proposed new sections mirror provisions already in other parts of the Bill.</p> <p>The amendments will strengthen the safeguards against attorneys acting outside the authority given to them, address potential risks of abuse and exploitation of donors and increase protection for the rights of donors.  The proposed amendments provide for attorneys to be accountable and held responsible for their actions.  I am proposing to delete sections 50 to 64, inclusive, and replace them with a revised, simplified text and additional sections that provide for more detailed provision in relation to reports by attorneys, complaints against attorneys and offences relating to enduring powers of attorney. </p> <p>Some of the new sections specify requirements such as notification requirements that would otherwise be left to regulations and were included in Schedules 1 and 2 to the Bill.  Thus the main requirements for executing and registering enduring powers of attorney are now contained in primary legislation.</p> <p>One of the main substantive changes to Part 7 is that the director will not register enduring powers which have been created under the 1996 Act but have yet to be registered.  I have received legal advice stating that it would not be possible for the director to register these enduring powers under this Bill.  They will have to be registered under the 1996 Act by the Office of the Wards of Court, which is the current system.  However, the attorneys appointed under these enduring powers and all other powers registered under the 1996 Act will be subject to the new complaints and offences provision I am proposing to insert by way of amendments Nos. 188 and 192.  I believe that the number of executed but not yet registered enduring powers under the 1996 Act will be small.  </p> <p>Amendment No. 2 revises the definition of "attorney" in line with the amendments to Part 7 of the Bill.</p> <p>Amendment No. 7 is similar to amendment No. 2 in that it revises the definition of "enduring power of attorney" in line with the proposed amendment to Part 7 of the Bill.  It also inserts a definition for "enduring power" under the 1996 Act which is now required as a result of the proposed amendment to Part 7.</p> <p>Amendments Nos. 19 and 20 propose to delete the cross-references to Part 7 and Schedules 1 and 2.  This is to enable jurisdiction for enduring powers of attorney to be transferred from the High Court to the Circuit Court.  The proposal to transfer jurisdiction to the Circuit Court is intended to enable cases relating to enduring powers of attorney to have the benefit of the specialist judges who will be dealing with the majority of matters arising under this Bill.  It is also intended to reduce costs for applicants in the interests of encouraging more people to draw up enduring powers of attorney.  These remain a good means for the person to express his or her will and preference in terms of who should take decisions on his or her behalf if he or she subsequently loses capacity.</p> <p>Amendment No. 69 clarifies that a co-decision making agreement will be null and void if there is an enduring power of attorney in force, registered either under this Bill's provisions or the 1996 Act.  </p> <p>Amendment No. 77 clarifies that the disqualification of a co-decision maker if he or she has an enduring power of attorney registered in respect of him or her includes enduring powers of attorney registered under the 1996 Act.</p> <p>Amendments Nos. 143 to 146, inclusive, amend subsections (9) and (10) of section 33 which allow a person who is the subject of an application to be assisted in court by a court friend if he or she is not legally represented or does not have a decision-making assistant, co-decision maker, decision-making representative, attorney, designated health care representative or other person willing to assist him or her with the proceedings.  The amendments clarify that the attorney can be appointed under the Bill or under the 1996 Act.  </p> <p>Amendment No. 148 proposes to delete subsection 34(3) which provides that the court cannot make a declaration as to whether a person lacks capacity to make or revoke an enduring power of attorney.  This subsection was inserted in the Bill in order to avoid a person having to go to court routinely to get a declaration of capacity in respect of the making or revoking of an enduring power.  A statement from a medical professional and another health care professional on the capacity of the donor is deemed sufficient.  However, in drafting the new provisions on objections, complaints and offences under Part 7, it became apparent that the court may have to assess the donor&rsquo;s capacity in order to investigate an objection, complaint or offence and it could not do so if subsection 34(3) remained in the Bill.</p> <p>Amendment No. 170 inserts a new section 50.  The current section 50 is being deleted and replaced by revised text as part of the overall amendment of the enduring powers of attorney provisions.  The interpretation section of Part 7 has been streamlined and provides a definition of key terms in the revised sections of Part 7.</p></speech>

The new section 51 sets out what is an enduring power of attorney, who may appoint an attorney, what authority can be conferred in an enduring power and how the authority must be conferred.  The new section 51 reflects provisions in subsections 52(2), 52(5), 54(2) and 55(1) of the Bill as passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Subsection (2) provides that an enduring power must be conferred in writing in an instrument which is compliant with the other provisions of the Part and any regulations made by the Minister for that purpose.  Subsection (3) provides that an attorney may, in the instrument creating the enduring power, appoint an alternate attorney should the original attorney die, be disqualified or is no longer able to carry out his or her duties as an attorney.</p> <p>Subsection (4) provides that the enduring power will not come into force until the donor lacks capacity in one or more of the relevant decisions which are the subject of the power and the instrument that created the power is registered in accordance with new section 61.  Subsection (5) equates to subsection 54(2) of the Bill as passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and provides that where general authority is conferred by a donor on an attorney in respect of property and affairs, the attorney has the authority to do anything on behalf of the donor that the donor can lawfully do.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Kathleen Lynch:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=656"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=656&amp;amp;pid=KathleenLynch&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Subsection (6) sets out who is suitable for appointment.

New section 52 sets out what has to be included in an instrument that creates an enduring power of attorney.  Subsection (1) provides that the instrument must contain statements from the donor, a legal practitioner, a registered medical practitioner, a health care professional and the attorney in relation to various matters, such as the capacity of the donor, that fraud of undue pressure was not used to create the enduring power and that the attorney is willing to undertake the functions of attorney under the power.  The provisions were previously contained in section 52(4) which covered what may be included in regulations to be made by the Minister.</p> <p>New section 52 makes it obligatory to have such statements included in an instrument.  It also provides for an additional safeguard by requiring statements by two different professionals as to the capacity of the donor to understand the implications of creating such an enduring power.  One of the statements must be from a health care professional, such as a social worker, so as to not be too reliant on the medical assessment of capacity.  Subsection (2) is a new provision specifying details that must be included in the instrument creating the enduring power of attorney that would otherwise be left to regulations.</p> <p>Subsection (3) is a new provision, complementing subsection (4).  Subsections (3) and (4) mirror provisions introduced into the co-decision-making Part on Committee and Report Stages in the D&aacute;il.  The NDA advised that the Bill needs to provide for situations where due to literacy issues, blindness, dexterity, etc., a person is unable to sign a document.  The proposed provisions that will apply where a person cannot sign the document accords with advice that such a situation would require the combined input of the donor, the attorney, the substitute signatory and two witnesses.</p> <p>Subsection (4) is a new provision, complementing subsection (3).  It tightens the provisions regarding the witnessing of an instrument creating an enduring power.  Similar to section 14(7) in the co-decision-making Part, a further safeguard has been inserted which provides that an employee or agent of the attorney may not be a witness to an instrument creating an enduring power of attorney.  It also requires that at least one of the witnesses is not an immediate family member of the donor or the attorney.  The requirement that at least one witness is not an immediate family member is to provide an additional safeguard so that an independent person must be involved as a witness.  This is to reduce the risk of a donor being pushed by family members into conferring an enduring power of attorney against his or her wishes.</p> <p>Subsection (5) is a new provision that requires a donor to specify in the instrument creating the enduring power if the attorney is to be paid for performing the functions of attorney, what functions he or she is to paid for and how much he or she is to be paid.  </p> <p>For clarity subsection (6) provides a definition of immediate family member to include a spouse, civil partner, cohabitant, child, parent, step-parent, a grand-parent, an aunt, uncle, nephew, niece or immediate in laws of the appointer or co-decision-maker.  The same definition is found in the corresponding subsections in Part 4 on co-decision-making and Part 8 on advance health care directives.</p> <p>Amendment No 173 inserts a new section dealing with notice of execution of an enduring power of attorney.  New section 53 sets out the notification requirements in relation to the execution of an enduring power of attorney.  It is a new provision that requires the donor to give notice of the execution of the power to all close family members, such as spouse and children over 18 years of age and any decision-making supporters that the donor may have, such as a decision-making assistant or co-decision-maker.  It also allows the donor to name two other persons whom he or she wishes to inform of the execution of the enduring power.  The provisions in new section 53 specify requirements that would otherwise would have been left to regulations. </p> <p>Amendment No. 173 inserts a section dealing with scope of authority - personal welfare decisions.</p></speech>

New section 54 replicates subsections (2) to (7), inclusive, of section 53 and of the Bill as passed by the D&aacute;il.  It sets out the scope of authority of an enduring power of attorney in relation to personal welfare matters.  Subsection (1) sets out the limited conditions where an attorney may restrain a donor.  As with all other interveners restraint by attorneys is to be tightly regulated and only used in limited circumstances.  The situation has to be an exceptional emergency in which there is an imminent risk of serious harm to the donor or to another person.  Subsection (2) defines &lsquo;&lsquo;restrains&rsquo;&rsquo; for the purposes of this section.  It includes the definition of chemical restraint in that definition.  Restraint is deemed to apply when a person administers a medication with the intention of modifying or controlling the relevant person&rsquo;s behaviour so that the person will become compliant.  This amendment was inserted on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il.  Subsection (3) requires that the restraint be immediately ceased when no longer necessary to prevent the imminent risk of serious harm to donor.  Subsection (4) provides that subsections (1) to (3) shall not constrain the generality of section 69 of the Mental Health Act 2001 or of rules made under that section.  Subsection (5) prevents a donor from authorising an attorney from making a decision relating to the refusal of life-sustaining treatment or from making a decision that is the subject of an advance health care directive by the donor.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Kathleen Lynch:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=656"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=656&amp;amp;pid=KathleenLynch&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Subsection (6) provides that if an enduring power contains a relevant decision relating to the refusal of life-sustaining treatment or a decision that is the subject of an advance health care directive, the power is null and void to the extent that is relates to that decision.</p><p>Amendment No. 175 inserts a section dealing with the scope of authority relating to property and affairs.  New section 55 replicates, with minor amendments, section 54(3) to (5), inclusive, of the Bill as passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  It sets out the scope of authority of an enduring power of attorney in relation to property and affairs.  Subsection (1) provides that the attorney may, if specific provision to that effect is made in the power, act for his or her own benefit or that of any other person&rsquo;s benefit to the extent provided for in the power.  Subsections (2) and (3) cover the giving of gifts by the attorney on behalf of the donor.  The donor must specify in the power that the attorney may give gifts, while subsection (3) limits these gifts to customary occasions and to persons, including the attorney, to whom the donor would have likely given gifts in the past.  The value of the gifts must be reasonable, taking the circumstances of the donor into consideration.</p><p>Amendment No. 176 inserts a section dealing with the application of joint and joint several attorneys.  New section 56 deals with the application of the Part to joint and several attorneys.  The provisions in relation to joint and several attorneys were contained mainly in section 64 and the Second Schedule to the Bill as passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Subsection (1) allows a donor to appoint more than one attorney.  The donor must specify in the enduring power of attorney whether such multiple appointments are made either jointly, jointly and severally, or jointly in some matters and severally in other matters.</p><p>Subsection (2) sets out what happens if one of the attorneys who was appointed to act jointly with another attorney is disqualified, dies or lacks capacity to carry out his or her duties as attorney.  With regard to joint and several attorneys, where one dies, lacks capacity or is disqualified, the remaining attorney or attorneys may continue to act, unless the instrument creating the enduring power provides to the contrary.</p><p>Amendment No. 177 inserts a section dealing with persons who are not eligible to be attorneys.  New section 57 equates to section 52(6) of the Bill as passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Section 52 deals with a number of issues relating to the characteristics of an enduring power and who may be appointed as an attorney.  Subsection (1) sets out who is not eligible for appointment as attorney and replicates similar provisions in assisted decision-making, co-decision-making and advance health care directives.  Subsection (2) replaces section 52(7) and prevents financial issues such as bankruptcy from being a barrier to being an attorney in respect of personal welfare matters.</p><p>Amendment No. 178 inserts a section on the disqualification of an attorney.  New section 58 equates to section 52(7), (8), (10), (11) and (12).  For clarity and consistency with other Parts of the Bill, the provisions relating to disqualification have been brought together in one section.</p><p>Amendment No. 179 inserts a new section on the functions of the court prior to registration.  New section 59 replicates section 56.  It enables the court, before the registration of the enduring power, to exercise powers it would have been able to exercise once a power had been registered, if it has reason to believe the donor may lack or shortly may lack capacity.  An application to the court under this section may be made by any interested party whether the attorney has made an application for registration of the instrument.</p><p>Amendment No. 180 inserts a new section on application for registration of an instrument creating an enduring power.  New section 60 replicates the existing section 57 and incorporates Schedule 1 to the Bill.  However, additional text has been added to incorporate provisions that were to be provided for by way of regulations and to strengthen the safeguards against the premature or fraudulent registration of an enduring power.  It sets out the obligations placed on the attorney when he or she has reason to believe the donor lacks capacity in relation to one or more relevant decisions which are the subject of the enduring power.  Subsection (1) provides that an attorney must make an application to register the instrument creating the power of attorney as soon as he or she believes the donor lacks capacity.</p><p>Subsection (2) provides that the application for registration shall be made in a form that is to be prescribed by the Minister.  The fee to accompany the application shall also be prescribed in regulations.  Subsection (3) requires the attorney to notify specified persons of the fact that he or she is applying to the director to register the enduring power of attorney.  The list of those who have to be notified mirrors the list contained in new section 53 which lists those who have to be notified of the execution of an enduring power.  Currently, section 57 and Schedule 1 to the Bill replicate the provisions of notification found in the 1996 Powers of Attorney Act.  The provisions and the accompanying regulations have been a source of confusion and conflict in recent years.  In order to simplify and to provide protection against premature or fraudulent registration, I propose that all close family members be notified by the attorney that he or she intends to register the enduring power.  Those notified will then have the opportunity to object to the registration if they are of the opinion that the attorney is not suitable or that undue pressure was placed on the donor to choose the appointed attorney.  The amended notification provisions in this new section, coupled with the new notification requirements at execution stage, should, I hope, ensure all of those who need to be informed of an enduring power of attorney are notified.</p><p>Subsection (4) replicates section 57(3).  It provides that the attorney may, before applying to register the enduring power of attorney, apply to the court for a determination in relation to the validity of the power.  Subsection (5) replicates section 55(2).  It allows an attorney, once he or she has applied for registration, to take action under the enduring power to maintain the donor, to prevent loss to the donor&rsquo;s estate, to maintain the attorney or other persons so far as the donor might be expected to do so or to make a personal welfare decision that cannot be reasonably deferred until the application has been determined.</p><p>Subsection (6) is a new provision that requires an attorney who has taken action under subsection (5) to report these actions to the director.  Subsection (7) sets out what needs to accompany the application to register an instrument creating an enduring power.  Similar to the requirement in relation to the execution of an enduring power of attorney, statements on the donor&rsquo;s lack of capacity will now be required from two different professionals, one of whom must be a health care professional such as a social worker.</p></speech>

The new section 61 replicates section 58(1) of the Bill and provides in more detail for how the director shall review an application for registration.  It also provides additional provisions incorporating an appeals mechanism in relation to the decisions of the director on the registration of an enduring power.  Subsection (1) lists the criteria that the director must consider when reviewing an application to register an enduring power.  </p> <p>Subsection (2) provides that, subject to any objection received, where the director is satisfied that the application is in order, he or she shall register the instrument creating the power.  </p> <p>Subsection (3) provides that, where the director is not satisfied that all is in order with an application, he or she shall notify the attorney and the donor of his or her view and give the attorney and the donor the opportunity to respond.  This is a new provision that allows the attorney or donor to provide further material or evidence to back up the application for registration because we cannot rule out the possibility of vexatious complaints about who is chosen.  </p> <p>Subsection (4) is complementary to the new subsection (3).  Following the receipt of further information or material as provided for in subsection (3), the director can do one of two things - register the instrument if he or she if satisfied that the criteria listed in subsection (1) have been met or refuse to register the instrument because the criteria are not deemed to have been met.</p> <p>Subsection (5) is a new provision.  It provides for an appeals mechanism for an attorney whose application to register is refused.  The attorney has 21 days from the time he or she is notified that the application has been refused to appeal the decision of the director to the court.  </p> <p>Subsection (6) is a new provision and complementary to subsection (5).  It sets out what the court may do upon an appeal under subsection (5).  It may require the director to register the instrument, or affirm the director&rsquo;s decision to refuse to register it or make an order or declaration, as it considers appropriate.  </p> <p>Subsections (7) and (8) provide for the director to supply an authenticated copy of the instrument to the attorney and the donor.  The copies authenticated by the director will be evidence of the contents of the instrument and the date it came into force.  New section 60(3) provides that the attorney shall send them copies of the enduring power of attorney when notifying them of his or her intention to register the power.</p> <p>Amendment No. 182 inserts a new section &ndash; effect and proof of registration.  The new section 62 replicates section 59(1) and (2).  Subsection (1) provides that once an instrument has been registered, a revocation of power will not be valid unless it is confirmed by the court.  A disclaimer by the attorney will not be valid except on notice to the donor and with the consent of the court.  Once registration has taken place, the donor cannot extend or restrict the power, nor can he or she give a valid consent or instruction by which the attorney will be bound.  Subsection (2) provides that subsection (1) applies for so long as the instrument is registered, regardless of whether the donor lacks capacity for the time being.</p> <p>Amendment No. 183 inserts a new section &ndash; objections to registration.  The new section 63 replicates and expands on section 58(2), (3), (4) and (5) of the Bill as passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  It allows for objections to be made to the registration of an instrument creating an enduring power of attorney.  It also provides for additional provisions that set out a mechanism by which the decisions of the director on whether an objection is well founded can be appealed to the court.</p> <p>Subsection (2) sets out the grounds on which an objection to the registration of an instrument creating an enduring power of attorney may be made.  It also allows for the possibility of a fee being charged which will help to filter out frivolous or vexatious objections.  Section 46 of the Bill, as published, contains some similar provisions.  Subsection (3) sets out the required actions of the director in regard to objections, while subsection (4) sets out the role of the courts in this regard.  Subsection (5) provides that a person may appeal the decision of the director that his or her objection was not well founded to the court, while subsection (6) sets out the role of the court in this regard. </p> <p>Amendment No. 184 inserts a new section &ndash; register of enduring powers.  The new section 64 replicates section 60(1), (2) and (3) of the Bill as passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  It mirrors similar revised provisions in regard to other registers maintained by the director.  Subsections (1) and (2) require the director to maintain, in such form as he or she considers appropriate, a register of enduring powers of attorney that have been registered by him or her.  </p> <p>Subsection (3) revises the current provision that provides for the register to be open to inspection by the public.  With a view to the need for data protection, particularly as enduring powers of attorney are essentially private arrangements between individuals, it is not considered appropriate to make the register open to the general public.  Where it is necessary for a person or a body to know of the existence of an enduring power or to have access to some or all of its contents, the director will allow the appropriate level of access.</p> <p>Subsection (4) allows the director to issue an authenticated copy of an enduring power or part thereof to a body or class of persons that shall be designated by regulation.  Subsection (5) provides for the maintaining of a record of those who have had access to the register or who have been sent an authenticated copy of an enduring power. </p> <p>Amendment No. 185 inserts a new section &ndash; revocation and variation of enduring power.  The new section 65 replicates and expands on the current section 62 of the Bill.  Additional subsections provide for provisions that were to be provided for by regulation.  Subsection (1) clarifies that where a donor has capacity, an enduring power of attorney may be varied or revoked anytime prior to its registration.  Subsection (2) provides that the variation or revocation must be done in such form as prescribed by the Minister.  Subsections (3) and (4) set out the administration requirements for the variation and revocation of an enduring power of attorney by a donor.  It is not necessary for the donor to go to court to revoke an enduring power that has not been registered.  Subsections (5) and (6) provide that a donor may revoke an enduring power that has been registered if he or she has the capacity to do so.  However, the court must confirm the revocation for it to be valid. </p> <p>Amendment No. 186 inserts a new section &ndash; disclaimer by attorney.  The new section 66 replicates section 52(14).  It provides that a disclaimer of an enduring power that has not been registered by the attorney will not be valid except on notice to the donor.  A disclaimer of an enduring power that has been registered by the attorney will not be valid except with the consent of the court.</p> <p>Amendment No. 187 inserts a new section &ndash; reports by attorneys.  The new section 67 replicates and expands on section 60(4) of the Bill as passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  It provides for greater oversight of attorneys by the director, especially in regard to the financial affairs of donors.  Subsection (1) is a new provision that requires an attorney who has been given the authority by the donor to make decisions on his or her property and affairs to submit within three months of the registration of the enduring power a schedule of the donor&rsquo;s assets and liabilities and projected statement of the donor&rsquo;s income and expenditure to the director.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Kathleen Lynch:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=656"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=656&amp;amp;pid=KathleenLynch&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is good practice on behalf of the attorney because he or she will need to be aware of the donor's incomings and outgoings in order to effectively manage the donor's property and affairs.  It also ensures that the director is made aware of any substantial estates that may require closer oversight.</p><p>Subsection (2) requires the attorney to keep proper accounts and that such accounts be available for inspection by the director or special visitor.  Subsection (3) requires the attorney under a registered enduring power to submit a report as to the performance of his or her functions under the enduring power to the director within 12 months.  Subsection (4) provides that reports submitted by the attorney must be in a form to be prescribed by the Minister and must include details of all expenses and remuneration paid or to be claimed by the attorney.  Subsections (6), (7) and (8) are new provisions that set out what must happen when an attorney does not comply with his or her reporting obligations.  This includes a provision that allows the court to determine that the attorney should no longer act as attorney for the donor concerned.  Subsection (9) defines the term &ldquo;relevant period&rdquo;.  Subsections (10) and (11) are new provisions that apply the reporting obligations set out in this section to attorneys of enduring power that had been created under the 1996 Act but have not been registered yet.  Subsections (12) and (13) are also new provisions that provide that the functions of the director, the investigations of the director and the appointment of special and general visitors by the director in relation to the reporting obligations of an attorney include attorneys and owners under enduring powers created under the 1996 Act. </p><p>Amendment No. 188 inserts a new section 68, complaints in relation to attorneys, into Part 7.  The new section mirrors section 27, which deals with complaints against co-decision-makers.  It sets out new provisions enabling complaints about the suitability or conduct of attorneys.  Complaints against attorneys appointed under the Bill and attorneys appointed under the 1996 Act may be investigated by the director under this section.  Provision is made here for the director, having satisfied himself or herself that a complaint is well-founded, to apply to court for a determination.  An additional safeguard is provided by allowing the director to investigate a matter and bring it to court notwithstanding that no complaint has been received.</p><p>Amendment No 189 inserts a new section 69, applications to court.  Subsection (1) sets out what the court may do where the director makes an application to it in relation to whether he or she should register an instrument creating an enduring power of attorney.  Subsection (2) sets out the criteria that the court must take into consideration when determining if an attorney is suitable for appointment as an attorney.  Subsection (3) replicates section 61(2).  The court can determine the meaning or effect of the instrument.  The court may give directions with respect to the personal affairs and the management or disposal of the donor&rsquo;s property or affairs.  It can also decide on the rendering of accounts and on the production of records kept by the attorney, and on the remuneration and expenses of the attorney and consent to a disclaimer by the attorney.  Subsection (4) replicates subsection (3) of section 61.  It sets out the circumstances in which the court must notify the director of its directions, requirements, consent or authorisation made under subsection (3) and requires the director to monitor the giving of effect of such directions, requirements, etc., by the attorney.</p></speech>

It mirrors provisions in section 26 that deal with the removal of co-decision-making agreements from the register following revocation.  Subsection (1) sets out the circumstances in which the director shall remove from the register of enduring powers an instrument that has been revoked or where the attorney has been disqualified.  Subsection (2) sets out what happens in regard to the register when there is more than one attorney appointed under the enduring power of attorney or where the donor has nominated an alternative attorney.</p> <p>Amendment No 191 inserts a new section 71, regulations.  This new section pulls together in one section the matters that must be prescribed by the Minister.  These are currently scattered throughout the part.</p> <p>Amendment No. 192 inserts a new section 72, offences in regard to enduring powers of attorney.  It mirrors similar sections in the co-decision-making and the advance health care directives parts.  A person who uses fraud, coercion or undue influence to force another person to make, vary or revoke an enduring power will be guilty of an offence.  A person who makes a statement in connection with the creation or registration of instrument creating an enduring power, which he or she knows to be false will also be guilty of an offence.  This is an important protection for a donor.</p> <p>Amendment No. 193 inserts a new section, transitional provisions.  New section 73 provides for the transitional arrangements between the Bill and the Powers of Attorney Act 1996.  It provides that, following the commencement of this part, no further enduring powers of attorney may be created under the 1996 Act.  That is fairly straightforward.</p></speech>

It is not to be applauded on a legislative level.  As Senators demonstrated by their comments, the Minister of State showed some signs of physical stress in reading out all this, and one&rsquo;s heart goes out to her.  We have had nearly an hour of the Minister of State.  These amendments compose almost the heart of the entire Bill.  They account for 22 pages out of 55.  That is half the physical number of amendments.  This is a huge swathe to take in one gulp.  One could not really take it in.  With the greatest respect, the Minister of State made a couple of errors in numbering and so on.  What can we as ordinary Senators do about this?  It is a real difficulty.  I sincerely hope that no legislation of this kind will be introduced again ever in the Seanad.</p> <p>It is very important to consult with people and I welcome the fact that the Bill has been amended in consultation, although not as fully as some of us would like but there is no excuse for the kind of grammatical amendments turning up here two years later and after it has been passed by the D&aacute;il.  These should have been spotted straight away.  It is a grotesque offence to Seanad &Eacute;ireann that these kind of drafting errors are sustained in the Bill and have to be addressed at this stage.</p> <p>I have some comments on the amendments as I followed them.  I apologise to Senator Moran if I interrupted her but I was desperately trying to find out exactly where these things fitted in because some do not deal with sections in the Bill or in the amendments.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They are all over the place and it is impossible to find out what section is qualifying another.  I was trying to figure this out so I could do my job here.<br/><br/>Amendment No. 171 indicates &quot;Subject to the provisions of this section ... a person who has attained the age of 18 years ... may appoint one or more suitable persons&quot; to act as an attorney.  What about people under that age?  What about somebody who is 17 and a half, for example?  Will the Minister of State reassure us that the guardian <i>ad litem</i>will be called into play for minors?  They should certainly have some protection as they are more vulnerable than an adult.  We are talking about people who have attained the age of 18 years but what about people who are under 18?<br/><br/>Amendment No. 184 deals with the register of enduring powers and subsection (2) indicates &quot;The Register shall be in such form as the Director considers appropriate.&quot;  I wonder what that means.  Does it mean it should be in a ledger or in a computer?  Does it give overwhelming power to the director to say that it can be done whatever way he or she likes?  I would have thought that a register of enduring powers of attorney would be a factual matter.  It is clear what it should include.  I am not sure what it means by &quot;in such form as the Director considers appropriate.&quot;<br/><br/>This is an enormous bulk of material to consider and it means that virtually half of the Bill is to be discussed in one go.</p></speech>

It seems there is a certain degree of separation in that issue and it deserves to be teased out separately.  This is really pushing at the last minute to get legislation through.

I share the frustration of Senator Norris.  In fairness to him, we have had a number of Bills through the House in the past week and a half with hundreds of amendments coming at the last minute.  As legislators, we can see amendments replacing sections and the discussion is on the new sections.  It can be very confusing, especially as these numbered amendments only came to us at 11.59 p.m. last night.  None of us picked up our e-mails from then until this morning, so it has been quite a challenge to try to get through the amendments.</p><p>I want to be specific to issues that have been raised, particularly with regard to advance health care directives.  My understanding is these have been affected by the grouping of amendments we are speaking to.  They relate to changes to sections 59 and 60 of the Bill as passed by the D&aacute;il.  There are concerns being raised with me around advanced health care directives and the provisions are causing a great deal of concern among mental health service users.  They feel their human rights will not be respected on an equal basis with others if the treatment choices of those detained under mental health legislation are excluded from the Bill.</p><p>I note that the Minister of State is seeking to amend the mental health legislation around the issue of electroconvulsive therapy, ECT, and other harmful treatments, where people are found to be unable to consent, which is to be welcomed.  It will only occur if there is a legally binding advance health care directive allowing patients to consent or refuse treatment in advance.  It is felt that the changes suggested may affect the issue around advance health care directives.  I note that Dr. Fiona Morrissey from the National University of Ireland, Galway, has raised the issue and she states:</p><blockquote>The impending legislative provisions discriminate against anyone who may experience mental distress.  Given that one in four of us experiences some form of mental distress during our lifetime, any one of us could find ourselves in a position where we become emotionally overwhelmed due to some form of life event and end up in a crisis situation where we are excluded from making decisions in relation to our treatment under this legislation.  The proposed legislation specifically excludes the use of legally binding advance health care directives for the treatment choices of those who may be subject to involuntary detention under the Mental Health Act 2001.</blockquote> <p>Dr. Morrissey believes this is clearly discriminatory under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which the Government is planning to ratify in the near future.  The use of differential standards in the legislation reinforces the notion that the preferences of individuals who may experience mental distress are not respected on an equal basis with others and reinforces stigma.  In its general comment on article 12, the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has stated that state parties have an obligation to require all health and medical professionals, including psychiatric professionals, to obtain the free and informed consent of persons with disabilities prior to any treatment.  She also argues that advance health care directives are legally binding during involuntary detention in a number of other jurisdictions, including Germany, and a number of US states and Canadian provinces.  Advocacy organisations have urged that laws on advance directives for mental health treatment decisions should operate in exactly the same way as other directives, subject only to legitimate emergency situations, such as when there is an imminent threat to life or others.</p><p>The question is about seeking clarification.  As Senator Norris has stated, with the grouping and gamut of amendments, we need specific discussion of this issue of advance health care directives.  People are concerned that these are being specifically excluded.  Will the Minister of State clarify this?  Will they be omitted and, if so, what is the rationale for leaving them out in light of this international opinion?</p></speech>

The grouping of amendments might need examination in the context of parliamentary reform.  There is probably a logic in having a maximum number that may be discussed in one amendment grouping.  That said, it appears that these amendments are related, diverse as they may be.  They deal with ward of courts and that has never been dealt with.  Long before any of us were around here, in the 1800s, the legislation governing wards of court was in place.  I do not follow the royal family in England but it was probably Queen Victoria who was in charge.  People who needed assistive capacity did not have any money, resources, rights or dignity.  This is ensuring that people who needed assistive capacity have all those rights and their money is treated with respect.  It is about ensuring their rights are not impugned in any way.  I welcome that we have substantial amendments, as they are to improve the legislation.  I am sure many issues were identified, not just by colleagues in the D&aacute;il but by officials and people drafting the Bill, as it is such pioneering and ground-breaking legislation.  No Government in Irish history has made an effort to tackle it.</p> <p>Along with colleagues like Senators Bacik, O'Donovan and others, I was a member of the Oireachtas committee on justice, defence and equality that held exhaustive hearings and made significant recommendations in this area.  The Minister of State is correct.  I am a novice in the Seanad.  Senator Norris has been here for 20 years or longer.</p></speech>

I agree with respect to the length of time involved.  It is very difficult on everybody involved but we are all here with a common aim that we all want to get this right.  Like Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh, I read that article by Dr. Fiona Morrissey at the weekend and I join in asking for clarification on some of the points in it, particularly, as the Senator said, in regard to the mental health service users.  I found it interesting that Dr. Morrissey reported that 60% of  mental health service users felt that they had no control over future treatment.  That is an important point.  We are talking about a review in respect of wards of court, and Part 6 of the Bill, and I have had discussions with those in Inclusion Ireland who have expressed some concerns brought to their attention by family members.  It is desirable we would have a look at that category.  It is always much better if the wards of courts are family members as opposed to a medical person.  It is very important to ensure that we do that.</p> <p>Another aspect is the funds for the wards of court, even though this may not be the legislation under which to raise it.  I do not know where that would come in but with respect to funds that are in place for them that have been depleted as a result of the economic downturn, what is in place to ensure that the people who were awarded money are not out of pocket?</p></speech>

One of the meetings was with the officials and it was of three hours duration.  I have also met her and she has put her case.  It was an informal meeting.  I do not want to mislead anyone, it was not the case that this was something we were discussing but I knew her arguments because I have read her extensive e-mails on several occasions and I have explained to her and others, and officials explained also in great detail at that three-hour meeting, that we intend to deal with the advanced health care directives in regard to the mental health Bill when the general scheme is produced.  We believe that is where it should be dealt with.  As well as that, the expert group, who have looked at the Mental Health Act for us, has advised that it is where we should deal with it.  This legislation is about enabling people to make decisions and  it relates to the general scheme of life events, but the specific area of mental health should be dealt with in the Mental Health Act.  We are not opposed to that and we have very much taken on board what Dr. Morrissey has said.  She is very determined that this would be stitched into this legislation but we do not agree on that and that is the beauty of democracy.  We have explained in great detail why it should be in the Mental Health Act rather than in this legislation.</p></speech>

While most people simply require recognition of their legal capacity and support to express their will and preferences there will still be a small minority of individuals who are not expressing a will and preference in a manner that others can understand.  The Bill must establish the lawful response to such circumstances.  However, I do not believe that a functional assessment of a mental capacity, and a subsequent denial of legal capacity, is the correct response to these difficult situations.  A person in a coma or in a minimally conscious state, for example, will not be communicating their will and preferences to others and may not have made their wishes known in advance through an advanced health care directive or granted a power of attorney to anyone in respect of their relevant decision.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jillian van Turnhout:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2391"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2391&amp;amp;pid=JillianVanTurnhout&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In these circumstances decision making assistants, co-decision makers, decision making representatives, attorneys or designated health care representatives may need to make a decision on the relevant person's behalf in accordance with their best interpretation of his or her will and preferences.  While the Bill does require all interveners to respect the person's will and preferences as part of the guiding principles included in section 8, further reference to the concept of best interpretation of will and preferences is needed for the hard cases in which it is very difficult to tell what a person's wishes are.  The term "best interpretation" needs to be defined in section 2 of the Bill to guide those in the supportive roles I have outlined.  Best interpretation of a relevant person's will and preferences means taking into account past express preferences, where known, and includes knowledge gained from family and friends and other evidence available.  Best interpretation can also be arrived at in seeking to communicate with the person in every possible way, including by using, where appropriate, assisted and augmentative communication, facilitated communication, signs, gestures and total communication, all of which are noted in the regulations and code of practice.</p><p>The use of best interpretation will rarely be an easy task.  However, the best interest determinations used currently are similarly difficult in these circumstances.  The provisions of Article 12 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities are merely shifting these difficult decisions from focusing on judgments existing outside the individual to the individual's own will and preferences.  That is why I am trying to insert a definition of best interpretation.  We do need to deal with the hard cases, too.</p></speech>

It seems important that we have a concept of best interpretation and a definition of it.  It should take into account the history and past expressed wishes of a patient who may now no longer be in a position to express them.  We should take into account assisted methods of communication, be it nodding, by squeezing a hand or whatever else.  One has to be careful, however, about the way in which the family is included because not all families are perfect.  We do not want to have families pushing an interpretation that suits them but not the patient.</p> <p>I was interested to see that the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2008 had been introduced in the D&aacute;il, a Bill I had seconded in this House.  I remember discussing it with former Senator Dan Boyle and a very nice Progressive Democrats Senator whose name I cannot remember.  That was before they dumped them.  It was an important move to have the Bill discussed and I was surprised and pleased to see it being introduced in the D&aacute;il on Tuesday.</p></speech>

This is obviously an incredibly complex issue, but the express will of the relevant person is certainly paramount.  Any mechanism or means that can be used to find out what it is should be used, no matter what state the person is in.  There are questions about somebody making an advance health care directive, for example.  If he or she decides in an advance health care directive that there are certain treatments he or she does not want to have, surely that must be taken into consideration.  It is not just an issue of what he or she would like to happen, but also what treatments he or she would not like to receive.  </p> <p>I commend the Senators involved and the work of the academics who have been supporting it.  I lend our support to the amendment.</p></speech>

As a practising solicitor, I have some concerns about it from my own experience which includes attending a nursing home to have a document granting power of attorney signed, only to find that the person concerned was not at all happy about signing it.  I did not get it signed but two days later in my office I found a signed document granting power of attorney which had been witnessed by the matron of the nursing home.  I can assure Senators that the document went into the shredder, which was the appropriate place for it.  That is going back many years.  I, therefore, have some concerns about how this provision will be interpreted in the sense that different people will give different interpretations to it and the intentions of the person concerned.  While I accept that a lot of work has been done on this matter by the Senators concerned and that the issue needs to be looked at, I have concerns.</p></speech>

I am not certain if he would agree with our interpretation of where he is now, but I am sure that if he weas still around, he would, at least, be half happy.</p> <p>On amendment No. 3, as Senator Colm Burke outlined, it is hugely important that we be very clear about the interpretation of someone's will and preferences.  I fully acknowledge that we can never get it entirely right and that there will always be circumstances where we will get it wrong.  Mr. John McCarthy's book which is on my shelf constantly reminds me of the human condition.  We are human and will get it wrong.  I do not know why we are ever that surprised by this.</p> <p>Senators Jillian van Turnhout and Katherine Zappone have proposed amendment No. 3 to introduce a definition of "best interpretation".  I cannot accept the amendment because my entire focus in the Bill is on ensuring people have the ability and are helped as much as possible to make decisions for themselves, sometimes in very difficult circumstances.  Section 3 provides that where a person's capacity is being assessed, he or she can be deemed to have capacity if he or she can communicate his or her decision by talking, writing, using sign language, assistive technology or any other means, including by means of a third party who knows him or her well and knows what his or her will or preferences would be in the circumstances.  Again, I am not certain people will always get it right, but they can only do their very best in the circumstances.</p> <p>The provision in section 3(2) encompasses much of what the Senators are seeking to achieve.  The proposed definition is somewhat unclear in terms of who would interpret it.  One issue about which I have concerns is the idea that gestures and actions should be included, without proper safeguards, in a definition of best interpretation.  The decisions which need to be made will often have serious legal consequences for the person concerned or another party.  The sale of a house, for instance, may leave the person concerned without a home.  It is crucial, given the seriousness of the decision, that his or her will and preferences be absolutely clear.  Communication through gestures and actions could be misinterpreted if they were not clearly understood.  As Senator Colm Burke says, they could be misinterpreted deliberately.  In some cases, non-verbal communication will work.  We all know people who are non-verbal but who can make their meaning very clear.  We see this every day.  In some cases, though, it may give rise to misunderstandings.  Therefore, a general definition would need to be workable in all cases.</p> <p>I suggest it would be more appropriate for the director to provide information on communication methods in a code of practice that would enable organisations to have clear information on how to approach communications which might involve the use of assistive technology or non-verbal communication.  For these reasons, I cannot accept the amendment, while appreciating exactly what the Senators are seeking to do.  I think we have covered as much as possible.  The director will have a further part to play in terms of how non-verbal communication can be interpreted.</p></speech>

Two new terms are proposed as more accurate terms to describe the facilities in which those encompassed by this Bill may be resident.  The term "designated centre" is proposed to encompass residential facilities for older persons and persons with disabilities.  It is a more accurate term than those currently in the Bill.  It is a term already defined in section 2 of the Health Act 2007.  It is proposed that it will bring consistency to the terminology used in the Bill.  The term "mental health facility" is retained to encompass residential facilities for persons with mental health illness.</p> <p>It is not appropriate to retain terms, such as "approved nursing home", as they relate to the nursing home support scheme.  The facilities encompassed by this Bill are broader than those which come under the nursing home support scheme.  The change of terminology will require the consequential amendment of the definition of the "owner" of such facilities.  Amendment No. 10 proposes a definition of "owner" which includes the new terms of "designated centre" and "mental health facility".</p> <p>Amendments Nos. 55 and 75 are consequential on the streamlining of references to institutions.  The references proposed are to "designated centres" to encompass nursing homes and residential facilities for people with disabilities and to "mental health facilities".  The provision has been redrafted to make its intent clearer as our consultations with disability and mental health stakeholders has suggested that the provision had created confusion.  What is proposed is that an owner, a person living with the owner or an employee are automatically disqualified from acting as interveners under the Bill, that is, acting as a co-decision-maker.  The exception is where any of them are the spouse, civil partner, cohabitant, parent, child or sibling of the relevant person.</p></speech>

This is very important and complex legislation so she has my support for the thrust of the Bill.  I am glad that only two amendments - Nos. 5 and 245 - deal with chemical restraint.  Accepting amendment No. 5 would really enhance the Bill.  It states that, &quot;chemical restraint is the intentional use of medication to control or modify a person&rsquo;s behaviour or to ensure a patient is compliant or not capable of resistance, when no medically identified condition is being treated, where the treatment is not necessary for the condition, or the intended effect of the drug is to sedate the person for convenience or for disciplinary purposes;&quot;.  </p><p>In a nutshell, by accepting this amendment, we will improve the human rights and quality of treatment for a person.  Before any drug is given to restrain a patient, a clinical assessment should be carried out which means staff would have time for the patient.  For example, giving a patient with dementia and who is agitated a drug will quieten him or her but it does get to the root of the problem.  Staff need time, skills and resources.  This is humane and it is what I am asking of the Minister of State by accepting this amendment.</p><p>I have heard of cases where patients with dementia who have been agitated have been given drugs instead of receiving talk therapy to take them through the condition.  I have heard of a stroke patient being drugged instead of being taken to the toilet.  All she needed was to be physically brought to the toilet.  It is undignified to use drugs in this way.  I am not saying there is no need for drugs; there is a place for drugs but only after a clinical assessment has been carried out which deems use of them as being the best and last resort.  </p><p>Same applies to children with autism.  Instead of staff being trained to talk to children in a meltdown situation, Ritalin is often administered.  I know that because there have been children in that state in my classroom.  One is not dealing with the real person but a person in a zombie-like state who has been incapacitated.  One is not dealing with the person with whom one could be dealing in order to get the best out of him or her.  I strongly encourage the Minister of State to accept my amendment.  SAGE is very appreciative and supportive of the amendment.</p><p>Amendment No. 245 reiterates what is in amendment No. 5 and states: &quot;Nothing in this Act shall be construed as authorising any person to administer to a relevant person any medication for the purpose of controlling or modifying the relevant person&rsquo;s behaviour or to ensure that a relevant person is compliant and not capable of resistance when no medically identified condition is being treated, where the treatment is not necessary for the condition, or the intended effect of the medication is to sedate the relevant person for convenience or for disciplinary purposes.&quot;  This reminds me of what went on in that horrific case in &Aacute;ras Attracta.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 245 further states: &quot;Notwithstanding the provisions of <i>subsection (1)</i>, the appropriate use of drugs to reduce symptoms in the treatment of a medical condition does not constitute chemical restraint but the administration of such medication should be clearly documented on the relevant person's file and the reasons for the administration of such medication specified.&quot;  In other words, there is a time and a place for medication but only after all of the appropriate human interventions, the face-to-face therapies and talking patients down and through the situation have been used.</p></speech>

The first one is a definition and I cannot see why it should be rejected.  It states that "chemical restraint" is the intentional use of medication to control or modify a person&rsquo;s behaviour or to ensure a patient is compliant" - in other words, to dose them down.  It is an emergency fire department response to the situation.</p> <p>Importantly, the amendment also indicates that this is in a situation where the administration of these kinds of drugs is not to treat any condition - in other words, the drugs are not medically necessary and their usage is simply a form of restraint.  We have to be very careful, in terms of people's human rights, when administering restraint.</p> <p>The amendment also states that "the intended effect of the drug is to sedate the person for convenience or for disciplinary purposes."  It is pretty shocking to think that when somebody behaves badly because he or she suffers a bit of dementia that, as punishment, drugs are administered to shut him or her up, keep him or her quiet and keep him or her down. </p></speech>

Those patients were zombies: they were out of their skulls.  I do not think this practice continues and would be very surprised if it did.  These amendments deal with the last vestiges of that and will ensure that drugs are not inappropriately used.  Drugs are for a specific purpose and should not be used to punish people.  The idea of using medication to punish a mentally-ill person is absolutely repugnant.</p><p>Amendment No. 245 makes it perfectly clear, following the definition in amendment No. 5, that the Act shall not be interpreted in such a manner as to allow the administration of drugs or medicines in such a way - either to restrain or punish.  However, it makes provision in subsection (2) for the medical administration of drugs.  In other words, in cases where they are being administered to treat a particular medical condition, that is not to be considered as chemical restraint.</p></speech>

I too was contacted by Mervyn Taylor of SAGE, the support and advocacy service for older people, in regard to this issue.  SAGE has noted the clear statement in the Department of Health policy document towards a restraint-free environment in nursing homes, which unequivocally states, "Chemical restraint is always unacceptable."  Chemical restraint is a violation of personal and bodily integrity.  It constitutes inhumane and degrading treatment and in the experience of SAGE, it is being used in certain circumstances to deprive people of their liberty rather than to address underlying clinical issues.  As such, it is in breach of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights and, therefore, should be prohibited.</p> <p>It is health care professionals who are responsible for the administration of medicine to control behaviour, but rather than undertaking detailed clinical assessments to address the underlying reasons for agitation in some patients, for example patients with dementia, they use chemical restraint as a first rather than a last resort.  That is why I support this amendment and why I have put my name to it.  We need to legislate and make it very clear that we should not normalise the issue of chemical restraint.  It is a last resort and there should be an appropriate clinical assessment done if it is to be used.</p></speech>

We spoke about interpretation earlier and about how one interpretation can differ from another.  Obviously drugs must be prescribed by a medical practitioner, but there could be different interpretations regarding how they are used.  Nursing homes have guidelines on how to deal with this matter, but would it be possible to address the problem raised here through the use of guidelines?  I understand the concerns of other Senators regarding the widespread use or any use of chemical restraint in nursing homes without a requirement for medical intervention.</p></speech>

We are always under the impression that restraint is physical, but chemical restraint is much more subtle and, probably, far more effective.  Apart from in this Bill, there are other areas that are protected in terms of chemical restraint.  For example, HIQA always insists on reading patients' records to ensure that medication is appropriate for people and that the amount and frequency of medication administered is registered.  This provision is always part of HIQA's reporting process.  This is one of the mechanisms we have as a safeguard.  Mention was made of &Aacute;ras Attracta and that example shows we are human and things do go wrong.  However, we must accept that the majority of people working in the care industry and medical professionals take this issue seriously and do not administer drugs that are of no benefit to the health of patients.</p> <p>Amendments Nos. 5 and 245 would introduce a definition of chemical restraint into the Bill and would insert a new section stipulating that persons would not be authorised by this Bill to use chemical restraint.  We are all in agreement that chemical restraint should be used as little as possible.  I have already responded to this concern and this is not the first time it has been raised.  I am sure the Senators proposing the amendment have been lobbied on this area.  I have already responded to this concern through the amendments I introduced in the D&aacute;il on Report Stage.   I introduced an amendment which stipulates that chemical restraint can be used or authorised only by decision-making representatives or by attorneys.  This is a significant safeguard.  They can use chemical restraint only in very limited circumstances, where there is an exceptional emergency situation which involves an imminent risk of serious harm to the relevant person or to another person.  The use of such restraint must be proportionate to the likelihood of harm.  Where chemical restraint is used or authorised, decision-making representatives and attorneys must include details of the use of restraint in their reports to the director of the decision support service.</p> <p>My amendments give the strong message that chemical restraint should be used only as an exceptional measure.  They are focused on instances in which individuals take decisions on behalf of a person with capacity difficulties as that is the focus of this Bill.  The Bill is not intended to address all issues that may affect vulnerable people.  Both HIQA and the medical profession have a role to play also.</p> <p>On the issue of chemical restraint more broadly, the position is that chemical restraint is not currently defined in health legislation although, as previously stated, a definition is given in the national policy on the use of restraint in designated centres for older people - nursing homes.  Regulations on designated centres for older people require that restraint only be used in accordance with that policy.</p> <p>The Mental Health Act requires rules for the use of restraint to be drawn up by the Mental Health Commission.  Rules have been in place since 2009.  The recent review of the Mental Health Act has recommended that revised mental health legislation should be broadened to include all forms of seclusion and restraint, similar to in the capacity legislation.  The group was satisfied that the details of how such policy should operate is best left to be provided for in rules and guidelines, which are to be revised by the Mental Health Commission when primary legislation is revised.  At this point, it is intended that secondary legislation should include a provision ensuring that approved centres are obliged by law to follow national policy where seclusion and restraint are concerned.</p> <p>Detailed provisions regarding the use of chemical restraint and other types of restraint are best set down in national policies and underpinned by secondary legislation.  This has the advantage of allowing for changes to be made, such as to improve safeguards, without the necessity of having to amend primary legislation.  For this reason, while I sympathise with what the Senators are seeking to achieve and have considered the issues, I cannot accept the amendments.  Again, we have included safeguards in this Bill in the context of who can authorise the administration of drugs and a reporting mechanism that should provide greater protection.  There are times when that protection is needed.</p> <p>The Mental Health Commission is also very active in this area.  It is the HIQA of mental health services.  In the context of older people and disability, HIQA is equally active in this area.  I believe we have sufficient safeguards in the Bill and further agreed definitions will be introduced in the revised Mental Health Act.</p></speech>

Whatever about amendments Nos. 2, 4 or 5, surely to goodness there should be the acceptance of a definition?  If the Minister of State does not like our definition, she should present one of her own.  It is astonishing that a major term employed in the Bill should not be defined.  Everything else is defined.  Decision includes "classes of decisions", for example.  The Bill defines decision although many people would believe they know what that means.  Under the legislation, Act of 1995 means the Civil Legal Act of 1995 and so on.  There are so many definitions included.  Why is there an absence of a definition here?  I would have thought that because chemical restraint is such a clear term, it would need a definition.  The definition offered here is: "the intentional use of medication to control, modify or a person&rsquo;s behaviour or to ensure a patient is compliant or not capable of resistance when no medically identified condition is being treated, where the treatment is not necessary for the condition".</p></speech>

When SAGE put its case to me, I had to ask what was meant by the term "chemical restraint" because I wanted to make sure we were talking about the same thing.  This Bill, without a definition of chemical restraint, will not be strong enough to prevent the use of drugs to control behaviour for disciplinary or other purposes.  The term must be defined and clearly understood throughout the text of the Bill.  My thoughts go out to the poor, weak, vulnerable people who are being managed by drugs when talk therapy or other approaches would be more satisfactory.</p> <p>I also ask the Minister of State to clarify what she means when she says that chemical restraint should only be used in exceptional circumstances.  I agree with that but ask where that assurance is laid out in the Bill.</p></speech>

Let us say, for the sake of argument, we are talking here about a nurse or a care giver.  Is he or she actually called a "decision-making representative"?  A nurse or care giver may just be following someone's orders.  I would not be convinced at all about this, given the potential impact on the patient, sufferer or vulnerable person.  I would not be at all convinced that a person who is following instructions from a third party is a decision-making representative.</p></speech>

This subsection does not refer to chemical restraint or define same.  I note that the Minister of State is nodding so I am taking that to mean that the phrase does occur elsewhere in the Bill.  Her case is substantially weakened by virtue of the fact that subsection (9) of section 38 begins thus: "For the purposes of this section".  That limits it to this section, which means it is not an adequate definition.  It does not refer to chemical restraint as such.  It gives a definition that approximates to chemical restraint but it limits and confines it to this section.  Therefore, where chemical restraint occurs elsewhere in the Bill, there is no definition.</p></speech>

I know that is a bit of an &ldquo;ask&rdquo;, as they say, but I would be very grateful if she could.  That might help us to tease out whether a definition is required. </p></speech>

This is limited in two ways: first, the Government should amend the words "this section" because one could argue that it applies only in this section; second, a definition is vital and if the phrase &ldquo;chemical restraint&rdquo; appears elsewhere the Minister of State should give us the precise page references.  Given that the Minister of State said that a caregiver or a nurse would not be the decision-making representative prevented from administering a medication, which is not necessary for a medically identified condition, who are these decision-making representatives?  We need to know.  Is it an attorney?  Who are we talking about?</p></speech>

Amendment No. 76 is similar to amendment No. 56 and is a technical amendment to include the necessary cross-references to all provisions relating to offences in the Bill.  Amendment No. 82 is a technical amendment to introduce the necessary cross-reference to the functions of a co-decision-maker as set out in section 16.

The court will make a determination on an application by the director under subsection 2(<i>a</i>) where the latter believes a complaint to be well founded.  <br/><br/>Amendment No. 131 is a technical amendment to make clear the court's determination on applications on co-decision making is limited to matters arising from this part and to co-decision making.  <br/><br/>Amendment No. 232 clarifies that in any application to the court on an advanced healthcare directive, the applicant should inform the court of any enduring power of attorney regardless of whether it was registered under the Bill or the 1996 Act.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-12-09a.643" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015120900002#CCC00600"><p>I will take this as slowly as possible because it is a huge group of amendments.  I understand the Senator's frustration.  We will do this as painlessly as possible.  Amendment No. 9 is intended to define intervention more accurately as the actions which directly have an impact on a relevant person.  These can include an action by an intervener, a court order or a direction made by a court.  It is not appropriate to include rules of court or ministerial regulations within the definition as their impact would be indirect in nature and would not be focused on an individual case.  Accordingly, it is proposed to delete the references to rules of court or ministerial regulations from the definition of intervention.</p><p>Amendment No. 15 proposes to delete the words &quot;in accordance with the provisions of this Act&quot; from the definition of relevant person as the phrase is unnecessary to the meaning of the definition.  Amendment No. 18 proposes the deletion of a phrase which is unnecessary to the meaning of the provision.  It is intended that the provisions of section 3 will apply for all of purposes of this Bill.  Amendments Nos. 22 and 24 propose to delete the word &quot;relevant&quot; from the provisions relating to the donation of an organ or the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment.  Amendment No. 28 proposes to delete the word &quot;relevant&quot; from subsection (<i>9</i>) of section 8.  This is because the phrase &quot;relevant person&quot; means someone who lacks capacity.  As these provisions explicitly state that they relate to a person who lacks capacity, the reference to &quot;relevant&quot; is unnecessary.  </p><p>Amendment No. 46 is a technical amendment to introduce the necessary cross-reference to the criteria as set out in section 15 that make a person ineligible to be appointed as a co-decision maker.  Amendment No. 53 ensures that the definition of immediate family relates to both the appointer and the co-decision maker and not just the appointer who is a relevant person.  The purpose of amendment No. 54 is to correct a grammatical error.  Amendment No. 57 is a technical amendment to make the provision more precise.  Amendment No. 59 is a technical amendment that clarifies the intent of the provision that the functions of a co-decision maker shall be specified by the appointer in the co-decision-making agreement.  Amendment No. 60 is a technical amendment that clarifies the intent of the provision that the co-decision-maker shall assist the appointer with communicating his or her will and preferences.  Amendments Nos. 67 and 70 are technical amendments to specify that a co-decision-making agreement will be null and void if any of the circumstances specified in subsections (<i>1</i>) or (<i>2</i>) occur, that is, that a marriage or civil partnership is dissolved or the couple separate.  Amendment No. 68 is a technical amendment to clarify that the reference is to the co-decision-making agreement.</p><p>Amendment No. 72 is a technical amendment to specify that subsection (<i>6</i>) relates to a co-decision-making agreement which becomes null and void post-registration of the agreement.  Amendment No. 74 is a technical amendment to specify that the cross-reference should be to Chapter 5 of Part 14 of the Companies Act 2014.  Amendment No. 78 is a technical amendment to specify that the disqualification of a potential co-decision maker occurs when the court makes a declaration under section 34(<i>1</i>), that is, a declaration which declares the co-decision maker to lack capacity, unless assisted by a co-decision maker or even with the assistance of a co-decision maker.  Amendments Nos. 79 and 80 are drafting amendments to make the intent of the provisions clearer.  Amendment No. 83 corrects a grammatical error.</p><p>Amendment No. 84 clarifies that the application for registration of a co-decision-making agreement must include a copy of any notice given to specified parties.  Amendment No. 85 is a technical amendment to specify that the director&rsquo;s review of an application for a co-decision-making agreement will relate to establishing if the criteria set out in paragraphs (a) to (f) have been met.  Amendment No. 86 is a technical amendment to specify that one of the criteria that needs to be fulfilled is that the co-decision-maker is eligible for appointment according to the eligibility grounds set out in section 15.  Amendments Nos. 87 and 88 are technical amendments in the interests of consistency.  They propose that specified actions will be taken where the director is of the view that criteria have been satisfied.  </p><p>Amendments No. 89 and 90 are technical amendments to clarify that the capacity to make a decision is at issue rather than the decision in general.  Amendment No. 91 is a technical amendment to specify more clearly that an objection can be made to registration of a co-decision-making agreement if the potential co-decision maker is not eligible on the grounds set out in section 15(1).  Amendment No. 94 is a technical amendment to specify more precisely that the director&rsquo;s review of a co-decision-making agreement should be against the criteria set out in paragraphs (a) to (e).  Amendments Nos. 100, 102 and 103 are related amendments which propose that the director&rsquo;s view on the outcome of the review will be based on whether or not the criteria have been fulfilled.</p><p>The purpose of amendment No. 95 is to correct a typographical error.  Amendments Nos. 96 and 97 propose to delete the word &quot;effectively&quot; as it is a subjective term and difficult for a director to assess.  Amendment No. 98 is a technical amendment.  Amendments Nos. 99 and 101 are related amendments which clarify that the director is forming a view that the necessary criteria do not apply at the time of his or her review of the co-decision-making agreement.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Kathleen Lynch:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=656"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=656&amp;amp;pid=KathleenLynch&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The director is not making an assessment as to whether the criteria applied in the past.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 100, 102 and 103 are technical amendments that clarify the intent of the provision.  Amendment No. 104 is a technical amendment to replace the term "notice" with "notification".  The term "notification" is a more correct term in the provision that sets out the director's right to apply to the court for a determination, having notified the co-decision maker that he or she has failed to submit a report or has submitted an incomplete report.  The term "notice" relates more to the serving of notice to specified parties of the creation of an enduring power of attorney, for example.</p><p>Amendment No. 98 follows on from the change to the heading in the subsection.  Amendments Nos. 109 to 112, inclusive, are technical amendments changing "the" to "and".  The amendment is needed because a relevant person does not have the status of "the" appointer if a co-decision-making agreement is potentially null and void.  Amendment No. 113 is a technical amendment to make clear that the director's investigation will be on the matters that are the subject of the complaint.  Amendment No. 114 proposes a time limit of 21 days for a person to appeal a decision of the director that a complaint is not well founded.</p><p>Amendment No. 115 is to correct a typographical error.  Amendments Nos. 119 to 130, inclusive, are a series of technical amendments intended to make clearer the provisions of section 28.  Amendment No. 133 is a technical amendment to specify that the person commits an offence when he or she uses fraud, coercion or undue influence to force another person to make, vary or revoke a co-decision-making agreement.  Amendment No. 147 is a technical amendment to make clear that the decisions for which the person needs a co-decision-maker will be those set out in the court's declaration rather than in an application, potentially by a third party, to the court.</p></speech>

The proposed amendment No. 14 is intended to bring the Bill into compliance with the Data Protection Act by including a definition of "relevant information".  This definition will enable interveners, such as decision-making assistants, for instance, to know the categories of information that they can and cannot access.  Including the definition should also make clearer to an institution which categories of information can and cannot be given to an intervener.</p> <p>Amendment No. 43 proposes to delete subsections (3) and (4) of section 16 as the obligations arising for co-decision-makers are now set out in section 8.  The obligations now relate to all interveners rather than specifically to decision-making assistants.  Similarly, amendment No. 63 proposes to delete subsections (2) and (3) of section 11 as the obligations arising for decision-making assistants are now set out in section 8.</p> <p>Amendments Nos. 240 and 241 propose to introduce additional provisions into section 82 concerning the obligations that will apply to general visitors and special visitors if they seek records relating to a person with capacity difficulties as part of their role to support the director.  They will need to have access to such records mainly when they are examining a complaint received by the director relating to a person with capacity difficulties.

It also retains the provision for the general visitor or special visitor to interview the person.</p><p>The amendments propose a series of additional obligations to bring the provision into line with data protection obligations.  It requires the general visitor or special visitor to seek the consent of the person with capacity difficulties prior to seeking the records in question.  It proposes that the consent requirement can be dispensed with where the person has a decision-making representative or an attorney under an enduring power of attorney.  This is for the reason that if the special visitor or general visitor is examining a complaint, it may often be against a decision-making representative or an attorney.  It would not be appropriate, therefore, for the person against whom a complaint is potentially being made to have the possibility to refuse access by the special visitor or general visitor to the records in question.</p><p>The amendments would impose the following restrictions in terms of the records that can be sought.  These are limited to the records needed for the purposes of carrying out the task required by the director.  They would also require the special visitor or general visitor to keep the records secure from unauthorised access, use and disclosure.  They would require the special visitor or general visitor to dispose of the records when no longer needed.  To ensure these restrictions are complied with, they would require the director to carry out an annual check to ensure special visitors and general visitors are complying with these obligations.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 242 and 243 propose the same provisions and obligations on court friends as are specified in respect of general visitors or special visitors.  They require the court friend to seek the consent of the person with capacity difficulties prior to seeking the records in question.  They also propose that the consent requirement can be dispensed with where the person has a decision-making representative or an attorney under an enduring power of attorney.  This is for the reason that if the court friend is supporting a person with capacity difficulties in a court hearing, the interests of the incapacitated person may be at odds with those of a decision-making representative or an attorney.  It would not be appropriate to give them the power to refuse access to such records.</p></speech>

The Bill proposes to repeal, as previously agreed, the Marriage of Lunatics Act 1811, which seems so ridiculous now.  The Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871 will be repealed with the exception of the transitional arrangements of Part 6 to allow all adult wards to be discharged from wardship and-or migrated to the new options.

The principles include respect for the right to dignity, bodily integrity, privacy, autonomy and control of financial affairs.  These are important rights but a fundamental right that should be included as a guiding principle is the right to reside in a place of one's own choice where that is practicable.  This right for older persons is included in section 2 of the Council of Europe recommendations 2014 on the promotion of the human rights of older people and provides that older persons are entitled to lead their lives independently in a self-determined and autonomous manner.  This encompasses,<i>inter alia</i>, the taking of independent decisions with regard to all issues which concern them, including those regarding their property, income, finances, place of residence, health, medical treatment or care.  Older persons, in principle, should only be placed in a residential institution or psychiatric care with their free and informed consent and any exception to this principle must fulfil the requirements of Article 5.43 of the European Convention on Human Rights, in particular the right to liberty and security.</p><p>With regard to people with disabilities, the right to choose a place of residence is set out in Article 19(a) of the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities 2007, which provides, &quot;Persons with disabilities have the opportunity to choose their place of residence and where and with whom they live on an equal basis with others and are not obliged to live in a particular living arrangement&quot;.  Too often, current practice is not to afford the opportunity to a person to exercise his or her right to make a choice as to whether he or she would like to reside and not to consider what options and support are available and could be put in place in respect of the choice being made.  The spirit of the legislation requires us to do this and I would like the Minister of State to accept the amendment.  The inclusion of this right in the guiding principles will at least prompt the interventor to consider this right before making arrangements that are contrary to the wishes and preferences of the relevant person.  Each person's well-being and happiness, which we continually forget, should be the standard that society aspires to.</p><p>I know the Minister of State understands this better than anybody but we seem to think that as one gets older, one becomes a bigger economy.  Although they are necessary and do good work, too many care and residential homes are being built and not enough is being done to keep people in their own homes if that is what they wish and if that is practicable.  There is such a concept as the appropriateness of a home.  More residential settings or residential beds for the elderly are not needed because we have enough.  The Minister of State will be aware of residential institutions that are a home within a home all over Ireland.  Older people have to be free and they should never be incubated.</p><p>I mentioned the last time we discussed this topic in the House that if one left a dog on its own for three days, the ISPCA would be rapping on the door to find out why one did that.  Older people do not bark enough for attention but we accept that they are deserving of more than one hour's human contact per day.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2390"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2390&amp;amp;pid=MarieLouiseODonnell&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We accept that older people are deserving of more than one hour of human contact per day.  We should stop segregating them.  There is a kind of an apartheid in how we treat older people.  That is why I tabled this amendment which I hope the Minister of State will accept.  It proposes the inclusion of the words "to reside in the place of his or her choice in so far as that is practicable".  It is not always medically practical or possible but it should be a choice.  We have the money to keep people in homes that cost a &euro;1,000 a week for their care but we do not have the same amount of money to keep them within the community.  I do not understand that and that is reason I tabled this amendment.</p><p>I know the Minister of State understands this point but the fair deal scheme should start in the home.  People should be able to stay in their homes to which the fair deal scheme should apply.  It should not only apply if people go into a care or an institutionalised setting.  The Minister of State is very aware of my views on this.  This issue has become very apparent to me.  Sometimes things do not become apparent until they hit one right between the eyes with ageing parents.  One of the findings from a small study I did recently of the Civil Service is that the mean age of the staff is 46 and many of them spend a great deal of their lives caring for elderly parents.  We will all do it and we will all face our own mortality and growing old.  </p><p>I would like the Minister of State to consider including this amendment.  Inherent in that guiding principle section is the bodily integrity of the human being and the protection of finance but we must protect people in their homes and we must protect their decision-making in regard to the place they want to reside.  This brings up the  point other Senators made about ensuring people are not being cared for by strangers who make decisions on the hoof.  I would like the Minister of State to consider this genuine amendment.</p></speech>

I am fully supportive of amendment No. 26 tabled by Senator O'Donnell.  The Minister of State is very aware that Senator O'Donnell tabled a motion in recent months on this very issue.  We had an excellent debate on it  in this House.  What the Senator is trying to achieve is to ensure the principle and the right of people to have such a choice.  She has appropriately added the words "in so far as that is practicable".  She has included a safeguard appropriately and I support her proposal.</p></speech>

Her amendment includes the words "in so far as that is practicable".  I recall the turmoil of my elderly mother who wanted to live independently long after she was able to so do.  At one stage, we had a nurse caring for her and over a period of six months, &euro;54,000 was consumed.  What caused us to make the final decision was finding her lying on the floor of her apartment, where she had been lying for several hours.  We were confronted with the moral question as to whether we should make a decision for her.  My mother was very lucid and was with it most of the time.  It is that practical issue that I am trying to address.  While I would like to support what the Senator said, I need that teased out a little more.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-12-09a.740" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1170" speakername="Marie Louise O'Donnell" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015120900002#FFF02900"><p>I take Senator Craughwell's point.  I am making a more general argument about the way we are "processing" older people and that is the word for it in the sense that we will not consider having the fair deal scheme applying to the home in the same way that it operates in care settings but it would be helpful if could start there.  In the Senator's case, it was not a practical option for his mother.  Sometimes the decision is made.  I have aged parents and there is nothing that teaches one as quickly and as well as the human being in front of one as to how one should proceed.  It is a more general look at how we should treat older people.  We all talk about the dignity of protecting finances, bodily dignity and the dignity of the self but people want to reside in their homes.  This is not the only legislation in which it sought to bring this about, we are trying to do it from a community, social and health point of view.  If I was standing in the next election for the Government, it would be an issue on which I would be standing, that people would have the right to stay in their home where it is practical and where it is medically and psychologically feasible.  I understand the Senator's point but I was talking about it as a generality and I believe that is the way we should be going.  We should be looking at the home as the best place.  I understand also that if the fair deal scheme applied in the home, the Senator might not have had to make the financial gift he had to make every week for care.</p></speech>

All interveners will be obliged not to attempt to obtain or to use information acquired in relation to a relevant person other than for the purposes of the decision.  Interveners will also be required to ensure that the relevant information is safely stored to prevent unauthorised access, use and disclosure.  Furthermore, a requirement is proposed which would require an intervener to dispose of the information when that information is no longer required.  I think that covers Senator Norris's point regarding the deletion of text from another section; it is simply transposed and made stronger.</p></speech>

As the Senator rightly pointed out, there are many pieces of legislation into which these types of safeguards on will and preference should be inserted.  Unfortunately, this Bill is not the appropriate place because none of us has a right to decide where we are going to live or how we are going to live in many ways.  Of course we can decide if we have loads of money and that is possible, but the Senator's general point is that in the event that someone is already in situ in a home situation and they do not want to move from there, they should be afforded the opportunity to address that.</p> <p>It is nothing to do with this Bill, it is to do with the fair deal scheme.  We did look in the review at whether it was possible to offer the fair deal scheme in the home.  What we discovered is that if one were to apply it to a home situation, while it would be beneficial in certain circumstances it would not suit other people who do not have family to contribute because the fair deal scheme is very much based on a contribution from the person.  Despite the fact that one would be quite willing to make such a contribution for care, one would still have to heat one's home, eat and provide for all of the other needs.  There must be a different mechanism for doing that.  What we must do is build up community services.  Most of the factors that keep us well in our own community are issues outside of the remit of the Department of Health and the Minister of State with responsibility for older people.</p> <p>The next Government should create a new Department of social care, which would bring all of those related issues together to ensure that people at a later stage in their life who might need to dip in and out of services and require additional health care or support would be allowed to stay in their own homes.  Equally, we need additional nursing home beds because there are people, such as Senator Craughwell's mother, who are at a particular stage in life and no matter what one would put in place they cannot safely stay in their own homes.</p> <p>I accept Senator O'Donnell's point but, unfortunately, I cannot accept the amendment.  I hope that in another piece of legislation we might be able to make a more reassuring and secure commitment to ensuring people can make choices about what they want.  This Bill will allow people to make choices but, first, there is a big learning curve to address in terms of telling people who need to make decisions now and for them to get those who agree with their point of view, which is important, to make decisions with them.</p></speech>

Perhaps that is too creative.  One could ask if there is a right place for legislative measures.  I accept the point that the Bill concerns decision making and that if older people want to stay in their homes they cannot be forced out, if they have the capacity and wherewithal.  However, where does one start with legislation?  A measure such as the one I proposed should be enshrined in social, community, health and education legislation.  I am in two minds as to whether to press the amendment.  I appreciate the work that has been done on the Bill and that one cannot always have everything one wants.</p></speech>

What we seriously need to do is start to create different types of communities in order that one would not have circumstances whereby a person is in a home that is way too big for him or her, as a big house is difficult to heat and stairs are difficult to negotiate among other matters.  Perhaps we need to start from the perspective of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in terms of creating different types of housing.  I do not mean different types of communities because I do not want people to be segregated.  Members know my views in that regard.  We must ensure that we start to build more appropriate settings within communities for us as we age.</p></speech>

It is done in the name of health and safety but in fact it is the closing down of their freedom.  Some of them are so healthy and safe they are treated like babies and they are not allowed to think for themselves.  In effect, their liberty is taken away from them, for example, because they broke their arm and there is nobody to make their dinner on a Saturday.  I know the Minister has read the book by Atul Gawande, <i>Being Mortal</i>, and knows what we do to people when they get older.  The model is outrageous.  That is where politics should start - at the community level where people, if they want and can, stay in their towns and villages.</p></speech>

One of the items that gives particular difficulty is the question of financial management.  This has been a real thorn in the past.  I know that it has been said that, taken overall, the results have not been as bad as might have been expected but in some cases they have been spectacularly horrible and we want to ensure that the financial interests of somebody who is not capable of directing those financial interests themselves is properly addressed.</p><p>Amendment No. 239 also deals with the qualifications of this particular person.  The suggested wording is: &quot;is a person who, although not a registered medical practitioner, is, in the opinion of the Director, a person who has particular knowledge, expertise and experience of financial matters,&quot;.  In other words, we want somebody who is actually qualified, who has a knowledge of the markets, who will be able to give advice.  There is no point in having a medical quack there.  They may very well know what to prescribe in terms of medication but they do not know what to prescribe in terms of investments in stocks, shares and bonds.  What is required is a person who has financial expertise.  The amendment includes a reference to &quot;selected under <i>paragraph (c)</i>, will be a representative of the NTMA,&quot;.  The National Treasury Management Agency has a terrific record, a superb record in safeguarding the interests of this country.  It is one group on which we can rely.  The amendment also makes reference to the ability to &quot;provide expert guidance on reinvestment of the financial portfolio to sustain costs necessary to the relevant person,&quot;.  That is the whole point.  One invests in order to get the money to provide for the sustenance, well-being and financial security of the person who is a ward of court.  In addition, there is a requirement to &quot;provide annual reports to the relevant person&quot;.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There was a period of many years during which no reports were provided, which meant there was no account whatsoever of stewardship.  It is necessary that annual reports be provided in order that trustees or families can urge that a decision be made.</p><p>Amendment No. 244 deals with financial powers of oversight and management by the court and provides for what would happen in the absence of a suitable person to act as co-decision maker, or any other condition under which the court retains or assumes responsibility for the relevant person&rsquo;s funds.  In other words, where a question arises about the investment of the funds of a ward of court, the primary purpose of court management of the relevant person&rsquo;s funds would be the provision of adequate financial support to provide for medical and sundry expenses, which is more or less what I have said.  We need to ensure the correct personnel are put in place, which is the purpose of the first two amendments.  We then need to set out what they will be required to do, which is the purpose of the third amendment, in ensuring the provision of adequate financial support in the investment of funds.</p><p>Subsection (3)(a) of amendment No. 244 is extremely important.  It reads, "Assets must be invested in a manner designed to ensure the security, quality, liquidity and profitability of the portfolio as a whole, so far as is appropriate, having regard to the nature and duration of the expected liabilities".  In other words, there would be a requirement for prudent investment.  In the past this was not done and investment portfolios collapsed.  There was an almost arbitrary and care-free approach to investment of the funds of persons who were not in a position to do it themselves.  </p><p>Subsection (3)(b) provides that assets would have to be invested predominantly in regulated markets and so on.  In other words, they would have to invested in safe areas.  It would also provide that "investment in assets which are not admitted to trading on a regulated market must in any event be kept to a prudent level".  I do not know to what exactly this refers.  Perhaps it might relate to property folio investments such as investment in a block of apartments and so on.  However, such investments would have to be kept to a prudent level.  In other words, all of the eggs should not be put in the one basket.  </p><p>Subsection (3)(c) reads, "Assets must be properly diversified in such a way as to avoid excessive reliance on any particular asset, issuer or group of undertakings and so as to avoid accumulations of risk in the portfolio as a whole.  Investments in assets issued by the same issuer or by issuers belonging to the same group must not expose the scheme to excessive risk concentration".  In other words, where possible, risk would have to be avoided.  The average person in the street can be as careful as he or she likes and invest on speculative grounds, in which case he or she may make a killing or lose everything.  That is his or her decision, but a person who is incapable of making these decisions is reliant on another person to invest prudently and diversify in such a way as to avoid excessive reliance on a particular asset.</p><p>Subsection (3)(d) would constrain those making investments, in most circumstances, from investing in derivative instruments.  It was derivatives that caused the collapse of western European economies and the collapse started in the United States.  The toxic bundles were put together by the clever stockbrokers and financial advisers who are still being consulted by the Government and appointed as advisers.  Nobody knew what was in the bundles: they were just derivatives.  The amendment would provide for constraint against excessive investment in such instruments which could only be made in so far as they would contribute to a reduction of investment risks or facilitate efficient portfolio management.</p><p>Subsection (4) reads, "Annual financial reports on the condition, progress, and management of relevant person&rsquo;s funds; both liquid funds and investments; will be made available to (a) the court, and (b) relevant persons".  Accountability is important.  </p><p>Subsection (5) reads, "If an endowment as individual principal value falls by 10%, or more, within one financial quarter, the portfolio will be liquidised into cash...".  I would like to give an example of where this would come into play, but I will, first, make some general remarks on the question of wardship.  Where the High Court approves an award for personal injuries suffered and a plaintiff who is deemed to have a capacity deficit is made a ward of court because he or she does not have the capacity to make appropriate decisions for himself or herself, in respect of which he or she has no choice, funds are not released to meet his or her needs until such time as the process has been completed.  </p><p>There have been many difficulties with ward of court funds which are held in investments by the Courts Service.  Following a Committee of Public Accounts review in 2000, it was determined that no audits had been carried out for two decades.  The Bill seeks to address that issue.  The amendments to which I am speaking seek to strengthen and reinforce what is provided for in the Bill in that regard.  Even after it was discovered that there had been no audits for 20 years, there was no look-back or review carried out.  The Courts Service was then established and the accounts of the courts were computerised.  The management of funds was put out to tender.  The new structure provided for four strands of investment, some of which involved greater exposure to equities and bonds than others.  Those that were heavily exposed fared poorly during the financial crisis and some wards' funds suffered serious losses.  The Courts Service states the funds have performed well overall compared to similar funds.  In this regard, key is the word "overall" because not all funds performed well and there are no similar funds.  We are speaking not about regular investors but about vulnerable people under the protection of the State.  There were no cash reserves held for wards of court to meet emergencies.  It is extraordinary that a person would gamble on the Stock Exchange and not hold back a little to look after people in this position.  There is a concern about the management, investment, auditing and accountability of funds.  Funds were audited internally, but errors were not always picked up.  An audit is instigated by the Courts Service, but as funds are not audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, there is no accountability.  There is a sum of &euro;1.5 billion in the funds.  </p><p>I would like to outline a specific case which was brought to my attention by parents whose son, as far as I can recollect, had been injured, in respect of which he received compensation.  In a two year period between May 2007 and April 2009 the fund diminished from &euro;510,685.02 to &euro;280,145.71; in other words, it was halved, but that is not the end of it.  The last statement the parents received showed that the value of the fund at the end of 2014 was &euro;186,490.85.  This means that the fund had decreased from almost &euro;511,000 to &euro;186,000, which was an astonishing collapse and worse than the cut in my income as a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  According to the parents, a further &euro;40,000 can be deducted from this amount for expenses in 2015.  With little earnings, the fund will be down to almost &euro;150,000 by the end of the year.  The officials say the ward's fund will only last a few years.  If it had been managed appropriately. he would not be in this position.  In other words, the fund will have reduced from &euro;510,000 to &euro;150,000.  In view of what it costs per year to care for this young man, &euro;46,000, the money will be gone in less than four years.  What is he to do then?</p><p>Quite apart from understanding the complex nature of these investments in unitised funds which have a strong exposure to equities, if one does simple maths, one will see that these funds have not recovered.  When one takes the figure of &euro;510,685, the value of the fund in May 2007, and deducts from it &euro;186,490, the amount at the date of the last statement, one is left with a figure of &euro;324,194.17.  When this figure is divided by seven, the seven period 2007 to 2004, one gets a figure of &euro;46,313 per annum.  The moneys drawn down during these years would not have reached this amount every year, but the point the parents of this young man make is that if they had kept the money in a drawer and drawn down only what was needed, their son would not be any worse off, yet the funds are in the Courts Service for their protection.  In other words, had they kept the money under a mattress, they would be in at least as good, if not a better, position than they are having had the money invested.  For this reason, the safeguards contained in the three amendments are vitally necessary to protect the welfare and interests of wards of court.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Our contention is that the Courts Service has failed in its duty of care to those vulnerable people and has been covering this up by saying that overall funds have performed well.  It is no excuse and it is not good enough.  We need good governance for these funds.  I am sorry if I have taken a while but it is a complex matter and is at the kernel of the welfare of wards of courts because they are financially vulnerable.  If we do not ensure that best practice is followed for these people, we are abandoning them to their fate.  I urge the Minister of State to take on board the content of these amendments.</p></speech>

I support amendment No. 27 and the rest of the amendments.  We have discussed the matter in detail for the past three weeks.  I contacted the Minister of State's office about it when I saw this amendment.  As Senator Norris noted, the current situation has allowed the funds to dwindle.  I have a graph showing how funds dwindled for one ward of court.  The people around this individual knew nothing about it.  It was all gone.  They woke up in the morning and asked where it went.  That is not good enough.  We must ensure that we do not let that happen.  The funds are not nice collections of money.  They are needed for the care of vulnerable citizens.  As our economy changes, and I grant we must be open, the funds invested will change.  The least we are asking is that when they are dwindling, the people around wards of court are informed annually.  As Senator Norris noted, two decades passed without any audit of funds.  That is not right.  These amendments will change that and make the investment of funds transparent in respect of oversight and management.</p><p>In other areas, the Bill introduces a lot of transparency to the protection of the most vulnerable.  In respect of managing money, we all know money sometimes attracts people who may not have the best interests of the person at heart.  At least, everybody needs to know what is going on when the funds are managed by the courts.  Amendments Nos. 27, 239 and 244 aim to bring about three changes that are crucial to making this Bill one that will work for the vulnerable person.  They assert that the purpose of court management of funds is the support of the welfare of the relevant person, provide for annual reports on the funds to the court and the relevant person and establish a safeguard against the freefall of funds.  Having spoken to people who speak for very vulnerable people, I know that the changes proposed in those three amendments are necessary and I ask the Minister of State to support them.  </p><p>When we look at amendment No. 244, are we looking for something that is too certain?  I would be prepared to reintroduce this amendment on Report Stage with sections 121(1)(a), 121(1)(b), 121(4)(a), 121(4)(b) and section 121(5) retained and sections 121(2), 121(3)(a), 121(3)(b), 121(3)(c) and 121(3)(d) removed.  Section 3(a) states that:</p><blockquote>Assets must be invested in a manner designed to ensure the security, quality, liquidity and profitability of the portfolio as a whole, so far as is appropriate, having regard to the nature and duration of the expected liabilities.</blockquote> <p>This section might be looking for too much security.  How does one ensure security?  We would all love to know that in respect of every share we invest.  I urge the Minister of State to accept amendments Nos. 27 and 239.  We will be pressing the matter because we have discussed it previously.  If Senator Norris is in agreement, I would be prepared on Report Stage to look at retaining sections 121(1)(a), 121(1)(b), 121(4)(a), 121(4)(b) and 121(5) and removing 121(2),121(3)(a), 121(3)(b), 121(3)(c) and 121(3)(d) in respect of amendment No. 244.  I am being more realistic in making a bit of a deal with the Minister of State in this regard.  Senators Conway and Cummins and I would like to support Senator Norris in this regard.  I thank Senator Norris for carrying out a lot of research on it and I also thank the groups we met.  </p></speech>

I also support what I referred to at the beginning of the debate.  I support Senator Norris.  As Senator Keane so eloquently put it, it is important we ensure that the most vulnerable people have money that is being invested.  I add my support to that.  I also ask the Minister of State to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

It is our responsibility to challenge the Government and this means people on the Government side as well.  I get criticised because I probably do it too much.  The money of the most vulnerable should not be subject to boom and bust.  The rest of society suffers enough from that.  I would probably have gone a step further than Senator Norris and insisted that the investment be in blue chip Government bonds because I certainly would not trust the banks.  We saw what happened to the banks and all that went with it.</p></speech>

The only way we as citizens can offer blue chip assurance is by investing in Government bonds and products.  We have a duty to do everything we can and to make sure this legislation underpins that to ensure that it is guaranteed because, ultimately, we do not have the right to gamble with this set of resources.</p></speech>

I mean no disrespect to the parliamentary counsel but the amendments are very well drafted.  I agree with colleagues on the opposite side that they should be accepted.  The case outlined by Senator Norris concerned an unfortunate individual who ended up in dire financial straits because of the manner in which his money was invested by the Courts Service.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Diarmuid Wilson:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2017"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2017&amp;amp;pid=DiarmuidWilson&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I would go further to suggest he might have a legal case against the Courts Service because I consider it to have been completely irresponsible in the manner in which it invested that money.  Moreover, as Senators Norris and Keane have pointed out, it is totally unbelievable that in respect of an arm of the State, no audit has been conducted for more than two decades.  I urge the Minister of State to accept these amendments.  Perhaps, as Senator Keane suggested, too much financial security is being sought but when one is dealing with wards of court and vulnerable people, I do not think one can have too much security.  Consequently, if the Minister of State cannot accept the amendments now, I urge her to agree to consider them again on Report Stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-12-09a.778" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015120900002#KKK00200"><p>I listened with interest because as public representatives, this issue has come to the attention of all Members, namely, the awful devastation when people get a statement and make a discovery about money they believed to be absolutely secure and people will ask how much more secure can it be than when the courts are minding it for them.</p> <p>However, we are moving away from a court system and that is why the amendments are not relevant.  While I understand perfectly what the Senator is saying, as soon as this Bill is enacted everyone will be out of wardship within a three-year period.  Their funds will be returned to them to manage as they please, in some cases with co-decision-makers, and with the advice of people such as their bank manager, a financial adviser, their parents or perhaps a friend who has knowledge of these matters.</p> <p>I commend the Senator's foresight because the Government is moving away from a court-based system.  While the Bill was being debated in the D&aacute;il, one amendment proposed the extension of wardship should be done within six months and the argument was put to the Government that this could not be done because some people are ready right now to exit wardship.  Some people will not be ready even at the end of the three-year period, I refer to the need to put together the security package that gives them the freedom to make those decisions for themselves, but on exiting wardship, their funds will be returned to them.  The Government has asked for advice on the three amendments and in particular, has sought advice from the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, because its staff, as Senator Norris rightly observed, have more expansive knowledge in this regard and they worry that perhaps it would not be beneficial to the individuals involved, except for people who get enormous sums.  Moreover, even this will change in the future, in terms of how payments will be made.</p></speech>

Even though it is an enormous sum, as the Senator noted, one has no indication as to what can happen in respect of stocks, bonds and all those things unless one puts it into the drawer at the bottom of the bed and does nothing with it.  That is the only protection but I am not certain it would last very long.</p> <p>However, the Government is moving away from wardship and moving away entirely from a court-protected system and people then will be empowered, with protections and advice from whomsoever they choose in respect of those matters.  Everyone then must trust that the right decisions are made; people sometimes do not but then again, that is what this Bill is about, namely, the right to make the wrong decision for oneself, because we all make wrong decisions.  While I commend the Senator's foresight, the Government is moving away from what the Senator is proposing and I know he will appreciate that.</p></speech>

As Senator Norris noted previously, there is no point in such a person having medical expertise.  It will be necessary to have financial "expertise and experience of financial matters, as respects the capacity of persons", even though that person might not be a medical practitioner.  While I grant to the Minister of State that we are moving away from the courts, this is why such a provision still is needed.  However, in moving away from the courts, I note the Bill contains absolutely nothing in respect of the special visitor or the person put in care to specify there should be an annual report or financial statement to that person.  This is absolutely relevant for transparency and is necessary.</p></speech>

This must be specific and as Senator Keane has stated, it must be someone with financial expertise.

Is it responsible on the part of society to hand somebody who is brain-damaged a huge bunch of money and tell him or her to go off and make mistakes?  That is Reaganomics; it really is western capitalism at its worst to let these people have their pensions and then to allow them rot in the gutter.  I do not believe in letting people who are so disadvantaged make mistakes.  Proper safeguards are needed to ensure they do not make mistakes.  One cannot project what will happen three years into the future.  There always will be people who will be reliant on guidance of whatever kind and to include this amendment, even if it is guidance for future legislation, is absolutely necessary.  I am proposing an annual report in light of the fact that there were no audits of any kind and no account given for two decades.  This appears blindingly obvious to me and even were it only for the next three years, it would be absolutely necessary in light of the history of these funds.</p></speech>

The court then will appoint and the court will be responsible.  That is what this is about, that is, in any situation in which a person is not available or deemed unsuitable to act as a decision-maker, the court retains this responsibility.  While the court retains responsibility, Members are trying to ensure that within that responsibility, there must be safeguards for the people themselves.  Such responsibility will come out through an annual report to the court and to the person appointed, to make that quite clear.  While a court may appoint a person, I refer to the elapse of two decades without an audit and it is to be hoped this kind of thing would not happen again.  The purpose of the amendment is to try to bring greater transparency to the process.</p></speech>

I now am speaking directly to the people with that experience because I acknowledge there is concern that this somehow is going too far or that it is giving a level of discretion to certain people who do not have capacities.  While I accept this, the type of language expressed by the Senator really is not helpful.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Kathleen Lynch:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=656"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=656&amp;amp;pid=KathleenLynch&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Clearly, if someone does not have capacity, which is very rare, and does not have relations or a circle of friends to call on, the court will appoint.  It will do so on the basis that the person it is appointing will have responsibility for the well-being of the person concerned, including his or her financial property and welfare.  That is essential.</p><p>Everyone has the right to make a wrong decision.  We hope to have people around us who love and respect us, who will be charged with caring for us and directing us.  This is something we need to get our heads around.  The director of the decision support service will be obliged to give financial information.  It would not be appropriate for a special visitor to give that advice.  For instance, what would happen if it did not work out?  Would the person concerned be held liable?  The director can give advice on financial matters and the possibilities in that regard rather than directing someone to invest.  We all make these decisions every day.  With enough support and decision makers around us, even people with limited capacity will be able to make them.</p><p>The courts will appoint a suitable person and the director will accommodate by ensuring it is someone from a panel who will be an accountant or a fund manager and will have the expertise required to manage extensive funds.  It is important that Senators realise we have made provision to cover all possibilities.  We have been formulating the Bill for three years and there is not a single issue we have not come across or addressed.  It is not the first time we have come across this issue.  We all have.  The special visitor would not be the appropriate person to do this as his or her remit is entirely different; it is to ensure the person concerned is properly looked after and, where there is an investigation to be held, that it takes place.  The co-decision maker or person appointed to support the person who lacks capacity has to make a statement every single year, not to the courts but to the director.  If he or she is appointed to advise on financial issues, he or she will have to make a statement to the director on those financial affairs.  If the issue concerns health, welfare or other aspects, that is different.  He or she has to make a return every single year to the director and, if the director finds that this has not happened, he or she will have the power to either remove the person or investigate the matter.  There are extensive powers for the director and extensive safeguards for the relevant person.  This needs to be understood.</p><p>There is not a single element in terms of amendments, suggestions or contributions of which we have not thought.  Where we had not thought of something and where it was new and possible, we brought it forward by way of an amendment.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-12-09a.825" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015120900002#MMM00400"><p>Amendments Nos. 30 to 42, inclusive, and amendments Nos. 44 and 45 propose to align the provisions relating to decision-making assistants with those already agreed for co-decision makers.  Amendment No. 30 is intended to clarify that a person must be 18 years or over to be appointed as a decision-making assistant, reflecting the responsibility involved in supporting decision-making by a vulnerable person.  I propose amendment No. 31 arising from the consultations held with disability groups last month.  A request was made that a relevant person should be able to have more than one decision-making assistant.  I explored the feasibility of the request and I am pleased to propose an amendment which will allow a person to appoint more than one decision-making assistant.  This will enable an elderly mother to appoint all of her children to act as decision-making assistants and to have the right to source information on her behalf.</p> <p>Amendment No. 32 proposes to delete subsections (6) to (12), inclusive.  This is to align the provisions on assisted decision-making with those already agreed for co-decision-making.  Amendment No. 33 proposes to align the categories of persons who will not be eligible to be decision-making assistants with those agreed for co-decision- makers.  The provisions are largely similar to those already in place in regard to decision-making assistants.</p> <p>Amendment No. 34 proposes that a decision-making assistant's agreement will be null and void if there is a decision-making order, decision-making representation order, advanced health care directive or a registered enduring power of attorney already in place in respect of the decisions encompassed by the decision-making assistant agreement.  The reason for this amendment is if a person has a decision-making representative to take decisions on these matters it confirms that the relevant person lacks capacity to make these decisions.</p> <p>Amendment No. 35 proposes to insert a new section 13 to align the categories of persons disqualified from being decision-making assistants with those already agreed for co-decision-makers; for example, a spouse or civil partner will be disqualified if they separate from the relevant person and if the marriage or civil partnership is dissolved.  Similarly, a cohabitant will be disqualified if they separate from the relevant person.  These provisions are intended to protect the relevant person against a former partner seeking to use the person's incapacity to gain control over the person's property and affairs.  The provisions are largely similar to those already set out in the Bill in regard to decision-making assistants.  As a new provision they provide for the situation in which a civil partnership is annulled or dissolved in a State other than Ireland.  The ex-civil partner would be disqualified from acting as a decision-making assistant in these circumstances.</p> <p>Section 13 retains the provision which disqualifies persons from being decision-making assistants if they have had for example safety or barring orders issued against them in respect of the relevant person.  The existing provisions preventing a person from acting as a decision-making assistant on property and affairs, if convicted of fraud, etc., is also retained.</p> <p>Amendment No. 35 seeks to make clear that the functions of a decision-making assistant will be as specified in the decision-making agreement.  It is intended to underline the control that will continue to be exercised by the relevant person over the agreement.  As previously indicated, he or she will be free to revoke the agreement at any time.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Kathleen Lynch:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=656"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=656&amp;amp;pid=KathleenLynch&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Amendment No. 36 is intended to make clearer that the decision-making assistant&rsquo;s role will be to assist the appointer in terms of accessing relevant information.  Relevant information is defined as information to which the appointer is entitled and that is needed for the purposes of the decision.  The objective is to ensure that a decision-making assistant does not seek to use the role to source other information that is not relevant to the decision.  Amendment No. 37 is a technical amendment to clarify the intent of the provision.  Amendments Nos. 38 to 42, inclusive, are drafting amendments to make the provisions clearer.  Amendment No. 44 inserts a new provision to clarify that a relevant decision is the appointer&rsquo;s decision even if taken with a decision-making assistant.</p><p>Amendment No. 45 proposes to insert a new section 12 dealing with complaints in relation to decision-making assistants.  The new section mirrors section 27 of the Bill which deals with complaints against co-decision-makers.  The proposed new section sets out new provisions enabling complaints to be made about the suitability or conduct of decision-making assistants.  Provision is made here for the director, having been satisfied that a complaint is well-founded, to apply to court for a determination.  An additional safeguard is provided by allowing the director to investigate a matter and bring it to court notwithstanding that no complaint has been received.</p></speech>

The person has to be "capable" of performing the role.  Amendment No. 71 proposes to amend the provisions relating to dissolution of civil partnership to encompass dissolutions occurring in other states.  The former civil partner will be ineligible to act as a decision-making assistant or co-decision-maker.  Amendment No. 81 is intended to make clearer the remedies available to a third person if he or she unknowingly relies on a co-decision-making agreement which is later found to be null and void.  My amendment proposes that the third party would not be prevented from recovering damages for any loss incurred as a result of unknowingly relying on a null and void co-decision-making agreement.</p> <p>Amendment No. 92 proposes an additional ground for objection to the registration of a co-decision-making agreement, namely, that a false statement is included in the application to register the agreement.  Amendment No. 93 is intended to specify more clearly that the director can take action only if an objection has been received within the time period of five weeks specified in subsection (1).</p> <p>Amendment No. 105 proposes an additional provision that would allow the director to make inquiries where an incomplete report has been submitted and to be satisfied that the report is in order.  This provision allows the director the flexibility to accept an incomplete report where the circumstances warrant it.  The provision would benefit co-decision-makers who are caring for the relevant person and who may not have the time, because of that caring responsibility, to submit a report that is absolutely in line with the regulations but where the information submitted confirms that there are no issues arising with the operation of the co-decision-making agreement.</p> <p>Amendment No. 108 clarifies that the grounds for complaint against a co-decision-maker is that he or she is acting outside the scope of his or her functions.  Senator Jillian van Turnhout clearly expressed her views in this regard.  Amendment No. 117 is intended to specify more precisely that the court can make a determination when an appeal has been made under the new subsection (3) and within the time limit of 21 days specified in that subsection.</p> <p>Amendment No. 118 is a technical amendment to delete the phrase "which was the subject of a complaint to the Director".  The reason for the amendment is that the court may make a determination both on an issue which was the subject of a complaint to the director and on an application made by the director where no complaint has been received.  In the latter case, the director will make an application where he or she believes that a serious issue has arisen in relation to the operation of the co-decision-making agreement which warrants consideration by the court.</p> <p>Amendment No. 132 is a technical amendment to specify the cross-reference between the obligation in section 17(8) for an appointer or a co-decision-maker to notify the director of the nullity of a co-decision-making agreement and the corresponding provision in section 30 setting out the director&rsquo;s role when this notice has been received.</p></speech>

I ask the Minister of State to listen to what I have to say and perhaps consider revising it and coming back to it on Report Stage.  Amendment No. 65 provides that a co-decision maker may refuse to acquiesce with an appointer's decision where it is reasonably foreseeable that the decision will result in harm to the appointer or to another person.  I believe this is too restrictive on the autonomy of the appointer.  We all enjoy the dignity of risk to take decisions that can carry a risk of harm to ourselves.  For example, if the appointer wishes to consent to a new surgery which she believes will benefit her condition but the surgery has a reasonably foreseeable risk of harm, would we really want a co-decision maker to be able to prevent her from taking that decision?  I believe this amendment should be revised to ensure that the harm, in addition to being reasonably foreseeable, should be imminent and of a grave nature.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jillian van Turnhout:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2391"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2391&amp;amp;pid=JillianVanTurnhout&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That would bring the Bill closer to its goal of respecting the will and preferences of the person concerned.  I ask the Minister of State to take another look at the amendment because I have a concern about offering choice.  I argue all the time for what is best in the interests of the child.  I realise that when one is no longer a child, we are all allowed to make decisions as adults that may not necessarily be in our best interests.  That is what we want to do and we should be allowed to do so.  This amendment is not in keeping with the spirit of the Bill.  We should, therefore, consider inserting the words "imminent and of a grave nature".  Who will have the power to make a decision about undergoing new surgery?</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 135 to 137, inclusive, involve the deletion of the provision whereby the court can make a declaration in terms of a person&rsquo;s capacity to marry.  As the Bill is not altering the existing law in terms of marriage, it is not appropriate that the court should have a role in making a declaration regarding a person&rsquo;s capacity to marry.  The capacity to marry is governed by extensive statute law and common law which should more appropriately apply to it rather than this Bill.</p> <p>Amendment No. 140 involves the deletion of provisions concerning costs for applications.  It is appropriate that section 33(7)(a) should be deleted as the principle that the costs are borne by the parties who retain legal representation is a general one.  There is no need to restate it in this legislation.  It will apply to this Bill without having to be specifically referenced.</p> <p>Similarly, with regard to section 33(7)(b), the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 will apply to proceedings under this Bill and there is no need to reference it specifically.  I am removing a provision that might be detrimental to a relevant person in section 33(7)(c).  As it stands, a person or an organisation can take an application to have a person declared as lacking capacity and can have the legal costs borne out of the person&rsquo;s assets.  That potentially creates the risk that a person might mischievously seek a declaration that another person lacks capacity to gain control of his or her assets.  There would be no disincentive as the costs of the proceedings would be borne by the relevant person.  I propose to remove this provision for this reason,</p> <p>Amendment No. 142 is a technical amendment.  As the Bill specifies the parties who are to be notified of applications, it is not appropriate for these to be determined by rules of court.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-12-09a.1142" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015120900002#PPP03800"><p>Amendments Nos. 149 to 162, inclusive, propose a series of amendments to align the provisions on decision-making representatives with those agreed for co-decision-makers.  The intention is that the more robust safeguards agreed for co-decision-makers would be applied to decision-making representation.</p> <p>Amendment No. 149 seeks to make clear that a person must be 18 or over to be appointed as a decision-making representative in view of the level of responsibility potentially arising from this role.  Amendment No. 150 seeks to clarify the boundaries that will apply between the functions of a decision-making representative and the terms of an advance healthcare directive or an enduring power of attorney.  The court will be required to ensure the order appointing a decision-making representative is consistent with the terms of an advance healthcare directive and with the powers of a designated healthcare representative.  The order will also have to be consistent with the terms of an enduring power of attorney and with the functions of an attorney.  The reason they take precedence is because an advance healthcare directive and an enduring power of attorney are direct expressions of the will and preferences of the person.</p> <p>Amendment No. 151 proposes to align the categories of person who will not be eligible to be decision-making representatives with those agreed for co-decision-makers.  The provisions are largely similar to those in place in respect of decision-making representatives.</p> <p>Amendment No. 152 inserts a new section 37.  The section proposes to align the categories of person disqualified from being decision-making representatives with those agreed for co-decision-makers.  A spouse or civil partner will be disqualified if he or she separates from the relevant person and if the marriage or civil partnership is dissolved.  Similarly, a cohabitant will be disqualified if he or she separates from the person.  These provisions are intended to protect the person against a former partner seeking to use the person&rsquo;s incapacity to gain control over the person&rsquo;s property and affairs.  They are largely similar to those set out for decision-making representatives.  One new provision is that they provide for a situation in which a civil partnership is annulled or dissolved in a state other than Ireland.</p> <p>Amendment No. 153 proposes two new subsections which seek to respond to the concerns of Senators that the duty to ascertain the relevant person&rsquo;s will and preferences be given priority.  The first duty will be to ascertain, in so far as is possible, the person&rsquo;s will and preferences.  The second amendment proposes to move the provisions of subsection (4) to become subsection (2) of this section.  The provisions are as agreed.  The intention is to highlight the duty on the decision-making representative to act as the relevant person&rsquo;s agent and in service to that person.</p> <p>Amendment No. 154 moves the provisions, currently in section 38(5) into a new section.  This is in the interests of clarity as the previous section 38 covered too many different issues.  No change is envisaged to the provisions as agreed.</p> <p>Amendment No. 155 proposes to move the provision currently in section 36(8) into section 37 in the interests of structuring the Part more clearly.  No change is envisaged to the provisions as agreed.</p> <p>Amendment No. 158 proposes to modify the provisions of section 38(7) to specify that the scope available to a decision-making representative to make a decision on the carrying out or refusing of life-sustaining treatment is subject to the terms of an advance healthcare directive.  Similarly, the amendment proposes that the decisions of a designated healthcare representative will take precedence over those of a decision-making representative on these matters. This is because the advance healthcare directive is the direct expression of the will and preferences of the relevant person on such matters.  Equally, the designated healthcare representative will have been appointed specifically by the person to take these decisions if and when they arise.</p> <p>Amendments Nos. 159 and 160 propose a new section 39 which set out the provisions that would apply in terms of the register of decision-making representatives.  The provisions are in line with those agreed for co-decision-makers.  It is proposed that the Minister would specify by regulation the bodies and classes of person entitled to access the register.  In the interests of the person&rsquo;s privacy, it is not appropriate that a register would be accessible to the public.  However, it is intended that anyone needing to know if a person has a decision-making representative will be able to apply to the director for that information.</p> <p>Amendment No. 161 proposes a new section 40 setting out the provisions relating to the reporting obligations to be imposed on the decision-making representative.  These are in line with the provisions agreed for co-decision-makers.  They retain the provisions in subsections (6) and (7) of section 36 but add a number of key protections.  They set out the procedures that will apply if a decision-making representative fails to submit a report or submits an incomplete report.  The director will contact the decision-making representative on this issue.  If the decision-making representative continues to fail to submit a complete report, the director will have the power to apply to the court for a determination on whether the decision-making representative should continue in the role.  It is important to add these provisions as a safeguard for the relevant person.  Reporting is intended as the primary means by which the director will supervise the decision-making representative.  The director will be unable to perform this supervisory function adequately if he or she does not have the possibility to engage with the decision-making representative on the reports or to seek the court&rsquo;s determination where the representative fails to comply with the obligations.</p> <p>Amendment No. 162 proposes a new section 41 which sets out the complaints mechanism that will apply where complaints are made against decision-making representatives.  A person will be able to make a complaint where the representative is acting or proposing to act beyond the scope of the functions specified in the court order.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Kathleen Lynch:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=656"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=656&amp;amp;pid=KathleenLynch&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A person will be able to make a complaint where the representative is acting or proposing to act beyond the scope of the functions specified in the court order.

It is proposed that the director will be able to investigate the complaint to see if it is well founded.  If it is, he or she will be able to apply to the court for a determination.  He or she will also be able to launch investigations on his or her own initiative.  If a complaint is not well founded, the director will notify the complainant who will be able to appeal the decision to the court.</p></speech>

It provides that a decision making representative can not only be remunerated for expenses incurred in the performance of his or her duties but also if approved by the court.  This payment will be made from the assets of the relevant person rather than by the State.  I am concerned that this violates the constitutional right of the relevant person to private property.  In addition to the human rights violation in having one's legal capacity to make decisions removed, the amendment ensures the person whose right to make decisions is being removed will also have to pay for the privilege of this violation through his or her own assets.  I ask the Minister of State to reconsider the amendment.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 163, 165 and 166 provide that the wardship court shall not review the capacity of a ward but rather make a declaration under section 46(1).  The amendments are necessary because the existing provisions do not correctly describe what is envisaged.  Where a person has been admitted to wardship without reference to his or her capacity such as in the case of many minor wards, he or she can be discharged from wardship without reference to his or her capacity.  The wardship court will not look again at the ward's capacity, which is what the previous provisions implied.  Instead, it will review the ward&rsquo;s case and, where necessary, make a determination as to his or her capacity.  No change of policy is envisaged by these provisions.</p> <p>A new provision is proposed that will allow the wardship court to continue its jurisdiction, pending the discharge of a ward or the ward&rsquo;s migration to the new options foreseen under the Bill.  The amendments will allow payments, for instance, to continue to be made, pending the court hearing on a ward&rsquo;s case.  This is to ensure there will be continuity in the provisions in place for wards throughout the process of moving from wardship to discharge or the new options.  The amendments do not change in any way the deadlines already set in the provisions.  Wardship will be phased out for adults within three years of the commencement of Part 6.  A minor ward will be entitled to a court hearing of his or her case no later than six months after his or her 18th birthday.  </p> <p>Amendment No. 169 proposes to replace section 47 with a new section.  The provisions repealing the Marriage of Lunatics Act 1811 and the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871 have been moved to section 7.  Some saving provisions are needed to ensure orders of the wardship court made before this Part is commenced will remain valid, even if the 1871 Act is repealed.  This is to provide certainty in terms of payments to third parties and so forth.</p> <p>It is proposed to delete section 49.  The provisions of the Bill are essentially for adults.  Adult wardship will be abolished over a three year period.  It is important that boundaries not be blurred between the current arrangements and the arrangements foreseen under the Bill.  To make this clear, the role of the director of the decision support service will relate exclusively to adults.  He or she will not have a role in the case of minor wards.  Any matter relating to minor wards will continue to be handled by the Office of the Wards of Court.  The amendment makes clear the separation that will apply between the Office of the Wards of Court and the decision support service.</p></speech>

Since the Bill is being developed as part of Ireland's preparations to ratify the UN convention, the functional assessment of mental capacity must be replaced with a process of interpreting the will and preferences of the individual.  This will ensure that when people need help to make decisions, they will be supported in doing so, rather than have their legal rights to make decisions removed.  </p><p>On a broader note, Inclusion Ireland has concerns about the review of the position of wards.  I highlight these concerns and invite a response from the Minister of State.  Inclusion Ireland argues that Part 6 of the Bill applies to people who are wards of court.  The sections therein allow for a review by the ward or somebody who appears to the wardship court to have sufficient interest or expertise in the welfare of the ward.  Inclusion Ireland has received communications from a number of concerned families in this regard.  Many family members are concerned about the reference to the &quot;welfare&quot; of the ward and the broadness of the category, as preference in persons acting as co-decision makers and decision making representatives is given to a relative or friend of the appointer who has had such personal contact with the appointer over a period of time that there is a relationship of trust between them.  Inclusion Ireland is stating it would be preferable if this category was introduced before the aforementioned phrase &quot;sufficient interest or expertise&quot;.  I ask the Minister of State to comment on this suggestion.</p></speech>

I am looking at the feasibility of the Senator's proposal and seeking legal advice on the matter.  Given that the Bill is driven by consultation to ensure we get it right and subject to the legal advice being what we expect it to be, I will be tabling an amendment on Report Stage broadly along the lines of that proposed by the Senator.  I hope that will satisfy him.</p> <p>In terms of wardship, it is important that we be very clear in the Bill.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Kathleen Lynch:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=656"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=656&amp;amp;pid=KathleenLynch&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Quite recently, I had a visit from a very caring and very young family.  They wanted to talk to me about an adult relative who was awaiting a court hearing about wardship.  The adult in question was very worried about it and not necessarily want it.  The family wanted to support him in his decision.  I am very anxious to get this legislation through because so many people are waiting on it.  What I found quite interesting was that the judge in the case, who was very enlightened because he knew that this legislation was coming, advised them to look for an adjournment until the legislation came in so that they would not have to come into wardship.  In the circumstances, this was the wisdom of Solomon.  Sometimes we do not realise that when we are developing legislation, so many people will be affected by it in such a fundamental way.  Sometimes we think that, apart from what we publicise, nobody else takes any notice of or interest in what we do in here.  In this case, they rang the ward of courts office and when they asked the woman at the other end about this legislation, she told them that if they had said that to her last year, she would have told them that she had been listening to it for seven years but that the legislation was actually on the way.  We sometimes forget that.  The ward of courts issue is a serious one for people and is not always necessary.  There are other ways of managing our affairs other than by the court and that paternalistic approach.  We are looking at the amendment and I would appreciate it if it was not pressed as I promise to come back on it.</p></speech>

It is about the advance health care directives.  The Minister said she would come back to this.  I understand that sections 59 and 60 relate to that area.  I do not know if the Minister of State wishes to discuss it now or later but I wanted to raise it because it is proposed to delete the section that deals with it.  I wish to raise those concerns that I put on the record earlier about the provisions among health service users who feel that their human rights will not be respected on the same basis as others.  I understand that there are up to 400 individuals who are lobbying on this issue and who are specifically affected by it.  My understanding is that ten groups met with the Department.  I have raised this issue, which is a very serious concern.</p> <p>I understand the Minister of State has said that she might not agree with the issue but as she has done with previous issues, I have noted that she has listened to almost all the amendments so far and is at least willing to take it on board.  Without going over what I had earlier, the same issue is there.  There are very serious concerns around the advance health care directives to the effect that if somebody puts something in an advance health care directive about treatments they do not wish to have, it will be recognised as well in the competencies.  I ask the Minister of State to take another look at that one as well.</p></speech>

In this instance, we have listened very carefully, I have read material and the officials have had extensive listening exercises.  This is specifically about people with mental health difficulties.  I would still continue to assert that this is not the right piece of legislation for it.  We can have the debate as to whether or not we should have mental health legislation, although it is a bit late in the evening for it, because that is a different argument.  Should it be combined with general health?  This is an issue for another day.</p> <p>When it comes to advance health care directives, I am not saying that people with a mental health difficulty should not have advance health care directives.  Far from it, I have always believed they should have them but that is very specific in respect of a particular condition and that condition is dealt with under different legislation.  That is really the point I am making.  I am not convinced by the arguments otherwise.  It is not because I have not listened because I have.  I have read everything that has come to us.  The officials have met for an extensive period of time.  All of the advice tells us that it should be dealt with under the Mental Health Act.  We will deal with it under the revised Mental Health Act and advance health care directives will be in there as well.</p></speech>

They feel that the deletion of sections 59 and 60 should allow for that to be addressed.  An election is pending and legislation has been coming through the Houses at a fast pace but at the same time there are concerns that the change might not happen and this issue will not be addressed until further down the road.  That is the reason I am being asked to raise the matter with the Minister of State.  If sections 59 and 60 are being deleted, why can we not put the measure into this Bill to copperfasten it?  If it is the Minister of State's belief that it needs to be addressed then it should be included in the Bill.  I will not labour the point but I have been asked to raise it.</p></speech>

I know there is an election coming.  There is no avoiding that, but I do not think it is a good enough reason for doing something that I do not believe should happen.  We have the general scheme of the new mental health Act.  There was a comprehensive review and the legislation will be introduced.  I accept it will not be done in this Government's term but it will be addressed because it is being worked on as we speak.  These things do move along.  A change of Government does not change these things and they progress.  I do not believe the measure should be in the Bill.  It could be more comprehensively dealt with in the mental health Act.  I might be wrong, but that is my belief.</p></speech>

We did not get to do that but it does seem to me that the issues he raised are important in terms of the Irish Kidney Association or recognised donor registration bodies.  Does my adverting to the issue at this point act in ease of his reintroducing the matter on Report Stage?  I realise that we did not move the amendment and I am anxious that it would not be impossible to move it on Report Stage for want of a discussion on Committee Stage.

Amendment No. 195 amends section 67 on page 74.  Currently, the Bill provides that an advance health care directive is legally binding only when it relates to the directive maker's refusal of treatment.  Section 67(3)(b) states that a request for a specific treatment is not legally binding.  This means that every decision against life, so to speak, no matter how unwise or unsound - that is to use the terms employed in section 66(2) - is granted greater legal protection than every decision in favour of life, even where the directive maker simply seeks to have food and water provided to them through artificial means.  Advance health care directives are inapplicable in the case of the administration of basic care but, according to section 68, artificially-delivered nutrition and hydration do not constitute basic care.</p> <p>Many Irish people very reasonably hold that the provision of food and water, regardless of how it is delivered, is part of basic care.  No doubt at least some of those people would want their advance health care directives to reflect that very reasonable conviction on their part.  While the decision in the 1996 ward of court case probably precludes basic care from being defined by the Bill as incorporating artificially-delivered nutrition and hydration, that is not really the point because it does not prevent the Oireachtas from treating advance health care directives requesting the provision of food and water as legally binding.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Bill as it stands clearly favours life ending wishes over life saving wishes. Denying citizens the right to make a health care directive requiring the provision of food and water, whether delivered artificially or naturally, undermines their right to life and freedom of conscience.  This is not a constitutional claim as such - one might argue that it is a moral claim - but constitutionally there must be a question mark over the Bill on this point however speculative it is to argue.  It seems odd that people are not supported by the legislation in seeking to vindicate their right to life by the provision artificially of food and hydration.  I would not claim to be definitive but I argue that this is constitutionally questionable.</p><p>Some might argue that to provide an advance health care directive which mandates the provision of artificial food and hydration in a certain situation could put huge pressure on medical resources but I do not think we want to go down the road of medical resource arguments.</p></speech>

With regard to any possible objection that this would involve unnecessary burdens for the patient towards the end of their life, it would be entirely possible to add any necessary qualifiers to the provision I propose.  For example, it could be indicated that the guarantee to continue or provide artificially delivered nutrition and hydration would be inapplicable in the final stages of terminal illness.  The proposal is for a restricted application, but I would be grateful if the Minister would consider it.</p></speech>

Advance health care directives are a welcome addition to the Bill and will provide a way for people to articulate their will and preference for a later date in which their views may become unclear or unknown.  This can be useful for treatment decisions relating to end of life situations, mental health crises and age related disability.  A coalition of organisations in the fields of mental health, disability and older people have consistently called for advance health care directives to apply equally in the general health and mental health contexts.  Too often mental health issues are seen as separate and different, and the same rights and protections are not extended to mental health service users as they are to others.  The addition of section 68(7) to the Bill has therefore come as a surprise to me since it effectively excludes the use of advance health care directives when a person is involuntarily detained and treated under the Mental Health Act 2001.  The provision is unfortunate because it is precisely when people-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-12-09a.1324" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1171" speakername="Jillian van Turnhout" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015120900002#TTT01200"><p>Maybe if Senator Walsh checks against the Bill when I am talking about a section, he will see I am talking about section 68(7).  I am speaking to amendment 203.</p><p>I believe the provision is unfortunate because it is precisely when people are treated under the Mental Health Act 2001 that people will wish an advance health care directive to take effect.  The use of differential standards for treatment decisions during involuntary detention perpetuates stigma and limits the use of advance health care directives in mental health care settings.  Stigma and discrimination have been identified as the greatest barriers to recovery.  Even if advance health care directives are legally binding during voluntary admission, the threat of coercion limits the impact of decisions.</p><p>A national study by Irish mental health service users has found an urgent need for legally binding advance heath care directives during involuntary detention to promote respect for treatment preferences.  Many clinicians assume that if advance health care directives are made binding in the mental health context that hundreds of people will make blanket refusals of all medical treatment, yet there is no evidence to support this.  Advance health care directives can actually increase treatment engagement rather than increase refusals.  In an Irish national survey the majority of mental health service users stated they would be more willing to adhere to treatment if they had an advance health care directive, suggesting the measure may lead to an increase in treatment engagement rather than refusals.  The international evidence also suggests this.  The fear that individuals would refuse all treatment, or be left untreated, often results in limitations on advance health care directives during involuntary detention.  The research suggests that mental health service users are more interested in using advance health care directives to express a preference for a particular treatment over others, rather than using the directive to refuse all treatments.  To make a blanket denial of these preferences and concerns when a person is involuntarily detained, at precisely the moment such directives become important, is unjust.  This is why I suggest amendment No. 203.</p><p>I will now turn to amendment No. 201.  I am very surprised and concerned that an informed and considered decision to end life sustaining treatment should be viewed as equivalent to a suicide attempt.  To put these situations together is unbelievable and, having worked on the Joint Committee on Health and Children's <i>Report on End of Life and Palliative Care in Ireland</i>and having looked at the issue extensively, I find it objectionable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-12-09a.1325" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1122" speakername="Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015120900002#TTT01300"><p>I support amendment No. 203 proposed by Senators van Turnhout and Zappone.  I have outlined my reasons previously which are similar in vein to the advance health care directives.  There are concerns that the impending legislative provisions on advance health care directives discriminate against anybody who may experience mental ill health.  Given that one in four Irish people experience some form of mental health difficulty during their life this issue could apply to any of us.  It is felt by a number of experts that the proposed legislation blatantly excludes the use of legally binding advance health care directives for the treatment choices of those subject to involuntary detention under the Mental Health Act 2001.  These experts believe it is clearly discriminatory under the EU Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which the Government is planning to ratify in the near future.</p><p>The use of differential standards reinforces stigma and the notion that the preferences of individuals with mental health conditions are not respected on an equal basis with others.  There were 80,457 admissions to Irish psychiatric units and hospitals in 2013, of whom 11% were involuntary.  Similar legislation in the United States was litigated as discriminatory under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 in the case of Hargrave v Vermont in 2003.  After filing a legal challenge for differential treatment in the United States Court of Appeals, Ms Nancy Hargrave asserted:</p><blockquote>It seems fundamentally unfair that I choose or refuse chemotherapy which is saving my life, but I do not have the same right to choose or refuse psychiatric medication.</blockquote> <p>The findings of a national study published in <i>The Journal of Ethics</i>on medicine and public health suggests an urgent need for legally binding advance health care directives for those who have been involuntarily detained under the mental health legislation in order to provide a sense of control over future treatment, to enhance recovery and to promote trust and respect.  There is a compelling argument.  The Minister has said she has looked at the issue in great detail.  There seems to be quite a body of evidence internationally that supports the call.  There are many people in Ireland also making that call and it warrants further debate and thought between here and Report Stage.  I support the calls to have it looked at again.</p></speech>

I have worked with the mental health services for nearly 30 years.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Gilroy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2367"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2367&amp;amp;pid=JohnGilroy&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is anomalous to preclude a person suffering from major mental illness from the safety of a health care directive.  Major, enduring and relapsing mental illnesses are often accompanied by loss of insight by the person suffering from the condition and it is at that very moment when pre-planning by that person is a human rights issue.  In all other areas of the mental health services, we try to encourage a collaborative and team approach which includes the patient in decision-making.  At a time when the patient is least able to collaborate in his or her own treatment, we preclude him or her from the protection of the directive.  I am very interested in hearing the Minister of State's response to Senator van Turnhout's worthy amendment.</p></speech>
