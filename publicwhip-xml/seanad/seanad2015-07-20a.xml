He will be well known because the case is public, but I apologise for that.  However, my constituent requires life saving medical attention and an operation that is only available in Canada.  This has been confirmed by St. Vincent's Hospital.  A liver operation is required.  The galling matter is that this family has health insurance and the insurance policy document, which I have with me, clearly states "Yes" that the family is covered regarding benefit abroad for surgical procedures that are not available in Ireland.  Obviously, the news this family received about this man's liver cancer was devastating.  They made contact with Aviva at the time and were told verbally that they were covered and that it would be dealt with, except for flights and accommodation.  <!--/p--><!--p></p-->  <!--p-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Darragh O'Brien:</span-->  <!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2178"></a-->  <!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Then, a couple of weeks ago, Aviva came back to them and told them they were not covered and that they would be paid &euro;22,000.

It may be that the State will have to step in, but Aviva cannot be let off the hook on this.  This man and his family have paid their premiums.  They are paid to date.

It has been promised for a long time and everyone in the House will be aware of the difficulties in drafting legislation of this kind.  Colleagues on both sides have worked on this, as have colleagues in the D&aacute;il.  I look forward to the eventual publication of the Bill.</p>  <p>I also welcome the announcement that M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn is to chair the Higher Education Authority gender equality review of third level institutions, which is being conducted in light of the Micheline Sheehy-Skeffington case.  I know other colleagues, including Senator Naughton, have been raising that case and have been concerned about issues around gender inequality following the Sheehy-Skeffington decision.  I welcome the setting up of a panel to put forward what the head of the HEA has described as what he hopes will be "impactful" recommendations in light of the review to ensure greater gender equality at third level.</p>  <p>We have heard a great deal this term regarding children's health and rising obesity levels.  Senator van Turnhout has established a cross-party group, along with the Irish Heart Foundation, looking at children's health and efforts to tackle obesity, etc.  It has been suggested to me that we might look to the Minister for Transport to institute a bike to school scheme, similar to the bike to work scheme instituted by the last Government, which has been so successful in encouraging higher levels of cycling among adults.  The introduction of a scheme that would encourage higher levels of cycling among schoolchildren would be very welcome.  It would be a really good initiative.  I will be writing to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to suggest that he take up this initiative, but I ask that the Leader also support it and that we might have a debate in September on how to improve children's health and how to improve health in the population generally through greater promotion of cycling.  We have seen great things like the dublinbikes scheme working to improve levels of cycling, but a bike to school scheme would also be a great idea.  It is always hard for schoolchildren to see back-to-school things at this stage of the summer, when September seems so far off, but "bike to school" would be a good play on the words "back to school" and would be a very welcome initiative for children and parents alike.</p></speech>

I have two questions relating to the National Economic Dialogue, which I was delighted to attend last week.  I was the only Senator present, and I am particularly grateful to our Leader for helping me to get there.  I am not sure why I was the only Senator present.  <!--/p--><!--p></p-->  <!--p-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Katherine Zappone:</span-->  <!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2392"></a-->  <!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2392&amp;amp;pid=KatherineZappone&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Perhaps it was because even though we have things to say on money Bills, we do not have votes on them.  As we said during the debate on Seanad reform, we have a great deal of expertise that feeds into how this country sets its budgets and its priorities in that regard.  I suppose this leads me to my first question, which relates to the issue of Seanad reform.  I understand there was a meeting of Opposition leaders and the Taoiseach on the evening of the most recent debate on the Manning report.  I heard about it.  It seems that at this meeting there was debate but not consensus.  According to the newspapers, the report is going to go to the D&aacute;il for debate and maybe a Bill will be introduced on the basis of whatever consensus is achieved.  I wonder whether this is the best way to do the business of achieving Seanad reform.</p></speech>

I suppose my question relates to whether we will have a Bill on Seanad reform in the autumn.</p>  <p>I will return to the National Economic Dialogue for my second question.  The matter of the engagement of parliamentarians with the Government in the budgetary process, which we have often raised here, was raised at that forum.  It would be preferable if we could be engaged in pre-budget discussions rather than post-budget discussions.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, indicated at the conference that he wrote to every committee in January of last year to look for suggestions on the setting of budgets, but no committee responded.  There was no engagement, at least in that way.  I wonder whether that resulted from a problem with the committees or a difficulty with the process.  How can we get more pre-budget engagement from parliamentarians as part of a more open, transparent and inclusive process?  I enjoyed the National Economic Dialogue very much.  I thought it was terrific.  We were able to listen to parliamentarians, members of civil society and representatives of lobbying groups.  However, that is not how we should debate our priorities when setting budgets.  Similarly, debates within individual committees are not the best way to go about this work.  I suggested that we might need to keep child benefit where it is and instead invest more money in children's early years services.  Professor John McHale, who is the director of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, mentioned to me in conversation that the OECD has been asked by the Government to make recommendations to it on how parliamentarians might engage in the budgetary process.  Can we hear about what those recommendations are when they come in?  More important, I would be willing to come in to have a debate at a committee meeting in September.  I might even participate with the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform in debating priorities in terms of budget 2016.</p></speech>

As the home of the first woman to be elected to Parliament in Britain or Ireland, it is an inspiring place.  It was a source of great inspiration for people like Yeats, who wrote in 1934 that the "real work of legislation" is done in meetings dominated by "old lawyers, old bankers, old businessmen, who ... have begun to govern the world".  I hope the Cabinet's deliberations in the west are not influenced by old lawyers, bankers and businessmen.</p>  <p>I echo the support that has been expressed for the chairman of the Committee for Finance and Personnel of the Northern Ireland Assembly, Mr. Daith&iacute; McKay, who has asked for representatives of NAMA to attend that committee's investigation into a &pound;1.3 billion property deal in Northern Ireland.  There are fine relations between the two Parliaments now.  Last Friday week, we met the new Speaker, Mitchel McLaughlin.  The chairman of NAMA, Mr. Frank Daly, is a frequent and valued attender at meetings of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.  I think this should be a case of hands across the Border.</p>  <p>I wish every success to our great golfers, Paul Dunne and P&aacute;draig Harrington, this afternoon.</p></speech>

Lissadell House is a place full of history and tradition and thankfully the battles associated with it in recent history have concluded successfully and it is now open to the public, as the Cassidy family always wanted.  I commend the family for what they have done for society.  My good friend, Senator Sean D. Barrett, left out one group of people who always deliberate successfully, namely, gentlemen professors.  </p>  <p>I also commend Irish golfers, particularly Paul Dunne.  Their international success is amazing.  We are setting standards worldwide, as I know from the wonderful golf course in Lahinch where the Taoiseach and the Speaker of the House, Mr. John Boehner, played a successful game recently.  I sincerely hope an Irish golfer will win the British Open.</p>  <p>Ireland is a centre of excellence in many areas.  One such centre is the Irish Financial Services Centre where the creation of 100 jobs was announced today.  I have maintained for a long time that the country should lead the way in mediation, arbitration and conflict resolution services.  We should have a hub here in order that we become world leaders in this area.  With that in mind, I again call on the Leader to impress on the Minister for Justice and Equality the importance of proceeding with e-conveyancing.  We should embrace technology and the concept of e-conveyancing which would save the country millions of euro.</p></speech>

Some people scoffed at his remarks that seagulls were endangering society and taking food out of children's mouths, etc.  Some in the media thought they were a bit of a joke, but the Senator is usually very level-headed and seldom flippant in his comments.  It is interesting to note that no less a person than the Prime Minister of Great Britain, Mr. David Cameron, has recorded his concern and worry about the behaviour of seagulls.  He made his remarks because a tortoise and a child's pet, a terrier dog, had been killed in the recent past by seagulls.  Fish, the normal food source for seagulls, are becoming more scarce and the number in the sea is probably only one third of the level 30 or 40 years ago.  Seagulls have killed lambs and rabbits and we are reaching the stage where they are endangering society.  Their behaviour is sometimes like that of a rabbit with myxomatosis or a cow with mad cow disease.</p></speech>

I also note some of the issues the Adoption Authority of Ireland has noted it considers need to be addressed.  We need to be mindful that we go as far as we can with this legislation.</p>  <p>I agree with Senator Zappone, and I have said it already as did Senator Bradford, that we need to and should have a pre-budget debate in this House on the issue of public expenditure and the important headlines for the budget and so forth.  Two weeks ago we passed legislation which prevents discrimination against rent supplement tenants in securing accommodation based on their source of income.  It was perhaps a little noted part of the Employment Equality (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, with which we were dealing at the time.  Could we have a debate on rent supplement?  It is fine to put in place well meaning legislation preventing discrimination and I know the Minister of State, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, is keen that the legislation should be effective.  However, I have a number of concerns, first of which is the adequacy of rent supplement.  It is inadequate to secure or keep accommodation.  There are still inordinate delays, although some progress has been made, in processing rent supplement claims and the manner in which the scheme is administered.  My problem is that given all these issues, there is no way someone in receipt of rent supplement could not be discriminated against on purely legitimate grounds, namely, the manner in which the payment is made.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate with the Minister concerned to look again at the rent supplement scheme on which so many tens of thousands in this country depend for their home.</p></speech>

It is not confirmed yet but we hear the Low Pay Commission, set up recently - we had lengthy debates in this House on that Bill - will recommend a 50 cent an hour increase in the minimum wage.  It is interesting that the proposal has had a mixed reaction.  Business groups say, wrongly in my view, this will set the country back economically and have completely overreacted to the proposal.  The trade unions say it does not go far enough and I tend to be on their side.  It is interesting that this morning, IKEA has said not only will it pay the increase in the minimum wage but it will, from next week onwards, pay a living wage to all its employees.</p></speech>

However, very profitable companies can and should be paying better wages.  We know who they are.  Many of them are making very big profits in this country and they should be paying a living wage and, where they can, they should be supported and encouraged to do so.  For me, it reinforces the need for the Low Pay Commission to be a living wage commission and to look at all those issues.</p>  <p>In reality, I do not think we should be looking at this issue solely through the prism of pay increases.  For many low paid workers, pay increases are part of the solution but what they need is access to good quality public services.  For many people in low pay jobs the lack of wages is one issue but the fact they cannot depend on our public services, be those housing support, health or education services, because of rising costs impacts on them.  That is the flaw in the logic of the Low Pay Commission.  It is important for us to have a debate on this issue of low pay when we come back after the summer recess.  I commend IKEA, something I would not have seen myself doing last week.  It has, however, made that move.</p>  <p>I support the words of the Fianna F&aacute;il group leader as well on the private health insurance company which has behaved despicably.  I will lend my support and the support of Sinn F&eacute;in to any motion he wishes to table in this regard. </p></speech>

I want to mention world leaders.   Perhaps we should look at Ireland as being a world leader in sports tourism.  I got a number of texts from people today asking, "Who is this guy?"  <!--/p--><!--p></p-->  <!--p-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Eamonn Coghlan:</span-->  <!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2382"></a-->  <!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2382&amp;amp;pid=EamonnCoghlan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is always great to see someone come out of the blue.  They were referring to young Paul Dunne who grew up in Greystones, went to school in Blackrock College and went to the University of Alabama.  I did not know anything about Paul Dunne prior to this past week but I have a great deal of pride in him.  I think of Padraig Harrington as well as Rory McIlroy, Graeme McDowell, Darren Clarke and Paul McGinley.  Golf is really an exceptional sport, making Ireland a leader. <br/><br/>Many years ago, the Golfing Union of Ireland got funding from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for its scholarship programme.  The academy in Maynooth has helped to produce all these great lads.  People might ask how is this boy, Paul Dunne, going to do in the final round this afternoon but it is not his first time playing in the British Open.  He played in it last year and just failed to make the cut.  Having finished fifth in the National Collegiate Athletic Association, NCAA, he is going to do things.<br/><br/>Golf and other sports are very important for tourism here.  These players are ambassadors when they represent Ireland which is priceless public relations for this country.  When I was at the Irish Open in Northern Ireland this year, I got into conversation with some of the leading promoters of golf in the world.  They said it would be fantastic if the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Government were to really consider the golfing package, promote it and get seriously involved in promoting the Irish Open and putting more money into that.  Players such as Rory McIlroy, Graeme McDowell and this young lad, Paul Dunne, are huge attractions for this country and can bring in thousands of tourists as well as great publicity for the country. <br/><br/>I read John Greene&rsquo;s column in yesterday&rsquo;s <i>Sunday Independent</i>.  He usually has his finger on the pulse when it comes to talking about sport and what governments should do.  Last week I mentioned &euro;800,000 going into the National Sports Campus development.  Only 8% of that overall budget went to sport.  It is time to go back ten years, increase the funding in sports and give our sports an opportunity to lead us on the world scene.  Let us hope an Irishman wins the claret cup this afternoon.</p></speech>

I and others have raised the continuing high cost of providing child care here.  It is now out in the open again.  Another report from a child care provider shows that a majority of parents want an extension of the one year free child care as a matter of urgency.  They want direct subsidies or tax credits but would prefer direct payments.  We have heard a great deal of talk in this House about the Scandinavian models, and another new political grouping last week referred to the Nordic models yet this all seems to be aspirational.  We do not hear about the follow through.  It is now agreed that it costs a couple with two children &euro;30,000 a year to provide child care, which is as much as a mortgage payment.  Child care costs are now equated with mortgage payments.  That shows the seriousness of this issue.</p><p>Yet again I add my voice to those of many others, inside and outside this House, calling on the Government to act soon, in the budget.  It must act to address the high cost of child care which is crippling parents.  It is not fair in a society that has a developing and improving economy that this issue is not being tackled.  Will the Leader use his considerable influence to convey what I believe is the sentiment of all in this House, that child care costs be addressed, meaningfully and effectively, along the lines of the recommendations of the report, particularly in respect of the extension of the extra year&rsquo;s free child care, and that direct payments be made to parents to help alleviate the already unacceptable financial burden placed on them?</p><p>Senator Barrett referred to Countess Markievicz as the first woman elected to the British Parliament, which she was.  She was also the first female Cabinet Minister nominated in Europe, in 1918.  In research for a book entitled <i>Women in Parliament</i>that I did some years back with Maedhbh McNamara, we discovered that Countess Markievicz went to de Valera as the President of the Executive Council and said if he did not make her a Minister she would join the Labour Party.  I am not sure what the reasons for this were.</p></speech>

I would like to add my voice to the good wishes for our golfer, Paul Dunne.  Senator Coghlan admitted that he did not know much about him and neither did I until this week.  It is fantastic that somebody has come up through the ranks.  The president of his club in Wicklow was speaking on the radio this morning and described him as the boy wonder.  Hopefully, that will prove to be the case today.</p>  <p>Despite all the joviality around the issue of seagulls, to which Senator O'Donovan referred, I heard a piece on radio this morning about it.  I have a Jack Russell at home and I hope to God the seagulls do not get him because apparently they have killed terriers across England already.  </p>  <p>I wish to raise the issue of funding that was provided last week by the Government for improved road maintenance, public transport, rail stock, rail safety and bus fleets.  Also included in that allocation was funding towards community and local improvement schemes, which are administered at local authority level.  They have been the bane of local councillors for many years now because they have been absolutely starved of funding.  I am delighted this round now allows for 10% of maintenance money to be allocated to the local improvement schemes, and for 20% to be allocated to the community improvement schemes.  This will mean small improvements which will have a big effect on people's lives, particularly for those who are living on private and public lanes on which the councils are unable to carry out work.  With support from the residents and co-operation from the local authorities, these works will be carried out, which is good news for local councillors who are working on this issue.</p></speech>

I read a most disturbing account of what took place in Trim court last Friday.  I know I cannot name names here and will not do so.  Apparently, a member of the public was taken from that court on the instructions of the judge with respect to some query about contempt of court.  The man was returned to the court an hour later and, from witness reports, he had been badly beaten and his clothes were torn when he returned.  Clearly, if this is correct, there needs to be some sort of statement from the Minister as to what happened when he was taken from the court.  I will provide the Leader with the name of the man after this session.  It is most disturbing that some things might happen in any of our courts.</p>  <p>On a lighter note, my colleague, Senator Conway, was complimenting the gentlemen professors in the House.  We should also bear in mind that there are a few lady professors around the House who need to be complimented equally.  That is all I have to say.</p></speech>

In particular, I wish every success to our two great Irish golfers this afternoon.  I have no doubt that people throughout the country will be glued to the television screens to watch their progress.  It is amazing and wonderful that a young person of 22 years would lead the British open at this stage.  A great American golfer referred to him this morning as the greatest golfer he had never heard of.  We wish Paul Dunne and P&aacute;draig Harrington all the best this afternoon.</p>  <p>As we head into an improving economic situation, I feel the Government should be targeting additional resources, as they become available, for people with disabilities.  I would like to see some of the necessary cuts that were made during the recession restored.  <!--/p--><!--p></p-->  <!--p-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael Mullins:</span-->  <!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2368"></a-->  <!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2368&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMullins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The weekly payment to people with disabilities should be regarded as a priority.  Most important, the respite grant should be restored to pre-recession rates because that grant is required in that it gives assistance to parents and carers who are under pressure.  Another issue that needs to be addressed is making all employment activation programmes eligible to people with disabilities.  As it stands, the Intreo offices are not providing a comprehensive service to people with disabilities.  Some of the programmes arising from the Youth Guarantee scheme are not open to young people on disability and illness payments, nor is the Momentum programme.</p> <p>In light of the fact that one in ten adults of working age has a disability, we need to have a discussion in the autumn with the Minister of State as to how we can target some additional resources to people with disabilities in a way that will make a real difference to their lives.</p></speech>

As with all universal payments, those who can afford to do without, should do without and those who need it most, should get the payment.  The same applies in the case of the children's allowance.  I do not agree with those universal payments.  Senator Mooney spoke about child care and child care costs.  It is true that child care costs are exorbitant and they are putting families under serious pressure but instead of giving an extra &euro;5 in the children's allowance to everybody, why not divert that money into early childhood care as a sensible option?</p>  <p>I was at a public meeting with over 700 people in attendance in Shanagolden hall last Thursday night.  They are concerned about an American conglomerate which is coming to the area to build a &euro;200 million gasification project.  This was signed off by local area councillors from all the parties at local district level and it came before a full council meeting.  My issue is that I think local government is being undermined by county management.  They are manipulating the systems, pulling very important issues through local district level and putting them before a full council meeting to be voted through with debate lasting five minutes.  The disposal notice was voted through without the knowledge of councillors in any of the other districts.  We are told this project will bring in &euro;4 million or &euro;5 million per annum in rent for the council.  It was signed off without any consultation with locals and without any concern for human or animal health in the area.  Gasification does not fit with any of Ireland's 2020 targets.  I would like to hear where Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Sinn F&eacute;in, in particular, stand on this environmental issue because they have all gone along with it at local level. </p></speech>

It is great to see our home town competing against the big boys.  If the will is behind Dundalk FC, it will not just qualify but win the whole thing.</p></speech>

The motion calls on the Minister for Education and Skills to allocate two teachers to Inis Me&aacute;in national school.  As it stands, this island school has only one teacher, who must teach the entire curriculum, from age four to age 13, to nine children.  Apart from the sound educational grounds on which a second teacher should be appointed, it is fundamentally unsafe for one teacher to be left alone with nine pupils, both in terms of pupils' welfare and the teacher's personal safety and ability to take normal work breaks.  The Department has already approved five hours of resource teaching time for the school, which is an acknowledgement that children there have special educational needs.  However, nobody will take up the post because by the time one funds travel and accommodation, it would not pay to do so.</p>  <p>Every island school needs at least two staff if we are to ensure safe practice for both teachers and students.  I am seeking the Leader's support on this matter.  When I spoke to my colleague, Senator C&aacute;it Keane, about the issue last week, she pointed out that at preschool level, where there are more than eight children, there must be two members of staff.  By the time we come back in the autumn, children will have returned to school and it will be too late for this debate.  Let us use Parliament to work for the people and, on this occasion, for the children of Inis Me&aacute;in.  Either we are either serious about keeping our islands alive and encouraging young families to stay there or we are not.</p></speech>

Small companies are always reluctant to take on additional employees because of the extra costs involved, one of which is the payment of PRSI.  The chamber is suggesting that in the first three years of operation and where there are fewer than ten people employed, start-ups should not be liable for this cost.  The chamber of commerce points out that if 80,000 companies were to take on just one additional employee, we could make a substantial inroad into the numbers out of work.</p>  <p>This well-researched proposal deserves serious consideration prior to the forthcoming budget.  As a person who has been involved with a small business for many years, I understand what is involved.  Dublin Chamber of Commerce has huge experience in this area and its views should be taken on board and afforded careful examination.  <!--/p--><!--p></p-->  <!--p-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colm Burke:</span-->  <!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2353"></a-->  <!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I ask the Leader to organise a debate at some stage prior to the budget on constructive ideas for job creation so that we can get people back to work and employers are encouraged to take on more people.</p></speech>

There are only 13 of these schools on our offshore islands.  In the Gaeltacht areas eight have two teachers but five have only one teacher.  From the points of view of health and safety, child protection, teachers' employment and educational outcomes those kids are not being given an equal opportunity.  The scoil n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta on Inis Me&aacute;in is in Senator Healy Eames's constituency and the scoil n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Cholmcille, Oile&aacute;n Toraigh in my constituency, is in the same predicament with only one teacher and ten pupils.  This is totally unacceptable.  The cost of employing an additional new teacher is in the region of &euro;30,000.  The school in Inis Me&aacute;in has a resource teacher working approximately five hours a week which, when added to transportation costs, comes to &euro;15,000 per year so it is a minimal cost to the Department of Education and Skills.  The employment budget of the overall Department of Education budget of &euro;11 billion is in the region of &euro;7.5 billion.  Surely we can find an additional &euro;15,000 for these small schools on Inis Me&aacute;in and Toraigh to give our kids the same opportunity.  Ireland is assessed internationally by the OECD on the outcome relating to kids at primary and post-primary levels but we are not giving the same opportunity to small island children and that is not fair.  I hope the Leader will accept this amendment and will compel the Minister for Education and Skills to come to the House to talk about this very important issue before the schools start back again in September.</p></speech>

Subsequent to that I held a public meeting, entitled "Stop the Burglaries",  last Thursday.  I was privileged to have a former Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality and the current chairman of Crimestoppers, Mr. Tim Dalton, speak about Crimestoppers at that meeting.  I am providing information this morning.  Crimestoppers should be used more widely; it is not used adequately.  Its establishment was not an Irish idea.  The concept of Crimestoppers is used throughout the world in the United States, the United Kingdom and the North.  Crimestoppers is partly funded by the Government - the Departments of Justice and Equality and Health - and partly funded by the private sector - Ulster Bank, Neighbourhood Watch, the Vintners Federation of Ireland and DoneDeal.  It is important to put on the record that neither the chairman of Crimestoppers nor its organisation committee, representing the interests of the people involved, get paid a fee.

I visited Lissadell in recent weeks since the visit of Prince Charles.  It is a great place to go.  It used to attract approximately 40,000 visitors who also visited the north-west coast, right along the Wild Atlantic Way.

I do not know the recommendations it will contain but we are advised that they will not be acted upon in advance of the election, which is fair enough.  However, I would like to have a debate in the autumn on care of the elderly and that we would try to reach beyond the nursing home solution.  The very fine organisation ALONE published a report recently which highlighted the fact that up to 30% of people resident in nursing homes should not be in a nursing home.  There are many ways of looking after our elderly.  It should not be a question of the nursing home solution alone, if Members will excuse the pun.  I would like all the options including community care, home care, respite care, carer's allowance etc. fully debated.  We speak about the problem but do not investigate it fully.  From the point of view of the taxpayer but, more important, from the point of view of the elderly in our community, the community should be the start of our solution for them.  I would like the House to debate that in detail, alongside today's report, at the earliest possible date.</p></speech>

In terms of the problem of homelessness, we might consider having a dedicated officer in each county to determine the number of people who are homeless.  Mr. and Mrs. Average who find themselves homeless might be interested in moving to the country.  We should look anew at that.  About ten years ago, homeless persons were given the option to consider the rural resettlement scheme, but that seems to have died a death, so to speak.  Jim Connolly should be helped to examine this issue in an innovative way with a view to having a dedicated officer in each county because there are people in negative equity now who could be resettled.  Also, the situation in terms of employment is different now in that many people who are homeless or are on the verge of homelessness can work in rural areas with the help of IT.  The rural resettlement scheme might also be a way of ensuring that rural schools can remain open.  The Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, was mentioned in the article to which I referred.  She is proactive in this area also.  I call for an early debate on the rural resettlement scheme, which might be an innovative way of creating jobs in the countryside.</p></speech>

This is something that could be of benefit to many towns, cities and places throughout the land and that could lead to many interesting trails.  I compliment Reverend Simon Lumby, who has now retitled or expanded the title of his church, St. Mary's Church of Ireland, Killarney - Cill Airne - the Church of the Sloes, which, as the Irish scholars amongst us know, is the original name.  There are many historic spiritual connections throughout the land, but we in Killarney are particularly blessed that in the town hall opposite there is an ancient well and there was an ancient church on a site somewhere in the vicinity, between the existing church and the town hall.  Of course, there is also Innisfallen island, where the annals were written by monks in the 11th century, and Muckross and Aghadoe.  There are some mountainside shrines.  There is our magnificent Pugin cathedral - which, by the way, is also St. Mary's.  The project will lead people to other places.  It will be interesting for the future of tourism.</p>  <p>I support Senator O'Donovan in what he said about seagulls, picking up on what Senator Ned O'Sullivan proposed back down the line.  I have noticed that the seagulls are now coming inland 20 miles or so from the sea.</p></speech>

Obviously, there is a contract between both parties, and that is something that should be addressed.  I will certainly bring the matter to the attention of the Minister.  I understand the Senator will be forwarding details on the matter.</p>  <p>Senator Bacik raised the anticipated publication of the adoption (information and tracing) Bill.  As the Senator will be aware, a similar Bill was put to the House by Senators Power and van Turnhout not too long ago.  Senators will all welcome the publication of this Bill.  Hopefully, we can have that Bill dealt with in both Houses of the Oireachtas in the next session.</p>  <p>Senator Bacik also raised the gender equality review of third level institutions and welcomed the fact that it will be chaired by M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn.  The Senator also called for a bike-to-school scheme to be initiated by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Donohoe, to improve children's health.  I am sure the Minister will look kindly on such a proposal.</p>  <p>Senator Zappone raised the National Economic Dialogue.  Obviously, invitations came from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister, Deputy Howlin.  It was a pre-budget effort.  <!--/p--><!--p></p-->  <!--p-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maurice Cummins:</span-->  <!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2003"></a-->  <!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2003&amp;amp;pid=MauriceCummins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, said he is seeking pre-budget submissions and mentioned at the dialogue that committees did not submit proposals to him last year.  I will write to him immediately to come to the House to have a debate early in the new session.  Let us see whether he will come here to debate the pre-budget issues.  I will certainly put it up to him in that regard.</p> <p>On Seanad reform, I have no further information other than the fact that the Taoiseach has decided to set up an implementation body with a view to putting forward a Bill.  There is a draft Bill from the Seanad reform group.  I do not know whether it will be a Government Bill but I understand the Taoiseach is setting up an implementation body on the reforms that have been proposed.</p> <p>Senators Barrett and &Oacute; Clochartaigh urged that NAMA attend the meeting of the Northern Ireland committee on finance.  I will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, to determine whether any influence can be exerted.  It is not a matter in which I can have any role.</p> <p>Senator Barrett and others welcomed the fact that a Cabinet meeting will be held in Lissadell House, which was the home of Countess Markievicz.  Senator Mooney has outlined that she was the first lady Cabinet Minister in the world.  It has been welcomed in general that Cabinet meetings could be held outside the Houses of the Oireachtas, where appropriate.  I note Senator Bradford's point on that matter.</p> <p>Senator Barrett and several others lauded the efforts of Paul Dunne and P&aacute;draig Harrington, our golfers.  Senator Coghlan mentioned golf tourism, which is very important.  Our golfers have been punching above their weight in their efforts over recent years and are doing a tremendous job.  We wish them well today and in the future.</p> <p>Senator Conway urged that we proceed without delay on e-conveyancing.  I will bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for Justice and Equality. </p> <p>Senator O'Donovan mentioned seagulls.  I do not believe it is a flight of fantasy and I note that the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom has got in on the act as well in regard to seagulls.  It is an important issue if seagulls are stealing the food from children and damaging animals.  I heard on the radio earlier that a lady in the Botanic Gardens had her telephone taken by a seagull.</p></speech>

I can assure the Senator I do not propose to have a debate on seagulls in the House.</p>  <p>Senator Hayden referred to the adoption Bill and welcomed it.  She called for a pre-budget debate, which I will try to arrange with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, seeing that he has suggested this.</p>  <p>Senator Hayden also called for a debate on the adequacy of the rent supplement and how it is administered.  I will contact the Minister for Social Protection to determine whether she will come to the House to discuss this.</p>  <p>Senator Cullinane referred to the Low Pay Commission and welcomed its proposals on the minimum wage.  He lauded IKEA for its decision to pay a living wage and welcomed that.  The Government is committed to taking people on low pay out of the tax net.  It has taken hundreds of thousands out the tax net.  It has also made a commitment on the universal social charge.  That is the policy of the Government and it will continue with this through its next budget.</p>  <p>Senator Eamonn Coghlan referred to sports tourism and the work of golfing academies and clubs around the country in encouraging young people to play golf.  <!--/p--><!--p></p-->  <!--p-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maurice Cummins:</span-->  <!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2003"></a-->  <!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2003&amp;amp;pid=MauriceCummins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Senator Mooney referred to child care costs.  This is something to which the Government is certainly committed, along with realising all the benefits of high quality child care through targeted investment in the coming years.  Increasing the affordability, quality and accessibility of child care can play a critical role in realising a number of Government priorities.  These include better educational outcomes for children, as well as those with special needs, supporting parents in rearing their children while balancing work and family life, and reducing poverty among children and families.  I welcome Senator Mooney's comments in that regard and we all await measures to assist people with child care in the coming months.</p> <p>Senator Landy welcomed the transport initiative which the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, announced last week.  The initiative includes community improvement schemes for roads, which will be welcomed by local authorities.  </p> <p>Senator Craughwell referred to a matter in the courts.  That is a matter for the Courts Service and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with.  I do not propose to take any role in it.  It is known and, as he mentioned, it was in the newspapers.  I am sure it has been brought to the attention of the Minister, but ultimately it is a matter for the Courts Service and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with. </p> <p>Senator Mullins mentioned services for people with disabilities and the need to restore the full respite grant.  The Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will have many requests - as we have had on the Order of Business this morning - for increased financial resources.  They will obviously be considered in the budgetary process.  </p> <p>Senator Heffernan spoke against universal payments and said that all payments should be made on a needs basis.  I am sure that many would share his views in that regard.  He also said that the gasification plant was agreed without consultation.  I think it is extraordinary that any major project would be done without consultation.  I find it strange that consultation would not have taken place in that regard.</p> <p>Like Senator Mullins, Senator Moran sought a debate on disability services and supports.  She lauded the efforts of those who will be attending the Special Olympics.  We wish everybody well in that respect.  The Special Olympics that were held in Dublin probably constituted one of the greatest sporting events ever held in this country.  Senator Moran was also very parochial about Dundalk F.C. and we all wish the team well in the coming week.</p> <p>As regards the matter raised by Senator Healy Eames, Senator Keane brought it to my attention before the Order of Business.  I will make representations on the matter to the Minister for Education and Skills.  The necessity for two teachers in island schools is a valid situation, but I do not propose to accept the amendment to the effect that No. 18 be taken before No. 1.  I can assure the Senators, however, that I will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister.</p> <p>Senator Colm Burke called for the relief of PRSI for three years for new, small companies employing fewer than ten people.  That has been recommended by Dublin Chamber of Commerce and I am sure the Minister for Finance will also consider it when he is framing the budget.</p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill mentioned one-teacher schools which I have alluded to already.  Senator Brennan mentioned Paul Dunne emulating Bobby Jones's 1927 achievement as the last amateur golfer to lead in the final round of the British Open.  </p> <p>Senator White said that unemployment is a key issue and it certainly is.  As she rightly pointed out, youth unemployment is still a major problem.  <!--/p--><!--p></p-->  <!--p-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maurice Cummins:</span-->  <!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2003"></a-->  <!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2003&amp;amp;pid=MauriceCummins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->While the Government has got unemployment down from more than 15% to 9%, it is acutely aware of the problems that still exist, and jobs will continue to be a priority.  Senator White also lauded the work of Crimestoppers and called for a debate on crime in the next term.  I am sure she also welcomes the additional Garda recruits that have come from Templemore in recent months.  This will continue for the rest of the year.</p></speech>

The report on the fair deal scheme will be published today.  It has made several recommendations, namely, ensuring there is adequate residential capacity for those residents who require higher-level or more complex care, ensuring value and economy, with the lowest possible administrative cost for the State and administrative burden for providers, and increasing the transparency of the pricing mechanism so that existing and potential investors can make decisions that are as informed as possible.  The review also recommended the continued development of home and community-based care as an alternative to nursing home care.  The Government is not considering changes to the area of residents&rsquo; contributions.</p>  <p>Senator Keane raised the issue of pupil-teacher ratios in island schools, which I will take up with the Minister.  She also called for an examination of rural resettlement to deal with homelessness.  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh rightly pointed out that the problems in island schools did not just happen today.  It is recognised that they need to be solved.</p>  <p>Senator Paul Coghlan raised the matter of a spiritual tourism trail in Killarney and noted the many attractions that can be seen there.  Senator Coghlan will always highlight the delights of Killarney.</p></speech>

I outlined the rationale for this amendment.  I believe the Houses of the Oireachtas (Appointments to Certain Offices) Bill was drafted by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, and his Department.</p><p>As I outlined on Second Stage the main concern is applying a specific term to three of the posts, the Clerk-Assistant of the D&aacute;il, the Clerk of the Seanad and the Clerk-Assistant of the Seanad.  I outlined the roles the Clerk of Seanad in addition to the running of the House.  That individual sits on SIPO, the referendum commission and the commission that reviews boundaries for general elections.  It is a post that requires detailed experience, not just in the running of the House.  When it comes to Seanad elections, that person is responsible for verification of Seanad nominations and whether someone is appropriate to a certain panel.  That individual is also the returning officer for the Seanad elections, which, as I am sure the Minister of State is aware, are quite complex and require extensive knowledge.</p><p>While the appointment to the post of Clerk of the D&aacute;il goes through TLAC, the others do not and would be appointed by the commission.  An unintended consequence of the change the Government has introduced would be that effectively the Clerk of the Seanad would be appointed by and answerable to the commission, and the term would be set by the commission.  Subsection (3) states:</p> <blockquote> 	 		A person may be appointed to an office to which this section applies for a term specified by the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission to be a period of a number of years (or a number of years and months or days). 	 </blockquote>  <p>It puts it up to the commission to set that timeframe which is not done at present.  If the commission decided to set it for the term of any given Seanad, that person's appointment would end before the following Seanad election takes place.  I would be interested to hear the Minister of State's views on this before I decide to proceed further.</p><p>My amendment reads:</p> <blockquote> 	 		In page 4, lines 9 to 13, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;each of&rdquo; in line 9 down to and including &ldquo;Seanad &Eacute;ireann.&rdquo; in line 13 and substitute the following: 		<blockquote> 			<blockquote> 				&ldquo;the office of the Clerk of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.&rdquo;. 			</blockquote> 		</blockquote> 	 </blockquote>  <p>  <!--/p--><!--p></p-->  <!--p-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Darragh O'Brien:</span-->  <!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2178"></a-->  <!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The other three posts would remain as they are and a term would not be set for them.

Section 1(4) applies with equal force to all four Houses of the Oireachtas officer posts under consideration in the Bill.  In taking this approach the Government has in mind that the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, under the chairmanship of the Ceann Comhairle, would have the latitude in the future to take decisions on the tenure of the relevant postholders which would be in the best interests of an effective and efficient Oireachtas Service.  It does not see any justification for making a distinction between the Clerk of the D&aacute;il and the other three posts.  It is very conscious that if the amendment were to be accepted, there would be an anomalous position, whereby the occupant of the Clerk of the D&aacute;il post would have a seven-year tenure, while those appointed to the other three posts after the departure of the existing occupants would potentially have a much longer tenure, until they reached normal retirement age.  The Government strongly believes this would lead to much inflexibility in the management of the staff resources of the Oireachtas.  It would also be at odds with practice in the public service generally.  The Government and its predecessor are on record as wishing to afford the Oireachtas Commission the opportunity to operate an homogenised management structure in the service.  Explicitly mentioning in legislation the authority of the commission to specify lengths of tenure for the four main officer of the Houses posts is a significant step in this direction.</p>  <p>The Government believes its proposals will amount to a significant transfer of power from the Executive to the Legislature, as in the Oireachtas Commission.  The Taoiseach is heavily involved in the process.  The commission is representative of parliamentarians and will be fully attuned to their needs and demands.  I draw Senators' attention to the fact that under the terms of the proposed legislation successful nominees for the posts of Clerk of the Seanad, Clerk Assistant of the D&aacute;il and Clerk Assistant of the Seanad will be confined to serving members of the Oireachtas Service.  This gives me very solid grounds for expecting that the successful candidates will have a wide experience of parliamentary and electoral procedure and the work of the various commissions such as the SIPO and the Referendum Commission, with which they are associated.  The Government does not share the concerns expressed about adverse consequences for the work of these commissions or the conduct of elections.  When the tenure of the holder of any of the three posts I have mentioned ends, the commission will be at liberty to decide whether to maintain the postholder in his or her posting or transfer him or her to a post in the Oireachtas.  A significant number of posts in the service are of equivalent rank such as principal officer or assistant principal officer.  In the light of the points I have made, the Government is not prepared to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

I would like to delve into the final sentences of the Minister of State's reply.  If an appointment is made for seven years, why is it not mentioned that the person concerned could serve for a further seven years, five years or whatever the case may be?  It is the case where county managers are concerned.  Why is it not spelled out that after seven years, for example, the person can apply for and be employed in the position for a further seven years?  It should be spelled out now rather than leaving it for the commission to decide whether the person can apply again at the end of the initial period.  There is need for clarification on this matter and I hope the Minister of State will throw further light on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-07-20a.118" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1196" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015072000002#W00100"><p>I cannot believe we are still going down this route.  What if we were to legislate to allow a person to serve only once in their life as a Minister?  How would that sit with us?  It would not sit too well.  We are talking about people here.  Look at the officials who support the Oireachtas.  They work here all the hours God gives.  They are here for as long as we are here, they are available to provide advice any time we need it and they are here to keep the system on the rails.  How dare anyone suggest that we should set a term for which they can serve?</p>  <p>For as long as the State has existed people have been appointed to senior Civil Service posts and have retained those posts until they retired.  There is no reason for this in the legislation, other than to have some type of hold over the holder of what should be an independent office.  That is the only possible reason I can see for section 3.  I ask the Minister to reflect on it.  It is clear from what the Leader said that he is not very happy about it.  One often hears people say they have full confidence in football managers just before they fire them.  Are we going to hear someone say a few years hence that they have full confidence in the Clerk of the D&aacute;il or the Clerk of the Seanad before they end their term of office?  It is repugnant to the post to have a time limit set on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-07-20a.119" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1139" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015072000002#W00200"><p>I thank the Minister for his response to my initial queries.  It sheds a little more light on the response we received on Second Stage.  Reference to a seven-year renewable term would make a great deal more sense.  The problem is the way in which the legislation is written.  It refers to a number of years, months and-or days.  That leaves it up to the commission.  The legislation is not prescriptive so the commission could decide to give a term of five years.  Section 6A states: "A person may be appointed to an office to which this section applies for a term specified by the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission to be a period of a number of years (or a number of years and months or days)."  It does not state anywhere in the legislation, and the Minister can correct me if I am wrong, that it goes back to the commission for renewal.</p>  <p>The Minister's response confirms one of the fears I expressed last week, and which relates not just to this Government but to any future Government or future Ceann Comhairle.  The Seanad is an independent House of Parliament but the Clerk of the Seanad position would be decided, effectively, by the Ceann Comhairle as head of the commission.  The Ceann Comhairle is the Ceann Comhairle of the D&aacute;il and the Cathaoirleach is the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, but the Cathaoirleach is not mentioned anywhere here.  The Ceann Comhairle is the head of the commission but we are making a change here.  There is no other equivalent principal officer or higher principal officer role of which I am aware, and the Minister's officials can correct me on this, where we have set a term limit to it in the service.  The difference with the Clerk of the D&aacute;il is that it is the highest rank in that office to which people could aspire to reach.</p>  <p>Clerk-Assistant of the Seanad is at principal officer level and Clerk of the Seanad is at higher principal officer level.  Let us take the example of where one sets a term for them of five or seven years and the commission decides not to renew, for whatever reason.  Let us say the relations of a future Clerk of the Seanad with a Ceann Comhairle or a commission were difficult, as happened a couple of years ago.  Things do happen whereby a clerk must stand up for the independence of the office and the running of the House.  The commission could decide that it did not like the way that individual dealt with a matter and decide not to reappoint that individual.  It might appoint someone more pliable in that role.  This legislation makes it possible to do that.  I am not saying it will be done but it certainly leaves it open to be done.</p>  <p>The D&aacute;il and the Seanad have been at loggerheads in the past, such as at the time of the referendum and at the time of nominations for Seanad by-elections.  I do not wish to go over old ground but conflict between them does happen.  If the Ceann Comhairle or the Government, which will have a majority on the commission, decided it did not like an individual or the way in which an individual carried out their duties, the commission with its majority of Government members could decide not to reappoint that person.  <!--/p--><!--p></p-->  <!--p-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Darragh O'Brien:</span-->  <!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2178"></a-->  <!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As it stands the legislation is deficient because it does not discuss a person's reappointment.  It refers to setting a term.  As far as I can see, it does not say anywhere that when that term is committed, the person would go before the commission for re-evaluation and reappointment should the commission so decide.  It is a short Bill and maybe it is there, but I cannot see it.  There are genuine concerns here.  It does not relate to this Government.  It is about any future government or any future Ceann Comhairle.  We could have a serious problem here.</p> <p>If the Minister of State could respond to those questions, we will see where we go from there.  The response he has given here today is slightly different to that given on Second Stage, which did not mention reappointment.  The Minister of State probably just used the example of seven years.  That would probably be a sensible term if it were provided for but that must be specified, and it must state "for renewal after seven years" so that it would not clash with a Seanad election.  A commission could come in and say it was just doing it for five years and then there would be a new Clerk or Acting Clerk of the Seanad, as we have had in the D&aacute;il for the last four and a half years.  Legislation had to be brought in because of various issues, of which we are all aware.  I would be interested to hear the Minister of State's response to those further queries.</p></speech>

I appreciate where people are coming from in respect of this.  Senator O'Brien mentioned the Ceann Comhairle.  The Ceann Comhairle is the chairman of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, not just the D&aacute;il, and the commission is representative of parliamentarians.  This Government and the previous one are anxious to give the commission maximum flexibility.  That is the motivation behind the Bill.  As in every other facet of the public service, flexibility is required, and we are trying to ensure we can maximise the potential for flexibility.  In terms of the points being made about fixed terms, and I did give the example of seven years, Secretaries General of Departments are also appointed for fixed terms, so there is a precedent for this within the public service.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-07-20a.122" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1139" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015072000002#X00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  He mentioned Secretaries General.  I have asked whether there is any other grade of principal officer or higher where we have set a fixed term.  I am aware of fixed terms for Secretaries General.  That is the specific one, because that is the equivalent role.  That is the job.  What other such positions in the service have a fixed term?  I am not aware of any.</p><p>I would be much happier if a seven-year term were specified.  The Minister of State has mentioned a seven-year term, and that could be sensible, but it would be better if he specified it in the legislation and if he specified that after seven years it goes back to the commission and someone could have their contract renewed.  However, it is still preferable not to set those term limits.  It does not give any additional flexibility.  It effectively gives any future commission a stick that has not been there before.  It is saying, &quot;I don't like what you've done here, so I'm not renewing your contract&quot;.</p><p>The Minister of State says they could go into another role in the Oireachtas, but what other role could they go into?  The only other role I can see for someone with that level of experience would be the Clerk of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  However, that is one post.  If it is already filled, where does the person go?  If a threshold like that has been set, why in God's name would anyone want to get into this role?  Why would the people with the levels of experience required to carry out this job apply for it when there is a set term limit and someone else is the Clerk of the D&aacute;il so they cannot go any further?  There would be nowhere for them to go within their career path.</p><p>We could end up with people who do not have the requisite experience, knowledge or ability.  I have seen in my relatively short period in the Seanad that these are complicated roles.  They oversee the running of the House, functions<font color="#FF0000"> </font>in<font color="#FF0000"> </font>the House, our constitutional details, and our legislative functions.  We cannot just have anyone coming in from the outside and deciding how this would be done.  On Second Stage, it was stated that those three posts are open not just to those within the service, but also to people from outside, from the private sector.  <!--/p--><!--p></p-->  <!--p-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Darragh O'Brien:</span-->  <!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2178"></a-->  <!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I think that is wholly inappropriate for these particular roles.  I am not happy with how it sits there.  Maybe the Minister of State can give us some answers in that regard.  Have term limits been imposed on any other equivalent principal officer or higher principal officer grades?</p></speech>

Will that person's career be over?  Where will he or she be going in the public service?  Where is his or her future?  Such a person will have been constructively dismissed, in effect, by being refused access to the next post up the ranks.  From that point of view, I still think everything about this is wrong.  The Government promised reform, but this proposal is not reform.  It involves picking on a couple of specific posts within the Oireachtas and subjecting them to an appraisal of their performance after a set number of years.  From my perspective and that of most reasonable people, this is a proposal to remove a degree of the independence the office requires.  As it is an independent office, I do not believe a time period should be imposed on it.  I accept what Senator Darragh O'Brien has said and what Senator Cummins said earlier about setting the period at seven years and making it subject to renewal, all other things being equal at the end of that period.  I would see nothing wrong with that.  It would not be ideal, as it is not what people expect when they give their lives to the State, but it would be a damn sight better than what is provided for here.</p></speech>

We should all be in favour of transferring power from the Executive to the Parliament.  Can the Minister of State tell me whether I am right to say this will not affect the people who are in these positions at the moment?  I believe we are talking about what will happen when these positions come up in the future.  If that is the situation, and I presume it is, I would see no problem with a fixed term at that stage.  It is not specified in the Bill, however.  I think there should be a specified period.  We have all mentioned the seven-year period that applies to county managers and so on.  They have seven years and an option to apply again for a further term or part of a term.  What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  The same thing should apply to these senior posts as well.  I cannot see why it should be any different in this case from the cases of other people within the public service.</p></speech>

Under this Bill, there are positions in the Oireachtas office to which the Clerk of the Seanad could be transferred.  While I appreciate that the Opposition amendment is intended to be constructive, its effect would be to leave officers in office for life without that type of mobility.  It would leave the Clerk of the Seanad, for example, in office for life.  I do not think that is necessarily the intention of this amendment, but it would be its effect.</p></speech>

I still believe that is the case.  I do not believe there is any justification for being so vague about these exceptionally important positions in both Houses.  It has been pointed out repeatedly that we are not just dealing with higher civil servants; we are dealing with people who are operating at a constitutional level and whose job is not just about administering the Houses.  <!--/p--><!--p></p-->  <!--p-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paschal Mooney:</span-->  <!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1990"></a-->  <!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1990&amp;amp;pid=PaschalMooney&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There are also external positions involved, which has wider implications for the entire political system.  Considering the calibre of person that is expected to be appointed, it would not be attractive to someone outside the House who considers the possibility of applying for one of these positions if an abstract approach is taken to time periods.  While I accept that provision is made for the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission to specify a period, I do not understand the reason a specific period is not specified in the Bill, given the importance of the positions.  </p> <p>The Minister of State indicated that, on the expiry of the term of office of the individuals in question, they may be transferred within the public service.  The Bill does not make any such explicit reference.  This raises the issue, to which previous speakers alluded, of what will happen at the end of the term of office.

If that were the case, it would be necessary to introduce term limits for all principal officers and higher executive officers.  I have outlined the issue, namely, the failure to specify a term.  As Senator Cummins also noted, if the Minister had proposed a term of seven years to be followed by a review or renewal, I would have accepted the proposal.  However, this is not stated in the Bill and, as such, the text is open to interpretation.  Could the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission decide to set a term of two years or specify another arbitrary period under this legislation?  Could it also specify a term which either does or does not coincide with an electoral cycle?</p></speech>

The question Senators have asked has still not been answered.  To introduce legislation that has a cloud hanging over it and could have repercussions throughout the public service would be a very serious mistake to make for the Houses.  This legislation could destabilise every Department, as the jobs of all Secretaries General, assistant Secretaries General and principal officers would not be safe.  While this is a small Bill, it has serious implications.  We must be careful about what we are doing.</p></speech>

As the Minister of State may know, the present arrangement is that office accommodation is the responsibility of the Government Chief Whip.  There is no need to replay some of the difficulties which have arisen over the past number of years.  Will the Minister of State indicate why the Oireachtas commission, chaired by the Ceann Comhairle, should not be in charge of office accommodation thus ensuring that each Member of the Oireachtas is treated in an equal and fair fashion?  They are elected in that fashion under the laws of this land.</p></speech>

I remind Senators that it is always a benefit to everyone if the hyperbole is kept to a minimum.  To suggest this will rock the very foundations of the entire public service is a bit of a stretch seeing as this legislation only affects the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>On the matter raised by Senator Bradford, this matter was discussed when this Bill was proceeding through the D&aacute;il.  The Government was not prepared to accept the amendment proposed in that Chamber and is not prepared to do so now.  It is because it is not believed there is any justification for transferring responsibility for this matter to the Secretary General.  The Oireachtas commission has a statutory function in preparing guidelines for Members in the use of accommodation following dissolutions.  The office of the superintendent supports the commission in carrying out its statutory function.  Following on from this, the matter of accommodation is for the Chief Whip and the other Whips.  In the event of difficulties, the matter is decided upon by the Ceann Comhairle in his capacity as chairperson of the Oireachtas commission.  The Ceann Comhairle's decision is final.  The proposed amendment will reduce the powers of the Ceann Comhairle and the commission and the Government would be unwilling to become involved in the matter which is for the Legislature to deal with.  In addition, implementation of the proposal would lead to the Secretary General and Clerk of the D&aacute;il being caught up in a political matter.  <!--/p--><!--p></p-->  <!--p-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in:</span-->  <!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2301"></a-->  <!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2301&amp;amp;pid=AodhanORiordan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->My colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, stated in the D&aacute;il:</p><blockquote>	[T]he proposed amendment would, in my judgment, ultimately reduce the powers of the independently elected Chair of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to make decisions in the event of disagreements or disputes.

This issue has been raised with us by those working for people in debt.  The problem is that making compliance with the MARP code of conduct on mortgage arrears a pre-condition of availing of a court review is actually empowering the banks.  The Central Bank recently published a scathing report showing that the banks were failing abysmally to live up to the code of conduct.  We must recall that in connivance with the Central Bank, this Government has facilitated a watering-down of the code of conduct at the very time a strong code was needed.  By removing this pre-condition, which is ultimately a veto for the banks, the playing field would be made more level and this is essential at this stage.</p></speech>

The effect of the Senators' amendment is to remove the reference in the principal Act to co-operation with the MARP before a borrower makes a proposal for a personal insolvency arrangement.  I thank the Senators for their amendment but I cannot accept it.</p>  <p>Under the existing section 91(1), a borrower must first co-operate with the mortgage lender under the MARP approved by the Central Bank, before he or she can make a proposal for a personal insolvency arrangement.  If the borrower does so, but is not able to agree a restructure with the mortgage lender, he or she is then eligible to propose a personal insolvency arrangement.  The current provision does not address the situation of a borrower who has been in mortgage arrears on his or her home, has co-operated with the MARP and has subsequently entered a restructure, whether MARP or non-MARP, but the restructure has failed, or is unsustainable, and the borrower remains insolvent.  It is important that a borrower in this situation should be eligible to make a PIA proposal.  This section of the Bill is designed to expand the categories of person who can apply under section 91 and to ensure that there is no bar to an insolvent  borrower in such a restructured mortgage situation being eligible to make a PIA proposal.  This section, therefore, already seeks to significantly enlarge the categories of persons who may apply for a personal insolvency arrangement and to ensure that a person in a restructured home mortgage will be able to do so.  To remove the link to co-operation with the MARP for any borrower wishing to propose a PIA goes well beyond the scope of this amendment and would require very full policy consideration, not least due to its possible negative effects on incentives for borrowers to engage as early as possible with their lenders regarding any repayment difficulties.</p></speech>

The Bill provides that a debtor makes a declaration in writing that he or she has co-operated for a period of at least six months with the creditor who is a secured creditor and the mortgage is a secured debt.  <!--/p--><!--p></p-->  <!--p-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill:</span-->  <!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2261"></a-->  <!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2261&amp;amp;pid=BrianODomhnaill&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The difficulty here is that the banks are holding all the cards when it comes to the definition of "co-operation".  The existing legislation holds that the banks have the right to decide whether the person who holds the debt has co-operated.  It is not up to the individual to judge whether the bank is co-operating; it is the other way around.  The banks have a clever system in place whereby they periodically send out automated letters to individuals through a computer system.  If debtors do not respond to these letters, they may be deemed, after a period of time, to be not co-operating with the lender.</p> <p>That is where the difficulty lies.  The banks are taking individuals to court on the basis they have not co-operated even though, in many cases, those individuals are not aware of their obligations under the law.  As noted by independent commentators, the banks effectively wrote the initial personal insolvency legislation to suit themselves and not the debtor.  They hold all the aces in going to court and producing a paper trail to show an individual is not co-operating.  How can debtors co-operate when it is the banks that decide what constitutes co-operation?  In a case where a customer's mortgage repayment is &euro;1,500 per month, say, but he or she can only afford to pay &euro;300 or &euro;400, the bank can refuse to accept that accommodation and the person is deemed to be not co-operating.  It is totally unacceptable.  Having initially gone after owners of second and investment homes, the banks are now moving on to family homes, as we saw in reports in the newspapers last week.  Until there is a level playing field as between debtors and banks, we will not solve this issue.  Of course there are defaulters and debtors who are playing games with banks, but that is an entirely separate issue.  I am referring here to individuals who genuinely cannot afford to pay and where their bank decides they are not making a fair contribution.  How dare banks demand that people reduce shopping bills and other necessary expenses in order to make full repayment?</p> <p>I support the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment, which deals with a key area within the legislation.  In so doing, I am not in any way pointing the finger at the Minister of State, who was not in office when the initial legislation was brought forward.  That legislation was enacted by way of a rushed process wherein the Government facilitated the financial institutions to protect their own interests.  That was wrong.  We will not stand in the way of this Bill, but what is really needed is to go back to the drawing board.  The banks are laughing all the way to the courts.  They are rushing people out of their homes because they know property prices are increasing.  People trapped in secured debt situations will lose their homes as a consequence of the banks' veto.</p></speech>

The lines that are proposed to be deleted relate to the provision whereby a debtor may make a declaration in writing that he or she has co-operated.  In other words, it is the person who owes money who determines, by way of declaration, whether or not he or she has co-operated.  It is a judgment call on the part of the person who is seeking to use the insolvency process.  I regard that as an improvement on the previous situation where it was the lending institution that determined whether somebody had co-operated with the process.  While the amendment is very well meaning, it perhaps misses the nuances of the relevant provision.</p>  <p>There is an issue in insolvency legislation generally regarding the independence of the process.  As I said to the Minister of State on Second Stage, there is scope for amendment in that regard.  <!--/p--><!--p></p-->  <!--p-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Aideen Hayden:</span-->  <!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2384"></a-->  <!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2384&amp;amp;pid=AideenHayden&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As a member of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, I have been at numerous hearings at which banks have been present, and we have heard from a number of them that they do not have an independent process to determine whether a debt is sustainable.  We have all acted for people in mortgage arrears, but a number of the pillar banks have said they do not have a difficulty with an independent body to determine what is and is not sustainable.  The issue of whether somebody has co-operated should be within the remit of the Financial Services Ombudsman.  The legislation relating to the Financial Services Ombudsman is much too weak and this is an area we could very much do with looking at again.  It should be a priority of Government to amend the legislation to include provisions relating to the independence of the process and the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  In the context of this particular amendment, however, I do not believe there is an issue with this section.</p></speech>

We were promised that the banks' veto would be gone.  Instead we have a review of it, and only in certain circumstances.  The biggest get-out clause for the banks is that this court review can only happen if the arrears were built up before 1 January.  That means if I fall into arrears tomorrow the bank has a clear veto.  I do not believe that matches what we were promised.  The Government will argue that those who are in arrears but who had a restructured arrangement will qualify, but that is a mean approach when we consider how a family may have just avoided arrears or restructuring by prioritising a mortgage above all other costs.  Such a family will find itself excluded from ever having the chance to avail of this review if things even go slightly wrong and they find themselves in arrears having just avoided a restructuring, possibly for years.  I hope the Minister supports this amendment.  If he does not, I fear we will be back here in six, 12 or 18 months to correct this flaw.</p></speech>

The effect of the Senators' amendment is to remove the definition of the type of debt that may be the subject of an application for the new court review.  I thank the Senators for their amendment, but I cannot accept it.  First, this amendment risks creating legal uncertainty.  Subsection 21(1) already provides that the new court review refers to a person with a relevant debt.  Removing the definition risks leaving it unclear who can apply for the review.  This sort of uncertainty has to be avoided, particularly given the urgency of making the review available to borrowers in long-term arrears who urgently need solutions.</p>  <p>Second, the definition of "relevant debt" in subsection 18 targets the review at those who are most in need - people who are in mortgage arrears on their home or in a restructure of such arrears which has not returned them to solvency.  <!--/p--><!--p></p-->  <!--p-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in:</span-->  <!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2301"></a-->  <!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2301&amp;amp;pid=AodhanORiordan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is the Government's policy to prioritise this group.  Removing the definition could open up the review to any person proposing a personal insolvency arrangement, including a person whose difficulties relate, for example, to five buy-to-let properties.  This may seem superficially attractive.  However, it would carry a risk of legal uncertainty. </p> <p>I strongly underline that the Government's proposal has been very carefully designed and balanced to take full account of the very difficult legal territory of potentially providing for imposed solutions which could impinge on the property rights of secured lenders.  Following extensive deliberation and legal advice, the Government believes the Bill is constitutionally robust.  An important element, however, is that the Bill concentrates on risk to the borrower&rsquo;s home where the social policy justification for Government intervention, both regarding the borrower and the implications for public housing and other public policies, is at its strongest.  To make the changes proposed by the Senators would disturb this careful balance and risk opening up the Bill to legal challenges.  That would be extremely damaging to the situation of homeowners in serious mortgage arrears who are in urgent need of solutions.  For these reasons, the Government cannot accept the proposed amendment.</p></speech>

Presuming that the legislation will be signed into law by the President in the next number of weeks if approved by the House, it means one's mortgage has to be at least in excess of seven months in arrears for one's debt to qualify as a relevant debt.  Therefore, anyone who has gone into arrears since January is excluded.  What is the reason for this?  Why would there be legal challenges, as the Minister of State mentioned?

It is clear to us that the way this Bill, and the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, were brought before the Houses is a panicked reaction from the Government because there is huge lack of buy-in on the part of the public to the issue of water charges when only 43% of people have signed up at this stage.

Among the terms defined is "net scheme payments", which is required for the purposes of dealing with deductions from certain social welfare payments.  "Debt" is defined as not including debts arising from the repayment of loans to a debtor made by a bank, credit union, moneylender or credit card debt.  It is important to note that "net scheme payments" is a definition which protects those on social welfare because it ensures that the deductions from a social welfare recipient's payments do not dip below the basic social welfare rate.</p></speech>

The debtor will then have to furnish the court with a statement of means and information on dependants and liabilities for it to be able to determine the protected earnings rate of the debtor.  Section 7 deals with the statement of means.  The statement of means to be provided by a debtor is a burden given the amount of information required to be provided.  On top of the worry of personal debt, it is unreasonable to have imposed on a debtor the burden of preparing such an extensive number of information documents for the court.  The possibility of the details provided being inaccurate as a result of the sheer volume of information sought is high.  This will undermine, through no fault of the debtor, the protected earnings rate to be determined by the court.</p>  <p>On Second Stage there were some very valid concerns raised, including by Senator Jillian van Turnhout, about the fact that one would be washing people&rsquo;s dirty laundry in public.  All of their financial details would be discussed in open court.  Considering the amounts of money in question, this seems to be going too far.  Therefore, we have serious concerns about the section and hope the Minister of State will reconsider, even at this late stage.</p></speech>

Questions have been raised by organisations such as FLAC about how the District Court will determine whether a person can afford to pay the debt on enforcement and the various types of enforcement procedure, including deduction from salary through the PAYE or social welfare system.  A debtor in employment, for example, will be obliged to provide a statement of means for the court, which will then be used in assessing his or her capacity to pay.  Where the debtor is receipt of social welfare payments, the statement of means will have attached to it a verification statement from the Department of Social Protection.  Therefore, issues arise regarding employment which we will deal with in other sections and the relationship with the employer.</p>  <p>Judgment debtors are invited to provide a statement of means in regard to instalment order applications, but many do not do so.  According to FLAC, although the legislation is in place, many do not do so in some instances due to a fear of the court process and the public nature of the court appearance.  Any journalist or individual can obtain information in a public courtroom on the means of an individual.  There are no safeguards in place and there is none built into the legislation.</p>  <p>It will be an offence not to comply with this section without a reasonable cause and conviction carries a potential class C fine to a maximum of &euro;2,500, which is another potential debt for the debtor.  The debtor will be afforded the opportunity to make representations to the court on his or her own behalf, but many judgment debtors do not avail of this opportunity, given the public nature of the courtroom.  The ordinary individual on the street would not have the confidence, means or wherewithal to make a case for himself or herself in court without hiring a solicitor.  That costs money, money which he or she does not have in many cases.  The Law Reform Commission has raised this issue.  The Bill makes no reference to any service or support that might be available to debtors, particularly distressed debtors, who appear in court to support their cases on inability to pay.  <!--/p--><!--p></p-->  <!--p-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill:</span-->  <!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2261"></a-->  <!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2261&amp;amp;pid=BrianODomhnaill&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Opportunities have been missed here.  There are two issues.  The first is that there is no support for the debtor who may have to appear in court to present a case.  That support might be legal or emotional, just having someone with them.  Many of these debtors are isolated and living in poverty.  While there are people who may default on debts, even though they can pay them, many others default because they cannot afford to pay.  Those people need support and help.  The issue was raised by the Law Reform Commission but it has not been addressed in this Bill.</p> <p>The second issue concerns the openness of the courts' procedure and process.  As Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh said, individuals have to give their information in a public setting and then effectively make it available to the world, which I think is wrong.  There should be a different process, particularly for small debts.  An opportunity has been missed to establish some kind of out of court system that would be private but which would probably yield better results for the lender than going through the public courts system.  It would also cut down on legal expenses.  </p> <p>A process is being established here that will ultimately benefit the legal profession, which is unregulated.  The EU and IMF raised that as one of the Government's failings, that is, not bringing in regulation to a shielded sector within the Irish economy.  This sector will benefit from this legislation because individuals will need legal representation, but that is wrong.  Small debts of up to &euro;4,000 should be dealt with privately in a different manner outside the court setting.  Both debtors and lenders would obtain better outcomes if that were so.  </p> <p>The Minister of State will probably read the departmental line he has been given in whatever answer is coming from on high.  I must accept that but I think an opportunity has been missed in not dealing with the public courts setting.  Individuals should not have to wash their linen in public and let the world see what their means are.  I think that is wrong.  No one should have to justify why he or she was not in a position to pay a small debt.  We should not put people in that position and we would not have done so if this legislation had been drafted otherwise, with different thinking and new methods, such as what is done in Britain and other jurisdictions.  We could have established a debt office to mitigate for both sides and come up with a compromise.  Everyone would have benefited from that but instead we will fill the courts system again, which is already clogged up.  We know the courts are working in overdrive with debt cases at the moment but this legislation will only exacerbate that, while supporting the legal profession.</p></speech>

I understand that the Senators are opposed to the section which deals with the statement of the debtor&rsquo;s means.  I appreciate that they are trying to be as constructive as possible.</p>  <p>Section 7 sets out the requirements in relation to the information to be provided to the court by the judgment debtor on his or her financial circumstances.  In order for the court to establish the debtor&rsquo;s capacity to pay, it must have sufficient information on the debtor&rsquo;s circumstances, including his or her financial circumstances.</p>  <p>The judgment debtor, on receipt of a notice under section 6, is required to complete a statement of means providing details of their income and financial commitments.  Where the debtor is a social protection recipient, he or she will be required to request a certificate from the Department of Social Protection verifying his or her payments.  This ensures that the court has accurate information on the debtor&rsquo;s social protection payments to assist it in coming to a view on affordability.  This certificate will outline, in particular, what portion of the payment is personal to the debtor, what portion is in respect of his or her dependants, and whether there are any deductions being made from the social protection payment.  The certificate will not be disclosed by the court to the judgment creditor.</p>  <p>The court is empowered to request further supporting documentation from the debtor, or his or her employer, if so required.  The statement of means provided to the court and the verifying certificate from the Department of Social Protection shall be admissible in evidence.</p>  <p>Senators also referred to the statement of means.  <!--/p--><!--p></p-->  <!--p-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in:</span-->  <!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2301"></a-->  <!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2301&amp;amp;pid=AodhanORiordan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The statement of means will be drawn up under rules of court.  It will be along the lines of the forms in use in family maintenance cases and those which will be introduced in the context of attachment of earnings orders for the payment of criminal fines.<br/><br/>The debtor&rsquo;s personal public service number, PPSN, will not be shared with the creditor or the court.  This was made clear in the amendments the Minister tabled on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il.<br/><br/>It is not possible for these matters to be dealt with <i>in camera</i>.  The legal system operates on the basis that justice must be seen to be done in public.  Accordingly, there are limited circumstances in which court hearings may be held <i>in camera</i>.<br/><br/>It is not the case that an employer will see all of a debtor&rsquo;s private financial information.  The employer will be served with the court order by the creditor.  It will set out what deductions must be made over a specified period, as set out in section 10(6).  It will not give the debtor&rsquo;s financial information.<br/><br/>Is the debtor having to provide a copy of his or her completed statement of means to the creditor, as well as to the court, a breach of the debtor&rsquo;s privacy?  It is normal in civil cases to have an exchange of documents between the parties concerned.  However, the statement of means which is to be prescribed under the rules of court and the verifying certificate which is to be prescribed by the Minister for Social Protection will have to be drawn up carefully in order that sensitive information on the debtor is not disclosed.<br/><br/>I appreciate the sensitivity of these issues and hope I have clarified matters for the Senators.</p></speech>

It states no order deducting money from a person&rsquo;s hard-earned wages will be concurrent.  The truth is that this means that there will, therefore, be consecutive deductions.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, at the launch of the annual report of the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, stated:</p> <blockquote> 	People want to pay their debts.  Those who can pay them will pay them.  No reasonable person will resent seeing someone who has fallen on hard times benefit from proportionate debt forgiveness. </blockquote>  <p>There is, however, no debt write-down involved.  Instead, this is merely a ploy, labelled as a safeguard, to keep people in debt for a longer period to make sure every last cent is squeezed from their pockets.  This section will only prolong the hardship and it is not a safeguard.</p></speech>

In the event that a debtor is in receipt of a social welfare payment and earnings, the court can only make an order in respect of one income stream.</p></speech>

The Bill does not offer any guidance on how a court is to discharge its functions, particularly if the debtor is not present in court to make representations in person.  It makes no reference to the reasonable living expenses guide to which the Insolvency Service of Ireland and the official assignee must have regard under the personal insolvency and bankruptcy legislation to ensure a debtor&rsquo;s income does not fall below an acceptable minimum income standard.  <!--/p--> <!--p></p-->  <!--p-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill:</span-->  <!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2261"></a-->  <!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2261&amp;amp;pid=BrianODomhnaill&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->What is happening here is that the courts will have to make a determination of that standard.  Why try to recreate the world?  Reasonable living expenses are already dealt with under section 23 of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.  This should be used.  It should not be determined by a court.  Even FLAC has raised this issue and has said that the courts in general do not have the wherewithal or financial assistance to be able to make such a financial determination.  The courts are there to oversee our legal system, not to carry out financial analysis.  If it was the case that the court was expected to carry out a specialised financial task, the only way it could do so would be to hire financial and budgetary experts to deal with people suffering from over-indebtedness, and that is not part of the Bill either.  The only solution here is the amendment.  Perhaps there is some reason, but I would like to hear what the Minister of State has to say about why we are going down a different path in providing the court with exclusive power instead of working with the Personal Insolvency Act's determination of reasonable living expenses.</p></speech>

On page 12, line nine of the Bill, paragraph (f) of section 10(6) as it stands contains an incorrect cross-reference to paragraph (c).  It should, of course, be paragraph (d), so I would be grateful if this typographical error could be corrected by the Clerk.</p>  <p>Amendment No. 1 seeks the deletion of the existing subsection 10(3) and its substitution with new text which seeks to provide that the court shall be guided by the Insolvency Service of Ireland's reasonable living expenses guidelines when making an attachment of earnings order.  I can understand the Senators' concerns around this issue.  As I said on Second Stage, there is nothing to prevent the court from having regard to those guidelines if they so wish, but there is no need to make such a provision in the Bill.  When I spoke on this matter on Second Stage, I said that I thought it was preferable to allow the court full discretion in assessing a debtor's capacity to repay a debt.  Individual circumstances will vary from debtor to debtor, and the court should be allowed to make its own decision relating to these matters.  While I understand the motivation of the Senators who have proposed this amendment, I think they may well find that the court has more latitude in determining living expenses - and may indeed be more generous to debtors - if it is not obliged to have regard to the Insolvency Service of Ireland's guidelines.  </p>  <p>As I said during the Second stage debate, reasonable living expenses have a different context in respect of personal insolvency.  This Bill deals with the debtor's capacity to pay money that he or she owes to a creditor.  Its provisions ensure that the court has sufficient information available to it relating to the person's financial circumstances.  The court is also obliged to take into account any representations the debtor may make in relation to his or her circumstances.  It is important to remember that the courts already have a body of expertise relating to this matter and I believe that they will approach it in a sensible manner.  In any event, there is nothing to prevent a court from having regard to the Insolvency Service of Ireland's guidelines if it so wishes.  There is simply no need to make an explicit provision for this in the Bill.</p></speech>

The court may well determine more favourably in respect of a debtor.  However, there is no minimum threshold within the legislation and I would like to see something that would protect the debtor.  We would accept as a minimum floor or threshold the reasonable living expenses outlined in the Insolvency Service of Ireland's guidelines.  I appreciate where the Minister of State is coming from, but we are giving latitude here.  It is our job to make the law.  We cannot criticise judges afterwards.  We should at least have a guiding principle in the legislation that would guide the judge in making a determination.  Judges will be in a difficult position with people coming before them and representations on both sides.  There should be a floor and the floor should be the Insolvency Service of Ireland's guidelines.  <!--/p--><!--p></p-->  <!--p-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill:</span-->  <!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2261"></a-->  <!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2261&amp;amp;pid=BrianODomhnaill&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If a judge wants to be more reasonable than the guidelines, that is within his or her jurisdiction.

Section 12 places an obligation on employers to comply with attachment orders.  Under the section, employers have to smash the relationships they have had with employees and collect the money.  Otherwise, the courts will fine them.  Not satisfied with burdening employers with the role of debt collector, the Government is stipulating employers will have to go to courts as part of normal employment behaviour.  For an employer to determine whether particular payments are earnings, he or she will have to make an application to the courts under the legislation and may also be required to provide to the court a statement of specified particulars of his or her employees' earnings and expected earnings.  As if employers did not have enough to do already, they must now deal with court documents and procedures.</p>  <p>When an employee against whom an attachment order has been made changes employment, the new employer must notify the court in writing that the person is now his or her employee and include in such notification a statement of the debtors' earnings and expected earnings from the relevant employment.  Both the existing and future employer must submit a notification.  If a future employer were looking for staff, and a prospective employee had an attachment order, the employer would be sucked into a bureaucratic nightmare when enforcing the Government's policy.  Would an employer choose a potential staff member who has an attachment order, or somebody else?  A person against whom an attachment order has been made becomes less employable under the legislation.  The attachment order probably arises through poverty and the Minister has reduced the affected person's ability to earn in the future.</p>  <p>Setting aside the excessive administrative burden the Government is imposing on employers, imagine the impact of the measure on employee-employer relationships.  In a difficult economic environment, many such relationships are already fraught and difficult, given that both sides of the employment contract are being pulled in different directions.  This will cause more difficulty for employee and employer.  We must ask whether the Government consulted any employers on the legislation.  My colleague, Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n recently contacted the Small Firms Association and learned his call was the first it had received on the matter.  It has never been discussed at an Oireachtas committee.  As far as I know, the issue has not been broached with any employer and yet employers will have a new role under the Government's proposals.</p></speech>

We have all been in a position in which we did not want to pay something because we had an issue with it, even though we could have been wrong.  That does not mean the person are not capable of doing his or her job to a very high standard.  I do not know how that can be dealt with, but it is a fair point.  Perhaps under employment legislation it might be deemed illegal to ask a person at interview if he or she has an attachment of earnings order or to expect a person to declare that he or she is the subject of such an order.  It should be just a formality, like paying tax.  It certainly should not stand against people in changing jobs, improving their skills or applying for positions that may put them in a better position to pay their fines, bills and so on.</p></speech>

Given that the attachment of earnings order applies to PAYE workers, it will cause difficulties in the general workforce.  This has been examined in other jurisdictions - for example, in the US, European countries and in the United Kingdom.  The conclusions drawn from those examinations show the potential for an attachment of earnings order to have an effect on the employment prospects of the debtor.  According to the examination of this practice in other jurisdictions, where an order is directed at the debtor's employer who is obliged to make the prescribed deductions, it can have an adverse effect on the employee's opportunities for promotion and advancement.  It may even have an impact on the debtor's employment prospects, with employers in some cases drawing conclusions that trustworthiness, particularly regarding money matters, may be an issue for that particular employee.  They are very serious consequences.</p> <p>The recent FLAC submission to Members of the Oireachtas indicated that many countries have dealt with the issue through legislative schemes.  FLAC recommended that an attachment of earnings order should only follow a debtor's failure to meet the terms of an instalment order - in other words, as a last resort.  Varying the instalment order downwards due to a debtor's inability to pay should be examined before any attachment of earnings order is made.  Any attachment of earnings order should be capable of being suspended in order to allow the employee to make the payments voluntarily.  If a debtor comes into some money, he or she should be able to clear the debt.  It is very important for that to be included, but it is not included in the Bill, which is surprising.</p>   <p>Where an attachment of earnings order is made, substantial employment protection measures should be put in place.  In this regard, the Law Reform Commission's 2009 consultation paper recommended that the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 1993 should be amended so that dismissal on the grounds of being subject to an attachment of earnings order may be added to the list of unfair reasons for dismissal.  In its 2010 report, the Law Reform Commission recommended that legislation should prohibit not only the dismissal of an employee on the grounds that he or she has become subject to one or more attachment of earnings orders, but should also prohibit any other adverse action from being taken against the employee on this sole ground.  It also recommended that the employer should be guilty of an offence under this heading.</p>  <p>However, the Bill does not take any of these issues into account.  It even allows a District Court judge to make an attachment of earnings order without first requiring the creditor to apply for an instalment order.  There is no protection for the debtor against adverse treatment by his or her employer.  These are major issues which will affect employees either openly or without an employer having to be so open about it.  It may affect promotional opportunities and there may be hearsay within companies.  <!--/p--><!--p></p-->  <!--p-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill:</span-->  <!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2261"></a-->  <!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2261&amp;amp;pid=BrianODomhnaill&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We can imagine that in the public or private sector an attachment of earnings order would become the story of the office and this is very wrong.  The order should only be used, as was highlighted by the Law Reform Commission, as an absolute last resort.  We are opening a Pandora's box, the effects of which no one can anticipate.  The Bill has been brought forward as being based on recommendations from the Law Reform Commission, but the fundamental rights contained in the Law Reform Commission's paper have been excluded from the legislation.  The only rights included are for creditors to obtain their dues without even having to present a case.  This is wrong and it should be examined.  This is a human rights issue as much as anything else, and it is a grave mistake to go down this road without taking on board all of the recommendations contained in the Law Reform Commission's research and examination of this area in other jurisdictions.  We do not want to see the same consequences emerge here as have emerged in other jurisdictions.</p></speech>

It is fair enough, and these issues should be examined in detail when dealing with legislation of this nature.  I have no difficulty with this whatever.  The section deals with compliance with an attachment order.  The employer is required to comply with the order but is not liable for non-compliance during the first ten days.  This is to allow for a situation where the person served with the order is not the person's employer, in which case the person concerned is required to notify the court accordingly.  Provision is also made in subsection (4) for a situation where the debtor changes employment.  Subsection (5) provides that the lapse of an order under subsection (4) does not prevent it remaining in force for other purposes.</p>  <p>With regard to employer and employee relations, employees are protected by unfair dismissal legislation and other employment law.  The Attorney General has advised that unfair dismissal issues are already covered in Irish law and protections are adequate to deal with any issues which might arise regarding any attempt to discriminate against somebody solely on the basis of being the subject of an attachment of earnings order or, as the Senators mentioned, the possibility that a perspective employer might not employ someone because he or she is subject to an attachment of earnings order.  We will monitor the situation very closely because we appreciate the statements made by Senators.  Should any difficulties of this nature emerge we will take action to ensure it does not continue.  It is important to say attachment of earnings orders are common in other countries such as the UK, including Northern Ireland, and Australia.  Irish employers are already required to implement attachment of earnings orders for family maintenance and recovery of social protection overpayments.  This is not necessarily new ground.</p></speech>

We must look at the context in which we are working.  In recent years we have had a number of high-profile industrial relations disputes involving workers in a number of companies in the State, particularly those in lower paid jobs and on zero-hours contracts and the minimum wage.  We have seen some very unscrupulous tactics used by those employers against any workers they see as stepping outside the norm, anybody looking for union recognition in the workplace or anybody standing up for the union recognition that they have.  Unscrupulous employers have been very quick to take away people's hours and give them less favourable working standards.  These are quite hard to prove in court because of the nature of the contracts allowed under the legislation we have at present.  This is one reason we fear an employer, particularly in the lower pay bracket, will possibly wonder whether people coming with an attachment order on their wages are troublesome and whether the order will cause any hassle or mean the employer will have to send a manager or assistant manager to court, which would cost money.  <!--/p--><!--p></p-->  <!--p-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh:</span-->  <!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2363"></a-->  <!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2363&amp;amp;pid=TrevorOClochartaigh&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This legislation and this section will have knock-on effects.

This is the most Thatcherite provision in the Bill.  We are talking about the most vulnerable in our society - pensioners, the sick, the disabled and the unemployed.  It is particularly difficult for young people looking for their first employment or older workers who are made redundant through no fault of their own after the firm in which they worked for most of their lives closes without notice.  It would be understandable if such individuals fell into debt.  The debts do not need to be large because the legislation has a minimum threshold of &euro;500 for court orders for attachment of earnings or deductions from social welfare payments.</p>  <p>Let us take the case of an unemployed young person with limited work experience who in the normal run of things will already struggle to find secure employment.  How much harder will it be for that person to get a job if the first question in the interview is whether he or she has a court order that may require attachment of earnings to clear a civil debt?  I imagine such a question would dampen the young person's enthusiasm and blunt his or her willingness to learn.  The question may render meaningless his or her qualifications, or admirable references, because of the fact that he or she built up a modest debt.  As it is difficult to repay even modest debts when one is unemployed, an order may have been made to deduct the repayments from his or her welfare payments.  What chance will individuals have of securing their first job with attachment orders hanging over their heads?  </p>  <p>An older person who becomes unemployed already faces certain obstacles in finding a new job.  Sadly, age in itself becomes an obstacle in some cases.  Employers may consider those who are highly qualified as overly skilled for the position while others have worked for 20 or 30 years in a trade or job for which there is no longer a demand.  The longer they stay unemployed, the older they get and the less relevant their qualifications become.  It is not difficult to imagine such citizens falling into debt.  As deduction orders made from their social welfare would translate into attachment of earnings orders if they are lucky enough to get a job, how realistic are their chances of finding gainful employment?  Will the employers want the hassle of dealing with that scenario?  I do not think the Government has given serious thought to the way in which these orders could impede future employment prospects.  On that basis, we oppose this section.</p></speech>

This, again, has been hailed as a safeguard by the Government.  This is not a safeguard and it is definitely not an appeals mechanism, as some have suggested.  Another major flaw with the Bill is the lack of an appeals mechanism.  Sometimes courts can get it very wrong.  An attachment of earnings or the so-called protected earnings rate may be incorrect.  It may be so incorrect that it merits a new hearing but the Bill does not allow for that.  Instead, a debtor can get the order varied.  <!--/p--><!--p></p-->  <!--p-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh:</span-->  <!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2363"></a-->  <!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2363&amp;amp;pid=TrevorOClochartaigh&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a-->  <!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Given that it is not good procedural practice, we oppose the section.</p></speech>

The Government has hailed this as a safeguard.  It is not a safeguard and it is definitely not an appeals mechanism.  As I have said, another major flaw of the Bill is the lack of an appeals mechanism given that the courts can get it wrong.  Of the 27 sections in the Bill, there is only one section of merit, namely, section 26, which repeals Parts I and IV of the Debtors Act (Ireland) 1872 and is the only section of the Bill we support.  We agree with the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission to provide for the abolition of imprisonment of debtors except in the case of maintenance arising from family law.  It is in line with international best practice on human rights.  The fact this has been sneakily attached to a section at the very back of the Bill is cynical and disguises the entire Bill as a step forward.  For the reasons outlined, we object to the section.</p></speech>
