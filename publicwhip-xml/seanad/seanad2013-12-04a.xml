That is the way we should do our business in future and I know the Leader has committed to scrutinising some of these reports.</p><p>On my behalf and that of my party, I would like to say how shocked and disgusted we were with the findings of the Smithwick report.  All of us need time to read the report in full and I know the Leader will provide time in the future for a reasoned debate on it.  Having said that, none of us should lose sight of the tens of thousands of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who served this State with distinction over the years.  The report highlights one individual who Judge Smithwick believes colluded with the Provisional IRA and members of the republican movement in the murders of Harry Breen and Bob Buchanan but that is something we will debate further.  As I said, thousands of garda&iacute; have served this State and protected it against the Provisional IRA and the republican movement over decades and many gave their lives in the service of this State.  We should always bear that in mind.  One individual has done a lot of damage to the reputation of the force.  </p><p>What further concerns me from reading the summary of the report is that members of the IRA, many of whom are members of Sinn F&eacute;in, did not give evidence to the tribunal in public.  Their evidence was frankly pathetic.  In an interview on Newstalk this morning, Deputy Gerry Adams further exacerbated the problem when he effectively put the blame for the murders of Buchanan and Breen down to the fact that they needed to be careful about their security.  That is an absolutely outrageous and disgusting remark from a leader of the Sinn F&eacute;in movement, many members of which served in the IRA.  As we all know, Deputy Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn F&eacute;in, was a member of the IRA, and a significant leader in it.  From his operational activities, he probably would know these two officers, who were carrying out their duty as officers of the law in Northern Ireland, needed to be more careful about their security.  These two men were nothing short of murdered by the IRA.  I am certain that the people who carried out these murders are well known to Deputy Gerry Adams and senior members of Sinn F&eacute;in.</p><p>Our thoughts today are with the families of Chief Superintendent Breen and Superintendent Buchanan because I have no doubt the publication of this report will bring back some awful memories and feelings about the tragedy of the murders in south Armagh.  I am certain the Leader will address this but I ask that we have time for a full debate.</p><p>I commend Judge Smithwick on all the work he has done over the years to produce this report.  The establishment of the tribunal was worthwhile.  We need to look at areas where this State might have failed but let us not lose sight of the fact it was effectively fighting for its survival in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s against subversives in the Provisional IRA, many of who are now sitting in the Oireachtas.  Will the Leader provide time for a full debate when we have had the chance to read the report in full and consider its implications?</p></speech>

We all share a sense of outrage, disappointment and sadness at the findings of his report and our thoughts are with the families of Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and Superintendent Robert Buchanan.  I thank the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, and the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Gilmore, for their very prompt apologies on behalf of the State in this regard.  It is welcome that there has been no further delay in issuing such apologies.  I also ask the Leader if we might have a debate on the findings of the Smithwick tribunal because of its important ramifications for the Garda.  I know the Commissioner will make a statement later today and we await that.</p><p>I observe the tax revenues and VAT receipts that came in at the end of November were up.  I suppose that shows a sign of confidence and improvement in the economy.  We are slowly making progress.  One could go mad and say that is a signal of all manner of great things but I do not believe that to be the case.  It is a good sign of progress and shows were are going in the right direction but there is much work to be done.  </p><p>I draw attention to a statement made by the former Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly, exactly one year ago when she appeared before the Joint Committee on Public Oversight and Petitions.  She pointed out that the Department of Health, because of what appeared to be a culture of prevarication, disregard for the law and an inability to take hard decisions, had already caused the State to incur enormous costs and looked set to continue on that path.  Yesterday, with the observation of Ms Justice Mary Irvine in regard to cases before the courts, we saw the delays in accepting liability.  Ms O'Reilly was referring to the Who Cares? report and the number of settlements made out of court without any acknowledgment and without any information.</p><p>Given all we have heard about top-ups and payments to chief executives, I would like to know how much money the HSE is paying out in those settled cases on foot of the Who Cares? report because those trying to take cases find them dragged out over a long number of years and then being settled one by one.  Even though the Ombudsman pointed out where the problems lay and the Department of Health and the HSE know what the liabilities are, we, as citizens, do not know how much money has been spent on each of these settlements.  In light of the desire for accountability and transparency, those figures should now be made available.  Will the Leader see if we can find a way, through the Minister for Health, to make these figures available?  It is money being spent on our behalf and we should know how much it is.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-04a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1136" speakername="David Norris" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013120400003#B00500"><p>I join with my colleagues in calling for a debate on the Smithwick report and I compliment Judge Smithwick on the clarity of his conclusions.  I have not had the opportunity to read the whole report but I have read the shortened accounts of it in the newspapers.  It is significant that he said it is distressing and disheartening that even today, a culture appears to prevail in the Garda where loyalty is prized above honesty.  That really needs to be looked at and we need to have independent supervision of the Garda.  In every profession, there should be an independent regulator.  I think that should be the case in the media, the Garda, the legal profession and so on.  I am also very glad the Government acted so swiftly and honourably in making an apology to the families, who must be deeply distressed by this situation.</p><p>Along with one of my colleagues, I was horrified to hear the leader of Sinn F&eacute;in, Deputy Gerry Adams, speak on Newstalk.</p> <p>There seemed to be a kind of cold-heartedness and cynicism about the entire thing.  To blame the victim in this way suggests to me that Deputy Adams is unfit for his position as leader of Sinn F&eacute;in, a democratic party, in the other House.  He said that they showed disregard for their own security and sat comfortably in Dundalk police station.  Why should they not?  They were police officers and they were cooperating, as they thought, with the Garda in Dundalk.  I am sure that the overwhelming majority of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na feel betrayed by what happened in this instance.  It is very regrettable.  These things, unfortunately, appear to have happened on both sides.  There are strong indications of collusion on the part of the British Government with certain Loyalist elements.  This is appalling, depressing and disheartening.  I am glad that we have faced up to it.</p><p>The person or persons responsible for setting up these two brave police officers for their murder betrayed their own colleagues in a most extraordinary way and this is something for which they stand reproached by the entire society.  I would like to think, and I believe strongly, that one of the difficulties at that time was the lack of transfer of intelligence between the two forces.  Information was made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and apparently was not transmitted to the PSNI.  There seems to have been an awkwardness in communication.  I believe that has passed.  I very much welcome the fact that there is strong co-operation between the two police forces.  It is a sad day.</p><p>In that context there is a case which was repeatedly raised in this House about which a Minister from the previous Government, a very decent man, accepted that there was a gross injustice, the case of D&oacute;nal de R&oacute;iste who was dishonourably discharged from the army simply on the basis that he went to a pub in which there were Republican sympathisers.  This was guilt by attainder, it was medieval.  It was a gross and shocking injustice.  This House voted and the Minister said that it was so but nothing has yet been done.  This House should discuss that matter again.  This man was completely innocent but for some obscure reason he was fired from his job, dishonourably discharged and his family was extremely distressed.  It was raked up in the most disgusting way when his sister ran for the Irish Presidency but nothing has been done about it, although we have all recognised that it was an injustice.  On the other hand, there was a very long period over which it was suggested, known and openly spoken about that there had been some degree of collusion and little was done.  I would like that, parallel with this discussion, we again open the case of D&oacute;nal de R&oacute;iste and I would like my colleagues to join me in this, simply out of fairness because we need equity in all these matters.</p></speech>

The house was vacant for some time and the electricity was disconnected.  I am now advised that the procedure for reconnecting the electricity will take three months.  It is unacceptable that two State authorities, the local authority and the ESB cannot co-operate to expedite a matter such as this.  There are approximately ten different steps that must be taken before a house is reconnected.  The local authority-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-04a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1150" speakername="Colm Burke" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013120400004#C00400"><p>I am aware of that but this is an issue that cannot be left as it is.  This is a young family who want to get into a house before Christmas but which is told that it will take three months to reconnect the electricity.  The local authority has to send in an application, the ESB must send back a bill, and the local authority must pay the bill before the reconnection is made.  It is outrageous that something like this is happening in this day and age.  Ten different steps must be taken.  It is not the fault of the local authority officials or of the ESB officials but of the procedure.  Will the Leader raise this matter with the Minister to ensure that the relevant Ministers come together to resolve this problem?  This is just one case that I know of.  I am sure the same is happening in many other local authorities around the country.  It is not good enough.  It is not acceptable.  I ask that some action be taken on the matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-04a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1164" speakername="Diarmuid Wilson" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013120400004#C00500"><p>I support Senator Burke&rsquo;s call for resolution of that case.  It is ludicrous that it should take three months to reconnect a house that is obviously already wired and properly kitted out for connection.  I call on the Leader please to try to facilitate that request this morning.</p><p>I join Senator Norris in calling for the case of the former army officer to be reconsidered by this House.  It is correct that a motion was passed unanimously by this House when it was raised as a Private Member&rsquo;s motion by the former Senator Eoghan Harris.  It was supported by all sides, including the then Minister for Defence, Deputy Tony Killeen, who agreed that an injustice was caused to this individual yet nothing has been done to clear his name.  I echo Senator Norris&rsquo; call this morning that the House again consider the case.</p><p>I welcome the publication yesterday of the Smithwick report and I look forward to a debate in this House on that. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-04a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1162" speakername="Denis Landy" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013120400004#C00600"><p>I commend the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, for her initiative on temporary employment.  It is estimated that almost 40% of retailing employers take on extra staff at Christmas time but heretofore many people on jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance were reluctant to take up this employment because when they broke their claim it took months in some cases to get it back again.</p><p>The Minister, having consulted on this, has decided that a claim need not be suspended and that somebody can work for up to eight weeks after which the claim will be put back in place.  This is a welcome initiative and it is a sign that this Government is listening to the issues that prevent people who are unemployed getting temporary and full-time work.  I hope that this will continue for summer work etc.  I commend the Minister for that move.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-04a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013120400004#C00700"><p>I echo the statements of sympathy for the Breen and Buchanan families and the praise for Judge Smithwick.  I also welcome the measured response by the Minister of Justice in Northern Ireland, David Ford.  I am sure that the very good working relationship between him and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence, Deputy Shatter, will serve us all.</p><p>Will the Leader clarify whether yet again the Department of Health is refusing to implement an EU directive on health insurance, dating back to 1992?  According to reports on the radio we are seeking yet another year&rsquo;s derogation.  In this sector between 2008 and 2012 premiums went up by 56%, and 250,000 people have given up health insurance.  We subscribe to the principles of open enrolment, community rating lifetime cover but the Department is interested in protecting its in-house company, the VHI.  It is not working.  Health insurance is a financial service and should be regulated accordingly.  There is not a separate Exchequer for the Department of Health.  The present policy is postponing the day when the Government moves towards universal health insurance.  Will the Leader clarify if the Department of Health is yet again postponing a decision that the Commission asked it to make in 1992, which has been endorsed by the European Court and has been in the Supreme Court here?  When will the Department wake up to the damage that it is doing to the health insurance sector in Ireland?</p> <p>Treatments that take 10.6 days here and cost &euro;1,500 per night per bed can be done in 3.7 days elsewhere.  There is huge waste which a competing health insurance company could help to eliminate.  It is more procrastination and it has been going on so long that I do not blame the Minister for this; rather, it is the corporate culture in the Department of Health that wants VHI to always be protected from more efficient new entrants.</p></speech>

I share the sentiments expressed by all of those Senators who contributed on that issue.</p><p>It is important, as Senator Darragh O'Brien stressed, that nothing in this report detracts from the great and good work of the Garda force over the years of the Troubles in policing the safety of our people and the institutions of the State.  We must remember that only three officers were named in this report.  The references to inappropriate and improper contact with members of the Provisional IRA involved no more than three that Judge Smithwick could identify, and it referred to one Garda station in the country, namely, Dundalk.  We have to get matters in perspective in that regard.</p><p>I raised the report with the Leader yesterday and he said it was imminent.  He was right, proving he is probably better informed than the rest of us.  I thank him for his commitment yesterday - I have no doubt he will give it again this morning - to allow us a full debate on this report in early course.</p><p>If I may, I want to refer to one recommendation in the report.  We have all referred over the years to issues regarding the Border, for example, the smuggler mentality and the illegal activities such as fuel laundering, cigarette smuggling and so on.</p></speech>

I want to refer to one recommendation of Judge Smithwick, which states: "That frameworks and procedures be put in place to allow for the structured and regular exchange of intelligence between the PSNI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which exchange should be governed by information-sharing protocols rather than ad hoc decision-making."  In that regard, he commends as a model worthy of potential the specific operation that is in place between the United States and Canada along their border.  I believe, building upon that, we could have Border offices out of which the two forces may be able to jointly operate.  We have all heard of hot pursuit and so on, and many of us have referred to Border corridors, but an arrangement in line with that recommendation could be put in place, although, of course, that would be a matter for the Governments.  I look forward to us developing our thoughts further along those lines when we come to deal with the full debate.</p></speech>

I very much welcome its publication and compliment the judge on his painstaking work over a protracted period.  I want to express our sympathies to the families of Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and Superintendent Bob Buchanan.  Our thoughts are very much with them today.</p><p>It is regrettable that some damage has certainly been done to the reputation of the Garda.  The report points to one bad apple at one Garda station in Dundalk and it is worrying that the report states it is unlikely this person will be identified.  I would certainly have thought it should have been possible to identify this person, given the location from which they worked was certainly identified.</p><p>There is some rightful criticism of the republican movement for their less than full co-operation with the inquiry.  There are certainly legacy issues from the past to be dealt with and, if we want the full truth to come out, people have to be forthright and upfront, and co-operate fully with all inquiries.  I fully agree with Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh on the matter of the inquiry into the death of Pat Finucane and that report must also be concluded.</p><p>I very much welcome the fact the Minister for Justice and Equality and the T&aacute;naiste gave a very full apology to the families.  This is welcome and, I see from media reports, very much appreciated by the families.</p><p>I strongly support the words of Senator Colm Burke in calling for some level of common sense and co-operation to be brought to bear on the ESB.  There is something bureaucratic and crazy about a situation where ten steps have to be followed before a house can be reconnected with electricity.  I call on the relevant Ministers to get together to resolve that issue.</p></speech>

It is certainly shocking when it is taken in its full context, but it is also shocking when certain politicians would try to lay the blame, or at least part of the blame, on those who were murdered.  One cannot do that if one subscribes to peace.  One cannot have peace in the form of an <i>&agrave; la carte</i> menu; it must be on the basis of exclusive peace.  All political parties should reflect on this issue and not jump to conclusions, and certainly not blame those who were murdered for any shortcomings in this regard.</p><p>  The issue of health has been raised on the Order of Business a number of times.  The Government can defend its record, if it so wishes, but the facts speak louder than words.  In my own county, the waiting lists for orthodontic treatment have increased by 900% under this Minister's watch.  The average waiting list for orthodontic treatment has gone from 458 patients in Donegal in July 2011 to 4,127 on 26 November this year.  That is just over a 900% increase on the watch of the Minister, Deputy James Reilly.</p><p>  We hear that waiting lists are under control but the figures and facts do not back that up.  It is time we had the Minister for Health in this Chamber to discuss such issues.  I suggest we need a full day to go through the shortcomings in the Department of Health, right across the board, whether it is in regard to medical cards, orthodontic treatment or the overpayment issue in hospitals and the culpability of the Minister and Department in that regard.</p> <p>We have all seen the media reports on that issue in recent weeks.</p></speech>

The airline intends to have a daily service between Shannon and Bristol and to double capacity on the existing routes to Manchester and Birmingham.  This will create 20 jobs in Shannon and is a direct consequence of the abolition of the travel tax.  I commend the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, on taking that brave decision in the budget.  We have seen tangible effects from it, including the news from Aer Lingus today.  This new development follows the recent announcement by Ryanair that it will carry an additional 300,000 passengers in 2014.

I accept what Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh said regarding the institutionalised collusion by the British Government through the agency of the SAS and so on.  That collusion was starkly outlined in a recent book by Anne Cadwallader.  We can only conclude that if what went on in the North was a war, then it was a very dirty war.  None of the parties has come out of it with any great honour and glory.  Thanks be to God that people like Albert Reynolds, Garret FitzGerald, Tony Blair, Bertie Ahern and others were able to prevail upon those involved in that war to put an end to it.</p></speech>

No less an authority than Ruby Walsh has said it is impossible to ride horses out and train them in the shadow of the turbines.  We must take seriously the concerns of those working in what is an important sector of our economy.  I have called several times for a debate on the racing industry.  I hope the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, will address this issue when he comes to the House.  I ask the Leader to bring forward that engagement.</p></speech>

During a previous debate I expressed my disappointment that a truth and justice commission had not been established to deal with events during the course of the Troubles in Northern Ireland.  It was interesting last night to hear Gregory Campbell saying something similar.  Many people would like to see such a forum established, but it does not seem likely to happen in the near future.  In the meantime, will the Leader consider setting aside not just a portion of a day but time over a number of weeks to allow us to discuss, in a focused manner, the many issues arising out of the conflict on this island?</p><p>I am glad some closure has been brought to bear for the families of the two police officers in question.  We should always remember the human side of conflict and the suffering that goes with it.  The family of Pat Finucane have suffered in a similar way, as have the family of Rosemary Nelson.  Those of us who watched the recent &quot;Panorama&quot; programme saw that a group of people working in an official capacity were allowed to target and kill civilians at will.  We saw that collusion in the case of Bloody Sunday, for example.  It is wrong to claim that in raising issues such as those highlighted today in the Smithwick report, we are somehow minimising the suffering of somebody else or justifying some other act.  These types of revelations will continue to emerge into the future, probably for decades, with one particular incident being examined and other people asking why their case was not considered.  The only way I can see of dealing with all that is if we seek to encapsulate the whole story by giving everybody an opportunity to place on record, in a methodical and analytical fashion, their account of events.  We will never be able to eliminate the suffering of the bereaved, who will continue to suffer for the rest of their lives, but we can, by way of an open and inclusive process of examination, seek to achieve stability on this island and understanding among former adversaries.</p><p>I ask the Leader and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to consider taking my proposal on board.  The case of D&oacute;nal de R&oacute;iste has been rightly brought forward by colleagues.  I am sure he and his family would like that case to be examined.  It is one of many issues to be debated.  If the Smithwick report were to act as a catalyst to bring that type of process about and if Seanad &Eacute;ireann were the vehicle for its implementation, we would be doing justice to the memory of all those killed in the conflict.  Above all else, we would also be providing some type of foundation for full and proper development, co-operation and reconciliation into the future.</p></speech>

As a long-time critic in this House of the failure by the British authorities to deal with collusion at various levels in Northern Ireland, I must also condemn the finding in this report of collusion by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is unacceptable that any police force should have within its ranks people who subvert the law.  We depend on the Garda for our security and, as Senator Ned O'Sullivan rightly said, its members have served us well in this State.  Many of them have made the ultimate sacrifice in defence of the people and in upholding the security of the State.  It is sad, therefore, to discover there were elements within the force who deviated from those high standards.</p><p>  The debate should be broadened out to include other areas of collusion.  Some weeks ago I raised the issue of the reported collusion highlighted by Anne Cadwallader in her book, <i>Lethal Allies: British Collusion in Ireland</i>.  Some of us, including the Leader and me, have served on Oireachtas sub-committees where we heard evidence from members of the British army and the Police Service of Northern Ireland, various specialists and victims themselves.  All those issues need to be lanced.</p> <p>It is within six months of the 40th anniversary of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, which caused the single biggest loss of life in the State during the atrocities.  The fact that the people affected have found no closure in the meantime is nothing short of reprehensible.  I believe this House could play a role in applying pressure.  I agree with Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh that the State has faced up to the killing of the police officers, Superintendent Bob Buchanan and Chief Superintendent Harry Breen, but there is a need for the British Government to face up to the murder of Pat Finucane, which is probably the clearest illustration of collusion in all the atrocities that have been committed.  I hope we will not have a one-sided debate on this.</p></speech>

One often hears the phrase, "We can forgive, but we can never forget", but seeing the photographs of Chief Superintendent Breen and Superintendent Buchanan in the newspapers today is a reminder to us that it is important that we do not forget.  Sometimes people think the requirement of a peace process is that one forget things, but it is never appropriate to forget.  Forgiveness, of course, is essential.</p><p>Senator Darragh O'Brien drew our attention to what appear to be very troubling remarks by Deputy Gerry Adams this morning.  We must all live this experience, obviously recognising our own failings, of continuing to feel disgust at what happened and continuing to expect that those who have rightly made the move to a democratic life and respect for the Constitution would acknowledge the wrongness of what happened in the past, while we also celebrate their arrival into legitimate political activity.  Our thoughts today must be with the families of those men who were killed.  It is striking how terribly recent it all is.</p><p>Senator Crown intends to raise on the Adjournment the issue of supports for people with Huntington's disease.  I fully support him on that.  I am delighted to welcome to the Visitors Gallery today two academics from National University of Ireland, Galway, Mary Dempsey and Professor Bob Lahue, who were both nominees for the Irish Laboratory Awards last night.  Professor Lahue won two awards, for medical laboratory of the year and the pharmaceutical laboratory of the year.  The Lahue laboratory has been involved in the discovery of a new target to combat Huntington's disease and it is at the pre-clinical trials stage.  We owe academics such as Ms Dempsey and Professor Lahue a great debt.  I am sure Members will join me in wishing them every success with their work and congratulating them on their achievements to date.</p></speech>

At least two of the largest hospitals in the State, which derive their income virtually entirely from State funding, have boards that do not include even one publicly appointed, publicly elected or publicly accountable member.  In the case of one hospital, the board is appointed entirely by the former owners of the hospital, who left a legacy arrangement to ensure it is in perpetuity a Protestant board, and in the other there is a similar arrangement, with input from the Dublin archdiocese.  There are other arrangements like this throughout the country, and it is not confined to formerly Catholic, clerically run institutions.</p><p>Some type of system of accountability must be put in place.  For a start, there should be an ability to put in freedom of information requests on every organisation that receives public funds.  That should be a bare minimum.  In addition, there should be a legislative effort by the Government in that regard.  There is an unusual situation in Ireland.  We have a public hospital system in which many of the hospitals that provide a service are not publicly owned.  They are owned by boards that get their money from the State, but without any input from the State.  All kinds of dysfunctions have arisen from that, and the most recent reports indicate another level of dysfunction.  Will the Leader consider scheduling a debate with the Minister for Health on the governance structures of our hospitals, particularly as we are apparently to transition toward an all-insurance based model?</p><p>I offer my support for the wonderful work of Judge Smithwick.  I extend my sympathies to the families of Superintendent Bob Buchanan and Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and to the families of the other 3,200 people who were killed in the Northern Ireland conflict.  It is sobering now and then to get a reminder with those old faded photographs, particularly for those of us at an age to remember what it was like to open a newspaper every day and discover that three, four, five or ten people had been murdered the day before.  It is right to remember all of these individuals.</p></speech>

We are all very grateful to Judge Smithwick for the report.  Everybody is saddened and appalled that a person in Dundalk Garda station contributed to the deaths of Bob Buchanan and Harry Breen.  In addition, I believe every member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and especially the families of the brave members of the Garda who lost their lives protecting the institutions of the State, must be very saddened by what this report has exposed.  We will have a full debate on the report after due reflection on it.  The comments of the Leader of Sinn F&eacute;in on local radio this morning were reprehensible.</p></speech>

These industries receive financial support from the State through the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund in accordance with the legislation, specifically under section 12 of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001.  My Department makes payments from the fund to Horse Racing Ireland and to Bord na gCon.</p><p>In the period 2001 to date, a total of &euro;841.77 million has been paid from the fund to the horse and greyhound racing industries in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  State funding provided from the fund is crucial to the survival and continued development of the horse and greyhound racing industries.  The Estimates for my Department, passed by both Houses as part of budget 2014, contained an allocation of &euro;54.22 million for the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund.  This will be distributed 80% to HRI and 20% to Bord na gCon  in accordance with section 12(6) of the Act.  In order to allow my Department to provide the moneys allocated in budget 2014, it is necessary to comply with a technical requirement in the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act which requires increasing the cumulative limit on the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund by &euro;54.22 million.  This is achieved by way of the regulations submitted here today.  The aggregate limit on the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund has been increased in this manner in the years 2004, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012.  </p><p>The Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, at its recent meeting held on 26 November 2013, considered this financial provision in detail and concluded by recommending the approval of these regulations giving effect to the &euro;54.22 million allocation in support of the horse and greyhound racing industry.</p><p>The funding provided to Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon supports two very important indigenous industries and helps to sustain the role of the thoroughbred horse and greyhound breeding, training and racing enterprises in the development of the rural economy.  These industries produce a very good return on the State's investment and are a significant net contributor to the Exchequer.</p><p>Horse racing is a global industry and stallions and mares can move from one country to another.  Ireland must compete with world class competition in all aspects of the industry.  It is estimated the Irish bloodstock industry provided 14,000 jobs - many in rural areas - almost &euro;l.l billion in economic output and exports worth some &euro;174 million.  Ireland holds a pre-eminent position in the thoroughbred racing world, being the biggest producer of thoroughbred foals in Europe and the fourth largest producer in the world.  Approximately 40% of the EU output of thoroughbreds and 11% of the global total are produced in Ireland.  The industry is widely distributed throughout the country with 83% of horses bred on farms with two mares or fewer.  There are 26 racecourses located across the country.  Horse Racing Ireland is responsible for the overall administration, promotion and development of the industry.</p><p>The Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund has helped Ireland to develop into a world centre of excellence for horse racing and has allowed Horse Racing Ireland to undertake a capital investment programme that has underpinned a series of infrastructural improvements in the sector.  Bord na gCon estimates that the greyhound industry employs over 10,300 people and contributes an estimated &euro;500 million in economic output to local economies around the tracks which have a wide geographic spread.  Bord na gCon reports that since 2002.  More than 10 million people have attended greyhound racing meetings.</p><p>The funding being provided to the greyhound racing sector helps sustain a long-standing tradition as the industry is part of the social fabric of our country.  This funding underpins the economic activity in what are in many instances, less affluent regions of the country.  It has also contributed significantly to the improved facilities now available at 17 greyhound tracks around Ireland.  The horse racing and greyhound racing industries tick all the boxes in terms of employment and foreign direct investment and they are the type of export-orientated industries we need.  They enhance our international reputation and attract significant numbers of tourists to Ireland.</p><p>Successive governments have recognised the importance of the horse and greyhound racing industries and have supported them through legislation and policy initiatives.  The overall objective of the Government is to ensure that these industries achieve their maximum potential and in so doing contribute to the economic and social fabric of the country.  The support provided by public funds investing in these industries through the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund has enabled Ireland to become a world centre of excellence for horse racing and greyhound racing and breeding.  The draft regulations before the House provide for an amount totalling &euro;54.22 million to be allocated to the horse and greyhound industries in 2014.  It is expected that approximately &euro;25.32 million will be collected from excise duty on off-course betting in 2013.</p><p>When the Horse and Greyhound Fund was established in 2001, it was envisaged that the revenue from the betting tax would provide sufficient resources to finance the fund.  However, this has proven not to be the case due to successive cuts in betting duty coupled with an increasing level of betting activity migrating to tax-free platforms.  I am pleased to say that as part of its overall commitment to the industry the Government is addressing, through legislation, the anomaly whereby remote and on-line betting operators are outside the tax net.  The Minister for Finance has published the Betting (Amendment) Bill 2013 which, when enacted, will extend betting duty to on-line and remote operators.  I understand that this Bill will be brought before the Oireachtas soon.</p><p>The Government wishes to ensure that an appropriate infrastructure is in place to facilitate the growth and development of the horse and greyhound racing industries into the future.  The Indecon report into certain aspects of the Irish horse racing industry, commissioned by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, in early in 2012, made recommendations aimed at securing the viability and sustainability of the horse racing industry.  Indecon recognised the horse racing sector as, &quot;an important indigenous industry which has the potential to increase Ireland's export earnings and employment&quot;.  Measures are being implemented to give effect to the recommendations made in the Indecon report.  My colleague, the Minister for Finance, introduced the Betting (Amendment) Bill 2013 earlier this year which will bring remote and on-line betting within the tax net.  This is consistent with the Indecon recommendation which advocated that, &quot;Measures should be introduced to secure a significant increase in taxation from the Betting Sector&quot;.  I expect that actions being taken by the industry aimed at growing commercial income and sponsorship and increasing efficiency through the streamlining of functions will benefit the industry.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, anticipates that he will soon be in a position to bring proposals to Cabinet setting out the legislative changes required to give effect to the recommendations contained in the Indecon report.</p><p>I recently announced the Department's intention to commission a review of certain matters relating to Bord na gCon.  A public procurement process ensued and it is expected that the contract for this review will be awarded very soon.  The review will encompass the policy, governance, regulatory framework and the financial situation of Bord na gCon and will assist the Department in identifying any measures required to meet the challenges that lie ahead in a very dynamic environment.</p> <p>I look forward to seeing the outcome of the review, which I expect will be completed towards the end of March 2014.</p><p>State funding provided through the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund is crucial to the survival and ongoing development of the horse and greyhound racing industries.  These important industries require this funding in order to maintain and grow their economic activity, thereby supporting employment and facilitating export growth.  Both Houses of the Oireachtas have approved the provision made in budget 2014 to allocate &euro;54.2 million to the fund.  In order for my Department to distribute that amount to Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, and Bord na gCon, the aggregate limit of the fund must be increased by &euro;54.2 million pursuant to the provisions of section 12(5) of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001.  Accordingly, I wish to request that this House approve the motion.  I ask for the House's support so as to ensure that HRI and Bord na gCon receive the funding provided for in budget 2014 and that the important role of these industries, including the employment supported and the economic activity generated, is sustained.  I commend this motion to this House and I look forward to discussing any matter that may arise.</p></speech>

I also thank the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes.  This may be his first time handling a Bill in the House, although he may have taken some Adjournment debates.  I wish him well in his new role.</p><p>  This motion has been passed by the D&aacute;il and discussed by the agriculture committee, where I raised concerns about the issue.  I will do so again today and add other concerns.  I am a great believer in the need to support financially the sport and thoroughbred horse industry together with the greyhound industry, given the economic benefits that they provide and that are there for all to see.</p><p>  The industry is unable to sustain itself through the betting system.  This year, income from betting will be in the region of &euro;25 million.  The same amount next year would lead to a shortfall of approximately &euro;30 million.  My difficulty with this is that the taxpayer is being asked to carry the burden by way of statutory instrument, as requested in this motion.  There are alternatives, one of which the Minister of State highlighted.  The main alternative is to extend betting tax beyond bookmakers to online gambling.  The online and offline gambling sectors are worth a combined &euro;4.6 billion to the Exchequer this year.  According to the Indecon report, a 1% tax rate would generate approximately &euro;46 million.  We should at least consider increasing the rate to 2% and generate &euro;90 million.  I would not propose to give all of the additional money to the horse and greyhound racing industry, as we forget that this income is not exclusively from that industry.  This country has other sports.  For example, the Irish Sports Council will receive &euro;25 million this year.  It represents 57 national sports, including the GAA, 32 local sports partnerships and 18 high-performance sports.  Some of the money raised should go towards the council and possibly the FAI.</p><p>  To ask the taxpayer to carry the can when there is an alternative is wrong.  The legislation is lying in the Department of Finance.  While it is not the Minister of State's fault, it is regrettable that the legislation was not tabled ahead of this motion.  We would not have needed to approve this motion.  Even if the rate was left at 1%, the shortfall would only have been &euro;8 million if the tax was extended to online gambling.</p><p>  I will address the greyhound racing industry in a moment, but I recognise fully the importance of the horse racing industry.  It has served this country well.  However, the funding model is wrong and no request should be made to a committee or either House of the Oireachtas seeking the taxpayer to carry the can where there is a shortfall and an alternative way of raising that money.</p><p>  I am unsure of how much time I have left.</p></speech>

The latter has received approximately &euro;11 million this year.  The Minister of State touched slightly on the issues affecting the greyhound industry.  It is in chaos due in large part to the fact that Bord na gCon's chairman and board refuse to meet the Irish Greyhound Owners and Breeders Federation, IGOBF.  I have that in writing from the federation.  This is wrong.  Bord na gCon has serious questions of accountability, transparency and integrity to answer.  So far, answers have not been forthcoming.  I welcome the fact that the Committee of Public Accounts is examining this issue.  When some 50% of the &euro;11 million or &euro;12 million that goes to Bord na gCon comes from the taxpayer, answers must be forthcoming.  The rest of the amount comes from the industry.</p><p>  The IGOBF has been in existence for more than 40 years and is the controlling body for all regional greyhound owners and breeders.  It is a formidable, grassroots organisation.  Often, it is also a volunteer-based organisation.  Bord na gCon's 2013-17 strategic business plan is self-congratulatory and much of it has been disputed by the federation.  They are one year into the plan, yet there has been no formal communication between the breeders and the executive of Bord na gCon.  Its chairman refuses to allow the executive to meet the IGOBF.  This is outrageous.</p><p>  To be fair, a review is under way, but an integrity commissioner needs to be appointed to examine the manner in which the funding is being drawn down and spent.  From information that has been passed to me, it is my understanding that Bord na gCon is indebted to the tune of &euro;30 million and that greyhound stadiums lost &euro;1 million last year.  Serious questions need to be answered.  While we can ask them as politicians, an independent investigation must be undertaken by an integrity commissioner to examine how taxpayers' money is being expended and whether we are getting the best value for that money.  I am sure that the Minister of State will agree that issues should be addressed where they arise.</p></speech>

As we are aware, budget 2014 included a provision to allocate just over &euro;54 million, in an 80:20 split, to the horse and greyhound industries.  This is a significant allocation and reflects the importance of both industries to the economy and sporting life.  It is estimated that the combined horse and greyhound industry supports 24,000 jobs and generates &euro;1.6 billion in economic output.</p> <p>Both industries are net contributors to the economy.  Funding which had been allocated to these sectors has come back to the Exchequer in multiples of the original amounts invested.  Both industries have a large spin-off for the many farmers and services providers who are linked directly and indirectly to the sectors' activities.</p><p>The fund has been used by both the greyhound and horse industries to invest in the local economy.  Funds allocated have been used to put in place infrastructure which allows the sectors to maintain their presence in rural Ireland.  The fund has directly contributed to the improvement of 17 greyhound tracks.</p><p>As regards the horse-breeding industry, the fund was central to founding a centre of excellence which was a key component in establishing Ireland's industry on the international stage.  Ireland is the largest producer of thoroughbred foals in Europe and the fourth largest in the world.  We must not be complacent with this standing, however.  In order to retain and improve this status, we must properly equip the industry and put in place resources to retain stocks and bloodlines.</p><p>The horse-breeding industry has a healthy investment potential, with a small market for that investment compared to other sectors.  It is a market in which investment when lost can be difficult to win back, as competition from other countries is intense.  The allocation is significant so I am pleased that a full review of Bord na gCon and the greyhound industry is under way to ensure that this money is spent efficiently.</p><p>I look forward to the betting (amendment) Bill coming before the House, which will extend betting duty to online and remote operators.  It is only fair that all those operating in the sector should be treated equally in this respect.</p><p>I note from figures provided last week to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, that in 2012 some 1.2 million people attended race meetings, which is approximately the number who attended the GAA hurling and football championships.  This demonstrates the contribution these industries make both to the national Exchequer and the rural economy.  As such, it is only proper that the State should assist in putting in place the infrastructure to support these industries, in growing jobs and maintaining rural pastimes.</p></speech>

I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to this useful debate.  I look forward to the betting (amendment) Bill, which is timely given recent changes in betting practices with people using online betting facilities to avoid tax.  My colleague, Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill, asked whether the tax would be 2% or another rate.  The Department will propose a rate and 2% may well be an appropriate amount.</p><p>While I am not a fan of dogs or horses, I appreciate that this is an important indigenous industry which provides employment.  It is also important culturally in promoting overseas and domestic tourism.  As Senator Comiskey said, as many people attend race meetings as GAA championship matches.</p><p>I hope the betting (amendment) Bill will be before us soon and that there will be no further delays.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill is correct to urge promptness in this respect because this is where the money ought to be coming from.  State investment in this sector is welcome but there has been a shortfall, so we would like to see the industry itself contributing financially.</p><p>Some of the additional money should be used to ensure the continued safety and welfare of racehorses and greyhounds.  I know that subject is very dear to the heart of the Minister, Deputy Coveney.  While we appreciate the value of these industries, we should never lose sight of the animal welfare issues at the core of both of them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-04a.85" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="11:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013120400011#L00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, to the House but I must say that I have misgivings about this item.  The Minister of State said the subsidy was &euro;43 million, while Senator Comiskey estimates that 1.2 million people attend race meetings, which is &euro;36 for everybody who goes to a race meeting.  That is an incredible level of subsidy for a bankrupt country to give to people who attend race meetings.  The estimate for greyhound races is &euro;10 per person.  I would have to question whether the subsidy provides value for money.  It is twice the amount given to human sports, as Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill has said.  I do not rate greyhounds and horses as being remotely more valuable than human athletes.  This has been discussed by an bord snip in some newspaper reports, so the Department should address the issues and not come in with its own research from other people who think the subsidy is wonderful.  There are serious questions to be asked about this.</p><p>I also wish to pose serious questions about why the online betting tax should be earmarked for this sector.  That will add another &euro;10 to the existing &euro;36 subsidy to go to the races, and an extra &euro;2 or &euro;3 to go to a dog track.  I do not think such subsidies are worth it in social terms, particularly in view of the expenditures we already have.  </p><p>A lot of online betting has nothing to do with horses, greyhounds or sport generally.  One can even bet on the abolition of the Seanad and make a load of money.  As the Minister of State knows, the prices were an incorrect prediction of the wisdom eventually generated by the people.  I appreciate all the points that have been made but if the industry is so good - particularly horse racing - it should be putting money into the Exchequer, not seeking this kind of subsidy.  I do have misgivings therefore and I echo what an bord snip said about it.</p><p>It seems to me that racing attendances are in decline and that a lot of race courses around the country are maintained by the taxpayer without much going on for 350 days of the year.  The value for money aspects of so many things have been questioned during this recession.  Carers have been tackled and Christmas social welfare bonuses have been removed.  What on earth did horses do to merit a &euro;36 subsidy for everybody who goes to the races?</p></speech>

Go n-&eacute;ireoidh go geal leis sa jab nua.  Sinn F&eacute;in accepts that a huge number of jobs are created by the greyhound and racehorse industries.  In addition, many of these jobs are in rural areas and make a major contribution to the rural economy, including farm incomes.</p><p>The funds provided in the horse and greyhound racing fund are divided 80% - 20% between horses and greyhounds.  We would like to see a more balanced approach and a more proportional recognition of the benefits arising from the greyhound racing industry.  Bord na gCon has estimated that over 10,000 people are employed directly and indirectly in the industry, and that its value to the economy is over &euro;500 million.</p><p>The horse racing industry is estimated to employ over 20,000 people, between racing and breeding.  It is estimated that 1.2 million people attend race meetings in Ireland annually.  As regards tourism, the following points are often raised by those who support State funding for the industry.  The benefit to the local economy of a race meeting cannot be underestimated, along with the social benefits to an area of race day activity, the hospitality sector, retail sector and local transport companies.  There is a tourism benefit to the development of the horse and greyhound industries, and exports in the thoroughbred sector are significant.</p><p>With regard to the aforementioned points, I want to raise a number of important and relevant issues.  First, horse racing receives significant public funding in Ireland.  In 2011, for example, &euro;57 million was made available from the Exchequer to the horse and greyhound fund established under the 2001 Act.  We accept that horse racing has a social, economic and cultural place in Irish life that can be pointed to in justifying a positive policy stance towards the industry.  It is not self-evident, however, that such a policy stance should extend to the provision of public funding.  If public funding is justified, it does not dictate the level of support that is required nor the means through which it should be provided.</p><p>Second, the primary beneficiary from horse racing is betting, rather than the racing industry.  It is therefore imperative that the Government address the issue of excise on betting and particularly as it relates to off-course betting.  If we get this right, it could save the Exchequer a minimum of &euro;57 million per annum, remove the funding of horse racing and greyhound racing from the central Exchequer, and protect jobs in the Irish betting industry, as well as the horse and greyhound industries.</p><p>Ireland currently has one of the lowest betting tax rates in the world.  This is not acceptable and needs to be addressed urgently.  In the UK, the betting industry pays an effective tax rate of 3% of turnover, which is three times higher than Ireland.  In France, legislation provides for taxation of 15% of turnover, some 15 times higher than Ireland, of which they return 8% to the French equine industry.</p><p>As it stands, State funding for horse racing in Ireland now goes beyond the role of securing a benefit from gambling for the industry, as it includes a subvention from general taxation.</p> <p>In the context of wider sports policy, other claims on State funding could equally be made.  For example, in connection with the facilities deficit that exists for children's sport.  At a minimum, future policy needs to assess carefully the public benefit that is served by State support for horse racing and the priority it should be accorded in expenditure decisions.  </p><p>Two other more general issues need to be considered.  First, public policy needs to take greater account of the role of horse racing in fostering and promoting gambling and in the possible social costs that may arise as a result.  Second, in many countries taxation on gambling is a significant part of the revenue base.  Gambling in Ireland makes little contribution in this context.  </p><p>In a general sense, Sinn F&eacute;in supports the measures being brought forward.  The thoroughbred industry recently commented on EirGrid's decision to locate pylons close to areas where thoroughbred horses are being bred.  This is a big issue from a health perspective for humans and animals.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on that.</p></speech>

We all acknowledge the importance of the horse racing and greyhound industry to this country.  As stated by the Minister, there are 24,000 people employed in the industry, which in economic terms generates &euro;1.6 billion.  This is very significant.  I agree with Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill and others that the Betting (Amendment) Bill is long overdue.  I understand the UK Government proposes to introduce a tax on online betting in its next budget.  Perhaps this is the reason for the delay in the introduction of the Betting (Amendment) Bill here.  However, I am not sure this is the case.</p><p>On whether a proposed tax on online betting should be set at 1% or 2%, I, too, would favour a 2% tax.  The vast majority of gambling now takes place online, as a result of which independent bookmakers are suffering.  There is currently no licensing requirement in respect of online betting.  This issue must be addressed in the Betting (Amendment) Bill.  In my view moneys accruing from a 2% tax on online betting should be earmarked for the horse and greyhound industry.  However, if, say, &euro;90 million is the amount yielded from this tax I believe it should be divided between the horse and greyhound industry and other sports.  As pointed out, the vast majority of betting is taking place online in people's homes.  People are betting on everything from a needle to a haystack.  </p><p>I agree with the comments made in regard to the need for greater transparency in the greyhound industry.  I would like to again raise an issue I have raised previously in the House.  I am no killjoy where betting is concerned.  I enjoy a bet myself.  However, there is an anomaly in this area in that a person wishing to purchase a national lottery ticket or place a bet in a bookmakers or with a bookmaker on course must be over 18 years yet children in communion dresses and younger are placing bets on tote.  I have drawn the attention of the Minister to this anomaly in the law.  I hope we will soon see action on it.  As I said earlier, I am no killjoy.  I bet on the tote myself when a child.  However, I believe there are many problems arising from the accessibility of gambling to children under 18 years of age.  I have been visited at my clinic by many people who because of this became addicted to gambling.  I am not suggesting that everybody who as a child bets on the tote becomes a gambling addict.  That is not the case.  However, a particular amount of them do.  I hope this matter will soon be addressed.  We cannot have anomalies like this in the system.  What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.</p></speech>

For once, I am in disagreement with my colleague Senator Barrett in that the record will clearly show that every punt, euro, shilling or cent invested in the Irish horse racing industry has benefited the taxpayer and the economy in general tenfold.  We are speaking not about a sport but about one of our greatest natural industries and resources.  Any support which we can give to it should be provided.</p><p>We all look forward to the introduction of the Betting (Amendment) Bill, which will address issues such as how moneys should be allocated.  I look forward to participating in the debate on that Bill.  While as I said earlier I welcome this proposal I ask the Minister of State to reflect on a central problem in this area which has been mentioned in all of the reports and recommendations referred to but with which we have failed to come to grips, namely, the continuing decline in attendance at race meetings.  This is a substantial problem.  The demographic profile of racegoers is, to put it mildly, becoming more mature.  We need to put in place measures and supports to encourage more people to attend horse and greyhound racing.  The greyhound industry may be more successful in this regard in that it is easier to sell food and so on at greyhound races.  The horse racing industry must be supported but must also lead in the efforts to encourage more people to the tracks.  </p><p>Senator Barrett referred to the under-utilisation of racecourses in terms of their being only used ten or 15 times a year.  We need a plan to encourage people to return to race meetings.  While watching horse racing on Sky Sports and the racing channel is very effective we also need punters at the tracks.  We do not want to end up like Australia and America where racing is all television and tote based.  I hope that the Minister of State will instigate initiatives to encourage greater attendance at our racecourses.</p></speech>

I thank all Senators who have spoken for their contributions.</p><p>An issue raised by all Senators was the delay in the introduction of the Betting (Amendment) Bill.  I agree with the comments in that regard.  However, the Bill is delayed at European Commission level.  I will write again to the Minister for Finance requesting that it be brought before the Houses immediately.  I will leave no stone unturned in ensuring this happens.</p><p>The Gambling Control Bill is being drafted.  Discussions in this regard, including on the tote issue, are ongoing.

Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill, like many other Senators, acknowledged the economic value of the horse and greyhound industry.  I do not agree with Senator Barrett's comments.  The economic benefit of the horse and greyhound industry is huge.  The Senator should perhaps visit the courses in Dublin to see what is happening and the number of jobs being created in this area.  In south Tipperary, which is the constituency I represent, there are people in every town and parish who own a small number of horses.  As I said in my earlier contribution, more than 80% of our horses are produced by farmers who own only two horses.  It is a small operator's game.</p><p>There are many people in employment on the fringes of this industry, including veterinarians, meal suppliers, hay and straw suppliers.  I see first-hand every day of the week the commitment of the people working in the horse racing industry.</p> <p>Moreover, I see how painstakingly slow it is to produce a winner, a good horse or foal or whatever.  These are highly committed people and these are real jobs.  They work seven days a week, 365 days a year and to them, Christmas Day or New Year's Day are no different to any other day.  These people are dedicated and committed to their job and realistically, while one refers to it as a sport, it is an industry.  Were one to take Coolmore and the other big players out of south Tipperary, it would mean the departure of a huge employer from my constituency and there would be placards outside-----</p></speech>

One should consider the success Aidan O'Brien has brought, as did Vincent O'Brien before him, as well as Tommy Wade with Dundrum.  The list is endless in respect of horse racing, jumping and the industry as a whole.  Someone made reference to the greyhound industry and Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill in particular spoke of the difficulties therein.  While the chairman of Bord na gCon, Phil Meaney and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, had discussed it, one of my first actions on taking this job was to investigate what was going on in the industry.  I have put in place a structure whereby within the next few months, a report will be handed to me.  I have sought a nuts and bolts, bare report and wish to be told upfront in order to ascertain how the industry can progress.  Last Saturday night, I attended the night of stars in Shelbourne Park and the place was packed.  I revert to Senator Bradford's point about the reason Bord na gCon is really successful in attracting people of all ages.  People were on a social night out and there were traffic jams at 7 p.m. because people were trying to get into that part of Dublin.  This really is an industry about which there is much good.  Obviously, there have been difficulties in the past and the board is being criticised day in and day out but contrary to Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill's suggestion, the borrowings are &euro;24 million, not &euro;30 million.  They are a lot lower than the Senator stated and the facts are a little bit different.  Moreover, these accounts have been signed off by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Bord na gCon and its future will be considered next March or April and a road forward will be charted.  It involves a lot of small operators in rural areas who, like in the horse industry work out of small farms to produce dogs and pups, which they can export to England.  They are really successful and are no different to the horse racing industry.</p><p>  Both industries go hand in hand and that is the reason I feel vindicated and proud to stand before Members to state the Government is supporting this industry.  There is a sporting aspect involved in it and I realise it has support but the other aspect concerns its economic value to rural areas at a time when rural Ireland is under a lot of pressure.  Many industries are leaving, there is a scarcity of jobs and people are leaving rural areas for England, America and Australia but yet, jobs can be created in the horse and greyhound racing industry.  I invite Senator Barrett to visit a place like County Tipperary and to attend a race meeting.  I will introduce him to some of those involved in the industry and everyone could learn from it.  After spending a day in County Tipperary or somewhere similar, as Senator Bradford might take him to Cork or Senator Cummins might take him County Waterford - it could be any part of the country -  he would return and state these are real jobs with people committed to an industry.  It certainly is worth supporting.</p><p>  As for other issues, Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh asked about pylons and it would be remiss of me not to address that issue.  Representatives of the industry have been speaking with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, in this regard.  A meeting was held within the past week and another meeting has been scheduled for this purpose.  The industry representatives have made a genuine case regarding the effect the pylons would have on thoroughbred horse breeding and on horses as they train in the fields.  This issue is being investigated as part of the consultations.  While it is not the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, if it has an impact on the Department, we certainly will make a submission to the relevant Minister and to EirGrid.  However, I suggest that people should talk to EirGrid.  A few weeks ago, I took a group of people from south Tipperary to meet representatives of EirGrid and a useful discussion ensued on the manner in which the company is doing its business.  As Members might be aware, there is a proposal for a project to go through Munster in particular that is creating a lot of controversy as there is a lot of racing and many racehorses in that province. On foot of the aforementioned consultation, the Government will take everything into account.  Anything that affects the racehorse industry must be considered and I urge EirGrid to do so.  I believe I have dealt with the decline in attendances and in response to Senator Bradford, I take the point that many older people attend race meetings.  However, while I would love to be at a race meeting in Clonmel or Thurles tomorrow evening, I cannot go because I am here.  In other words, people are tied up and cannot go as they obviously are working, whereas pensioners can go to race meetings.  Certainly, there is an opening for racetracks to engage in the promotion of events in the various racetracks nationwide such as the charity events operated by Bord na gCon.  I acknowledge there is a genuine need for such promotion.  Overall, however, the industry is not strictly a sport but is an industry that makes a valuable contribution to rural Ireland and I certainly believe it should be supported.  I am in the Chamber this afternoon to seek Members' support.</p></speech>

T&aacute; s&eacute; ag teacht.  T&aacute; s&eacute; an-t&aacute;bhachtach go mbeidh d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht oscailte againn agus go mbeidh seans ag gach &eacute;inne a gcuid tuairim&iacute; a nochtadh.</p><p>  This Bill is the second legislative milestone in the Government's strategy for the reform of water services provision in Ireland.  The Water Services Act 2013 provided for the establishment of Uisce &Eacute;ireann as a subsidiary of Bord G&aacute;is.</p> <p>This legislation represents fulfilment of our programme for Government commitments to introduce a fair funding model to deliver clean and reliable water; to establish a new State-owned utility to take responsibility for water infrastructure; and to advance our commitment to implement a charging system based on usage above a free allowance and a programme of water metering of all households, a programme that has seen approximately 50,000 households metered and that will reduce leakage and demand, cutting production by at least 15%.</p><p>The challenges facing Ireland's water sector are not unique.  Water demand is rising, supply becoming less secure.  Our water bodies need greater protection.  By 2030, the world is expected to need 40% more water than will be available.  We are distinct from most countries by the level of fresh water available, yet we must turn this benefit to our advantage by creating a world class water sector that can and will attract water intensive industries such as ICT and pharma-chem to Ireland as water stress becomes common elsewhere.  In the competitive market for inward investment, we would be well placed as one of the top countries, not only in Europe but in the world, for investment where high water intensive industries are being established.  By 2030, our river basin management plans will have been reviewed a further three times and the quality of our water bodies will have to have improved.  Environmental and economic regulation of water services must be inter-linked.  This Bill plans for the future.</p><p>I have read the excellent and well-compiled summary of the Bill by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service.  It makes the point that the anticipated increase in our population of 1.5 million by 2030 will have to be planned for and the water supplies will have to be in the right places to meet those demands.</p><p>The delivery of water services and new infrastructure through Uisce &Eacute;ireann, working with the local authorities, which have provided water and wastewater services, will involve a new partnership.  It will be a partnership combining the local authorities' expertise in operations with the considerable network and utility management experience within Uisce &Eacute;ireann through the service level agreements for which this Bill provides.  The establishment of a new and sustainable funding model will help to secure the level of investment required to upgrade, repair and expand our public water and wastewater infrastructure.  Increased investment, as well as securing supply and protecting our water bodies, will provide thousands of additional jobs, adding to the 1,600 jobs sustained through the domestic metering programme and approximately 400 jobs at the call centre when it is up and running to full capacity.</p><p>The domestic charges element to the sector's new funding model will be based on fairness.  The OECD has stated that metered charges are the fairest form of water charges.  The Government agrees.  Work is being progressed on the approach to the proposed free allowance and affordability measures which will be introduced by Government to ameliorate the impact of water charges on domestic customers. There will be clarity for the public on these issues well in advance of the commencement of charges and people will have an opportunity to contribute through public consultations to be undertaken by the Commission for Energy Regulator next year.</p><p>Independent economic regulation of water services is essential if we are to ensure water customers are protected and the new utility delivers value for money.  I am confident the Commission for Energy Regulation will protect the interests of domestic and non-domestic customers.  Its scrutiny of Uisce &Eacute;ireann's budgets and capital plans and determination of water tariffs will be performed with a view to ensuring services are cost-effective and efficiently delivered.  The Environmental Protection Agency's environmental regulation of Uisce &Eacute;ireann will mark continuity with its existing role in monitoring water quality.</p><p>The impact of the reforms on the local authority sector and in particular on local authority employees is an important issue for everybody, not least those who work in the sector.  It is a very important issue for public representatives on both sides of the House.  Given the scale and complexity of the changes involved, engagement with staff and their trade unions has been critical, and the Irish Water Consultative Group, which was put in place to facilitate this interaction, has played a vital role in moving the reform process forward and in helping to shape key aspects of this Bill.</p><p>Uisce Eireann and each local authority will be entering into a service level agreement to provide for the delivery of water services.  The initial agreement will be of 12 years duration, and once the first agreement comes to a conclusion, the option of entering into subsequent agreements is provided for.  Where it is decided not to enter into a subsequent agreement, the Bill provides for the transfer of staff involved in the delivery of the service level agreement from the local authority to Uisce &Eacute;ireann.</p><p>I wish to address some matters which are not provided for as yet in this Bill but which may be introduced as amendments on Committee Stage.  The Department is working with the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform and with the Office of the Attorney General on the optimal approach to targeting financial support for the much-needed capital investment, and while the Bill provides that the Minister can make grants to Uisce &Eacute;ireann, consideration is being given to alternative approaches and an amendment may be required.  The Departments and the Office of the Attorney General are also scrutinising the sections of the Bill relating to staffing and superannuation to ensure the interests of staff transferring to Uisce &Eacute;ireann are adequately protected.  If any issues are identified arising from this scrutiny, amendments will be brought forward on Committee Stage.  A small number of technical amendments may also be required in Parts 1, 3 and 4 to address drafting issues.</p><p>The Department is also considering the requirement for further primary legislation to complete the water services reform programme.  In particular it is examining how Irish Water will interact with the local authorities in their role as planning authorities, it is considering how the relationship between the Environmental Protection Agency and Uisce &Eacute;ireann will develop, and it will be monitoring closely how the new economic regulatory system for water services evolves.  If further legislation is required to address any of these matters, proposals will be brought forward for consideration by the Government.</p><p>I will outline the purpose and operation of each section of the Bill.  Sections 1 and 2 set out the Title of the Bill, its commencement provisions and the definitions of terms used in the Bill.  Section 3 is a standard provision enabling the expenses incurred by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government for the administration of this legislation to be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</p><p>Section 4 provides for the repeal of certain sections of the Water Services Acts 2007 and 2013 arising from the transfer of functions to Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  It also provides for the repeal of the Local Government (Delimitation of Water Supply Disconnection Powers) Act 1995.  The repeal of this Act, together with the provision in Section 15(8) of the Bill, will ensure households cannot have their water supply disconnected.  This an important feature of the legislation.  We must be very clear that there has to be due process.  If people do not pay, there will have to be clear protocols in place to ensure that at the end of the process, people pay for what they use.  A jurisdiction in England had people who cannot pay and people who will not pay and it treated customers differently.  If a person had what was called &quot;a water property&quot;, that was dealt with in a particular way.  If one could pay but did not, there was a civil bill system which worked extremely well.  At the end of that stage, if further protocols are needed they will have to be put in place.  That is a matter for us all to debate and agree on, if we can.  The process must be clear, transparent and fair.</p><p>Section 5 defines the terms used in Part 2.  Section 6 provides that the transfer day may be appointed by order by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Section 7 provides for the transfer of functions conferred by the Water Services Act 2007 to Uisce &Eacute;ireann on the transfer day provided for in section 6.  It also provides that water services functions in Part 4A of the Water Services Act 2007 and Part 6 of the same Act, which relate to rural water services, will not transfer to Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  That is an important assurance that group water schemes will remain in the group water sector.  Septic tanks and other domestic treatments are not part of the Uisce &Eacute;ireann focus.</p><p>Section 8 provides Uisce &Eacute;ireann with the power to charge non-domestic customers with effect from the transfer day on the same basis as the local authorities had charged those non-domestic customers prior to the transfer day.  This section will only have effect up to the date of the commencement of section 16 which requires Uisce &Eacute;ireann to charge customers in accordance with the water charges plan, which will be subject to the approval of the Commission for Energy Regulation.  The section effectively provides for the roll-over of the non-domestic water charges currently levied by the local authorities until such time as the commission approves Uisce &Eacute;ireann's charges next year.  The commission will consult publicly on the approach to non-domestic tariffs.</p><p>Section 9 provides that the provisions of section 29 of the Water Services Act 2007 shall apply to Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  It confers immunity to Uisce &Eacute;ireann and its employees from prosecutions arising from carrying out their functions under the Bill.</p><p>Section 10 provides that the local authorities will continue to have powers, which transfer to Uisce &Eacute;ireann under section 7, which are necessary for the performance of local authority functions under the 2007 Act.  These functions relate to septic tanks and rural water services.</p> <p> Section 11 provides that actions of a water services authority which commenced before the transfer day but not completed may be carried on and completed by Irish Water, where this action relates to a function transferred under section 7.  This would include matters such as planning applications or an Environmental Impact Assessment.</p><p>Section 12 provides for the transfer of the property of the water services authorities to Irish Water on a designated property vesting day or vesting days, in other words, they will not all transfer on the same day.  The power to transfer is contained in the Bill.  The transfers will be facilitated through ministerial orders under this section.  Property will include assets such as land, buildings, water services infrastructure, vehicles, pipes, sewers and moneys.  A provision is included for the Minister to request any information required from a local authority to enable him decide upon the making of a transfer order.  I am aware that Senator Brennan raised an issue with Louth County Council about community facilities attached to a water services facility, such as sports fields or playgrounds.  I understand that if there are social activities on properties that will be respected.  A Fianna F&aacute;il Member of the Oireachtas raised the question of the use of water by Tidy Towns committees.  We will seek clarity on these issues.</p><p>Section 13 provides for the transfer of rights and certain liabilities, associated with the property transferred from the water services authorities to Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  Examples of the type of rights and liabilities referred to would be leases, licences and wayleaves.  Senator Landy raised that point during the discussion on the earlier Bill.</p><p>Section 14 provides for the transfer of other liabilities of a water services authority, namely, those not provided for under section 13, to transfer from the water services authorities to Uisce &Eacute;ireann .  Liabilities transferred under this section shall be designated in a ministerial order.</p><p>Section 15 provides for the transfer of staff from local authorities to Irish Water.  Such transfers would take place following consultations between each individual local authority and Irish Water.  The intention is that this section will only apply to local authority staff involved in the delivery of water services as part of an agreement made between the local authority and Irish Water under section 24, and would only be applied following the termination of such an agreement, that is, after the first 12-year period.  There is also a period of consultation.  The people concerned must be notified six months in advance and the Bill provides for representations to be made and for discussions to take place with the appropriate personnel.</p><p>Section 16 provides that Uisce &Eacute;ireann shall charge each customer in receipt of water services.  The charges to be levied under this section shall be calculated in accordance with a water charges plan which will be published.  Uisce &Eacute;ireann will be prohibited from cutting off a water supply to a dwelling arising from non-payment of water charges.  Irish Water will be empowered to disconnect a non-domestic user where water charges remain unpaid and will also have the power to reduce the supply of water to all customers where charges remain unpaid.  The power to disconnect a customer from a water supply or to reduce a water supply to a customer will be subject to the approval of the water charges plan under section 17.  The section provides that charges will not apply for water supplied to a fire authority for the performance of its functions.  It also provides that for the purpose of charging, the owner of a premises will be presumed to be the occupier of that premises unless it is proved to the contrary.  I am sure that Irish Water will be reasonable and fair if a business is in difficulties.  Irish Water must get the money, but the local authorities use discretion.</p><p>Section 17 provides that Uisce &Eacute;ireann is to prepare a water charges plan setting out the manner and method for the water charges to be applied under section 16.  This water charges plan must be submitted to the Commission for Energy Regulator by Uisce &Eacute;ireann and the commission will have the power to approve or reject the water charges plan.  The water charges plan will contain the charges to apply where the charges are based on the quantity of water as measured by a meter or where the charges are assessed based on a formula to be set out in the plan.  The plan must specify the charges to apply to different classes of customers and the different methods of payments for customers.  Uisce &Eacute;ireann will, in common with other utility service providers, put in a place a wide range of payment methods and options to facilitate its customers.  I think it is very important to have that level of engagement, and have the capacity to meet the needs of consumers.  The section provides that water charges will apply to water supplied to a premises and waste water discharged from a premises.  The section specifies that unless agreed otherwise between Uisce &Eacute;ireann and a customer, the amount of waste-water discharged from a premises will be deemed to be equal to the amount of water supplied to the premises.  An example of the type of households that would need to differentiate would be those that are in receipt of a water supply from Irish Water but are discharging wastewater to their own septic tanks or similar systems.</p><p>Section 18 is a standard provision to define terms used in Part 4 of the Bill.  Section 19 provides that Uisce &Eacute;ireann shall take the necessary steps to amend its memorandum and articles of association to ensure that they are consistent with this Bill.  The Water Services Act 2013 set out conditions in relation to the memorandum and articles of association of Irish Water and provided that they must be approved by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, with the consent of the relevant Ministers.  The 2013 Act and this Bill provide that any alterations to the memorandum and articles of association require prior ministerial approval and consent.</p><p>Section 20 provides that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government may issue a direction to Uisce &Eacute;ireann, requiring it to comply with Government policy or policies as specified in the direction.  Directions shall only be issued by the Minister after first consulting with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</p><p>Section 21 is a standard provision providing for the recruitment of staff by Irish Water, on terms and conditions to be determined by Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  It provides that Uisce &Eacute;ireann shall have regard to Government policy in relation to the remuneration and conditions of employment of its staff.  In light of the current controversy in the health institutions, that is an important point.</p><p>Section 22 provides that Uisce &Eacute;ireann shall prepare a scheme or schemes for the granting of superannuation benefits to staff recruited by Irish Water from a local authority.  I stated earlier that the Department and the Office of the Attorney General are examining this section to ensure that the interests of staff transferring to Irish Water are adequately protected.</p><p>Section 23 provides that the Minister may make payments to Uisce &Eacute;ireann in relation to the superannuation costs of members of staff of a local authority accepted into the employment of Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  This funding will cover the financial liability in relation to the service of such staff with local authorities, ensuring that it does not fall to local authorities, given that the functions and assets have transferred to Uisce &Eacute;ireann and does not fall to Uisce &Eacute;ireann to fund, which would restrict its capacity to fund necessary investment in infrastructure.</p><p>Section 24 provides that Uisce &Eacute;ireann may enter into service level agreements with the local authorities in order that a local authority can provide services on behalf of Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  The Minister is given the power to direct Uisce &Eacute;ireann and the local authority to enter into such an agreement and to specify the functions to be included in an agreement in relation to such a direction.  An agreement under this section may include provision for the standards to be met by a local authority in the delivery of services on behalf of Uisce &Eacute;ireann and the provision of payment by Uisce &Eacute;ireann to a local authority for these services.</p><p>The initial agreement between Uisce &Eacute;ireann and a local authority will be subject to reviews after two years and seven years, respectively.  It is intended that the initial agreement will be of 12 years duration unless there is significant failure on the part of the local authority to provide the services under the agreement.</p><p>Section 25 provides for the preparation of codes of practice by Uisce &Eacute;ireann which will be subject to the approval of the Commission for Energy Regulation.  The codes of practice shall make provision for customer service standards, billing, methods of payment of water charges, the provision of information to customers of Uisce &Eacute;ireann and any other matters deemed necessary by the commission.  I have looked at websites of water supply companies in the United Kingdom, in particular Anglian Water.  They help to get the message out to consumer on how they can reduce their water usage.  Hints and aids to reduce water consumption is a key issue.  Tools such as social media are very important for engaging with people.  There must be proper engagement, not just through the traditional way of engaging, but through websites and social media so that people get the message and best possible information on how to reduce their bills.</p><p>Section 26 provides that Uisce &Eacute;ireann shall, on or before a date to be directed by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, prepare a water services strategic plan which it must submit to the Minister for his approval.  The water services strategic plan will set out the objectives of Uisce &Eacute;ireann in respect of the 25-year period following the approval of the plan and the means by which it proposes to achieve those objectives, including in relation to the following: drinking water quality; prevention of risk to public health and the environment; existing and projected demand for water services; and conservation measures.</p> <p>In preparing a water services strategic plan, Uisce &Eacute;ireann will have to ensure, as far as practicable, that the plan is consistent with the national spatial strategy, regional planning guidelines and river basin management plans.  The water services strategic plans must also have regard to a range of other policy considerations including proper planning and sustainable development, housing strategies, strategic development zones and water quality plans.</p><p> The section provides that the strategic plans should be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and published on the Internet.  It also requires that the implementation and operation of the plan be kept under review at least every five years.</p><p> Section 27 provides that Uisce &Eacute;ireann shall prepare investment plans setting out where it considers investment in infrastructure is necessary for the effective performance of its functions.  In developing the investment plans, Irish Water shall take account of the water services strategic plan prepared under section 26 and a range of other policy considerations including local area plans, regional planning guidelines and strategic development zones.  Before preparing an investment plan, Uisce &Eacute;ireann will be required to consult with the Environmental Protection Agency, regional bodies in respect of whose functional area the investment plan is likely to apply and each planning authority in respect of whose functional area the investment plan is likely to apply.  Copies of the investment plan must be submitted by Uisce &Eacute;ireann to the regional and planning authorities.  The first investment plan shall be prepared for the two-year period after the transfer date.  Future investment plans shall be for durations to be determined by the Commission for Energy Regulation.</p><p> Section 28 provides that Uisce &Eacute;ireann may borrow money for the purposes of the Act.  Such borrowings are subject to the consent of the Minister of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The aggregate of moneys borrowed under the section is limited at &euro;2 billion.  The existing borrowing limit for Irish Water is &euro;500 million which was set in the Water Services Act 2013 that conferred responsibility on Uisce &Eacute;ireann to undertake the domestic metering programme.<br />NewERA has advised the Government on the funding requirements for Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  It recommended that the revised limit is appropriate having regard to level of loans and liabilities that will be transferred from the local authorities to Uisce &Eacute;ireann, the loan arrangement between Irish Water and the National Pensions Reserve Fund in respect of the domestic metering programme and NewERA's projections of other capital investment requirements that Uisce &Eacute;ireann will have to provide for over the next few years.</p><p> Section 29 provides that the Minister of the Environment, Community and Local Government may, for the purposes of the Act, make grants to Irish Water or to the Commission for Energy Regulation.  In determining the provision of any grant under the section, the Minister shall take into account the capital investment plan provided to him under section 27.</p><p> Section 30 provides that the CER shall, in the first instance, perform its functions in a manner that best serves the interests of the customers.  The commission will be required to have regard to the need for Uisce &Eacute;ireann to be able to finance its activities, to ensure the continuity, safety and sustainability of water services and to ensure that costs are recovered from the users of water services in accordance with the EU Water Framework Directive.</p><p> Section 31 provides that the CER shall advise the Minister on the development and delivery of water services.  Section 32 provides for the preparation of strategy statements by the commission and the submission of revised strategy statements to the Minister every three years.</p><p> Section 33 provides that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government may issue a policy direction to the Commission for Energy Regulation.  This is based on a similar provision in the Gas Regulation Act 1999.   Before the Minister issues any direction, a draft of the proposed direction must be given to the commission and the Oireachtas joint committee.  A direction issued under the section shall also be published by the Minister in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>.</p><p> Section 34 provides that the commission may request information from Uisce &Eacute;ireann that it requires to perform its functions under the Act and that Uisce &Eacute;ireann must comply with any such request.  It also provides that the commission enter into an arrangement with the Environmental Protection Agency for the purposes of administrative co-operation.</p><p> Section 35 provides for amendments to the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 arising from the assignment of water services functions to the CER.  Sections 36 and 37 provide for amendments to the Water Services Act 2007 and the Water Services Act 2013, respectively.  Section 38 provides that Irish Water is required to prepare an annual report on the performance of its functions in the 2013 Act and this Bill.  The annual report is required to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.<br /><b></b>Last year the OECD published its report on water reform.  It stated that sustainable funding, effective governance and coherence between water and sectoral policies are the building blocks of successful reform for getting the basics of water policy right.  With the Bill we are putting building blocks in place and introducing a funding model to secure the investment required for security of reliable water supply.  We are creating the governance structures that will enable partnership, efficiency, as well as customer and environmental protection.  By bringing greater co-ordination between water policies and other policies across local, regional and national levels we can plan for a more sustainable future.</p><p> There are few things more fundamental to any society or economy than water.  T&aacute;imid ag d&eacute;anamh &aacute;r nd&iacute;cheall sa Bhille seo i dtreo is go mbeidh go leor uisce &aacute; shol&aacute;thar do theaghlaigh, do chomhlachta&iacute; agus do fheirmeoir&iacute; na t&iacute;re seo, go dtiocfaidh an t-uisce sin chucu chomh luath agus chomh maith agus is f&eacute;idir, go mbeidh an tseirbh&iacute;s nua f&eacute;ar&aacute;ilte do gach duine agus go mbeidh an c&oacute;ras measartha &oacute; thaobh c&uacute;rsa&iacute; sl&aacute;inte phoibl&iacute; agus an timpeallacht.</p><p> I look forward to the debate.  I am happy to consider all issues that are raised here and to have an open debate.  At Committee Stage we will have an open and full discussion on all issues of concern to everybody.  I look forward to the contributions that will be made by the Senators. Go raibh maith agat.  </p></speech>

Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it go dt&iacute; an Teach seo.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; mar Bhall den Teach seo uair amh&aacute;in.  Ag an am sin, ba mhinic go nd&eacute;anfaimid d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht le ch&eacute;ile.  Nuair a bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag caint leis an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Domhnaill, d&uacute;irt m&eacute; go mbeadh s&eacute; n&iacute;os oiri&uacute;na&iacute; ainm an Bhille a leas&uacute; go dt&iacute; "An Bille um Uisce Beatha 2013".  I say that because whiskey is obviously known as "uisce beatha" which means the water of life.  I have always felt that water is an invaluable and essential resource and it is for that reason I remember the following.  In 1983 Dick Spring was the leader of the Labour Party and he introduced water charges.  Even though my party held the majority on my local town council we decided to implement the water charges which cost &pound;40 in Irish pounds a year.  The decision was not terribly popular but my local council felt that it was the right thing to do.  Interestingly, a subsequent Labour Minister removed the water charges in a state of panic when Joe Higgins threatened to take the seat from Joan Burton.  Subsequently she lost her seat and water charges were removed.</p><p>I am not in favour of everything that is proposed in the Bill.  The Minister of State laid emphasis on the Commission for Energy Regulation but I shall return to the matter later and shall deal with the Bord G&aacute;is aspect at the same time.</p><p>The Bill will set up an expensive quango.  As we have seen with a range of semi-State companies and State services, they are laden with quite a high level of inefficiency, cost ineffectiveness, very high salaries and an excessive amount of staff.  That is a feature of public services everywhere and is definitely a feature in Ireland.  Bord G&aacute;is is a reasonably good example because it has many examples of same.  The same applies to the ESB, as members will know, and other organisations.  That worries me.  The Minister wants to introduce the legislation at a time when people are hard pressed.  This Government, in particular, has ladened them down with a significant array of costs.  The new charge is on top of the local property tax and great hikes in energy prices.  </p><p>I shall turn now to the Commission for Energy Regulation.  I am not a fan of regulation in this country because it has failed us badly.  When I was a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and National Resources I initiated a request where we sought a list of the salaries paid to the top executives in all of the semi-State companies that reported to us, including the regulatory authorities that reported to the committee.  The information was provided.</p> <p>For its own reasons, the committee decided it would be done without publicity, so we dealt with it in committee which I did not think was the best way to deal with it.  This was well in advance of a lot of what emerged subsequently, where many of the organisations were brought into disrepute because of the levels of pay and so on.  I hope it highlighted for my colleagues on the committee that transparency is an essential part of dealing with this issue and these types of issues.</p><p> I have been very underwhelmed by the approach of the Commission for Energy Regulation.  The reason for the escalating price of energy over the years would have been perceived by some - I am not sure it is correct - that because many of these people came from some of these organisations or had backgrounds in them or came from the Department which dealt with these organisations, the interest of the consumer was definitely not prioritised.</p><p> I refer to the provision of this essential resource without the necessary breaks and balances we have within the local government system.  If one were to roll out water charges as in the past, the elected members would play a significant role in ensuring the levy of the charges was reasonable and would have an obligation, which was often discharged, to tackle the cost inefficiencies within the system.  This worries me and I would not have any confidence in the Commission for Energy Regulation doing that.  I have never seen an example, although perhaps the Minister of State can give me one, where it was shown that the interest of the consumer was prioritised over the interest of the supplier.  I have never seen an example of that and I do not think it will happen in this case.</p><p> I am concerned because there has been a dearth of investment within the service, which I accept.  I presume this will be tackled and that is part of the reason we will borrow.  I can see in that scenario that the Commission for Energy Regulation will probably argue it needs to build up reserves to be able to take on these significant investments.  I can see the interests of the consumer being sidelined.</p><p> Bord G&aacute;is was mentioned and I know people who worked in it.  It has a very good reputation but when one scratches underneath the surface, it certainly does not come out smelling of roses as a tightly disciplined cost-effective corporate entity.</p><p> We should have certain criteria to underpin what we are doing.  One should be that it is cost efficient.  We are stripping away the functions from democratically elected members of local authorities and providing this quango, which I understand will have up to 500 employees with another 400 in call centres.  Abtran will be involved.  We have seen examples of large consultancy firms being involved.</p><p> I cannot understand why the company will not be open to freedom of information from day one because many of these consultancy costs need to be put under the microscope.  If we are learning anything from what is coming out of the HSE and other public bodies, surely it must be that we need to get a grip on these before they become issues and problems.  Due to the failure of our State apparatus to control these overhead costs and excessive salaries, what we will end up with in a few years is a huge pressure building up from other workers in these organisations, who do not occupy these privileged positions, for huge increases.  As a State, we have been moving back in a better direction of being competitive, but we are still far short of meeting the competitive benchmarks we need to meet, which are western European countries.  Salaries across these companies, the public service and these Houses should all be benchmarked with what is happening in western Europe - in Germany, the Benelux countries, France, Spain, Britain and Scandinavia.  If we do not want to be back into a situation where we are struggling economically, we must pitch our tent in that particular arena.</p><p> Hard-pressed consumers are not just faced with what I said about the property tax but with huge increases in health insurance, which we raised in this House, specifically because of a change in Government policy.  I understand between &euro;100 and &euro;400 per year will be added and nobody will ensure it is towards the lower end rather than the higher end.  There will not even be freedom of information to expose it.</p><p> I refer to the audit of this network and tackling the waste within the system.  And a lot of water is wasted.  I do not know if any consideration has been given to a more efficient structure.  I know it will probably involve a lot of capital costs but we treat water, which is expensive to process, and flush it down the toilet or use it for washing rather than human consumption.  I do not know if there is scope in that area.  I would like to see some vision emerge and some brakes put on this.</p><p> I have set out the position.  Our party is opposing the Bill for some of the reasons I mentioned.  We are not alone in opposing this Bill.  The Labour Party's election manifesto stated it did not favour water charges.  On 18 February 2011, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, said the Labour Party did not favour water charges.  On 28 June 2010, the leader of Labour Party, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore, stated in the<i>Irish Examiner</i>, with which I am sure Senator Clune is familiar, that he was against water charges, that water was a necessity, that he always believed essential services like water should be delivered as a public service, that a flat household charge would be unfair as it would not discriminate between houses with five bathrooms or no bathroom, and that metering was unworkable.  That comment was made by the T&aacute;naiste three years ago.  I look forward to hearing the answers from the Minister of State and from those in the Labour Party.</p></speech>

This is the second Bill this year and this one provides for the transfer of water services which are currently the responsibility of the 34 local authorities.</p><p>I welcome the Bill and have always been supportive of the establishment of an organisation like Irish Water which is important for many reasons.  It is most important we have efficiencies, we do not have gaps in the services and we have oversight of our water supply and water treatment.  The issue of water charges was mentioned by Senator Walsh.  Water charges were required to be introduced following the agreement with the troika, so I am surprised Fianna F&aacute;il opposes the Bill on that basis.  There seems to be collective amnesia in some quarters.  Having said that, I have always agreed with water charges.</p><p>The need for an establishment like Uisce &Eacute;ireann was brought home to me in November 2009.  When I was preparing my notes for today, I thought about November 2009 when Cork had severe disruption to water supplies.  Following flooding of the water treatment plant in Cork, there was no water available in the city, although there was in the county council area.  Cork city is a small area but there was no connection between the two areas.  It highlighted the fact we do not have a system which crosses municipal boundaries.  Also at that time, during severe cold weather, a number housing estates were without water, in particular those built relatively recently, because the pipes were not at a sufficient depth below the surface and were subject to freezing.</p> <p>This happened in an era when we know well that pipes need to be below a certain level - I think it is a metre to the underside - to be out of the freezing zone.  That was allowed to happen.  I know it is another story but it is one that Irish Water or Uisce &Eacute;ireann will have to consider and resolve over the next few years.  Uisce &Eacute;ireann is being established to introduce efficiencies and we had a very informative briefing on this yesterday.  Instead of having 34 individual authorities preparing their water plans and buying services, all of that knowledge and experience will be pooled in one authority.  That is very welcome.  It will be a better service for the consumer.  Irish Water will produce its strategic plan.  There will be a regulator.  Irish Water will have to establish what and how it will charge.  This will lead to a more transparent system, which will be very welcome.  Like the Minister of State and most people in this House, I served in a local authority.  At this time of year when we prepared our estimates the issue of charges to the non-domestic user was always very contentious because there was a suspicion that the commercial sector was supporting the domestic sector in the absence of domestic charging.  That will all be in the past and there will be more openness and transparency. </p><p>We need to review the water infrastructure.  There has been investment and significant progress on this in the past 15 years.  I mentioned the issue that arose in Cork in 2009.  In the past month the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government gave the go-ahead for a connector between the two local authorities and this year there has been funding for refurbishment of the water scheme in Cork.  I am sure that there are other positive stories like that throughout the country.  There is much more work to be done.</p><p>The urban wastewater discharge update report published by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, last June stated that 42% of wastewater treatment plants do not meet all quality standards or EPA guidelines.  Different schemes have been stitched together which compromises the national supply and many of our systems are out of date.  Some date back to the Victorian era, others from the 1950s and 1960s when we replaced sections of our network with asbestos cement.  We also need to replace the lead piping.  Our network is not of the required standard.  There have been breakages and leaks that have been patched up across the country.  We need to draw up a scheme to replace the essential networks that will be part of the plan.  Some of that is already happening. </p><p>We need certainty of supply, and of its quality and cost, which we will get now.  In respect of foreign direct investment, would-be investors need to see that there is a secure supply.  The pharmaceutical and ICT sectors are massive users of water.  There has been much infiltration of ground water into our sewerage network which loads the wastewater treatment.  All those problems need to be sorted out.  The fact that we have longer, drier spells now means that security of supply and storage facilities needs to be addressed.</p><p>I welcome what the Minister of State said about those workers who will transfer from local authorities to Irish Water, and that he may have to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to protect the employment rights they have built up.  It is a welcome proposal because they are concerned about that.  I acknowledge that the service level agreement with the local authorities will ensure that the corporate knowledge and experience that they have in dealing with the local networks will not be lost and will continue to be available to Irish Water.</p><p>The consultation period with the regulator on how the charges will be established will be very important.  The Government has not yet established the terms of the free allowance or where it will be but it is important to establish that there will be an allowance.  I am sure that will come up in the debate, in respect of people who have medical needs, or large families.  The Minister of State said that it will not be possible to cut off the water supply but restrictions will be in place.  There will be caveats to that statement because there will be people who refuse to pay even though they can pay.</p><p>I welcome this Bill.  Bord G&aacute;is has experience of managing its own network across municipal boundaries and of dealing with customers on an individual basis and on a larger scale.  This knowledge is very important and its experience is perfectly pitched to this type of performance.  This is a good day.  We look forward to weeding out all the difficulties we have with our water supply and treatment.  We need to send out the message that we have a world-class system where there has been a dearth of much-needed investment.  We look forward to progressing in the years ahead and we look forward to getting to a point where we can see and plan ahead how our water services can be developed and protected. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-04a.117" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1136" speakername="David Norris" time="12:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013120400018#S00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State back to the House.  He always listens but he is not always able to act even when he agrees with what is said.  I have spoken about the water supply for many years.  It is one natural resource in which this country an <i>embarras de richesses</i>.  We have plenty of the raw supply of water.</p><p>  I accept completely that we cannot simply take the rainwater out of the sky and use it for domestic purposes.  It would not be practical or sanitary and we need to be protected against various microbial infections and pollutants and so on.  There is a clear charge on the State to provide plant and insulation for the treatment of water and provision of adequate services and piping and all the rest.  I have no problem with water charges.  I never opposed them.  I believe in paying for what we use.  For that reason the idea of the payment per cubic metre of water is appropriate.  It depends of course where that is put.  I hope it will be put at the lower end.</p><p>  Can the Minister of State indicate something about the phrase that has been tossed around of a &quot;free&quot; water element?  Does he have any idea what the quantification of this is likely to be?  Although I agree with the charges, I also agree with my colleagues on this side of the House who said that it will be a great burden for many people because of the accumulation of different taxes.  There are now so many.  In one report, I read that the average four member family might have to pay up to &euro;500 a year.  That could be crippling for people on tiny margins.  For that reason I am also very glad that the Minister has decided not to allow Irish Water to cut off supplies.  That would be an outrage and a kind of violation of human rights.  Why have this mean business of reducing the water?  If the Minister is prepared to go to court when people do not pay why not leave it at that?  Why reduce the water supply?  There is something rather Scrooge like in that.  How much will they get?  By how much will it be reduced?  What will the impact of that be on a family, particularly if there is a sick person in the family or a need for extra water?</p> <p>It is a pity this legislation has really been sparked by the EU and the IMF agreement.  We should have done it years ago, although I am not blaming this Government as it goes back to Government after Government.  They simply did not invest and there was a massive lack of investment in water infrastructure.  The last really huge water programme was one that is mentioned in <i>Ulysses</i>, the Vartry reservoir in 1904.  We have neglected this partly because, I suppose, we see the grey waters pouring out of the skies all the time.  I always laughed when they said &quot;Don't water your garden in the summer&quot;.  The minute I heard that, I used to go out and leave the hose on because I thought that the sooner we have a crisis, the better, and if I can add to that crisis in any way, I will, because that is the only way they will ever face up to the situation.</p><p> With regard to metering, I have a number of particular concerns.  I have mentioned this before, and the Minister of State nodded and says he is in agreement, but I do not know that anything is happening about it.  First, the installation of the metering seems to have been outsourced and commercial companies are doing it.  I would like to think they will be given very strict instructions within the Georgian core of Dublin that they must not continue to destroy the antique pavement.  This is a heritage from the 18th century yet it is routinely desecrated, and the local authorities used to replace it with concrete in some places.  We kicked up hell about this in North Great George's Street and were eventually successful.  The local authorities have since been very good about it.  I am concerned about the outsourced people because they do not give a tinker's curse about heritage on many occasions, whereas the employees of the corporation certainly did.</p><p> The other issue I am concerned about in regard to metering is the need for joined-up thinking.  If we look at the helpful explanatory memorandum, the Minister's speech and the context around this, it is perfectly clear that the utilities are all interconnected in one way or another.  We have Irish Water, the gas people and the electricity people, and they are all related and interconnected, and are all, more or less, already involved in this project.  The point I made to the Minister of State, and I would like to know if he has any comment on this - he did nod, but it might just have been a nervous tic - is why in the name of God can we not put in one universal meter which can be read electronically and remotely for electricity, water and gas.  This avoids estimated readings given that, very often, meter readers cannot get into the house.  Of course, they will be able to access the water meters from outside but we will still be left with the electricity and the gas.  Given they are all inter-related, why not seize this moment?  I gather they have already started putting in these meters, but they had not started when I said it first.  It seems to be clear logic to do this as it would be much more efficient.  In my own case, for example, I was quite pleased to be estimated because they had overestimated me so hugely that it ended up with the gas board owing me &euro;1,000, so even though I have had a boiler breakdown which has been repaired, I am still in credit, which was rather nice to find out.  However, I would much prefer to have this accurately done.</p><p> Turning to the Minister of State's speech, what about the people in the countryside who have their own independent supply?  I presume there is no proposal to meter them.  If they have their own well and provide their own water, they are completely excluded from this, which is fine and exactly the way it should be.  I wonder should there not be a universal charge for water.  Presumably, it will not vary from county to county, which I know happens in terms of commercial development.  I believe the Minister of State is indicating there will be one rate, which is good.</p><p> They are establishing a new State-owned utility to take responsibility for the water metering and all the rest, &quot;a programme that will reduce leakage and demand, cutting production&quot;.  How will it do so?  Putting in a water meter will not reduce leakage.  From lip reading, I see the Minister of State is indicating that it will, so I look forward to the reply which, although I cannot stay to hear it, I will read with great interest.  If the Minister of State says it will, I take it that it will.  However, I do not see how simply metering will do this.  It will perhaps indicate the source of leaks-----</p></speech>

I like public utilities and I believe they should stay public utilities.  I would like it if the Minister of State could give an undertaking that, certainly as far as this Government is concerned, this is not the first stage of a privatisation.  I really do not want to see privatisation, which I do not believe works in England.  When the corporation here privatised the bins, it made an ungodly mess of it.  It is still a mess and is still financially corrupt.  I do not believe we should go down that avenue.</p><p>  It is interesting that the gentleman in charge of Irish Water was the former Dublin city manager, which may give him certain insights into the situation.  Given everybody is so interested in money these days, could we have a notion of his salary, which I presume is on the public record?</p></speech>

This again brings in the question of hospital executives.  If somebody is supposed to be in charge of several hospitals and was paid &euro;250,000, and is then dropped down to &euro;109,000, it is very odd, particularly when we are able to transfer a civil servant from one situation to another and he still gets considerably over what these people are expected to get.</p></speech>

The Minister of State also said the metering means &quot;1,600 jobs sustained&quot;.  I think that a rather sly use of the word &quot;sustained&quot; because these are expendable, limited jobs that are not going to be sustained.  They will be for four years, but when you get to my age, four years is absolutely damn all - you just do not notice it flying.  That is not sustainable employment.  It is employment for a satisfactory period but still not the correct one.  Again, I agree with the Government that metering is the fairest method.</p><p>  With regard to financing, &quot;the Bill provides that the Minister can make grants to Irish Water, consideration is being given to alternative approaches and there may be an amendment required.&quot;  Is the Minister of State in a position to give us information as to what those alternative approaches are likely to be?  Is it funding through a flotation on the stock market?  I would be interested to know in what way they will be funded.</p><p>  There is also the question of ensuring the interests of staff, which is good.  As I raised in regard to the earlier Bill, I consider it very important to know the relationship between the new body and the local authorities, particularly in terms of planning.  This will be vital and unless it is properly addressed, it could undermine the entire process.</p><p>  With regard to water charges for supply to a premises where waste water is also discharged, given it is specified that they amount to the same thing, if I were in a light-hearted mood I would say they are not always discharged.  If one is supplying one's swimming pool, for example, or filling one's moat, as members of parliament in a neighbouring island do, it is not discharged at all.  Perhaps these poor aristocrats should be looked at for their moats and their swimming pools.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State to the House and welcome his opening address.  The briefing document that was supplied to us by the Oireachtas Library was indeed excellent and it supplied strong and irrefutable evidence that we need to build out our water system.</p> <p>It contrasts greatly with the evidence that was made available today by the other State organisation, EirGrid, regarding the case for opposing the undergrounding of cables.  That is another day's work and is not a matter for the Minister of State here today.</p><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.

I thank the Minister of State for the work that he has put into the legislation.  I raised a number of issues in a previous Bill before the House.  The Minister of State said that he would address them in this Bill which he has done and I sincerely thank him for doing so.  It is important that when Senators raise issues here, following discussions with other people and experts, the relevant Minister listens and includes it in legislation.</p><p>The Bill provides for the transfer of water services and functions from 34 water service authorities to Irish Water to ensure cost savings.  Reference was made to the cost of staff, etc., in the new structure.  I am satisfied that the staff on the ground, notwithstanding the top tier of staff, are working at a rate that will provide efficiencies in the new organisation.  The Bill will also ensure that a combination of expertise spanning all local authorities will be available to Irish Water.  That is extremely important and is an issue that I have raised with the Minister of State before.  Senator Clune referred to the fact that the expertise in local authorities, particularly local knowledge on water networks which is critical, will be maintained, saved and availed of for the years ahead.  Many years ago my local authority had a local town plumber, Lord have mercy on his soul, who memorised the entire water network.  When he died we discovered that the network had never been recorded on paper.  My local authority learned a lesson.  It realised that it is critical to have such knowledge documented and it has since been recorded on a GIS system. </p><p>The Bill also provides for service level agreements between Irish Water and local authorities.  I shall return to the matter later because I wish to ask a few questions.  A service level agreement is necessary for a smooth changeover and was a critical issue when we discussed the previous Bill.  The agreement will last 12 years.  In the Bill and explanatory memorandum reference was made to what may happen after the 12 years expires.  Does the Minister of State believe that there will not be a follow-on after the 12 years?  Has he concerns?  The question has been put to me by worker representatives and I ask him to clarify the matter when he responds.</p><p>Representatives will work at a regional level with local authorities to ensure that the service level agreements are adhered to.  How deep will the drilling go?  Who will measure the depth on an ongoing basis?  </p><p>The Bill refers to but does not provide for water charges.  Can he let me know his thoughts on the matter?  I know that the situation will follow on from where we are today.  I ask that consideration is given to large families on low incomes, carers in the home and people who, for one reason or another, must use extra water.  The Minister of State made reference to the matter in his contribution in terms of the Tidy Towns committees and various community groups.  I welcome his comments because the matter is extremely important. </p><p>A section in the Bill provides that water can be cut off to commercial operations or premises but not for non-commercial entities.  Will the provision stand up?  The provision will cause problems because many people live over their premises, for example.  I know that the issue has been thrashed out a lot with local authorities.  What happens if a retail business where the owner and his or her family lives over the house, closes down because he or she cannot pay commercial rates and the water is due to be cut off?  How will the matter be dealt with and clarified?  </p><p>The Commission for Energy Regulation is responsible for ensuring that decisions are made in the best interest of the customer.  Earlier one Senator questioned whether the commission will act in the interest of the customer or the supplier.  Common sense should prevail and people should realise that the commission will act in the interest of the customer because that is why it exists in the first place.  Is the Minister of State satisfied with the provision?</p><p>I have already referred to the fact that 4,000 people work in local authorities in the water sector.  Also, service level agreements are due to last 12 years.  Is the agreement's duration directly linked to security of employment for local authority workers?  Is there a correlation?  There is a little ambiguity that needs to be cleared up for me, even though I pose the question on behalf of other people.</p><p>The Minister of State has clarified that all of the terms and conditions for the people who are and have transferred will move with them.  Will they get individual &ldquo;letters of comfort&rdquo;?  That term was used by Aer Lingus in the past.  Can he clarify the current position? </p><p>With regard to getting ready for metering in 2015, the meters shall be put in place and ready by the last quarter of 2014.  Practically all commercial premises have a water meter but there are still many meters to be installed.  It has been estimated that between 200,000 and 300,000 units of housing, many of which are apartments, cannot and will not be metered in time but there is a mechanism to estimate their water usage.  I am talking about apartment blocks so shall use them as the most common example.  Will apartment blocks have individual meters or will it always be a guesstimate scenario?</p><p>I have a concern about the call centre to be set up and I have raised the issue with the Minister of State here, at committee and at the briefing.  The representations that local authority members make to the water section of their local authority are dealt with first hand by the staff.  What will happen to the service when Irish Water runs the water services for local authorities?  To whom can representations be made, either by local authority members or Oireachtas members?  At yesterday's briefing some of his staff suggested that a special telephone line could be made available to public representatives.  </p></speech>

The Minister of State has a genuine interest in seeing that local representatives have access.  It was one of the greatest issues and concerns that they expressed to me.  They wondered what would happen if something happens on a Sunday.  At present, and I told him before, the head of water in my local authority sends a text to tell councillors and Oireachtas members what is happening.  We want that service retained.</p> <p>As he comes from rural Ireland, the Minister of State will be well aware of the continual liaison and interaction between those involved in group water schemes and local authority staff.  The local authorities provide help to group water schemes even though they are separate entitles.  Does the Minister of State envisage a similar approach will be adopted by Irish Water?  It is critical.  I know the local authorities are separate, but they provide critical assistance and expertise to group water schemes.  Can the Minister of State ensure this knowledge base is made available to those involved in group water schemes?  As the Minister of State knows, we are talking about people who come together in their own areas to provide water services.</p><p>I have asked the Minister of State about the transfer of staff.  Can he explain why a 25 year timeframe will apply to the water service plans that will have to be set out?  Did somebody decide that 25 years was a suitable length of time?  Is there more to it?  I cannot see a reason for it in the legislation.  It seems like an awfully long time for which to have to set out a plan.  It could be argued that it is visionary to set out a plan for 25 years.  I would like some clarity on that.  I thank the Minister of State for his contribution.</p></speech>

T&aacute; a fhios againn go l&eacute;ir go bhfabhra&iacute;onn costais nuair a chuireann na h&uacute;dar&aacute;is &aacute;iti&uacute;la uisce ar f&aacute;il.  Cosna&iacute;onn s&eacute; thart ar &euro;1.2 billi&uacute;n an uisce sin a chur ar f&aacute;il.  Tagann thart ar &euro;200 milli&uacute;n ar ais &oacute; thaobh na t&aacute;ill&iacute; uisce a ghearrtar ar lucht gn&oacute; na t&iacute;re seo.  T&aacute; a fhios againn le cois sin go bhfuil fadhbanna ollmh&oacute;ra i dtaca leis an uisce a chailltear.  I accept that certain costs are associated with the provision of water.  All consumers want to get top quality water on demand when it is required.  They expect the European safety legislation that governs this area to be adhered to.  There is no question that providing this service costs money.  Before now, that cost was met through the local government fund or through the general taxation mechanism.  The legislation that governs this area and allows the Government to charge for water is section 65A(1) of the Public Health Ireland (Act) 1878, which allows sanitary authorities to charge for water.  We are seeing the reintroduction of water charges, which were introduced in 1983 and abolished in 1997.</p><p>I have a couple of general queries.  According to library and research service documentation which has been mentioned by other speakers, 77% of households are connected to the public mains, 9% are connected to group water schemes which are connected to public supplies, 3% are connected to private group water schemes and 10% are connected to other schemes.  A small number of units - 2,908 - are not connected to any facility.  Can the Minister of State outline whether houses connected to public or private group water schemes will be charged under this legislation?  Obviously, charges cannot be imposed on houses that are connected to other private sources, such as wells and rivers.  I contend that in the same way, charges should not be imposed on private group water schemes or on those who do not have any connection.  I understand the legislation provides that people can be charged for wastewater as well.  Perhaps the Minister of State will provide some clarification in that regard.  How can charges be imposed on houses without any public drinking water supplies?  Maybe it is my reading of it, but I do not think the legislation is clear on the question of wastewater.  Will the Minister of State clarify that further?  No provision is made in this Bill for exemptions in the cases of people who cannot afford to pay.  Regardless of whether we like it, some people will not be able to afford to pay for water.</p><p>I would like to move on to speak about charging.  The Commission for Energy Regulation has been mentioned.  The library and research service has done some work on the position across Europe.  The average price of water across many European cities ranges from 40 cent to &euro;5.75 per 1,000 litres.  There are huge variations within countries.  In Sweden, for example, people in Malm&ouml; pay just &euro;1.03 per 1,000 litres whereas people in Gothenburg pay &euro;4.19.  What is the Government's policy on pricing throughout the country?  Will there be a universal price?  According to an estimate that has been provided by the library and research unit, the average level of water consumption in Ireland is approximately 150 litres per person per day.  International experience tells us that consumption is likely to decrease by approximately 15% if this change is introduced.  That is what happened in England.  If a similar decrease takes place here, average water consumption will fall to approximately 127.5 litres per day, or 3,825 litres per person per month.  According to the most recent census, some 1.39 million households are connected to the public mains.  There are four people living in most of those households.  The cost of providing the water is &euro;1.2 billion.  The average price across Europe is &euro;1.93 per 1,000 litres per month.  This would mean that Irish consumers would pay &euro;7.30 a month, or &euro;87.67 per year.  The average household has 2.78 people living in it.</p><p>According to the figures I have cited, this measure is likely to take in &euro;339 million per annum.  The Government is seeking to generate &euro;500 million per annum, however.  If that objective is to be achieved, an average cost of &euro;129.31 per person will have to be imposed for the use of water.  If the &euro;500 million target is to be achieved, that theoretically means the average cost per household would be approximately &euro;360.  That estimate is based on the figures from the library and research service.  I join the Minister of State in praising the thorough work of that service.  If we take the figure of &euro;360 per household per annum as an average, we must bear in mind that it will be imposed on top of the property tax and other charges.  I have no faith in the Commission for Energy Regulation, by the way.  We are living in an era in which the cost of living should come down.  Why has the commission allowed the price of electricity to increase by 15% per annum in that context?  What will happen if its form to date is encapsulated in what is coming down the tracks with Irish Water?  If we assume that Irish Water is to be allowed to do the same thing, I suggest that the average base charge will start from &euro;300 or &euro;360 per household - this is based on the census figure of 2.78 people per household - and will escalate from there.  That is all I have to say about pricing.</p><p>We are fundamentally opposed to this measure.  I accept it was included in the EU-troika programme.  Nothing in that programme has prevented the Government from renegotiating part of the Irish Water proposal, especially in light of the constraints households are under at present.  Nothing in the troika programme requires the establishment of a quango like Irish Water.  The Government is removing democratic accountability.  At present, local authority members are able to hold council officials to account.  If there is a water burst in a local village, one can contact the local councillor or engineer with knowledge in this regard.  Under the new system, one will have to ring a call centre in Cork to report a local burst up the road.  That is exactly what is going to happen.  When the transfer of responsibilities takes place, there will still be people working in the local authority sector.  Between 4,000 and 4,500 people work in the water directorates of local authorities.  Can the Minister clarify what will happen when the transfer of responsibilities takes place?  Will there be redundancy obligations when people leave local authorities and get 12 year contracts?  Who will pay those redundancy obligations?  If so, where will that money come from?  What will be the cost of those redundancies across the sector?</p><p>I ask the Minister of State about section 6 of the Local Government Act 1998, which is being amended in the new local government legislation to allow the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to transfer up to &euro;600 million.  I understand from an Oireachtas committee meeting that took place yesterday that &euro;500 million from that fund will be transferred to Irish Water.  Can that be clarified?  What will that money be used for?  How will the shortfall in the local government fund, which is established on the basis of people paying their motor tax, be made up?</p></speech>

The more one uses, the more one pays.  Metering will educate people to conserve water and to be careful in their use of water.  I agree with the Minister of State that metering will identify leaks.  Small but visible leaks are often ignored by householders or landowners.  I predict that when householders and landowners study their water charge bills, they will see the cost of those leaks and decide to remedy them.</p><p>I live at the foot of the Cooley mountains and I see numerous rivers flowing down the mountains into the sea.  I often think there must be something we can do to help conserve more of this valuable commodity.  We have reservoirs in Omeath and Carlingford.  We should consider the possibility of increasing reservoir capacity in mountainous areas in particular.  It grieves me to see water flowing down the side of the mountain in wet winters.  I note the programme will reduce leakages of a valuable commodity by 15%.  The Bill also plans for the future which is most important.  The new funding model for the domestic sector will be based on fairness.  Should the initial agreement period of 12 years be reviewed so that it could be a period of five or ten years, for example?  There is obviously a reason for choosing a period of 12 years.</p></speech>

Section 15 provides for the transfer of staff from local authorities to Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  Such transfers will take place following consultations between each individual local authority and Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  The intention is that this section will only apply to local authority staff involved in the delivery of water services as part of an agreement between the local authority and Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  There is a question about the pension rights of local authority staff with long service who move to Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  Will those rights be transferred?</p></speech>

Irish Water will be prohibited from cutting off water supplies.  When ESB bills were not being paid, people were given every possible opportunity to pay the bill and disconnecting supply was regarded as the very last resort.  Uisce &Eacute;ireann will leave a certain flow of water which may not be adequate for all domestic use.  Is it the case that commercial premises could be disconnected completely?  I am unsure whether this is fair treatment of commercial enterprises who give employment and I ask the Minister of State not to disconnect them.  I am confident that Uisce &Eacute;ireann will consider payment options such as deferred payment.</p></speech>

The Water Services (No.1) Bill established Uisce &Eacute;ireann as a subsidiary of An Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, a company which this Government said it intends to sell off.  This new company will be given power to install water meters and to charge families for the water they use.  In Denmark, with a population similar to our own, water metering is in place and in 2007, the average cost per household was &euro;715.  The water services Bills do not take into account people on low incomes or even those currently living in poverty.  Under this legislation, poor households will be charged the same for their water as An Taoiseach, Enda Kenny or, as the Minister of State said, the chief executive officer of the company who earns &euro;200,000 a year.  This is shameful and it betrays a complete and utter lack of consciousness about issues to do with environmental justice.  Any development - including that of our water system - which ignores the essential needs of the poorest people, whether in this country or abroad, is not sustainable.</p><p>According to a major report by the British Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, a household spending of over 3% of income on water charges is at risk of water poverty.  The report, Water Poverty in Wales and England, found that UK households in the lowest three income deciles spend on average 3% of their net income on water bills whereas the average spend for all households is just 1%.  The report states that large water bills have the potential for causing significant deprivation.  However, despite international evidence, this Bill does not even attempt to protect low income families and those who are regarded as vulnerable.</p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in is against the privatisation of water and against the introduction of charging for water.  The establishment of Irish Water, along with the imposition of water meters and water charges, is, at best, ill thought-out.  It transpires that meters cannot be installed in one third of households in Dublin.  This will also be the case in many parts of the country.  If water meters equal water conservation, then the Government has a serious problem.  </p><p>The Water Services (No. 2) Bill sets out the legal basis for domestic charges, thereby facilitating the Government in the introduction of water charges and water metering.  However, we need to see the Government-sponsored drive towards water metering in the context of overall Government policy.  Sinn F&eacute;in condemns the wave of cuts of water investment planned from 2012 onwards, as outlined in the Government's plan for capital investment for the period 2012 to 2016.  Capital investment in water services is being cut from almost &euro;435 million in 2011 to &euro;331 million in 2012.  This is a cut of &euro;100 million or almost 25% and a cut of nearly &euro;200 million on the 2010 allocation, with more cuts planned until the budget is just &euro;266 million.  </p><p>The budgets of consecutive Governments have brought extreme financial pressure to bear on families.  Water metering has an immediate and negative impact on low income families.  When taking the poverty levels and income distribution in Ireland into account, it is obvious that water charges will have a significant impact on households and their income.  Sinn F&eacute;in agrees that we need a co-ordinated approach on the island of Ireland towards ensuring that water is brought to where it is needed when it is needed.  We must ensure that homes and communities are protected against the adverse effects of flooding from too much water.  Currently in this State, there are 34 local authorities supplying water to nearly two million households.  Sinn F&eacute;in agrees there needs to be better co-ordination but Sinn F&eacute;in is opposed to water charges on the island of Ireland.  The current proposal to install water meters and charge households for water was dreamed up by Fianna F&aacute;il, brought to life by Fine Gael and supported by the Labour Party.</p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il stated in its National Recovery Plan 2011-14 that part of the expenditure savings package would arise from the introduction of a scheme for the metering and charging of domestic water.  Overall, it is anticipated that these measures could lead to annual savings of up to &euro;500 million per annum.</p><p>The Water Services (No. 2) Bill 2013 sets in train a process that will see 1.3 million holes drilled outside people's homes and water meters installed using money from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF.  These households, which are currently paying taxes for the water they use, will have to pay again for the same water.  This means that residents will be paying three times for each glass of water they drink - first through their income taxes, second through the NPRF investment and third through water rates.</p><p>The installation of water meters will prove to be costly and inefficient.  Experts, including the local authority professional officers, have estimated that &euro;1.2 billion will be needed to cover the cost.  In England, private companies are still attempting to install water meters 20 years after they were first introduced.  The Bill has nothing to do with water conservation and everything to do with taking more power away from local authorities and centralising it ahead of preparing for the full privatisation of our water service.  The Bill is nothing more than a Trojan horse for privatisation.  The Minister of State has claimed that it is not the Government's intention to privatise, but those intentions easily change when opportunities arise.</p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in has actively campaigned against water charges in the past and we will redouble our efforts to ensure that these charges end up in the rubbish bin of history.  Sinn F&eacute;in fully understands the challenge that lies ahead for the water sector, but the Government has used the crisis as an opportunity to promote its right-wing agenda of charging ordinary people for the use of something they already own and pay for through their taxes.  Our approach is different.  It is based on ensuring that water provision remains in public ownership and is paid for through progressive taxation.  Sinn F&eacute;in proposes investing money from the NPRF in creating real jobs that have a positive legacy.  The money being wasted on meters should be invested in upgrading an ageing, leaking water distribution system.  The &euro;500 million referred to in the Bill would fund the water conservation strategy for six years.  This would be a far more appropriate investment than meter installation.</p><p>The water sector is managed by the 34 local authorities.  The move to Irish Water will not improve accountability or governance.  Local authorities are accountable to their communities.  They are able to meet local demands and can provide solutions to local crises and emergencies.  With the establishment of Irish Water, the water sector will no longer be accountable to elected public representatives or the public they serve.  To register a complaint or raise a concern, one will no longer go to a local councillor.  Rather, one will telephone an 1800 number for a call centre that has no connection with local authorities.</p><p>The State's water distribution network is antiquated.  A decade of underinvestment means that more than half of the water in some local authority areas is leaking away.  It is not the householder, but the network that is the main culprit when it comes to water waste.  It needs to be replaced.</p><p>With average leakage at a staggering 41%, we understand that there needs to be an increased level of capital spending.  While the Minister of State's proposals are focused on the domestic householder, there is no mention of the debt owed by the commercial sector, where only 52% of water rates are collected.</p><p>The crisis facing water supply does not start or finish at the Border.  Recognising that river basin districts cover both sides of the Border, it is essential that there be co-ordination of the water sector.  We need to develop an all-Ireland strategy on water provision.</p></speech>

It is eminently fair and sensible.  Most reasonable people will agree that the Government is playing catch-up and is putting to right decades of neglect.  As Senator Clune and others mentioned, ours is a Victorian infrastructure.  To cite a phrase from the politics of another era, not NewERA, when the country was awash with money, I am sometimes bewildered as to what we did with it.  We had a great opportunity to invest in strategic infrastructure, the most basic form of which is water, yet we still have counties that need to issue boil notices and there are leaks of up to 40% in the system.  This is shameful.  In recent weeks, water was rationed in the capital city.  How embarrassing was it that thousands of investors and guests who came to this city for the Web Summit could not even have cups of coffee or showers before leaving their hotel rooms?  I am intrigued that anyone would criticise the Minister of State for trying to right these issues.</p><p>Everyone knows that families are under a heavy burden.  No one likes to see another bill coming through the letter box.  As we have seen with the property tax and other charges, most reasonable people are willing pay a fair price for a fair service.  They want to know that the water is safe and reliable.  I do not know what the charge will be, but there will be an allocation per household and people who use more will pay more.  Industry, commerce and farmers already pay for the water they use.  We want people to take the next step with us down the road and pay a modest charge of perhaps &euro;1 per day for all of the water their households need.  That is not unreasonable.</p><p>It would be inconsistent of us to ask people to pay for water without fixing the leaks or building the necessary infrastructure.  I might sound like a broken record, but I urge the Minister of State to build the Garryhinch reservoir once and for all.  Bord na M&oacute;na has the plan and is ready to apply for planning permission.  It would cost &euro;540 million and Bord na M&oacute;na has secured investment capital.  It would be a significant economic stimulus, creating 1,000 construction jobs over a five-year period and securing a water supply for the entire Leinster region for generations to come.</p><p>I am fascinated by some of the spurious arguments being made in this debate.  It is as if water metering was a new phenomenon.  We are the only country in Europe that does not have a water charge.  We must broaden the tax base without putting all taxes on people's incomes.  People claim that apartments cannot be water metered.  Half of Europe lives in apartment blocks.  Under the cupboard in each of those apartments are gas and water meters.  We are not looking to reinvent the wheel.  A small bit of cop-on would go a long way.</p><p>Recently, I heard worrying commentary from senior officials and engineers at Dublin City Council.  They claimed that there would be water rationing and shortages in the Leinster region for the next ten years.  They must be joking.  The Government cannot allow this situation to persist.  We must act with expediency and urgency.  I seek a reassurance from the Minister of State that we will press ahead with ensuring a safe and sustainable supply of water.</p><p>I commend the Minister of State on the measures in the Bill that recognise and respect the contribution that local authority workers continue to make to the provision and reliability of our water services.  Local authorities have done a great job over the years and it is important that we not lose the local knowledge and expertise that their workers bring to the table.</p><p>I am pleased that we are finally moving towards enabling Irish Water to operate.  A single utility in a small country can ensure that we have a modern, reliable and safe supply of water.  I am happy that the Government decided it would be a public utility.  We have seen what happens when important infrastructure and utilities are privatised, for example, Eircom.</p> <p>We have an appalling situation in rural regions which still do not have adequate broadband facilities.  That is because the private sector seeks profit above providing a service.  Members of this House who argued that we should have put Irish Water out for tender were wrong.  It is important that the company is retained in public ownership for the benefit of the economy and the community at large.  We are making great progress at last and people will pay water charges providing they see that the service is safe, secure and sustainable.  In addition, the money raised must go back into the infrastructure.  We cannot wait extra years before starting work on the Garryhinch reservoir at Portarlington, which is the most important piece of infrastructure in this water network and will ensure an adequate water supply.  It would be absurd to ration water in Dublin while charging householders for it.  People would not have confidence in us if that happened.  It would undermine the Government's credibility and the process of establishing Irish Water because people will ask why they should pay for water when they cannot be sure of supplies.  The Garryhinch reservoir must be built.</p></speech>

This is possibly one of the most important pieces of legislation that we are likely to debate in this House.  After all, water is synonymous with life.  One need only look at the array of glasses here and it also seems that water is important to democracy.  That is why we must tease out all the issues that are coming before us.  Nobody doubts the amount of work that has gone into the establishment of Irish Water.  We are all prepared to admit up front that things are not as they should be.  Whatever crises we had in the past, we may even have a worse one in the future.  Nobody would ever thank us if we found we could not function in the midst of a drought.  A national audit needs to be completed as well as the national network.  I understand that the audit has not yet been completed so perhaps the Minister of State can explain that.  Such an audit is vital to putting our minds at ease about any questions that might arise in this regard.</p><p>I listened to Senator Landy's contribution and I fully agree with him that it is vital to maintain the network that is already established, along with the existing expertise.  Local input and responsibility are important because one can obtain answers when questions arise.  It is important for people's well-being.</p><p>I have often questioned the concept of centralising the whole health system in the HSE.  Why do we have so many debates on the HSE?  With the old health boards one could always contact somebody if there was a life or death issue in the community.  We have often seen cases of people awaiting heart surgery, yet nobody is taking account of them.  I do not know how many Senators have direct lines to the HSE but I certainly do not.  I can never find out who is responsible for what or get answers to questions, yet people's lives are at stake.  I know of a case where a person died waiting for heart surgery.  That is the result of centralising because what emerges is not a better system.  That is quite clear.  I accept that many new medical procedures have come about that did not exist years ago but I do not think the HSE has proved to be better than the health boards which preceded it.  </p><p>Local authorities are democratically responsible, which is important.  When local councillors finish their meetings, they may be questioned by members of the public outside who hold them to account.  In dealing with water issues, I could go to the town sergeant in Cashel.  I had his phone number and could ring him to explain if a problem arose, such as a leak.  One had a contact and somebody responded almost straight away.  Now we will have 500 people at the top and 400 other outreaches, but it is not a proven system.  I accept that we must try it but we should be careful.  Mr. John Tierney is one of the finest public officials one could hope to have.  He has a proven track record, apart from the fact that he is a good Tipperary man.</p></speech>

If we are taking away that immediate contact we had when there was a problem, I would like to think that this has been teased out.  We can all draw on our local experience.  I know of cases where at 15 minutes' notice the water supply could be cut off to one part of a town and delivered to another part.  I want to be assured that whatever new system is introduced, somebody will take responsibility for it.  We should not have to table questions in the D&aacute;il or Seanad, but have a direct line to obtain information.  I am a little worried about this.  I accept that we have to make progress with the existing difficulties, but I cannot understand why we did not keep local authorities in the equation, given their experience and local knowledge.  They should have been kept in the equation in a meaningful and authoritative way, so they could have responded.</p><p>I do not have a problem with water charges and believe that those who can pay should pay.  The bottom line is as simple as that.  I do not think we can continue to deliver services unless that is the case.  I have an old-fashioned view on this, although economists and others will say that it does not work.  I cannot understand why we did not have a clear increase in taxation - be it 2%, 3% or 4% - and get rid of the septic tank, water and household charges.  In that way, if it was based on direct taxation or PAYE, only those who are able to pay would be paying.  The argument against it is that it interferes with employment, but I do not accept that because it is a tax, whether direct or indirect.</p><p>A charge of between &euro;100 and &euro;300 has been mentioned for households, which is a fairly big gap.  At the end of the day, water is life, although I do not mean uisce beatha.  We must therefore ensure that those who cannot afford it will not be charged, or at least that they will not be made to cut back on using water to the detriment of family hygiene and general cleanliness.  These issues must be considered.  I am worried that some people may fall within the charging remit but will not be able to afford such an extra charge.  I am not opposed to progress and am certainly not opposed to charges, but we need to have further debate as well as fine tuning the system.  This is not the answer to all the problems, which is why we should tease out every issue while we have an opportunity to do so before the measure is implemented.</p></speech>

Man cannot live on bread alone and, in the past, prisoners at their lowest ebb in solitary confinement lived on bread and water.  One cannot live without water but it is one of the dearest commodities that our local authorities supply.  Some 10% of Kilkenny County Council's budget is used to treat water coming into households or for treating wastewater afterwards.  It is a major expenditure which I presume applies to every other local authority.</p><p>I was delighted to hear that Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; is not against the charge, but he then let himself down by stating that it should be a direct charge in tax.</p> <p>The Government committed in its programme for Government to not increasing income tax.  The reason for this is that if one increases taxes on income people it may not pay people to continue in employment.  Some 1,200 jobs per month are being created, which is a great achievement for the Government.  Getting people back to work is important in the context of recovery of the economy.  </p><p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh might refer his speech to his Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues in the Northern Ireland Assembly.  Water charges are incorporated into the property tax applicable in the North.  In some cases, people are paying up to &pound;1,200 per annum in this regard.</p></speech>

That is a great deal more than what is being charged by the Irish Government.</p></speech>

Ireland is now the only country in Europe that does not charge for water, which I am sure amazes people in Europe.  As stated by Senator Whelan, the people who attended the conference mentioned were amazed to hear that we often have to ration water or issue notices to boil water.</p><p>The document from which Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill read a great deal also states that the renewed programme for Government issued by the previous Government, of which Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill's party was part, in October 2009 committed that Administration to introducing charges for treated water use based on a system whereby households would be allocated a free basic allowance and charged only for water use in excess of this allowance.  In other words, when Fianna F&aacute;il was in government it favoured the introduction of water charges.  It has since done a U-turn on this issue and the introduction of a property tax, the introduction of which it favoured when in government.</p><p>Currently our water services are administered by 34 local authorities.  It is important that Irish Water take charge of this responsibility.  Operation of our water services is costing us &euro;1.2 billion per annum, &euro;715 million of which goes on operational costs and &euro;500 million of which goes on capital costs.  The proposed water charges will yield only &euro;200 million, which leaves a shortfall of &euro;1 billion.  The Government must in terms of water charges take in at least &euro;500 million.  As pointed out by everybody who contributed to this debate thus far, our infrastructure is way out of date.  Our pipes were installed during the 19th century.  Many are now leaking.  In some counties, including Kilkenny, water wastage is approximately 50%.  It is important we invest in this infrastructure.  However, the Government cannot do so unless it takes in the necessary money.  Water is a commodity we cannot do without.  Many people purchase bottled water in public houses and supermarkets.  The quality of the water coming out of the taps in most areas in this country is of better quality than that bottled water.</p><p>I welcome that under section 16(8), Irish Water will not be permitted to disconnect water supplies.  As I said earlier, water is an essential commodity.  Section 17(10) provides that for the purposes of calculating a charge under section 16, the amount of wastewater discharged from a premises is deemed to be equal to the amount of water supplied to that premises unless Irish Water and the customer agree otherwise.   It is ridiculous that we are using treated water in toilet facilities, washing machines and so on.  I hope that the Government will introduce a grant system in respect of rain water harvesting and so on.  This would result in a reduction in the amount of treated water being used in toilet facilities and so on.  I would prefer if households were not expected to pay for wastewater treatment.  Currently, a double charge is imposed on businesses in respect of water-in and water-out.  I do not believe the Government should consider the introduction of water-out charges for people whose water comes from a main sewerage system.   </p><p>It is important we put in place a centralised system.  As has been pointed out, since the introduction of metering, water usage in the UK has decreased by 15%.  People respect what they have to pay for.  The problem here is that we have become a country of entitlement, with everybody thinking they are entitled to everything free of charge.  We have now had our hand forced by the troika in terms of the introduction of a property tax and water charges.  It is important people pay for services provided.  Reference was made earlier to the water charges in Kildare being &euro;1.70 per cu. m. and in Wicklow being &euro;3.04 per cu. m.  Will an average price apply across the country?  It is important for business sake that charges are equalised.  Businesses will not want to locate in areas where water charges are high.  </p><p>If leaks are addressed and better efficiencies are achieved, the cost to the consumer will reduce further.  If everybody is paying, businesses may not have to pay as much.  It is important to support businesses and jobs.  Without a proper water system we will not be successful in attracting companies and thus jobs into this country.  I will give an example.  A few years ago Kilkenny County Council, with the assistance of the IDA, sank major wells of clean water near Belview Port, which currently supplies some parts of the city of Kilkenny with water and will in the future supply the new Glanbia plant being constructed in Belview.  This is one of the biggest investments ever made by an Irish company in this country.  The availability of a clean supply of water enabled the construction by Glanbia of its major milk processing plant on the Waterford border.  Investments can only be achieved if we are realistic.  </p><p>I support the passage of this Bill through the Houses.  As I said earlier, everybody should pay for essential services such as water.</p></speech>

Ensuring greater security of quality water supply for the Irish people and the economy is of paramount importance.  Having a national public utility providing water services and infrastructure and a sustainable funding model will, I expect, bring an end to the situations we witnessed in Galway some years ago and in Dublin recently.</p><p>There is no doubt but that water is one of the most important commodities on earth.  It is only when water is rationed or the supply is cut off for various reasons that we realise its importance.  This Bill provides for the transfer of water services functions from local authorities to Irish Water.  I join with other Senators in paying tribute to the many local authority workers and engineers throughout the country who have worked diligently to provide an adequate and safe supply of water to Irish people.  In many local authorities this has been achieved despite paltry investment in water services infrastructure and a lack of funding by the State in this infrastructure.</p><p>I recall Ministers saying during the Celtic tiger years that we were so awash with money they were looking for ways and means to spend it.  Investment at that time in water infrastructure would have been a prudent and beneficial investment for all.  However, such investment brought no votes and the benefits that might accrue were not visible to the electorate.  This is possibly the reason we have been bereft of investment in this infrastructure, in particular over the past 20 years.  </p><p>I listened to Senator Walsh kick off this debate.  I never cease to be amazed at the neck of some members of Fianna F&aacute;il in suggesting that the Labour Party has rowed back on its promise to oppose the introduction of water charges.</p> <p>The Labour Party and all other parties were left with no option after Fianna F&aacute;il signed up to these charges in the bailout programme.  This matter of fact is on record and it simply is not true for anyone to say otherwise.</p><p>While the Bill contains many provisions, obviously people will hone in on the charging for water.  Despite the many other aspects of the Bill, people will focus on that and it is natural that they would do so because people unquestionably are hard pressed.  The people of middle Ireland are hard pressed with bills and when one talks about the economy picking up and so on, these people do not see that at present.  They see this measure as another bill that will come in the door but hopefully, this will change in the future.</p><p>I note that under section 17, Irish Water will be required to prepare a water charges plan, setting out details of its tariffs and related matters, including payment methods.  Moreover, these plans, including tariffs, will be subject to the approval of the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER.  When will these plans be put before Members?  The Government should have a say in this regard, apart from the regulator, because I have doubts in respect of regulators.  There is a need to consider the work of regulators and some appraisal should done regarding the regulators in place at present.  Indeed, someone should be looking after the supervision in this regard as well.  It is the same as anything else in that one cannot have people policing themselves and the regulator will deal with the information it gets from Irish Water.  This should be examined carefully by the Government before it goes to the regulator.</p><p>I understand that work is being progressed on the approach to the proposed free allowance and on affordability measures that will be introduced by the Government to ameliorate the impact of water charges on domestic customers.  When it is proposed to announce such allowances and to have in place an estimate of the type of charges?  I acknowledge that an inventory is being carried out at present by local authorities, feeding into Irish Water.  When will people get an idea as to what they will be charged for their water and on what quantity of water will be provided in a free allowance?  What other mechanisms will be put in place to ameliorate the impact in the case of large families and so on?  The Minister of State might revert to Members on these questions because this is what people want to know.  They wish to know how much it will cost, how much water will be provided free as an allowance, what they will be obliged to pay for the rest of it and what mechanisms for payment will be available.  I am glad of the provision that Irish Water will not cut off the supply completely if people do not pay, but what mechanisms will be available to the company?  Will it be the same as for Bord G&aacute;is or the ESB if people do not pay their bills, where they are cut off?  Will the company go to court or will a mechanism be put in place to collect the money through Revenue, social welfare payments, pay packets or whatever, in the event of people not paying this charge?  These are the type of questions that are being asked on the ground and perhaps the Minister of State might provide Members with some answers today.</p></speech>

Caithfidh m&eacute; caint faoi sin n&iacute;os d&eacute;ana&iacute;.</p><p>This has been an important, open and frank debate.  I welcome the comments from all Members in what was a constructive and informative debate.  It is the right way to conduct a proper debate and this House comes into its own in such situations, where the political stuff is kept to a minimum but the facts, questions and realities that are brought to me and that I am learning from Members are extremely important.</p><p>If I may, I will deal with the contributions in the order in which they were made.  Senator Walsh spoke of an expensive quango with huge salaries.  The first point to note is that the salary of the chief executive is a matter of public record.  The entire reason there will be charges from the outset is because of the troika agreement signed by Fianna F&aacute;il.  As the Oireachtas notes indicate, water charges were originally meant to be in place by 2011-12.  This Government has negotiated a change in that they will not commence until the beginning of 2015.  A question regarding different councils was raised by Senator Walsh and other Members, that is, the difference between Kildare, Kerry, Wicklow or whatever.  At present, different counties have different commercial charges but notwithstanding that, the average charge for water in Ireland is approximately &euro;2.50 per 1,000 litres.  In other words, for every bottle of Ballygowan or whatever for which one pays &euro;2.50 in a pub, the State will supply 1,000 litres of water, so there is great value for water in Ireland at present.  Therefore, I believe we are being cost-efficient in its production but greater efficiency must be achieved.</p><p>As for the question of consultants raised by Senator Walsh as to how much they will cost and who they are, the key point is that any cost placed on the cost of water will be imposed by the regulator and such costs must be placed there transparently.  In other words, the regulator will neither be able nor will wish to add in costs that are not reasonable, not fair or which are not computed efficiently, fairly and practically.  Consequently, there is no question of there being hidden costs in respect of the transparency of how the regulator will make its decision.  While no one mentioned it - perhaps Members were unaware  - last Friday, the regulator concluded a consultative period with the public.  It was a publicly advertised document on its website, advertised in the national press, on how the company would go about charging and what would be the process, without going into the nitty-gritty of the actual charges themselves, as well as how that will work.  I suggest Members might wish to access the CER website and read that document.  Following this consultative period, the Government will be informed by 22 December as to what will be the advice the regulator will give to the Government in respect of the consultation period, which I believe to be important.</p><p>A question was raised about how the commission will limit the level of charges that Irish Water can charge, which is the point I am making.  The commission will determine the structure of domestic water tariffs and take account of the Government's pricing framework.  An issue raised by many Members pertained to what will be the free allowance and to the level of social supports.  I revert to the point made by Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh about water poverty, which is a very important consideration in my reflection on these issues.  Where a family is deemed to be in water poverty - I believe the definition is that the cost is greater than 3% of its income - then supports must be in place and this will be the case.  It is both important that everyone will get a free allowance and that the question of affordability is a key and critical part of everything that will happen.  It is important that there is transparency and accountability in this regard.</p><p>Senator Clune raised the question of the role of the regulator and makes an important point about Bord G&aacute;is customer relations and how they will relate to one another.  At present, on the basis of my personal experience, I believe Bord G&aacute;is does an excellent job in customer relations.  It has an 1850 number that one calls, just like the ESB, which I also believe to be fantastic, in terms of the national content of the messages that come to one locally.  I believe the same will be true with the call centre but I wish to make the point clearly that the commitment of Uisce &Eacute;ireann is that each councillor in the country will have a contact number in his or her locality who will be responsible to that councillor for all the information needed.  Moreover and importantly, Members will be able to pass on such information to them via that communication channel as well.  There will be no change in that regard and it is a key and core element.</p> <p>I understand Uisce &Eacute;ireann has appointed regional communicators who will deal specifically with elected members and with councils.  I cannot over-emphasise that point and its importance.</p><p>Senator David Norris raised the issue of the free allowance and asked how people who cannot afford to pay will be supported.  At the Cabinet sub-committee on economic infrastructure we agreed that an interdepartmental working group will advise the Government on the appropriate methods for addressing water poverty.  The group, which includes representatives from the Departments of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Social Protection, the Taoiseach, Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, is tasked with identifying the groups likely to face affordability issues, examining the appropriate mechanisms to address these issues, taking account of the broader social policy agenda, including systems integration and labour activation, preparing a high level action plan and identifying costs.  In recent weeks the group has looked at a range of options for addressing affordability.  To fully inform its work, it has met a wide range of stakeholders.  The group expects to report to Government before the end of the year.  The agreed approach to affordability issues will be reflected in a charging structure established by the regulator.  That is a critical part of the process.</p><p>Senator Norris made a point about reducing water.  If a meter is installed, water wastage and unaccounted for water on the customer's side goes down.  In Ballycroy, County Mayo, a fantastic group water scheme is in place which involves young people in schools.  That scheme has reduced water consumption by more than 70% through proactive community measures, part of which has been metering.  Senator Norris asked how one deals with a person who is sick and whose water supply is restricted.  That is an important issue.  It is proper that there would be proportionate action in terms of restriction of water, particularly if a person can afford to pay.  If a person is unwell, that is an entirely different matter.</p><p>The question of Georgian pavements, heritage streets and the historic infrastructure of towns and cities was raised in terms of metering.  That is a very important point.  I will ask Uisce &Eacute;ireann to respond directly on that issue.  It is right and proper that there would be appropriate metering.  NewERA, an entity which is responsible to the Minister for Finance, advises the Government on all manner of issues - the purchase of State assets, issues relating to water and many others.  Perhaps I will get a note to Members on the role of NewERA, which would be helpful to everybody.  The level of unaccounted for water is very high and we believe that will be reduced.</p><p>Senator Deirdre Clune spoke about Cork city and county where there was not joined-up thinking, the water supply to the city was not connected to the water supply to the county, and the city suffered because its supply was interrupted.  This is not about local authorities having their own little quango and running their 34 water services.  It is about joined-up thinking, regional development, planning and so on all joined together, which is not the case at present.  I agree with the Senator that 42% of water is wasted nationally, which is an appalling waste.  The idea is to have a constructive plan on how to deal with water wastage in order that when people are asked to pay, they will be given the facts and will buy into it.</p><p>Senator Denis Landy raised the critical and important question of labour, the Labour Relations Commission and staff issues.  It is critical that local authority staff are happy, consent to what is happening and that the agreements that have been reached are successful.  There is an independent chair on the committee that deals with issues that arise.  The agreement is for a period of 12 years.  Senator Terry Brennan asked why it is not for a lesser period.  In looking ahead, I think 12 years allows people to make career choices and it allows time for Uisce &Eacute;ireann to bed in.  If at the end of that period they are still in the water system, the obvious place for them to be is in Uisce &Eacute;ireann, not with the local authorities because they will not handle water issues any longer.  Even at that stage, as provided for in the Bill, there must be consultation, six months notice must be given and there is an opportunity for representations to be made.  Nobody will be ruthlessly pushed out of business into a place to which they do not want to go.  The procedure must be fair, balanced and proportionate and there must be consultation.</p><p>Many Members raised the role of the Commission for Energy Regulation.  If Members were to table amendments on Committee Stage, we could provide some more information.  It would help me to get the answers Senators want.  The role of the CER is critical to the credibility and transparency of decision-making, how and why it is done and how one makes representations.  As I understand it, the CER will propose to charge a certain amount for water and Senators will have the opportunity to debate that.  I do not see why the Seanad would not have a look at it and make its own approach.  I advise Members to get their messages in.  It is all about making the CER accountable in a transparent way.  The role of the CER in its consultative role is about sustainable, secure and reliable water, fair charging, transparency and accountability.</p><p>Senator Denis Landy asked what happens when premises cannot be metered.  When conventional meter installation is not possible, alternative approaches will be considered.  An estimate of the amount of water consumed and wastewater discharged will calculated by the application of a formula in the water plan.  For the purposes of calculating charges, the amount of wastewater will be deemed to be equal to the amount of water supplied, unless otherwise engaged.  For example, if one is in a water processing industry or activity where water is taken out and used in the manufacturing process, there will be an agreement on that issue.  It will be fair and it will have to be seen as transparent.  Irish Water is undertaking a review of its approach to the second phase of metering, which will include apartments.  Many Members raised that issue.  I agree very much with Senator John Whelan.  Half of the people in Europe live in apartments, so what is the big deal?  Let us find out the best way to meter apartments and let us do it fairly to ensure everyone who can have a meter has one.</p><p>Disconnection is a key issue.  Nobody wants people to be cut off totally.  Everybody agrees it is a human rights issue to have access to water, but we cannot have people who can afford to pay but will not getting away with blue murder.  That cannot and will not happen.  The code of practice and protocols will have to be put in place and will have to be clear.  We will be able to discuss them in the House or the Seanad may wish to make suggestions or table amendments.  I advise Members to submit their arguments to the Department and get them into the system.</p><p>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill mentioned group water schemes.  Such schemes will continue to be completely separate from Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  There will be no connection between them.  If a group water scheme is on the public water supply, a charge is in place.  Its members already pay for water.  I do not know how it works in the case referred to by the Senator but I will get absolute clarity for him on what charges apply if a group water scheme is getting a public water supply.</p><p>I am not clear on the question about remote housing.  If one has one's own water supply in the country, that is one's own business.  If one does not discharge into a public sewer that is one's own business.  If one has one's own private water supply but one discharges into a public sewer, I presume one would have to pay for the pubic sewer discharge.  There will have to be total clarity, fairness and equity.  I refer the Senator to the consultative document from the CER.  It is important to keep one's eye on everything on that website.</p><p>My colleague, Senator Terry Brennan, has great expertise in metering in electricity and so on, and spent a lot of time looking after his constituents in a very effective way-----</p></speech>

We both agree that water poverty is a key issue that must be dealt with.  There must be fairness, equity and support the families who have low incomes and very high water usage.  There is no difference between us in our efforts to resolve those issues.  As far as I am aware, there is no issue on the privatisation of water.  That is covered by law.  I will not be a party nor will the Labour Party stand over the privatisation of the water system.  The water system is a total monopoly because in a country of our size, one could not have the provinces in competition with one another to provide water services.  That would not work and would be a disaster for critical infrastructure.</p><p>Notwithstanding the campaign the Senator's political party may have in this jurisdiction, the fact is that on average the cost in the North per household is &pound;1,200 for the services which his colleagues----</p></speech>

That deals with most of the points raised by Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh.</p><p>  I will now respond to Senator Whelan.  We must face the reality that we have a Victorian infrastructure.  There are cases where people must boil all water.  Senator Cummins mentioned that some years ago the people of Galway had no potable water for six months because it was contaminated by E.coli bacteria.  The only way we will have proper and safe water is by making the investment.  In respect of Garryhinch, I could not agree more with Senator Whelan and I suggest the Oireachtas Committee should invite Bord na M&oacute;na to discuss the proposal.  There is a deficit of knowledge about what is happening.  On one side of the country, people want Garryhinch and on the other side they do not want it.  We need to have a debate on Garryhinch.  I think both communities would benefit from examining the facts.</p><p>  The question of meeting the water requirements for Dublin is very important.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; raised the audit of infrastructure.  I understand the book value of the audit is &euro;11 billion, and is believed to be the book value of the assets of the water infrastructure nationally, but that has not been finally totted up.  That is the expectation.  We would not underestimate the massive task ahead.  While the legislation allows for the transfer of assets on 1 January, that will not be the way it happens because due diligence has to be done.  I raised a question about social infrastructure and some assets.  It is quite complex.  The Minister must sign off on each of them.  There will be no uisce faoi thalamh.</p><p>  The Senator also made the point about contacts with local representatives.  I could not agree more with him and I am concerned that the public is fully engaged in all of the conservation issues.  I want to see more of that engagement from Irish Water.  I welcome the fact that it has placed advertisements in the national media.</p><p>  Senator O'Neill made a very good case as well.  I agree with the points he made on Sinn F&eacute;in and transfers of accountability.  He also mentioned the &quot;Boil Notice&quot;.  I made the point earlier that one bottle of water costs &euro;2.50 but for the same amount one will get 1,000 litres from the public water supply.  That is great value for money.  The quality of the water that Glanbia uses means it can stand over the significant investment in its development.</p><p>  I have already referred to the contribution of Senator Maurice Cummins who raised the health issues in regard to the water in Galway and the supply issue in Dublin<b>.  </b>He also raised the issue of collection of water charges by Revenue.  It is not proposed that Revenue will collect the money.</p><p>  The water services plans must be transparent and open to comment by the public.  The local authorities will obviously have a major input as to what they think should be happening.  There must be buy in to local developments plans, local area plans, county plans, regional plans.  There must be joined-up thinking.</p><p>  There will be transparency on the question of the free allowance and affordability of water charges.</p></speech>

We will only get it right if we all work together and take the best of all the ideas from every side of the House to build a sustainable future for everybody, so that the young people sitting in the Visitors Gallery will have jobs in the future no matter where they live.  We need to ensure that all towns have the capacity to supply water to industry and that the health of the population is improved because there is less contamination of water by E.coli.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-04a.191" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1129" speakername="Susan O'Keeffe" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013120400029#FF00200"><p>I move:<blockquote><br />That Seanad &Eacute;ireann:- notes the Government's commitment to invest &euro;20 million in community-based, patient-centred mental health services in Budget 2014;<br />- welcomes the appointment of the new Mental Health Services Director;<br />- notes that the total commitment of this Government to mental health is &euro;90 million to the end of 2014;<br />- notes the recent publication of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013 to replace the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871;<br />- notes the changed awareness among the public about mental health and the greater openness around mental health;<br />- notes the increased demand for services in the past five years;<br />- notes the global research in relation to the predicted rise in dementia and Irish figures showing a predicted rise to 140,000 sufferers in the next thirty years;<br />- notes that research shows that, in line with international studies, an estimated 14% of the population has mental distress;<br />- notes that the Government's agreed mental health policy &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; supports community-based services which are managed and targeted at specific groups; andasks the Government to ensure that:- the community will remain central to the provision of mental health services into the future;<br />- the staffing levels will continue to be increased, especially in relation to suicide prevention;<br />- services for children and adolescents (CAMHS) be strengthened and accelerated; and<br />- the community-based teams will be strengthened to ensure the delivery of targeted services.</blockquote>  I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  We are here to take stock of the progress that has been made in mental health and to urge the Government to continue the commitment to the very serious challenges facing those with mental health problems and those responsible for the delivery of mental health care.  I know the Minister of State has a personal commitment to this, which is welcome and vital, but it is impossible for her to drive it forward all by herself.  The building and strengthening of commitment across the HSE is crucial to the future success of mental health care in this country but we are lucky to have an advocate like the Minister of State leading that charge.</p><p>  We have moved a long way from institutional care as the default position for those with mental health problems and issues.  A Vision for Change set out a very clear person-centred treatment approach with an integrated care plan literally looking after each person as an individual.  That is hardly rocket science as this is exactly what we provide for people with physical illnesses.  A Vision for Change remains an important shift in culture and attitudes towards people with mental health issues - a shift which had to be urged on and compressed in time as we become increasingly aware of our responsibilities to those with mental health issues.  It is a shift in attitude which the health services above all must accept and implement.  Statistics show the mountain that we must climb.  One in three people visiting a family doctor has a mental health aspect to their medical problem.  Of those who live to 65, one in nine will spend some time in mental health care.  Another way of putting it is that 14% of the population has some kind of mental health issue or that 43% of young adults said they had contemplated suicide at some point with 7% having made an attempt on their lives at some point.  </p><p>  There are many ways to provide statistics and increased statistical research is vital for the Minister of State's planning, the delivery of services and budgeting.  I am sure that over the years, the Minister of State has seen many pieces of research and many statistics but the important thing is that our friends, neighbours and family are suffering from mental health issues and it is up to us to respond to that.  I wonder if the numbers are rising as we become more open about mental health and more people feel able to seek help.  Will we see a bulge?  There are statistics showing calls to various helplines and mental health charities would all record some surge in people coming forward.  I wonder if this is in part due to that.  Perhaps that will settle at some point.  I am not sure.  It is up to all of us to own mental health, to be responsible, to talk and be open about it, to support those who have issues and problems and who are ill and to reduce the stigma and discrimination that have accompanied it.  I know the Sea Change programme, which is now in its third year, is continuing that work at a local level.  It encourages people to tell their own stories and trains people and organisations to understand at a very local and personal level and to be more aware of our mental health.</p><p>  The removal of institutional care and its replacement is a huge gear change in management, work, attitude and cost.  It is, of course, a cost to recruit new posts, train those already there, provide new services, tailor existing ones and step up care for those at risk of suicide.  We welcome the Government commitment of &euro;35 million  in the 2012 budget, a further &euro;35 million in 2013 and &euro;20 million in Budget 2014.  That is a total of &euro;90 million that is ring fenced to modernise mental health services and, in particular, to strengthen community teams which deliver those services.  </p><p>  There has been much public debate about the speed of recruitment to the posts in question.  That has caused an issue but we must always step back at this time and say that finding hundreds of people with the right mix of experience, skills and availability is never an easy task.  However, I am grateful for the Minister of State's reassurance that substantial progress has now been made in recruitment for these posts.  I see figures that show that the recruitment process is well on the way with 93% of the 414 posts that were approved in 2012 in place.  That is evidence of the hard work that has been done.  I trust that the HSE's national recruitment service will continue to prioritise these appointments as this is the best way to bring about the changes demanded by A Vision for Change and other research.  </p><p>  Senator Moran, who will be seconding this motion, will address child and adolescent mental health services.  One of the basic headlines there is the urgent need for children and young people not to be in adult units.  Again, there has been progress in that area but I see that some children are still in adult units and I know that is something none of us would wish to see continuing.  </p><p>  Primary care has received an allocation of &euro;7.5 million for counselling for people with mild to moderate psychological difficulties.  Again, this is a very practical approach.  There are ten councillor co-ordinators and I know the Minister of State and the Minister of State with responsibility for primary care, Deputy White, helped to launch this initiative earlier this year.  This is a very practical way of listening to people on the ground and asking what will work and how we can help.  These are the kind of services that often do not get talked about and it is opportunities like these that allow us to praise that work because it is appropriate.  </p><p>  Many of us here in the Seanad and many of our colleagues in the D&aacute;il have discussed and debated suicide, bullying and cyberbullying so I welcome the recent decision by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to launch the Internet Content Governance Advisory Group, which is the first such body specifically tackling the bullying of young people on-line and looking at content and how we safeguard it.  The Minister for Education and Skills often spoken about bullying.  I know that the guidelines for mental health promotion and suicide prevention were launched with the Minister of State earlier this year and there is a new action plan on bullying.  An anti-bullying forum centred around homophobic bullying was launched with the Minister of State and the Minister for Education and Skills.  </p><p>  Much work has been done involving small pieces of work which themselves are very significant and practical.  The National Office for Suicide Prevention continues with its various campaigns, some of which we have seen on television such as Let Someone Know, which is aimed at younger people aged under 18, and Please Talk, which is aimed at third-level colleges.  Again, these are the kind of practical things that people say they never hear being done.  Well they are being done, which is welcome.  The National Office for Suicide Prevention supports many local organisations such as Pieta House, the Samaritans, SpunOut, SOS and Inspire Ireland - organisations that are dedicated in this area.</p> <p>A local organisation, <i>talkaboutit.ie</i>, is active in Mayo and Sligo.  During the summer, representatives of that organisation took spaces at local festivals, among cattle, sheep, baking and flower arranging.  Their presence is a testament to the new attitude that our mental health is nothing to be afraid of, that it is certainly nothing to hide, and that it can take its place along with all other activities and become much more normal.  I pay credit to those sitting in tents for long hours waiting to talk to people and being there to remind us of the importance of our mental health.</p><p> We know young people are vulnerable.  We need to prioritise them and encourage them to be open about their mental health.  I pay tribute to the work of Comhairle na n&Oacute;g.  Many of its groups have done very good practical work in individual schools with their peers, raising awareness, discussing mental health and producing brochures and videos.  Again, this is small work but well placed.  The young people doing that work are valued.  Perhaps they are sometimes overlooked when we talk about the amazing amount of work that volunteers do.</p><p> The Minister of State was in the House for the debate on a previous Private Members' motion I tabled on a national strategy on Alzheimer's disease.  As she knows, 42,000 people have dementia and the number of sufferers is predicted to rise to 140,000 in the next 30 years.  I know she is in the consultation phase of the new programme for dementia and I look forward to that being published in the coming months.  The World Health Organization recently published a document calling on countries around the world to treat Alzheimer's disease as a public health priority.  Clearly, dementia patients have a very specific need.  There is considerable research into preventing dementia or finding appropriate treatment for dementia.  As the world's population ages - at least in the wealthy world - it brings the burden of this illness with it.  Regardless of how we legislate, as a society we must come to terms with these figures and calculate how we will pay for them because we and our children will be such sufferers in due course.  Irrespective of how good it might be, no strategy can possibly address that particular aspect.  Debate and conversation at this and at every other level will be vital in changing the kind of cultural prejudice and ignorance of those with a mental illness that existed and still exists to some extent.  We need to shake that off if we are to address those figures and try to do something about it.</p><p> I welcome the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill, which started its journey in the D&aacute;il yesterday.  It will provide a statutory framework to support decision-making by adults who find it difficult to make decisions without assistance.  How wonderful it is to be repealing Acts from the 19th century that use the language of lunatics and that in their very concept separated and, in effect, locked away those with mental illness.  Safeguarding the autonomy and dignity of those with impaired capacity is welcome.  I trust there will be a very robust and worthwhile debate on that legislation when it reaches the Seanad.</p><p> I know the Minister of State is looking forward to completing the review on the reform of the Mental Health Act 2001, a commitment given in the programme for Government.  People often say we do not keep promises.  However, the expert group has met on ten occasions and the heads of the Bill are being prepared.  I am sure we will also have robust debate on that.  That is a welcome reform and we are pleased with the progress on it.</p><p> The community of people working in the area of mental health - carers, nurses, doctors, policymakers, volunteers and patients - need a firm reassurance from the Minister of State and Government that the issue of mental health has turned a corner.  We still have problems and hurdles, and people are still waiting for treatment or may not be getting the right treatment.  That does not mean we are not making progress.  This community needs reassurance that the direction the Government is taking of patient-centred, community-based care delivered by well-trained teams is the way of the future and of the present.</p><p> There is no turning back.  Budgets will continue to be spent where they need to be spent, recruitment will continue to be a priority, the changes that have been hard won will be appreciated and built on, and the momentum kept up.  It is a difficult task made more difficult by the difficult times in which we find ourselves.  It will require perseverance and patience but our nation's health is at stake.  Ultimately, we are all responsible for that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-04a.193" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1174" speakername="Mary Moran" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013120400030#GG00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State, who is a regular visitor to the House.  I commend Senator O'Keeffe on bringing the motion to the House.  I second the motion.</p><p>We have had many discussions on mental health in the past two years.  I commend the Minister of State and the Government on the work that has been carried out and the promises that have been kept.  They include promises made before coming into government and the promises in the programme for Government.  I welcome the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill that is before the other House.  I attended a briefing by members of Inclusion Ireland who outlined how vital it is to give people the opportunity to make decisions where and when they possibly can in order that others are not making decisions for them when they are quite capable of making the decisions or perhaps just need to be assisted.</p><p>We have had debates on A Vision for Change and so forth.  I would like to focus on areas where I would like to see improvements.  First is the area of the inpatient child and adolescent services.  A Vision for Change recommended the provision of 80 child and adolescent psychiatric inpatient beds, whereas there are only 44 between Dublin, Cork and Galway, which is not enough as I have mentioned on several occasions in the House.  I know there will be an improvement in this.  It is very important that children and adults are not mixed.  I welcome the plan to phase that out, and although progress has been made in recent years, it has not been quick enough.  There is a huge gap in the provision for 16 to 18 year olds.  From my dealings with youth groups and people in statutory and non-statutory bodies working with young people of this age, it is clear this is of great concern.</p><p>When patients see a doctor, it is important they do not see a different doctor at each visit.  I understand that doctors may be on rotation, but continuity should be maintained as much as possible.</p><p>The link between statutory and non-statutory bodies is very important.  The HSE is carrying out excellent work.  In my area we have St. Brigid's and the Ladywell Centre in the community doing excellent work under the HSE.  The waiting lists are far too long, which is a problem everywhere and needs to be addressed.  A new mental health service facility will be available shortly in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure that will not encroach on the existing service in St. Brigid's.  It can be a long journey for people based in one end of the county to have to go to the far end of the county.  We need to consider that these are vulnerable people who may not able to able to make long journeys or who have become very used to where they are going.</p><p>I pay tribute to the work done by Comhairle na n&Oacute;g.  The Comhairle na n&Oacute;g in Louth has done tremendous work in the area.  Last year it produced an application highlighting the services available.  The young people are much more forthcoming in speaking about their mental health than we were at this stage.</p> <p>We talk about the improvements in mental health and that people are coming out but we have much to learn from those young people.</p><p>A Vision for Change contains a list of recommendations.  They are not obligations.  People are not obliged to accept them but we must ensure that schools take on the existing policies on mental health and suicide awareness because if they do not buy into them, they will be lost.  They are recommendations in A Vision for Change but we could go further.  We have an anti-bullying policy and a policy on the discipline problem but it is very important that we have a mental health policy for each school.</p><p>I mentioned previously to the Minister of State that a year ago in my area we had a public meeting in Dundalk of all the different agencies, statutory and non-statutory bodies and organisations providing services for people to promote positive mental health.  From a personal point of view it was good for me to become aware of the different groups, and I am sure I will omit to name some of them.  We have formed a forum where once a month somebody on the steering committee delivers a talk on this area.  There are many agencies and groups involved in the forum but within the steering committee we have members from SHINE, Grow, the Dundalk Outcomers, a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a member of the Health Service Executive, members of suicide awareness groups in Dundalk and a member of Comhairle na n&Oacute;g.  We have a representative of every aspect of society who delivers talks on this area but it is amazing the amount of information each of us individually and each of the bodies have fed into one another, so to speak, in that they were not fully aware of the service the other was providing.  Once a month we have a talk on cyberbullying or suicide awareness.  We did the SafeTALK.  Last Monday we did one on coping with adolescent anger, which is a major problem for many young people who do not even realise that what they are feeling is perfectly normal but who become concerned and believe they have a mental health problem.  Those talks were very well attended, and it does not cost money to hold them.  Funding is not required.  We simply meet to try to promote positive mental health.  That is a cost effective way we can help to improve the mental health services in our community.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-04a.195" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1149" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013120400031#HH00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank her for making herself available again.  I commend the Labour Party group for bringing forward this motion, which we will not be opposing.  I am glad to have the opportunity to highlight some issues in this area about which we have concerns.</p><p>Of all the jobs of the Ministers of State, I would hate to have the Minister's job.  There is no better person for the job than her good self but it very difficult because we know there is so much that needs to be done.  </p><p>I must now criticise the Minister of State's colleagues by stating that mental health is the poor relation when it comes to budgeting.  If &euro;30 million is needed, it will be taken either from the Minister of State's budget or she will be last to get it.  That is fundamentally wrong and it is a failing of all Governments over the years, not just this one.  That will be the constant challenge facing the Minister of State.  I wish I could go around to Merrion Street and pull out &euro;100 million for her budget.  There has not been such cross-party unity on a policy like A Vision for Change.  It is a sad state of affairs when we know so much of what needs to be done and we are not capable of doing it because of money.  A councillor in Sligo had a saying that the stones on the road know what needs to be done.  It is just a case of getting out and doing it.  </p><p>As matters stand, a great deal of excellent work is being done in isolation in trying to tackle the many challenges in this area.  As John Saunders, the chairman of the Mental Health Commission, said, what we have in many instances is football teams with only half their players.  Senator O'Keeffe said that while there are difficulties in securing enough qualified people as quickly as we might like, and I know that some progress is being made on that, what is unforgivable on the funding side is this &euro;35 million, which seems to be the first service to be targeted every year.  I promise not to be political in this debate but I read a comment that the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, complained bitterly and colourfully about being kept in the dark on her own budgets.  I agree and I can imagine that happening.  The point is that it is the first funding to be taken.  </p><p>The commitment for 2014 in the budget is &euro;20 million, which is 42% less than the &euro;35 million allocation.  A commitment has been given that this gap will be made up in 2015.  Does that mean that provision will be &euro;50 million in 2015?  Has the Minister of State a commitment on the ring-fencing of this funding or will it be the case that when the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, is nursing whatever deficit there will be this time next year, that &euro;35 million allocation will be the first taken and the issues that arise in terms of the implementation of A Vision of Change will be put on the back burner once again because they are seen by so many as expendable.  Its implementation is seen as a slow burn, step-by-step exercise and we fool ourselves into thinking we are moving in the right direction, but Rome was not built in a day.</p><p>The stigma associated with mental health is a major issue.  Senator O'Keeffe said that one in three people who go to a GP attend for a mental health issue, but one in four of all of us will have a mental health issue in our lives.  I have had a mental health issue.  One in three of us hyperventilate or have panic attacks.  Effectively, they signify mental distress and for many people that distress brings on such attacks.  One in 20 of us will have suicidal thoughts.  If I am filling out a form and I see a question asking if I have ever taken medication for depression, I find that offensive.  What way is the answer to that question interpreted by people?  What way is it taken into consideration when it comes to giving a person a job or in terms of the attitude taken towards the individual concerned?  </p><p>In other debates I have highlighted a survey of Deputies taken two or three years ago by a marketing company.  I cannot remember the broad purpose of the survey but one of the questions related to mental health and whether people with depression ought to have children, and 70% thought that they should not.  That was the view of Deputies taken in a survey in the past three years.  What hope have we got in changing the stigma surrounding this issue when we, the legislators, seem to have the view that if somebody is suffering from depression, ideally that person should not have children?  It gives a picture of how steep the cliff is that we have to get up in terms of changing the view of mental health and getting and encouraging people to talk.  The advertisements on television some years ago were very good in that they encouraged people to mind their mental health.  Whether it is depression, the 'flu, arthritis or panic attacks, there are solutions to those problems and we must get that message out to the public.  As both Senators mentioned, excellent groups are doing excellent work throughout the country but in isolation.  We are not connecting the dots.</p><p>On the issue of suicide, Actions Speak Louder than Words was our Fianna F&aacute;il document into which we put seven months work.</p> <p>Senator John Gilroy has also done a great deal of good work in this area.  Our document, which includes a range of useful proposals, was welcomed by the Minister of State's office.  Everything is costed, with a total estimate of &euro;90 million as the required funding to reduce the incidence of suicide by 30%.  The problem, of course, is that there are 15 people at the Cabinet table seeking to lay claim to any moneys that are available long before they get to the Minister of State.  As well as bringing forward legislation in this House to implement our proposals, as we intend to do in due course, we have also given consideration to how they might be funded.  It is a question of seeking to harness the goodwill that exists among people who are effectively enjoying themselves as opposed to levying people who are selling alcohol.  That touches on the whole off-sales area.  Our proposal in this regard would bring in &euro;150 million per annum.  Given our estimate of a requirement for &euro;90 million in funding specifically for suicide prevention, that would leave use with &euro;60 million for the implementation of a A Vision for Change.  In order to implement those measures, we need political will and leadership from the Taoiseach and his Cabinet.</p><p>Between now and this day week, eight men will have taken their lives.  I will do everything I can, both inside and outside politics, to see the measures set out in our document implemented by whichever Government or series of Governments will do so.  A very courageous young man called Brian McCann assisted with the research into the document to which I referred.  Sadly, he lost his life in tragic circumstances a fortnight ago in Sligo, aged just 24.  That has made me refocus my efforts to impress upon whomever is in government or has authority in this area to do something other than pay lip service to the need to reduce the incidence of suicide.  The capital budget of the National Office for Suicide Prevention has not been spent in its entirety in 2013.  Yet, as we saw during the course of our research, many schools have no suicide prevention policy, while those which do, in most cases, drew them up without any contact with the National Office for Suicide Prevention.</p><p>I will not go through all the measures set out in the document as it is available to Members.  I wish the Minister of State well in her endeavours and we do not intend to oppose the motion.  She will always have our co-operation to make progress in this area.  I urge her, however, to fight harder for resources, because it is a lack of resources that is ultimately holding back progress.  There can be no better person than the Minister of State in her role and she is doing a great job in very difficult circumstances.</p></speech>

I assure Senator Marc MacSharry, as someone from the same constituency as the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, that she is well able to fight her corner.  I have no doubt whatsoever that she will secure every possible cent for this area of the health care budget.</p><p>  I propose to focus on one aspect of the motion, namely, services for people with dementia.  It is an issue that will assume greater prominence in the coming years.  In fact, according to Health Service Executive estimates, the number of people in Ireland suffering from dementia will increase from its current level of more than 40,000 to 100,000 plus by 2036.  Advances in health care, better nutrition, improved working conditions and a reduction in poverty have all contributed to people living longer and generally healthier lives.  Arising from these welcome developments is an ever increasing cohort of aging people.  Unfortunately, one of the unforeseen consequences of improved health care, better social conditions and longer lives is a very significant increase in dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease.  While dementia should never be seen as a normal part of ageing, it is a risk factor for many.</p><p>  As defined by the World Health Organization, dementia is a syndrome, usually of a chronic or progressive nature, caused by a variety of brain illnesses that affect a person's memory, thinking, behaviour and ability to perform everyday activities.  Some 60% to 70% of dementia patients have Alzheimer's disease.  Symptoms vary from the mild to the very extreme and the prognosis can vary considerably from person to person.  A recent article in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> estimates that the prevalence of dementia in the over 70s is of the order of 14.7%.</p><p>  In Ireland, Central Statistics Office population projections show that the number of people over the age of 65 is set to rise from its current level of 550,000 to 1.3 million or more by 2041.  During the same period, the number of people aged 80 or over is projected to increase from some 71,000 to 257,000.  Enhanced longevity increases the risk of contracting dementia.  In fact, international studies indicate that the number of people with Alzheimer's disease doubles for every five-year interval past the age of 65.  Dementia is a deep personal affliction for sufferers.  Moreover, huge emotional, psychological and financial stress is often placed on the family members who care for them.  According to HSE figures, 40% of people with dementia are in residential care, while just over 40% are cared for by family members.  In addition, at any one time, 18% of acute hospital beds are occupied by people with dementia.  This latter figure is an indication that there are gaps in the care provision for patients with dementia.  The WHO report also draws attention to the need to have a legislative framework for people with dementia to ensure their personal dignity and rights are protected.</p><p>  In the programme for Government we undertook to develop a national Alzheimer's disease and dementia strategy by 2013 to increase awareness, ensure early diagnosis and intervention, and facilitate the development of enhanced community-based services.  A commitment was given to implement the strategy over five years.  We all acknowledge that the Minister of State is doing a great deal of work in this regard.  Likewise, the HSE is making significant progress in the area of training and community support.  It is imperative, however, that the Government should move decisively to develop the promised strategy on dementia.  Several organisations, including the Alzheimer Society of Ireland, have made excellent submissions on this issue.  As the WHO points out, people with dementia and their caregivers often have unique insights into their condition.  They should be involved in formulating the policies, health plans, laws and services that relate to them.  The strategy must focus on prevention, early detection, patient care, treatment protocols and research.</p><p>  Ireland should begin to take a lead in the medical treatment of dementia, research into its causes and new drug treatments.  The time has come for the Government to establish a national institute for dementia modelled on the various institutes assembled under the umbrella of the National Institutes of Health in the United States.  This body should be part-funded by the State, with additional funding potentially being sourced from the EU's Horizon 2020 research programme.  In fact, a specific portion of the research budget should be devoted to health, demographic change and well-being.  In addition, there are many wealthy individuals in this country who might be persuaded to support such an institute.  Dementia is an international health issue that is growing in magnitude.  The WHO estimates that caring for people with dementia has a global cost of more than $600 billion per annum.  An Irish institute devoted exclusively to this major health issue could soon become a centre of excellence, attracting international funding and expertise.</p><p>  There is still some residual stigma attached to dementia which must be tackled.  Dementia is a real and gathering challenge to us all.  As the number with dementia grows, resources will be stretched.  We must not ignore the challenge, however, because it will not go away.  Instead, we must face it with determination and resolve and, above all, with compassion for those directly affected and those caring for them.  I thank the Minister of State for the work she is doing in the area of mental health care.  Now is the time for us to work together in developing new policies and strategies for dealing with this issue of national concern.</p><p>  I will conclude by referring to a particular issue of concern.  Many hospitals are using a tracking device to ensure dementia patients who move away from their own ward can be easily located.  As I said, more than 40,000 people in this country have dementia.  We should give serious consideration to developing a national scheme whereby such devices would be made available to all people with dementia, particularly those residing at home.</p> <p>I am talking in particular about people who have the early signs of dementia.  It is a huge concern for families.  In a recent case in Dublin, a lady was missing for two days before she was located.  We should look at this issue from a national point of view.  We should encourage families to get involved in the strategy.  It might be helpful for the HSE to organise a competition for the design of the roll-out and implementation of this strategy.  That is something we should look at.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-04a.199" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="15:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013120400033#KK00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State.  I commend the Senators who have tabled the motion before the House.  This is a major issue in society.  I look forward to hearing from Senator Gilroy, who has much more expertise in this area than I do.  The thoughts I am expressing come from outside the system.  As Dr. Eoin O'Sullivan of Trinity College has pointed out, this State inherited an amazing institutional structure for mental illness in massive concentrations in places like Grangegorman, the Lee Fields in Cork, Portrane, Portlaoise, Mullingar, Ballinasloe and Castlebar.  Dr. O'Sullivan has suggested that the British Government, almost as an experiment, decided to see whether the problems of society could be solved by locking up as many people as possible.  People used mental illness as a way of getting rid of rivals to inherit farms or people to whom they did not want their families to be related.  We committed many people, out of all proportion to the size of our population.</p><p>I suggest that Irish society has not really come to terms with this cruel episode.  We blame churches for the way children were institutionalised, but many adults were institutionalised without any assistance from churches or anybody else who could be blamed.  Researchers have found that people were institutionalised in Ireland to a degree that is unparalleled anywhere.  That is the system the Minister of State is belatedly seeking to dismantle.  I think she has our support in her endeavours.  Mental illness became a major industry in certain towns.  The manner in which people committed their relatives in such numbers to institutions from which they would never emerge shows us the dysfunctionality of Irish society at that time.  Books have been written by people who were committed in Mullingar even though they were perfectly able to function.  They could not get out because the certification of the doctors who put them in there needed to be undone.  We cannot escape from this shameful episode in Irish history.  We have tried to brush it under many carpets.  I commend the Minister of State on her attempts to dismantle the institutional structure to which I refer.</p><p>I would like to comment on some of the things we see now.  I wonder whether it is time to ban electroconvulsive therapy altogether.  I believe the scientific basis for it is most unsound.  Anyone who has seen movies like &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest&quot;, or who knows someone who has had this treatment, will wonder what we are thinking when we put big charges of electricity through people's heads.  I hope it is on the way out.  The Minister of State will certainly have my support if her intention is to ban it.  The science is unknown.  Drug therapy is another way of anaesthetising people into a zombie-like state and subduing them so they do not ask awkward questions, shout or generally enjoy themselves.  The experts tell me that we base too little of our approach on talking to patients and too much of our approach on drugging them into some kind of submission.  I support everything that has been said about the need for prevention and detention.</p><p>I wish to speak about the underlying causes of mental illness.  I was struck by the pessimistic reference in the motion to &quot;global research in relation to the predicted rise in dementia and Irish figures showing a predicted rise to 140,000 sufferers in the next thirty years&quot;.  I think we should take up the challenge of ensuring that figure never gets anywhere near 140,000.  Economics is known as the dismal science, but the utterances of economists are positively cheerful by comparison with the unending stream of gloom that comes into this society from the media on a daily basis.  People should reflect on how much gloom they need.  Economists draw attention to things so that we will solve them - that is our optimism.  I wonder whether the unending gloom in the media is causing the increase in mental health problems.  Do we help families enough?  I refer to dealings with children and between spouses.  Do we know how to relate to old people?  I think it would be extremely pessimistic to write off 140,000 people without taking positive health measures aimed at ensuring they do not end up in that kind of situation.</p><p>I know the Minister of State is a reforming person who wants to change things.  The system of incarceration, drugs and electric treatment has long ceased to commend itself to anyone in this House.  The Minister of State's attempts to replace it with something more humane, more effective and of more spiritual value to society deserve our support.  When institutions are in place in Ireland, it is a hell of a difficult job to try to dismantle them and move onto something new.  I hope the Minister of State will have some success in this case.  I commend the Senators who tabled this motion.  I have nothing further to add because I am anticipating what Senator Gilroy will say.  He has experience in his life of the topics discussed in this motion.  As the Minister of State said, one of the great things about the Seanad is that its Members come from so many different backgrounds.  Every time I come to this House, I learn something new.  I have learned something in this debate.  The Minister of State is always very welcome.  I look forward to hearing the views of someone like Senator Gilroy who has actually been there.</p></speech>

Perhaps I should tear up this script and make up something else.</p><p>I started to work as a psychiatric nurse in 1984, which was the year in which a policy document, Planning for the Future, was published with great fanfare.  The main provision in the document was a proposal to close this country's old-style institutions.  When I started working in Our Lady's Hospital in Cork, it housed over 1,000 patients.  Senator Barrett used the word &quot;incarceration&quot;, which is a good word because that is exactly what is involved.  This country has been very good at locking people up in a range of institutions, including mental institutions.  There seems to be something in our culture that means our first response is to remove a problem from before our very eyes in the hope that it will go away.</p><p>I am not criticising the Minister of State when I compare the position when the 1984 document was launched to the position that obtains today.  I am very critical of mental health services but I hope nobody interprets that as a criticism of the Minister of State, who has been landed with an enormous legacy issue and is demonstrably interested in reform.  It is a living scandal in our society that, as of 31 January last, some 394 people are still living in old-style institutions, many of which have been described by the independent group that monitors A Vision for Change as hardly fit for purpose.  While there has been a great reduction in that number from the time I joined the mental health service as a young fellow, I think it is a scandal that almost 400 people are living in institutions in 2013.</p><p>A few years ago, I was involved in a literature review of international mental health policies that looked at the policies in the UK, France and many other countries.  The review found that A Vision for Change stood out among all documents that had been published at that time.  It must be supported because it is an excellent template for the provision of an integrated, world-class, modern, effective and humane mental health policy.  This country is sometimes not very good at drawing up policies in this area and many other areas.  We sometimes feel that if we feed in policy at the top, it will come out oven-ready at the bottom.  We need to remember that it needs to be mediated at every level in between.  I am glad that when A Vision for Change was published in 2006, an independent monitoring group was put in place in March of the same year to report on its implementation on an annual basis, or as close as possible to that, and ensure the policy is effective.  A Vision for Change is not without its faults.  In 2006, the independent monitoring group criticised the piecemeal and slow implementation rate.  In 2012, it was equally critical of the inconsistent and slow implementation of the recommendations in the document.</p><p>We have concentrated on funding issues during this debate.  I commend the Minister of State for protecting and increasing the funding that is spent on mental health last year and the previous year.</p> <p>There have been some delays in recruitment but this is understandable because of the great difficulty in matching the service to the job and to the geography and the other matches that are required.  We are well on the way to achieving the very ambitious targets and standards set by the Minister of State.</p><p>Strange to say, but funding issues are probably not the most important issues in the mental health service.  There are cultural and structural issues to face before we can really make progress in delivering a proper mental health service.  One aspect is the paternalistic approach of many senior clinicians in the service.  Treatments are handed down from the top.  Although the A Vision for Change strategy states that the treatment must be patient-centred, very often it is not.  I know this is the case because I was a practising psychiatric nurse until two years ago when I came to this House and I have seen such treatment at first-hand.  I am concerned that when community services are developed and institutions are closed there is a real danger that we might move the institutional mindset into the community and replicate the mindset of the institution in the community services.  There is a danger that treatments and services are not patient-focused.</p><p>One of my bugbears is the post code lottery associated with mental health services and I hope the Minister of State will comment when she replies.  It is the only part of the health service where a person's address determines the level of treatment in the public service.  For instance, if I suffer from mental health difficulties in Glanmire, my catchment area is North Lee in Cork and if my clinician is an excellent clinician in North Lee then I am very fortunate.  However, I will only be half happy and half lucky because my clinician also needs to be an excellent manager.  If he fails to be an excellent manager I will not get the best treatment possible.  This post code lottery is not acceptable.  There is no way we can determine the locations of the good and bad practices - or the where the good practice is not - which may be a better way of saying it.  If patients were allowed freedom of choice, very soon it would be obvious that the best clinicians and best service would attract the most patients.</p></speech>

I accept it may result in too many patients in one service but it is a good thing that more people would be seen by the better services.  There is no method for knowing where are the good and bad practices.</p><p>I am rapporteur for suicide prevention on the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  I will be bringing a report to the committee and to the Minister of State some time in the new year.  Some of the recommendations will challenge existing presumptions on what is the best way forward.  I know the Minister of State, as a reforming Minister, will be receptive to this report and I look forward to discussing it with her.  </p><p>I could speak on the subject of mental health all day but it may be better to make those points I have made rather than trying to fit in 1 million points I would like to make.  I ask the Minister of State to give me some of her thoughts on what I call the post code lottery in mental health services.</p></speech>

I commend my colleagues, Senator O'Keeffe and Moran, for proposing and seconding this motion on behalf of the Labour Party Senators.  I am delighted the motion has cross-party support because such a topic deserves our support.  It acknowledges the Government's commitment to work on mental health services and to improve the provision of such services.  I commend the Minister of State for her very clear commitment to these issues and for her achievements in securing funding for mental health services.  The statistics speak for themselves.  Other speakers have referred to the commitments already made, such as the following: in 2012, a special measures package worth &euro;35 million, including the approval of 414 posts; in 2013, a further &euro;35 million and 477 posts, for which recruitment is continuing; and in 2014, a further &euro;20 million will be ring-fenced, with approximately 250 to 280 additional staff to be provided.</p><p>  The motion also refers to other developments and achievements.  I refer in particular to the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill which has recently been published and is long-awaited.  As a member of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, I participated in the hearings with a range of different groups and individuals.  We also worked with the Law Reform Commission which has carried out important research in this area.  The Bill will replace the very dated current system based on 1811 and 1871 legislation which refer to lunacy and the wards of court system which denies all sorts of decision-making capacity to the person to whom it applies.  The new Bill has been the subject of immense consultation and negotiation and I predict the debates will be good.  This Bill is a very important achievement of this Government in the area of mental health.  </p><p>  Previous speakers have referred to other developments such as the recent important announcement by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, about cyberbullying.  The Law Reform Commission in its programme for law reform is committed to examining cyberbullying in the context of other forms of cyber crime. It is well known that cyberbullying has had a very damaging effect on the mental health of young people in particular, as evidenced by very tragic cases.  Senator Gilroy spoke about suicide prevention strategies which must also focus on bullying and cyberbullying.  Senator Moran noted that the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, has initiated some very important anti-bullying strategies in schools which focus in particular on homophobic bullying which is a real issue for many children.</p><p>  I spoke this morning at an event organised by the National Women's Council on violence against women.  The Law Reform Commission came in for some criticism by Women's Aid on a related topic.  Although the Law Reform Commission intends to examine cyberbullying, it did not see the need for a reform of the law on stalking.  This is unfortunate because stalking is at the extreme end of bullying and there have been some serious instances of this behaviour.  The current legislation is the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 provides for an offence of harassment but it is a very difficult offence to prosecute because a very high level of proof is required, nor does it cover the cyberbullying element of stalking which is carried out on social media.  I suggest this could be reviewed or revisited.</p><p>  Other speakers have also referred to aspects of the motion dealing with the implementation of the strategy A Vision For Change and issues such as services for children and adolescents and the Government's Alzheimer's disease and dementia strategy, the suicide prevention strategies and the Sea Change campaign, for example.</p><p>  I wish to return to a matter raised by Senator O'Keeffe which underlies all of these different measures and initiatives, namely, the move from institutional care to care in the community for persons with mental health issues.  This has been the subject of an important recent publication by a colleague of mine who works in the Trinity school of nursing, Dr. Damien Brennan.  The Minister of State may be familiar with his book, <i>Irish Insanity:1800 - 2000.  </i>Dr. Brennan has carried out a comprehensive study which demonstrates the scandal of incarceration over two centuries of persons with mental illness.  I was privileged to attend the launch of the book at which he spoke about the scandal which is much greater in scale than the scandal of the industrial schools and the Magdalen institutions but a scandal of that nature, none the less.  For very many decades, and particularly in the 20th century after independence, this State incarcerated persons with mental illness in very damaging and what we would now regard as very abusive conditions, for long periods of time and in much greater numbers than were incarcerated in our prisons.  The prison statistics for the 1950s and 1960s show that Ireland had very low levels of imprisonment but there were extremely high levels of persons incarcerated in psychiatric institutions - State-run institutions - during those periods.  It is very interesting to note the management and the control of those institutions which were State-run rather than institutions managed by religious orders or other groups.  There is a great deal of research work to be done to uncover the figures and the human stories behind those experiences.</p><p>  The Minister of State this morning launched a report on women and the criminal justice system and the incarceration of women produced by the Irish Penal Reform Trust.  This report reiterates the theme of the need to move from incarceration to community care.  We have made that move, happily, for persons with mental illness and psychiatric health issues. </p> <p>This is an important theme running through A Vision for Change and all of the initiatives that have been taken, but we still incarcerate too many people with mental health problems in our prisons.  The position paper that the Minister of State launched today highlighted this.</p><p>Given the large number of female offenders, our two women's prisons - one in Limerick and the D&oacute;chas Centre in Dublin - are chronically overcrowded.  We are incarcerating women with mental health problems.  A 2005 study found that 60% of sentenced women prisoners that year had lifetime histories of mental illness.  Other research on the imprisonment of Irish women shows high levels of self-harm, substance abuse and addiction difficulties, yet we continue to incarcerate them.  Some diversion initiatives are useful, but it is time that we consider a more comprehensive programme of decarceration of women prisoners, particularly those with mental health issues.  I am taken with the first recommendation of the report of the Irish Penal Reform Trust, IPRT, which the Minister of State will have seen today.  It pointed out that, where women offenders had mental health problems, the earlier the point of mental health intervention, the better.  Consideration should be given to amending the existing legislative framework to provide for the diversion of those with mental illness who have committed minor offences to community inpatient or outpatient facilities by specialist mental health courts.</p><p>Professor Harry Kennedy of the Central Mental Hospital has set up an innovative and effective diversion programme for prisoners with mental health difficulties.  Clearly, there is a high need for this among the female prisoner population.  The proposal has considerable merit.</p><p>If we are discussing a move from incarceration to community care for people with psychiatric illnesses, we should also do the same for prisoners with such illnesses, particularly those committed - as the majority of women prisoners are - for non-violent minor offences.</p></speech>

It is not the first time that she has attended to discuss this issue.  When she was appointed as Minister of State, our debate on mental health was one of our first engagements with her.  She outlined her vision of moving from the old-style institutional care to community care settings.  I commend her on delivering on some of that vision.  I also commend the Labour Senators on tabling this Private Members' motion, as it gives us an opportunity to discuss this important issue.  I have one problem with the motion.  We did not table an amendment, but I will get to that in a few minutes.</p><p>Against a backdrop of continuing recession, the mental health of Ireland's population is under severe strain.  Research shows that unemployment and income inequality are major contributing factors to poor mental health and go some way towards explaining the rise in the rates of suicide and self-harm reported in recent years.</p><p>I listened to a radio programme in Waterford a number of months ago.  A local general practitioner, GP, who is a friend of mine and is active in the field of positive mental health and well being, talked about a tsunami of people attending his clinic suffering all sorts of mental health issues.  Obviously, there is some link with the economy.</p><p>I am sure the Minister of State agrees that the Government has a duty to protect the vulnerable in society and must ensure that the already negative effects of the economic crisis are not exacerbated by the lack of services for people experiencing poor mental health.  Therefore, I welcome today's motion and fully support the call for the continued resourcing of community mental health services, increased staffing levels in suicide prevention services and a strengthening and acceleration of services for children and adolescents.</p><p>The first part of the motion is self-congratulatory in its language and tone, which does not sit with some of the Government's commitments in the programme for Government to patient-centred mental health services.  I must point out some of the differences and failures.  The programme contained a commitment to &quot;vastly improving access to modern mental health services in the community&quot; in line with the recommendations of the mental health policy, A Vision for Change.  A further commitment was given to ring-fence &euro;35 million annually for the development of community mental health services.  This has been cut by &euro;15 million, yet the motion states: &quot;the Government's commitment to invest &euro;20 million in community-based, patient-centred mental health services in Budget 2014.&quot;  The reality, as outlined by the campaign group Mental Health Reform, is that few appointments have been made since 2012 to staff community mental health teams.  In recent correspondence to my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, who is our national health spokesperson, the HSE confirmed that, of the 477 posts allocated in 2013, as and from 30 September - unless there has been a change, in which case the Minister of State might give the House the information if she has it - the recruitment process had only been completed for 4% of those posts.  In the context of a gap of more than 1,500 staff in community mental health services, there is an urgent need to fulfil the promised investment.</p></speech>

Ireland's mental health services are in a time of positive transition, as we are moving from the old institutional model of hospital-based care to a new one of holistic, community-based services.  This is not just in the case of mental health, but also elderly care and ensuring home care as a first priority.  I support the Government in any move it takes towards more holistic, community-based services.</p><p>Notwithstanding the country's economic problems, it is crucial that the Government's commitment to reforming mental health does not waver.  Important structural and cultural changes are under way, but any further cut to the mental health budget risks undermining the work already done.  Mental Health Reform urges the Government to invest in the reform of Ireland's mental health services and support for people experiencing poor mental health.  My party has called on the Government to invest in comprehensive, holistic, community-based mental health services, including an additional allocation of &euro;35 million in 2014, as promised in the programme for Government, and an investment in governance structures to support the implementation of A Vision for Change, including resourcing support for the director for mental health.  We also want to ensure that there are no further cuts to funding for mental health and related voluntary and community organisations.</p><p>It is important to ensure that there is no reduction in the living standards of people with mental health conditions who are in receipt of social welfare payments.  This can be done by maintaining rates at their current levels, reducing the individual minimum contribution for rent supplement and restoring the fuel allowance cuts made in 2012.  We also call on the Government to restore the incentive for participants in receipt of disability benefits to undertake community employment, CE, schemes by providing a &euro;50 per week payment, as is already provided to participants in JobBridge.  The Government should reconsider introducing a requirement for employers to contribute to illness benefit.</p><p>We must ensure funding for the mental health actions in the housing strategy for people with disabilities and implementation plan.  My party has called for an allocation of &euro;1 million to support the transition of people with low to medium needs from HSE mental health facilities to local authority social housing.</p><p>A range of measures can and should be taken by the Government.  Deputy Kathleen Lynch is a reforming Minister of State and has done much work in this field, but as with any area of governance, more can and should be done.  I commend the Labour Senators on tabling this motion and I thank the Minister of State for listening to our contributions.</p></speech>

I thank my Labour colleagues for tabling this motion and giving us an opportunity to debate this important issue.</p><p>We all support the Minister of State in her efforts to secure more investment for mental health services, given the significant increase in mental health problems throughout our country, including the increase in suicide rates.</p> <p> I come from the town of Ballinasloe which had a large institution that at one time had close to 2,000 patients.  I pay tribute to the staff who worked in that hospital over the years.  They gave dedicated service, care and love to people in that institution, many of whom should never have been there.  Thankfully, today most of those people are happily living in the community and their lives have been enriched as a result.  They receive a service from the HSE and its dedicated staff who continue to care for them in the community.  Thanks are also due to the enlightened consultants who were attached to that hospital over the years.  As a result of following the concept of A Vision for Change, east Galway's mental health services are second to none and the envy of many other parts of the country.  Those services include the provision of some acute beds at St. Brigid's Hospital in Ballinasloe.</p><p>As the Minister of State knows, the HSE is in the process of reconfiguring services in Roscommon and Galway to improve the community element of the service, which I support.  The HSE is proposing to close acute beds in Ballinasloe while keeping beds open in Roscommon.  I am concerned because having recently spent &euro;2.8 million creating a state-of-the-art facility in St. Brigid's Hospital, Ballinasloe, the HSE proposes to close it.  A scoring system was used by the HSE to decide whether the beds in St. Brigid's or those in Roscommon would remain open.  There is grave concern in the community about the credibility of that scoring process.</p><p>Roscommon hospital no longer has an accident and emergency unit.  It is an 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. hospital which provides a much lower level of acute and chronic care services.  On the other hand, Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe provides a 24 hour service with many more consultants working in medicine and surgery.  In addition, its consultants specialise in heart disease, diabetes, geriatric care and lung disorders.  That range of services is not provided in Roscommon hospital, yet when it came to the score sheet, Roscommon scored ten points and Portiuncula Hospital, which is approximately one mile from the St. Brigid's Hospital campus, scored three.  Obviously, the question of being adjacent to a major regional hospital comes into consideration.</p><p>On behalf of the community, I am asking the Minister of State to request the HSE to revisit that element of what is proposed in the HSE's plan for community services.  There was virtually no difference in the scores of both hospitals in terms of mental health care provision.  Those scores are inexplicable as east Galway mental care services have been able to implement substantially the 2006 recommendations on mental health policy in A Vision for Change.  The Roscommon mental health service, by comparison, has become more institutional with staff being transferred from the community to the hospital, which is contrary to the direction envisaged in A Vision for Change.  This is confirmed by the fact that the Roscommon unit has a higher level of patient admission, approximately 498 per 100,000, whereas St. Brigid's admits 256 per 100,000.  It is second only to the Cavan-Monaghan region which is managed by the eminent psychiatrist, Dr. John Owens, who was the author of A Vision for Change.  </p><p>People in east Galway also want to be assured that the resources required to deliver the promised community service will be made available.  They are concerned that vacant posts will not be filled in time to coincide with the closure of beds at St. Brigid's Hospital.  The situation is causing much angst in the community.  I have attended two large public meetings there recently where the rating system was called into question.  If that scoring system is not credible, it undermines the good work the HSE is attempting to do.</p><p>I am somewhat critical of the HSE's communications strategy and how this message was delivered in this case.  Initially there was a lot of doubt and people got the story incrementally, which caused local concern.  The residential beds element of the HSE's proposal should be re-examined.  Many professionals in the east Galway mental health services feel that the best facility for the provision of acute beds is the recently refurbished unit at St. Brigid's Hospital.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-04a.213" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1147" speakername="John Crown" time="15:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013120400036#NN00200"><p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  I was just doing the sad little mental arithmetic on this and, without putting too much effort into it, I can think of 12 people I knew who died as a result of self-harm as a consequence of mental illness over the years.  A couple of them were cancer patients.  Three or four of them were health workers who worked in the cancer area as doctors or nurses.  Others were people I knew socially, including family members.  This is a serious problem and I am delighted that so much attention is being focused on trying to reform the way we deal with it.</p><p>There is a transition phase when a modernisation process occurs, when we move from what is clearly and demonstrably the wrong way of doing things - as in the past with the incarceration and isolation model, which was a sort of leper colony approach to mental health care - to a more modern community-based approach.  The danger is that as that transition is taking place, for all the deficiencies that existed in the old service as it is withdrawn, and before fully funded and adequate services are put in to replace it with a more modern community-type of approach, a huge hiatus can develop where there is no service.</p><p>I sometimes think that the Ballinasloe-Ahascragh triangle must be the epicentre of all public discourse in this country.  I worked in Ballinasloe for six months and we provided the medical service in Portiuncula, a fine general hospital, for the patients from St. Brigid's psychiatric facility if they became unwell.  I have two points to make about that.  If psychiatric patients need to be in hospital, it makes sense that the hospital should also be part of a general hospital campus.  We have had much discussion recently about co-location, bi-location and tri-location, but the idea used to be that psychiatric illnesses were treated in an entirely different kind of hospital.  Talk therapy and support therapy are great, but some people need medical care for what happens when they are psychiatrically unwell.  It tended to deprofessionalise the context of what was happening to these patients and somehow put them on a different plane from patients with more physical illnesses.  In truth, however, most illnesses - psychiatric or otherwise - ultimately have some physical basis.  I urge that great care be taken in the transition.  We should be as enthusiastic in building up the new services as we are in closing the old ones, and there should be a match.</p><p>Getting back to the Ballinasloe model, I always remember one elderly gentleman who had grown up somewhere in Connemara.  At an early age, as was the sad custom in those days, he emigrated to England where he worked in the canning factories near Bristol together with a group of other lads who had emigrated from his town.  Over the years they never came back.</p> <p>They may have returned once.  Interestingly, 40 or 50 years later at the time of retirement they were still speaking Irish to one another.  They had formed a little micro-society and were more or less looking after one another.  When this particular gentleman, who was elderly, retired and needed to return home he could not do so because the family home was gone and his family were scattered.  For a variety of medical and psychiatric reasons, he probably did not have a great capacity for self-management in a non-sheltered world different to the one in which we had previously lived and ended up, even though he was not that terribly mentally ill, in St. Brigid's Hospital in Ballinasloe where he became a long-term resident.  There was no place for him to go but the hospital, which for him was a nurturing environment where he received fine and compassionate care.  The point I am making is that there will be a complex set of needs unmasked as we wind down the care of people in long-term psychiatric facilities.  We will need to ensure that we have places available for people in the community services.  </p><p>There are other less glamorous components of psychiatric care that urgently need attention.  One that springs to mind is that of liaison psychiatry.  There is a huge need for psychiatric support for patients who may be in hospital with a primary diagnosis that is not psychiatric.  A number of years ago by Dr. Rachel Cullivan, a brilliant young psychiatrist from the unit to which I am attached who is now a consultant in Ireland, and I both undertook research which showed that approximately one quarter to one third of all of our patients admitted with a cancer diagnosis met every criteria for a diagnosis of depression and-or anxiety.  The truth is that we do not have good provision in place for these patients.  There are spin-off and knock-on effects of inadequate provision in respect of the psychiatric-mental requirements of these patients, which translates into a greater demand on inappropriate use of other aspects of the physical health services.</p><p>I ask that the Minister of State, when formatting the plans, examine the need for the development of what I believe is a humane system in good quality hospital-based supportive psychiatry and, most important, one that makes sense in terms of resource utilisation.  I commend the Minister of State on her reform efforts and urge that she continue her good work.</p></speech>

While I welcome also that we are discussing the issue of mental health this evening there is, in some respects, a sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i> in that we have discussed this issue a great deal over the past two years.  While on the one hand, this is reflective of the priority which Members on all sides of the House give to this issue and the growing public concern about mental health problems, including depression, the alarming suicide rates and so on, on the other hand it indicates that services have not improved.  While Members on both sides of the House have welcomed the additional &euro;35 million set aside for mental health services in the last two budgets, the &euro;35 million was not provided last year.  Despite several questions having been asked in regard to whether the &euro;35 million had been provided this year and, if so, on what it had been spent, they were not answered.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-04a.217" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1154" speakername="Averil Power" time="16:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013120400037#OO00400"><p>Yes.  A lower allocation of &euro;20 million has been provided for mental health services in this year's budget, which I find very worrying.  The provision of &euro;35 million is a drop in the ocean in terms of what is needed in this area.  There is no doubt that we have under-spent in this area for a long time, and not only in the past two years.  We have never given mental health the priority it deserves.  In the UK, 12% of the entire health budget is spent on mental health services.  The percentage here is much lower.  What was provided for in A Vision for Change sought only to bring mental health service provision up to 8%.  This issue has not been afforded sufficient priority for years.</p><p>The launch of A Vision for Change was taken as a signal of change and the provision of resources.  While some progress has been made, it is not enough.  During his attendance in the House in respect of the legislation for the new HSE system I debated with the Minister, Deputy Reilly, the need for a designated person for mental health within the new HSE structure.  I welcome that an appointment in this regard has been made.  However, I do not believe sufficient resources are in place.  I share Senator Crown's concern in regard to the dismantling of existing services without having new ones in place.  </p><p>There is a need for a huge cultural change across Irish society on this issue.  We need to start to normalise debate of mental health issues with our young children, from preschool level to adulthood.  We must make them aware that everyone experiences difficult times in their lives and to acknowledge this and to seek help is a sign of strength rather than a sign weakness.  While I welcome that the Minister for Education has published guidelines in this regard for second level schools, I believe there is a need for guidelines at preschool and primary school level.  I did some work on the Fianna F&aacute;il paper on youth mental health, which involved a great deal of consultation with schools.  I am aware that Senator Gilroy has been involved in a wide consultation process on the broader issue of suicide, which issue we have worked on together on a cross-party basis.  However, there is a gap in this strategy.  While schools welcome that there are now guidelines in place they have little resources in terms of the delivery of initiatives and practical supports on the ground.  They also believe that when a suicide occurs many of the issues around it should be adequately resolved through support at school level.  Some young people require access to professional mental health services, including, in some instances, acute care there are huge gaps in terms of child and adolescent mental health services provision.  It is stressful for a teacher when a student who is experiencing difficulties from a mental health point of view cannot access resources.  </p><p>In terms of this motion, I share the view that this issue needs to be given greater priority.  I welcome that the motion, which seeks to highlight the need for greater emphasis on mental health, was tabled by the Labour Party Senators.  I hope that the next time we debate this issue more concrete progress will have been made.  This is a huge issue and not only in terms of suicide, the rates of which have alarmed us all.  I live in Sutton which is not far from Howth.  Every couple of weeks a person drives to the pier in Howth with the intention of taking his or her life.  Not only are the families of people who have committed suicide in great distress, the level of depression across Irish society, caused by a wide range of issues, not least the recession, are frightening.  A lot more needs to be done.  There are many good precedents, for example, in terms of the work done to change people's attitudes to drink driving and road safety.  Far more people than are killed on our roads are now dying by suicide.  There is a need for a serious campaign, adequately resourced, in an effort to bring about a mind-shift in terms of mental health.</p><p>We are all aware of the suicide rates.  People are, perhaps, now talking more about mental health than they did a few years ago because of the increase in suicide, including the death by suicide of the young girls in Donegal and others which hit the headlines.  However, we know from surveys that people remain petrified of other people finding out they suffer from depression, including employers and their peers.  This is frightening.  We need to find a way to completely change this mindset.  This will only happen by way of a concerted and adequately resourced campaign on the issue of mental health, as has been done in other countries such as Australia.  I urge the Minister of State to consider that.</p></speech>

It is important to acknowledge the Minister of State's deep, personal commitment to this area despite the challenging economic climate in which we find ourselves.  There has been much focus on this issue for the past 26 or 27 months.  We are finally seeing significant progress, although we would all like to see more.  The &euro;20 million provided in this year's budget for community based mental health services is important.</p> <p>All Members have seen people with mental health challenges living within a community environment.  It is wonderful that the stigma regarding mental health, which has been prevalent for many years, can be eroded by people living and interacting within communities and by spending time integrating in the towns.  This is something in which it is definitely worth investing more resources as it is how one achieves respect and equality.  The appointment of a mental health services director is an important incremental step in the right direction to pull together all the various services and to ensure there is a focused and determined approach towards ensuring the resources that are put in are spent wisely and effectively to achieve the maximum result.</p><p> I heard some of the debate in my office because I was trying to get some work done but I listened carefully to Senator Power's comments.  Her contribution showed her finger is on the pulse, as ever.  I have no hesitation in stating that she is one of the best performers in this House and very much reflects people's true values.  On the recent publication of the legislation for which Members have waited for some time, the Minister of State was quite right to take her time to ensure she got it right.  This legislation is extremely important from a raft of different angles and the last meaningful legislation in this area was enacted in the 1800s, when Queen Victoria had jurisdiction over this country.  This simply demonstrates the work that has been done over two years to pull together this measure and to get right.  It is certain that when this Government leaves office, its successor will have a firm foundation on which to build.  This legislation also will ensure that Ireland can eventually ratify the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  On that note, I was proud to share an event that took place yesterday in Farmleigh House with the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and the CARA organisation from Tralee, of which I am a board member.  It is doing phenomenal work to ensure that people with disabilities engage in physical activity through sport, that barriers preventing people from engaging and participating in sport are removed and that adequate disability awareness training is made available both to governing bodies and down to the level of individual coaches, as well as training to ensure there is equal participation of all people, irrespective of their abilities or so-called disabilities.  I acknowledge the Minister of State for making available funding, through the Department of Justice and Equality, to ensure this programme is rolled out to as many people as possible.  I also acknowledge Joanne Cantwell of RTE becoming a patron of the organisation to ensure this issue gets the profile it deserves.</p><p> It is timely that Members are having this debate because after the Minister of State's extremely hard work for more than two years, results now are beginning to appear.  Moreover, it is not all about money or about throwing money at a problem.  It is about ensuring the money that is available is spent wisely, as for too many years, money has been shovelled at problems but such money then simply ended up going down a black hole.  This ensures the money is targeted effectively to ensure that results are achieved.  This pertains to a partnership approach, to eliminating prejudice and stigma and increasing public awareness and understanding.  The recession undoubtedly has created an enormous strain on citizens and financial worries lead to mental health issues and depression.  It is only right and proper that resources be made available for those people within society who, as a result of circumstances, find themselves in this dreadful situation.  Members have spoken <i>ad nauseam</i>about the issue of cyber-bullying and the difficulties and challenges faced in this regard but all elements in society are now suffering and the numbers who have declared mental health issues have increased.  It is good that people now are comfortable in discussing the issue and as a society, the cultural change that is taking place in front of people is both potent and appropriate.  Moreover, the Government's response to that is also absolutely appropriate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-04a.220" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013120400038#PP00200"><p>While I should apologise for being the last to speak, on an issue like this I believe it is always important to listen.  I will start by laying out the stall.  I greatly appreciate this issue being on the agenda at this time of year because Christmas is a particularly difficult time for people who have problems with their mental health.  It probably has something to do with the dark nights, the long evenings and all the rest or perhaps it arises from the expectation that everyone is meant to be happy at this time of the year, while some people are not.  Equally however, if Members continue to state that nothing has changed, the service is appalling and there is no one out there to help, how does one then get the message out to people telling them to seek help if they have difficulty with their mental health?  This is a difficulty and one cannot simply continue to do what has been done in respect of mental health.  I keep telling people the issue is different.  It is not the type of debate in which one can go at it hammer and tongs, kick it around the floor and then expect it to get up afterwards and continue along its merry way.  One can do that with some issues such as finances and with education and transport in some instances but mental health is different.  I am convinced the script Members are now receiving will not be the speech I will give.  However, they should keep it, as it will make good bedtime reading.</p><p>Senator Barrett referred to the media and their gloom and doom attitude and I believe Members are inclined to buy into it.  I would also make this point were I in opposition, but mental health is different and Members cannot continue to tell people the service has not changed and that nothing is happening and then expect them to seek help.  This is because people who are vulnerable and have difficulty with their mental health at any time actually do listen to Members.  They take in what they are saying and I would hate to give them the wrong message.  I will provide Members with the figures regarding the posts later, which are fairly comprehensive.  I have just about had it with different organisations and when I challenged one as to from where exactly it was getting its information, its spokesperson just replied that it was out there.  What does that mean?  One would imagine that organisations that are listened to by the Government and by society in general would conduct a little research but that is not happening.  This also is an issue that worries me.</p><p>What can I say to Senator Mullins?  I sat here listening to him and I take on board everything he said about Ballinasloe.  I accept that times are difficult for politicians in that locality at present.  Moreover, I understand that people in the area who deal with the service or who have relations and families who do so are nervous and live in trepidation in respect of the service.  I now wish to deal with the points made by Senator Crown in that respect.  The only guarantee I can give him about the gap about which people worry regarding the transition from the old to the new is to point to what has been done in other areas.  Precisely the same steps were taken in Clonmel with St. Luke's hospital as are proposed in Ballinasloe.  Moreover, the same resistance was encountered but anyone who lives in Clonmel and the greater Tipperary area will tell one they now have a better service.  The aforementioned hospital in Clonmel has been closed but alternatives are available when people need to be hospitalised.  I agree entirely that people will need to be hospitalised and equally, at times there will be a need for medication.  Even the most progressive of psychiatrists and psychologists will tell one there are points at which people become so distressed that one cannot get through to them with talking therapies and it therefore is necessary to medicate them to ensure the best possible impact.</p> <p>These are not new to me.  These are things I discuss every day when it comes to mental health.  We need to be clear about it.  However, it is not only about that service.  People who have a difficulty with their mental health do not only live in a mental health box, they live in society like the rest of us.  They live across a range, like all of us.</p><p>I know this is something in which Senator Moran will have a particular interest.  Yesterday, I launched an e-learning site for the HSE.  It is now available to every practitioner within the HSE.  It is a service for people with intellectual disability and mental health problems.  It was developed with the assistance of six service users who have an intellectual disability and who are availing of a mental health service.  It is most accessible.  There is no longer a need for a person to come to Dublin to get training.  It is possible to tap into it anywhere because it is based on e-learning.  We are doing that type of thing all the time.  In the morning I will launch a website and information booklet on dementia.  We are hoping to launch the dementia strategy in the first quarter of next year.  It is across a range.  It is not only the medicalised model that we are dealing with, although I emphasise that the medicalised model is expanding in terms of therapies and so on.</p><p>We should remember where we have come from.  We started off with 22,000 people in long-stay institutions at a time when our prison population, as Senator Bacik, rightly, pointed out, was approximately 4,000.  The morality of it is one thing, but how could we sustain that?  It was not possible to sustain it.  I do not care what anyone says although I recognise what Senators Barrett and Gilroy said about people with mental health difficulties in institutions over a long period.  However, some people in there over a long period have no difficulties with their mental health and we should start acknowledging that as well.  There is a range of how we deal with these matters and the attitudes.  The Senator's point about the attitude is correct.  I have no wish for people to move out of the big institution only to go into a small institution.  That is not what this is about.  It is about attitude.  Jack Straw once said that he could not legislate for attitudes and that is a fact.  However, he went on to say that he could legislate to ensure one person's attitude does not detrimentally affect another's.  It is about that as well as being about a mindset and changing.  It is also about ensuring that if a person has a difficulty with her mental health and if it is acute, then she need not necessarily go to the service because the service will come to her.</p><p>Senator Gilroy will be interested in this point.  The fact that he lives in Glanmire means that he has a community-based 24 hour seven day mental health team.  It is excellent.</p></speech>

That happens sometimes because of resistance.  The type of resistance we are seeing is multifaceted.  On the one hand it is a little concerning because people are worried about the transition and the service not being available when they change to a different service.  However, if we did not do things every time we got nervous and afraid, then nothing would ever change.  I was laughing at Senator MacSharry when he referred to panic attacks and anxiety.  I was going to put it to him that he should have been a Minister in this Government during the first 12 months.  I could tell him about anxiety and panic attacks.  It is about how we live our lives and the awful things that happen to us along the way.  We are making progress.</p><p>I will tell the Seanad something else and I will be honest about it.  It is not an easy task and it has not been an easy task since day one.  We launched the A Vision for Change document in 2006.  I remember it.  Equally, I remember the Planning for the Future document and I still have a copy of it at home.  I remember when A Vision for Change was launched and how it was lauded - rightly so - because it a remarkable work.  We launched it in 2006 when the country was awash with money.  Despite the fact that the other two Ministers of State who had responsibility for this area before me were as committed as I am, for some reason it simply never got done.</p><p>We are trying to drive this out at a particularly difficult time.  The additional money we are getting is for specific posts.  It is not about replacing what is going out.  It is a different service in a different area delivered by different people.  Central to all of this will be the nursing fraternity.  They have done an excellent job in the past.  They have been the leaders.  I could name people in the service who I stand back and admire because, in some cases, they have gone against their own members and driven this out.  It is vital to have such people.  We cannot say that they are not doing the job or that it is not important and at the same time expect them to have the enthusiasm to do the job.  I recognise that everyone wants this to work.  No one wants this to work more than me.  I believe everyone wants it to work because it is in everyone's interests that it works.  Our attitude towards it needs to be different.</p><p>I will provide some figures on jobs because I know I am pushing it at this stage.  Recruitment for the posts approved for 2012 and 2013 is continuing.  I asked for the figures to be sourced from the central recruitment office rather than either the Department of Health or the HSE.  It was a double-check.  I received the most recent data from the HSE on the recruitment of these posts.  It indicates that at the end of November the recruitment process is completed or is in the final stages for 395 or 95% of the 414 posts approved in 2012.  We have a difficulty filling some posts.  Of the posts approved in 2013 the recruitment process is completed for 134 or 28%, while 172 or 36% of the posts are in the final stages of the recruitment process.  A further 106 or 22% of the posts are at earlier stages, indicating that 412 or 86% of the 2013 allocation has been completed or is in the recruitment process.</p><p>There are a number of posts for which there are difficulties in identifying suitable candidates.  I have said all this before and it remains the same.  There is a particular difficulty with these posts due to factors including availability of qualified candidates and geographic location.  However, the remainder are at various stages in the recruitment process.  The HSE's national recruitment service is currently working to ensure that the remaining posts will be filled as soon as possible from existing panels or through competition in the absence of panels at the earliest opportunity.</p><p>I offer what is only one example because it applies across a range.  There are difficulties in recruiting people for forensic psychiatry in the area of childhood and adolescence.  Let us suppose an organisation issues a generalised advertisement for recruitment calling for candidates interested in working in psychiatry in the area of child and adolescent mental health.  Then, a candidate responds because she has an interest in psychiatry and the associated area.  The vacancy is in Donegal.  Since the candidate has gone through the process and has been offered the post she gets the vacancy in Donegal, but, in reality, she wants to work in Dingle.  If an opportunity comes up or a place becomes available in Dingle, then she has the right to move.  That is a major issue for us.  Therefore, in certain areas we are developing specialised panels.  In other words, it is not a straightforward global catch-all.  We will now ask candidates whether they are interested in a given area and whether the post is where they would like it to be.  We are developing that type of specialist panel.</p> <p>The general panel will suit most people.  The area where we have a difficulty is with psychologists.  This is not just about the medical interaction.  We have also given over &euro;7 million to the Irish College of General Practitioners to develop a psychological and counselling service in order that when people go to their GP, which is where most go in the first instance, who are suffering from mild to moderate depression or anxiety, they can be referred on to that service, rather than go through the psychiatrist and the general service available in the area.  We have also given the college money to develop training for GPs in the area of suicide.</p><p>I agree that the mental health service was always the Cinderella service, the poor relation.  I am now being approached by people in the niche areas of the general medical area, for example, head and neck cancer and oral health, as to how they can get on board in terms of what is happening with GPs and the progress we are making in that area.  While it is not my area - I have enough without taking on anything else - we are trying to direct them in the way we did it to bring them in.  It is clear that other people are trying to catch up.  In A Vision for Change, each chapter - child adolescence, suicide prevention, restraints and medication - has had a strategy developed around each particular area.  Perhaps I am too idealistic when it comes to how we should approach mental health but in the absence of hope we despair.  I really believe we need to give people hope.  We have Shine, the anti-stigma organisation.  I wear its badge all the time and I find it starts a conversation.  </p><p>I apologise to the Chair.  I am very sorry.</p></speech>

We are delighted she spoke at the end.  As she said the value is in listening.  It has been a thoughtful and constructive conversation.  I welcome the cross-party support.  As Senator Marc MacSharry said, this is a subject in which we all have an interest and it is above politics.  As a member of the cross-party committee on mental health I am glad to have tabled the motion as part of the commitment of that group to keep mental health before us.  I know Senator Power said we have been here talking and we have talked but, in fact, we must keep talking because it is about change, as she pointed out, changing the culture and changing our own attitudes.  Every time one of us stands up to speak we will mention it to somebody else or somebody else will listen.  We cannot change the situation in the way the Road Safety Authority has changed because traffic accidents are a much more straightforward area, albeit, extremely difficult for those who have lost somebody or have been injured.  In this case the complexity of mental health is such an enormous area.</p><p>Today we have tried to see where the progress has been made.  Most, if not all, of us would agree that enormous progress has been made, it is just that the road is such a long one.  Senator MacSharry pointed out that the dots are not joined up.  I would argue that when this Government came into office, apart from A Vision for Change, even finding some of the dots was a challenge and finding the resources to find the dots to start joining them up is a challenge.  After two-and-a-half years we begin to see that some of the dots are being joined up.  Of course, there is always an impatience.  As soon as we say &quot;Let us change it&quot;, we actually want it to be changed tomorrow but we know that we cannot do that.   Each of those pieces, putting in the app, talking to the GPs, changing how volunteers come forward and how they interact, reducing the incidence of suicide, talking to young people, takes an incredibly long time.  </p><p>Certainly we feel a momentum and that we have moved away from what Senator Barrett described as the shameful legacy of incarceration.  All of us probably know of somebody who was incarcerated in some way, shape or form.  We were a nation who felt happy to lock people up.  The process will take an incredible amount of time.  The momentum, energy and will exists to address this.  Even the figures that the Minister of State has given and that she checked and double-checked put to rest those arguments about whether recruitment was taking place.  It is welcome that we can say that the work is being done.  We all have to be patient but we have to keep the conversation going.  Ultimately, there is still that default about physical health being the most important thing.  We know why that has happened but it is up to each and every one of us to change that into a society where the health of our mind and our body are equal.  Until we do that and can then perhaps change that poor relation status, and it is changing, each and every one of us has a responsibility.  The Minister of State can legislate, as can other Ministers, and we can legislate until we fall over but unless we take responsibility for the mental health of our own country and say we have a responsibility, we have a role to play, it will not change.  I am delighted that each and every one of us here this evening has made yet another contribution to that debate which will and must carry on.  I thank the Minister of State for her support.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-04a.231" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1147" speakername="John Crown" time="16:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013120400040#RR00700"><p>I thank the Minister of State for taking this Adjournment matter.  I want to tell her about a particularly troubling illness called Huntington's disease on which I am sure she has accumulated some information.  For the benefit of the uninitiated this is a disease which has an incidence of about one in 10,000 in the European population.  It is a disease which is incredibly cruel in its trajectory.  It is a genetic disease which is governed by a form of inheritance called autosomal dominant inheritance which means that if one has the disease there is a 50% chance one will pass on the gene to any offspring child.  If he or she has the gene they will develop the disease.  There are certain quirks in the genetics of the disease.  It sometimes occurs in earlier manifestations in succeeding generations.  People who courageously elect to have the test to see if they carry the gene, even though they are in good health, often do it to make important life decisions, reproductive decisions.  If they carry the gene they know they are facing an utter inevitability of a serious illness which will give them catastrophic physical and mental decline.  Typically, the time of the appearance of the first symptom to the time of death is about 20 years.  Most people develop the symptoms during their mid-30s which means that during their latter young years and their early middle years they are developing severe progressive neurological abnormality, progressing ultimately to paralysis, dementia, heart failure, etc.</p><p>The reason I find this issue topical is that a citizen of our Republic wrote to me asking that I bring her plight to the attention of the House.</p> <p>This was a young woman who had a husband in his early 50s who had been diagnosed with Huntington's disease and he would rapidly reach the stage of requiring absolute care and could no longer be cared for at home.  He required, for want of a better word, institutionalisation in a nursing home.  He was assessed there, as would any other resident of a nursing home be, and they have found themselves making a major contribution to the care in a commercial nursing home on the basis that they had an asset, namely, their mortgaged home.  </p><p>I guess what really brought the matter to my mind was the fact that patients who have the disease do not automatically quality for a medical card.  They may qualify for a medical card on the basis of a means test but they do not qualify statutorily because the disease is not on the list of conditions that grants automatic access to a medical card.  The matter needs to be rectified.  Patients will often get a medical card but, as things stand now, they must go through a renewal process even though the circumstances for people with the disease do not change.  Let me rephrase that by saying that their circumstances do change because they get worse.  It is cruel that people who have the disease are asked to renew medical card applications with the uncertainty that they may not get one.  In truth, the condition is of such catastrophic severity and so uncommon that a caring society should make a provision that basic care associated with a medical card should be made available to people.  </p><p>I know the Minister was dealt a miserable set of cards at the time he found himself in public office in terms of the public finances.  I understand that there are a number of demand restriction measures that take place across the health, social and educational services.  It is hard to escape the conclusion that the new focus on the assessment of &quot;probity&quot; for medical card applications has something to do with demand limitation.</p><p>I ask the Minister of State to take a special look at the plight of people who have Huntington's disease and other chronic neurodegenerative conditions where no cure is available and treatment is purely palliative.  The diseases make people completely disabled and place an extraordinary burden on sufferers and their families.  It is estimated that every Huntington's disease patient directly affects the lives of at least four other people in Ireland.  I thank the Minister of State for paying attention to this Adjournment matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-04a.233" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" time="16:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013120400041#SS00200"><p>I thank the Senator.  I shall commence by saying that I know about the disease.  I first encountered it because my neighbour had the disease but it was called Huntington's Chorea at the time.  It is a most distressing and cruel disease.  Huntington's disease is a genetic neurological disorder and is classified as a rare disease.  I shall not deal with the medical card issue raised by the Senator in my reply but I take on board what he has said and shall convey the matter to the relevant Minister.</p><p>The supports provided by the Health Service Executive to people with Huntington's disease involve a multidisciplinary team approach to the provision of health and personal supports.  It incorporates acute hospital services, primary care, community services, specialists, disability supports and supports services.</p><p>The Huntington's Disease Association of Ireland provides consultation, information and individualised supports to those diagnosed with Huntington's disease, their families and their health care team.  The Health Service Executive recognises the valuable contribution the association provides to those who suffer from Huntington's disease, their families and carers.  It provided a grant totalling &euro;66,887 in 2013 to support the association in its work.</p><p>Other developments that are under way and relevant to people's families and staff working with Huntington's disease include the following: the development of an implementation plan for the national policy and strategy for the provision of neuro rehabilitation services; the HSE clinical care programme in neurology and rehabilitation medicine; and the finalisation of a plan or strategy for rare diseases in Ireland, as recommended by the Council of the European Union. </p><p>Any patient with a diagnosis of Huntington's disease will be treated and cared for in one of the HSE's neurological departments.  The diagnostic process will involve assessment between a consultant neurologist and other disciplines such as neuro psychology as part of the diagnostic process.  Patients may also have a specific genetic test undertaken to confirm a diagnosis of Huntington's disease.  The genetic test is carried out by the National Centre for Medical Genetics.  The centre also offers patients with a known family history of Huntington's disease the ability to undertake a predictive test to assess the likelihood of inheritance.  Predictive testing is only performed in conjunction with a counselling programme run by the clinical genetics division of the National Centre for Medical Genetics.  I have been informed that there have been 27 clinical referrals in 2012 and 21 clinical referrals to date in 2013 in respect of Huntington's disease.</p><p>Beaumont Hospital provides specific clinics in respect of people with Huntington's disease and its department of psychology provides a specialist neuropsychology service for people diagnosed with Huntington's disease.  Patients referred to the service receive a detailed neuropsychological assessment that examines aspects of thinking, emotion and behaviour in line with international guidelines on the assessment of Huntington's disease.   Patients can also receive supportive psychotherapy and behavioural management, where appropriate.  A supportive service for carers and family members of patients with Huntington's disease is also available.  The HSE has informed the Department that the clinic currently operates fortnightly but individual sessions are available by appointment outside of clinic hours.  </p><p>In Galway, patients with Huntington's disease are referred to the hospital's movement disorder clinic.  A clinical nurse specialist also attends the clinic in addition to providing a telephone advice and support service to patients each day during the week.</p><p>A six-storey unit in the Mid-Western Regional Hospital in Limerick will be completed in early 2014.  It will bring together existing and, in some cases, deliver new services for patients under one roof at the hospital.  Floor 1 of the unit will include a six-bed acute stroke unit with the most advanced diagnostic equipment.  In addition, the floor will also accommodate a neurological centre.  Among the neurological conditions to be treated in the new unit will be Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, motor neurone disease and muscular dystrophy.  </p><p>I thank Senator Crown for raising the issue of Huntington's disease.  The Government is committed to advancing treatment and support for people who have rare neurological conditions through improved standards, quality of care, improved access to service and improved costs and efficiency.  As I said, I have not addressed the medical card issue but I shall ensure that his message is delivered loud and clear.</p></speech>

I know that she will do so because I respect her word on the matter.  Second, there must be some assessment of the adequacy of the arrangements that are in place for providing long-term care for the patients who sadly reach a very advanced stage of neurological deterioration that requires professional institutionalised care so can no longer can be cared for in the home.  We must establish whether it is appropriate that they are assessed in the same way as everyone else who enters nursing home care.  Third, we must consider establishing a national strategy for chronic neurodegenerative care.  I thank the Minister of State.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-04a.236" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1161" speakername="John Kelly" time="16:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013120400042#TT00100"><p>I would like to ask the Minister of State with responsibility for sustainable transport, Deputy Alan Kelly, to consider establishing a small group to oversee the delivery of a national network of off-road cycle trails in order to assist with the timely delivery of the national cycling strategy and to create a network of trails to attract some of the cycling tourism business which is so successful elsewhere but which does not exist in Ireland.</p><p>Ireland does not have a long cycle trail as is the norm in the rest of Europe.  Our existing short greenways merely provide day trips or weekend break products as well as a local amenity.  They cannot form the basis of a week long cycling holiday.  We need a number of long trails which will attract the fastest growing leisure pursuit in Europe.  We own significant linear corridors, such as canal and river navigation towpaths, and disused railway lines.  However, the creation of long trails on these assets on a county-by-county basis will result in unacceptable delays, a lack of standardisation of the product and an inability to leverage these assets further by co-locating services, such as broadband cabling, on these corridors.  A small focus body would fast-track this urgent infrastructure and would achieve economies of scale which would provide best value for the taxpayer.</p><p>This is a summary of what can only be described as the debacle of cycling and long distance walking infrastructure in Ireland.  Both sectors need to be examined together.  Long trails in other countries are enjoyed by both walkers and cyclists for the benefit of local and national economies.  Ireland has a particular problem in respect of developing off-road trails.  We have access issues and an attitude which is rooted in landownership and small farm sizes.  As a consequence, we have tended to create trails where we could rather than where they would be most effective.  In countries like the UK, footpaths co-exist happily with farms, and walkers and cyclists respect the country code and cause no problems for landowners.  We have some way to go before that level of understanding is achieved.  </p><p>We, therefore, need to concentrate in the first instance on lands which are in public ownership and we need to utilise any such assets to create a basic network that would give us a place at the table of European leisure tourism.  Currently, we have no such presence.  In 2006, a F&aacute;ilte Ireland report showed that Ireland had almost no penetration in the cycling holiday sector and nothing has been done in the meantime to address that deficit.  If we extrapolate F&aacute;ilte Ireland's figures in this regard, we are behind European norms by at least &euro;300 million annually on the cycling side alone which is estimated to translate into approximately 5,000 jobs.  The long distance walking business added to that equation would further enhance it.  We have no idea of the greater potential that is there. </p><p>Our colleague, Deputy Arthur Spring, is very passionate about this issue also.  He suggested that a subsidiary body of the National Roads Authority would be an option to deliver this project and to bring about the connectivity needed to bring all the local authorities together.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Kelly, knows, some local authorities might be passionate about this issue while others might be more passionate about protecting old railway lines.  The EuroVelo project in Europe has received funding of &euro;1 billion while a 150 km walking project in New Zealand creates one job per kilometre.  </p><p>I have a report produced by Mr. John Mulligan who has an in-depth knowledge of all the various cycle routes around the country, including Dublin to Stamullen, Dublin to Strokestown via Mullingar and Longford, Dublin to Shannon Harbour, a Dublin-Limerick-Tralee route and the Boyne Valley.  The list is endless.  The Minister of State is probably aware of this report but I will give it to him anyway.  As I said, Mr. Mulligan has an in-depth knowledge of this issue and has done some excellent work.</p><p>The Minister of State will see that what we are doing currently is not working, so we must come up with a different strategy.  The suggestion I made about a separate body to head this up is the way to go and I would appreciate the Minister of State's help in delivering it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-04a.237" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1088" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="16:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013120400042#TT00200"><p>I thank Senator Kelly, who always makes a very valuable contribution, for raising this issue and giving me the opportunity to outline this Government's commitment to the development of a world class national cycling network for Ireland.  I know the F&aacute;ilte Ireland figures, to which the Senator referred, in regard to tourism and there is some work to be done, although there has been some progress over the past number of years.</p><p>Domestically, cycling, as an activity, has gone through the roof.  The number of people cycling for leisure and tourism purposes is phenomenal.  One does not even need to see the statistics as anyone travelling around the country can see that.  Trying to build cycling more into people's lives as regards their commute to school and work is a critical component which I want to push as well, in particular given that 400,000 people travel 4 km or less to work each day.  From a tourism point of view, developing the infrastructure, about which the Senator spoke, is the critical issue.</p> <p>The suggestion to establish a working group to oversee the delivery of cycling infrastructure has merit and has been the subject of recent discussion within my Department.</p><p>I would first like to advise Senator Kelly of the national trails advisory committee, which does some of this work.  This committee, which operates as a sub-committee of the Irish Sports Council, includes representatives from a number of agencies and bodies involved in recreational trail development in Ireland.  Those represented include my Department, Coillte, Cycling Ireland, National Parks and Wildlife Service, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, National Trails Office, the Irish Local Development Company Network and Waterways Ireland among many others.  The functions of the committee are to oversee the implementation of the Irish trails strategy and to achieve agreement on a harmonised approach to certain elements of trail provision.  The committee meets on a regular basis and is in the process of developing guidelines for the development of cycle infrastructure in Ireland.  To date, the committee's work has been largely within the context of delivering on the Irish trails strategy but has allowed for information sharing on the broader issues of cycle infrastructure development in Ireland.</p><p>As the Senator knows, the demand for off-road cycle infrastructure has increased dramatically in recent years, particularly with the phenomenal success of the greenway in Mayo.  This is apparent from the number of applications submitted to my Department by local authorities under the recent national cycle network funding call 2014-2016.  A total of &euro;6.5 million has been set aside for the duration of this programme to deliver a small number of greenway projects and 38 proposals were submitted from 28 authorities.  I have visited many of the projects and would love to fund them all.  Some of them are fantastic but we just cannot fund all of them.</p><p>There is good reason for this interest.  Cycle projects, particularly off-road projects, are popular with local authorities and the general population because of the following: they are well-received and promoted by local communities; they are easy to provide from a construction perspective; and capable of providing significant benefits in line with many cross-cutting policies such as community, recreation, health, transport and tourism.  They create jobs too in their construction and maintenance and through the services provided for them.  I am conscious too that cycling infrastructure is being considered and delivered by several Departments and agencies across several funding programmes.  This needs to be addressed too.  There may even be potential for future co-funding with our European partners under the next INTERREG scheme and, once finalised, the next European regional development fund, ERDF, operational programme 2014 to 2020.</p><p>Given the ongoing demand for such projects, there may be some merit in broadening the scope of the existing cross-sectoral work through a high level group, which would formulate an agreed and consistent approach to delivering cycling infrastructure in line with the national cycle policy.  Such a group would include many of the aforementioned from the national trails advisory committee as well as the National Transport Authority and the National Roads Authority.  It is very much along the lines of the Senator's suggestion.  The programme for Government provides for the targeting of available resources on developing and co-ordinating niche tourism products and activity packages including continued investment in the national cycle policy.  A key task for any group established would be to ensure that there is a long-term vision in place that recognises the importance of investing in projects which have the potential to be branded collectively as a national product.  I have no doubt that the existing cooperation between all public authorities, community groups and companies will continue into the future and we can look forward to many diverse off-road trails and cycle ways opening up around the country in the coming years.</p><p>In this context, I am very open to considering the best mechanisms for delivering such co-operation because I believe that strategic investment now will deliver returns in a multitude of ways and will make a significant contribution to our long-term goals for sustainable travel and transport.  I will take the Senator's suggestion, which I welcome, and look on it positively and will return to him soon to report on the actions I will take to achieve the goals that we share.</p></speech>

The Minister for Tourism, Transport and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, published heads of a Bill earlier this year and hoped to present the Bill now.  Twice in the past week people have told me stories about the terrible way that clampers treat people, particularly on private property.  We need to regulate the practice to give certainty to car owners and to the owners of private property.  We do need a clamping process in private facilities but it needs to be regulated.</p><p>The statement the Minister made earlier in the year was very welcome.  He said that the National Transport Authority would oversee the regulation and that clampers would be licensed.  Other measures to be put in place include a complaints procedure.  At the moment there is no such procedure and one must write to some PO Box somewhere.  It is an important issue.  It is a commitment in the programme for Government and needs to be addressed and moved forward and I will be grateful for the Minister of State's response on where this stands. </p></speech>

I thank Senator Clune for raising the issue.  This is a good time to update everyone on this legislation.  The Senator would be surprised at the number of people who raise the issue.  People very much welcomed the fact that it was stuck into the programme for Government because they rightly have issues about certain practices in the clamping industry which need to change.</p><p>The programme for Government contained a commitment to &quot;legislate to regulate the vehicle clamping industry&quot;.  This commitment stemmed, principally, from concerns expressed by members of the public in regard to the activity of some clampers on private land, and the extent to which this activity may have been carried out in a less than fair manner with no mechanism to appeal against perceived abuses.  Sometimes some of the fines, the manner in which they were decided and their cost left a lot to be desired.  It was deemed appropriate to address these concerns, and that the Oireachtas should clarify for citizens and property owners an activity which has become an increasing feature of urban life in Ireland.</p><p>While section 101B of the Road Traffic Act 1961, inserted by section 9 of the Dublin Transport Authority (Dissolution) Act, 1987, provides the basis for clamping on public roads, there is no extant legislation governing clamping on private land or property.  In seeking to meet the Government's commitment, the Minister presented a discussion paper to the then Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment, Transport, Culture and the Gaeltacht in December 2011, outlining the various policy proposals available, and asked the committee to take a role in the pre-heads of Bill stage of the legislative process.  Specifically, the committee was invited to examine the relevant issues which should be addressed and to prepare a report outlining its views on the shape such legislation might take.  Following public hearings and a number of written submissions on the matter, the committee responded at the end of March 2012 with a comprehensive report.  This report, which is publicly available, contained a number of recommendations, the majority of which were included in a general scheme of Bill which was approved by the Government in March 2013.</p><p>The detailed legislation is at an advanced stage of drafting in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, which I can confirm, and it is expected that the Bill will be published by the end of this year or early in 2014.  We hope that it will be published this month.  The Bill will not propose an outright ban on clamping on private property.  Landowners need to be able to deal in a fair manner with nuisance parking, such as parking of cars all day in a shopping centre to the disadvantage of other customers.  There is, however, a clear need to establish broad rules to govern how clamping is carried out.  In general, this Bill will provide safeguards both for those operating a clamping regime as well as for motorists who may have their vehicles clamped.</p><p>The public is well aware of cases where private clampers have behaved in a manner that gives rise to serious concerns.  Under the principal provisions of the Bill, the National Transport Authority, as regulator, will ensure the provision of adequate advisory signage in locations where clamping is in operation, set maximum clamp release periods and fees, and establish an independent appeals process.  These provisions will apply to clamping activities on the public road, as well as on private property where the public has an invitation to park, whether explicit or implied.</p><p>Best practice aspects associated with such clamping activities on the public road, such as the current appeals process operated by Dublin City Council which has operated for many years - indeed I have had to lodge appeals - might be equally successfully replicated in respect of clamping on private property and be given the full authority of statutory provision in the public and private spheres.  We are taking some of the public practice into the private sphere. </p><p>As outlined both here and in the joint committee's deliberations on the matter, consideration of the various issues surrounding the use of clamping as a parking enforcement mechanism demands that any intended legislation will provide appropriate measures in legal terms.  There is a clear need to strike a balance between the rights of individual landowners effectively to enforce parking restrictions on their own property, and the rights of individuals to utilise a finite parking resource for the common good.</p><p>This latter point is best borne out by the experience in the public arena.  Prior to the introduction of clamping in Dublin, the problems associated with illegal parking were endemic, causing difficulties for residents and traders alike who could not access parking during business hours, as metered spaces were often occupied by all-day commuters.  In essence, the proposed legislation is intended to provide a balanced regulatory framework within which legitimate clampers may operate but which also protects motorists from disreputable practices.  The Minister expects to introduce the Bill in the Oireachtas early in the New Year following its publication, hopefully later this month.  What is being proposed is fair, balanced and totally necessary.</p></speech>
