We have spent in the region of &euro;80 million on the summer works scheme in the past few years, and work has been done on almost 700 schools.  It has been a very successful scheme.  It is run by the Department and involves small and medium-sized works being done by the school in the summer when the school is closed.  It has been very helpful for schools which need minor or, indeed, major upgrades, whether this is wiring, plumbing or issues regarding moving walls, playgrounds, etc.  I acknowledge the significant work done by the Department and congratulate the Minister on the way he has dealt with priorities, with Nos. 1 to 6 on the list having been completed, while 7 to 10 have not been dealt with.</p> <p>Is the Minister proposing a new summer works scheme for this year?  New applicants could be incorporated within priorities Nos. 1 to 6.  What is the timescale?  We are two months away from schools rising and builders are becoming hard to get as there is a shortage of plumbers, electricians and masons at the moment.  Builders and tradesmen have traditionally looked on the scheme as something they can bank on for the summer months but are now so busy that their availability may become an issue, something school principals also worry about.</p> <p>Is the Minister proposing to move onto priorities Nos. 7 to 10?  Will he take new priorities 1 to 6?  When will this be announced and what is the proposed budget? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-04-25a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018042500002#A00600"><p>The summer works scheme is designed to allow schools to carry out small and medium-scale building works that will improve and upgrade existing school buildings.  This has given flexibility to schools and has been very worthwhile.  This scheme is additional to other capital funding schemes that are operated by the Department, such as the additional accommodation scheme and the emergency works scheme for projects of such urgency that they would prevent some or all of the school from opening, and minor works schemes.</p> <p>The summer works scheme is a multi-annual scheme.  The Senator will be aware that over 1,650 schools, nearly 50% of schools, applied for inclusion under the current round of the scheme which reflects a very high demand.  To date, almost &euro;80 million has been approved under the current round of the scheme, in respect of 635 school projects, 464 primary and 171 post-primary schools, for gas, electrical upgrades, mechanical, sanitation and roof improvement works.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Richard Bruton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=119"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=119&amp;amp;pid=RichardBruton&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Details of the successful school applicants are published on the Department&rsquo;s website.  The Senator is seeking clarity on the position for 2018.  The position is that over &euro;25 million will be spent on summer works projects in 2018.  This expenditure will enable the remaining approved improvement works for the 178 schools nationwide to be completed.  These works will be carried out by the schools themselves on a devolved basis mainly over the summer months, so the disruption to students, teachers and other school staff will be kept to a minimum.  Furthermore, the Department intends to engage with the relevant education partners on giving schools a better lead-in period for planning and delivering projects under the summer works scheme from 2019 onwards.  While the summer works scheme is hugely successful in enabling small scale refurbishment works to be done on a devolved basis, the Department considers that the operation of the scheme could be improved by providing a better lead-in period for schools rather than in the second quarter as in previous years.  This will also help ensure that works done under the summer works scheme fit better with any wider refurbishment and energy retrofit plans that may be done at schools under the increased funding provided by the national development plan.  The engagement with education partners will commence shortly and will assist in developing a better timeframe for the planning and delivery of summer works for 2019 onwards.</p></speech>

He raised the priorities 7 to 10.  It is my intention that those would be reached in time.  If a scheme is announced for all the categories, I would not start a new scheme until we had given priorities under all the different headings a chance to participate.  We need a better planning approach.  The really positive thing in the national development plan is that we are now setting aside &euro;2.5 billion for deep refurbishment and retrofitting of schools.  This will be a very significant commitment of capital for the longer term to strengthen the fibre of our schools.  Perhaps it has not been remarked upon but it is a very significant part of the ten year plan.</p></speech>

I am seeking clarity and reassurance from the Minister of State for residents of &Aacute;ras Attracta, Swinford, County Mayo, and their families on the future of their residence at the &Aacute;ras Attracta site.  After the terrible revelations in the RT&Eacute; report in 2014, the McCoy report was commissioned.  One of a number of recommendations in the report when it was published in September 2016 was that the residents in the facility would be placed in the community over a five year period.  I understand some residents have moved, but most are still<i>in situ</i>.  Will that recommendation be adhered to to the letter of the law?  To what extent will families be consulted?  In the case of the particular resident whose details I have supplied to the Minister of State, the family have not been consulted and they do not know what is happening, nor does their brother who is a resident in the facility.  Does the Minister of State think it is a fair and proper way to proceed?</p><p>In the survey done leading up to the report, it was found that the majority of residents were very happy in &Aacute;ras Attracta and with the care they were receiving, as were their families.  Most of the residents are over 60 years of age and most have lived in &Aacute;ras Attracta all their lives.  There is a fear and a concern that people will be forced into the community against their wishes.  This also ignores the fact that &Aacute;ras Attracta is the residents' home, that some people have complex medical needs and that the community may not be the place for them.  They are getting older and these conditions are not improving.</p><p>I also note that it is current policy to put people with intellectual disabilities into community settings.  I understand that but we are talking about an older cohort of residents here.  I know that for the most part, no new resident has been admitted since 1992.  This facility opened in 1988.  There is a case for residents and families to be listened to.  In our drive to modernise, the focus should be on making sure that &Aacute;ras Attracta is safe, secure and provides the necessary social and medical care.</p><p>I mention the various recommendations, including more activities for residents and that residents be given an opportunity for education and so on and issues around the physical building, including that two people should not share a room.  All these things can be addressed on site.  A statement needs to be made because there has been an awful lot of speculation about this.  I would like a commitment that no residents will be placed in the community if they and their families are not in agreement with it.  The Minister of State would allay a lot of fears if that commitment was given.  After that, I would expect due consultation and a commitment in respect of the facilities there which need to be upgraded.  There is a swimming pool there and, as I understand it, it is rarely, if ever, used.  There is a lot of potential in &Aacute;ras Attracta.  It is a fine facility and it has given great service to the area, notwithstanding what happened.  What happened, in terms of what gave rise to the report, means that work must be done to address those issues.  I am not convinced that placing people in the community is a meaningful development in their care or a meaningful step towards improving their circumstances.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-04-25a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018042500002#B00700"><p>I thank Senator Mulherin for raising this important issue.  I begin by emphasising the Government&rsquo;s strong commitment to the provision of appropriate residential care to people with disabilities.  Congregated settings are those defined as a residential setting where people live with ten or more people.  &Aacute;ras Attracta is an old style congregated setting and this Government is committed to working with residents to move them out of these types of settings and into independent community living.  Institutional care is not in keeping with best practice and at its worst it breaches an individual&rsquo;s basic human rights.  International evidence also demonstrates that the outcomes for individuals are always better in the community.  Key to this is personal choice.  Individuals may choose to live on their own in an apartment-type residential setting, others may choose to live with a number of close friends and others with more significant needs may require homes that are purpose built.  There cannot be a one size fits all approach.  The level and configuration of the supports should meet the needs of individuals and support them to live a life of their choice.</p> <p>At the end of December 2017, there were fewer than 2,400 people with a disability living in congregated settings.  The HSE has prioritised the transition of 170 people in 2018 under its service plan.  I understand that &Aacute;ras Attracta has been identified as a priority case.  All residents will move over the next few years to a home in the community and the &Aacute;ras Attracta campus will close as a disability service.  I am informed by the HSE that a number of houses throughout County Mayo have been purchased.  These will be refurbished while there will also be some new properties built to suit residents' needs.  The work on the first of these houses was completed and the first house opened in November 2017.  Since then three more houses have opened with the fourth house expected to open next month.  There are advanced plans to open a further six houses in 2018 with a further four planned next year.</p> <p>The McCoy report published in 2016 highlighted a significant number of shortcomings in regard to residents&rsquo; safety, care and well-being.  The HSE has put a large amount of time and resources into addressing these issues in the intervening years.  In recent inspections of the campus, the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, has confirmed evidence of definite improvements, noting that the HSE has demonstrated a governance regime that will ensure quality and safety.  Most importantly there is evidence of a transformation leading to an enhanced</p> <p>quality of life for residents.  Notwithstanding these important improvements to the safety and well-being of residents, it is still the case that international evidence demonstrates that the outcomes for individuals are always better in the community.</p> <p>The HSE continues to work with registered housing bodies, Mayo County Council and other stakeholders to identify further accommodation to facilitate the decongregation of &Aacute;ras Attracta.  The HSE is working to ensure that the process of transitioning to appropriate living in the community is underpinned by meaningful engagement with residents, their families and key stakeholders.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Jim Daly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2328"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2328&amp;amp;pid=JimDaly&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This engagement becomes more active when a home is identified for a resident.  I am informed by the HSE that the resident mentioned by Senator Mulherin in her question will not be moving to a home in the community this year.  All residents at &Aacute;ras Attracta will move over the next few years to a new home in the community and the HSE is working with residents and their families throughout this process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-04-25a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1425" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018042500002#C00200"><p>I am very concerned about the proposals relating to the community setting.  The Minister said that addressing issues at &Aacute;ras Attracta was a priority for the HSE but, just a couple of months ago, HIQA was threatening to close down the facility, despite all the investment there has been.  HIQA withdrew its plan but the facility was clearly not achieving the desired outcome.  What faith can we have that things will be sorted out in a community setting?  I do not believe that people at this stage of their lives should be forced into the community.  The individual to whom I refer has autism and a number of complex needs and living in an unfamiliar environment is a traumatic experience for such a person.</p> <p>I do not see any sense in the plan.  I respect experts but these are people who have been institutionalised for most of their lives.  They are not of the younger generation, who might be better treated in the community.  I worked in a hospital similar to &Aacute;ras Attracta for five months a number of years ago, where I dealt with people with profound intellectual disabilities.  They tried to implement the same policies as we are trying to implement in Ireland and I am not convinced they are for everybody.  If we are to go beyond lip service and give the residents care and privacy, we owe it to them to upgrade &Aacute;ras Attracta and to allow those who want to remain there for the rest of their days to do so.  We should make it a healthy and happy environment for them as that is the humane option, rather than what is being suggested at the moment.</p></speech>

However, we have to be guided by best practice internationally and research shows that people thrive outside congregated settings in communities, where they will still be supported, assisted and helped in communal living accommodation at which they will also have company.  The decision to move away from congregated settings was taken a long time ago and it is not just an issue for Mayo - it is an issue for the entire country.  It is a challenge and change is difficult, particularly for the residents in this case but they will be at the forefront of the minds of people in the HSE as they make their decisions.</p> <p>People sometimes have to transition, such as when they leave their own homes to go to nursing homes, and transition is part of change.  We have to look to the best interests of residents and that sometimes means moving them to new community settings to be supported and assisted.  The change will have to be managed but it has been done very successfully in many other areas and it can and should be done in Mayo.</p></speech>

They are conscious of how busy garda&iacute; are and those in Henry Street cover the area out to Bruff, which is a large area.  One lady wanted to report a bogus caller but, because of the system, it took three days for the community garda to come back to her.  She was concerned for the welfare for some of her neighbours.</p> <p>Castletroy was originally a separate town from the city of Limerick and has a population of over 16,000, with a student population of some 20,000.  With a total of 36,000, it is the largest suburb in Munster and encompasses Annacotty, Lisnagry, Milford and Monaleen, which were also separate areas at one stage.  The University of Limerick is on its doorstep and there are a lot of industries growing at a very fast rate.  Garda&iacute; are doing a very good job and Limerick has been very lucky in recently receiving one of the new pilot cars with a computer inside it and enhanced Wi-Fi, which is like a Garda station in itself.  The residents, however, want a station on their doorstep, even for simple things such as getting a passport signed or to report petty crimes.  There is not a huge crime problem in Castletroy but the residents feel very vulnerable without a visible station and garda&iacute; on the ground</p></speech>

He holds primary responsibility for the effective and efficient use of the resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including in relation to the opening and closing of Garda stations.  As Minister, I have no direct role in the matter.  I understand that Garda management keeps under review the overall policing arrangements, including the operation of Garda stations and the assignment of personnel throughout the State, having regard to factors including crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in place on a district, divisional and regional level.  This ensures that the optimum use is made of Garda resources and that the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.</p> <p>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na building and refurbishment programme 2016-2021 includes a number of projects which reflect the priorities of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Provision of a Garda station in Castletroy, Limerick, is not included in this programme.  I very much understand that people want a visible Garda presence in their own locality.  In this context, the programme for Government commits to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  A cornerstone of this commitment is the Government plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 sworn Garda members, 2,000 reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  Further, the Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan 2016-2021 provides &euro;46 millìon for investment in the Garda fleet, to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose fleet.  This is in addition to the investment of almost &euro;30 million in the period 2013 to 2015.  In total, almost &euro;44 million has been invested in the fleet in the period from 2013 to end of 2017, with some 2,000 vehicles coming on stream in that period.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charles Flanagan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am informed by the Commissioner that the overall strength of the Limerick division as of 28 February 2018, the latest date for which figures are available, was 559.  In addition, I am informed that as at 22 March 2018, some 80 vehicles were available to the Limerick division.  I am further advised the area referred to by Senator Byrne is policed by the Henry Street Garda district.  The strength in Henry Street was 312 as of 28 February.  Where required and appropriate, the work of local Garda in the Limerick division is further supported by a number of Garda national units such as the armed support unit, the national bureau of criminal investigation, the Garda national economic crime bureau and the Garda national drugs and organised crime bureau.  The Senator will be aware that the closure of the Garda College in 2010 and the moratorium imposed at that time had a negative impact on Garda numbers across all divisions, including in Limerick.  Since the Government reopened the college in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  Of these, 36 have been assigned to the Henry Street Garda district.  I understand the point made by Senator Byrne about the Castletroy area.  I have taken careful note of what she said.   </p><p>I expect the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and enhance visibility within our communities, enabling the Garda Commissioner to provide additional resources across all divisions in accordance with identified operational need as new Garda recruits continue to come on stream.  The 2005 Act provides for the establishment of a joint policing committee, JPC, in each local authority administrative area.  The function of the JPCs is to serve as a forum for consultations, discussions and recommendations.  There are 15 members of the JPC in Limerick.  In addition, there are five Oireachtas Members, two members nominated by the garda&iacute;, two local authority officials and seven community representatives.  </p><p>I encourage Senator Byrne to engage directly with members, including the garda&iacute;, at the local JPC where input can be made on policing plans for the local area.</p><p>It is important to note that the question of the dispersal and use of resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the delivery of policing services to local communities is under consideration by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate.  The appropriate structures and management arrangements for the most effective delivery of policing services are under consideration by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  I expect both bodies to report to me later this year and I look forward to studying both reports.  In the meantime, consideration should be given by the local joint policing committee to the matter of the station, in conjunction with local garda&iacute;, to see how we can advance the matter, as has been submitted by Senator Byrne.   </p></speech>

Access to the 1901 and 1911 census returns for the entire island of Ireland has been available for public research for around 50 years.  The digitisation of the 1901 and 1911 census returns by the National Archives has provided a wonderful national heritage resource, which is freely available via the Internet.  Its phenomenal success has greatly increased the interest among members of Ireland's diaspora in their ancestral links to Ireland.</p> <p>Cabinet papers are made available after 30 years and they frequently contain sensitive material which can make or break reputations and provide a fuller picture of how Government operated at the time.  Could we accept a situation in which some material in our census is classified and other material is not as happens with some police records where examinations are made of what may or may not be released?  I would like to hear what the Minister of State has to say on that point. </p> <p>A period of 100 years is too restrictive.  Back in 1993 this issue was discussed in the Seanad Chamber and I think it was Senator Manning who noted that the most turbulent period in modern Irish history ensued in the years following the censuses of 1901 and 1911.  The outbreak of the First World War, in which around 49,000 Irish men were killed, occurred in 1914.  The Easter Rising was in 1916 and the First D&aacute;il met in 1919.  There is a black hole in our memory.  I have a Bill that would allow for the release of the census.  It would give special heritage status to the 1926 census and bridge the gap in our records covering this very important period from 1911 to 1926.  What is the likelihood of the Department being up for that?  Would representatives from the Department have conversations with us on that likelihood?</p></speech>

T&aacute;im thar a bheith s&aacute;sta a bheith ar ais sa Seanad.</p> <p>I thank the Senator for raising the matter.  The census of population 1926 is an historic collection of great value and interest for historians, researchers, the general public and the diaspora.  There has been great interest in previous releases.  While I acknowledge the historical significance of and keen interest in these data, it is not possible to release the records at this time.  </p> <p>The Statistics Act 1993 prevents the release of census forms until 100 years after the date of the relevant census for reasons of confidentiality.  The 1926 census of population was undertaken under the 1926 Statistics Act, which did not permit any access to census records at any time.  However, the Statistics Act 1993 repealed the 1926 and 1946 Acts and provided for the release of census forms from the 1926 census and all later censuses 100 years after the date of the relevant census.  The 100-year period strikes the right balance between facilitating legitimate historical and sociological research while protecting the confidentiality of census data and the integrity of CSO procedures.  The CSO considers that any amendments to the 1993 Statistics Act to allow for the early release of the census data before 100 years have passed could seriously undermine public confidence in the CSO and damage the credibility of the present day confidentiality guarantee.  </p> <p>The confidentiality of all statistical returns from individuals, households and business, including the 1926 census records, is guaranteed by law, and this guarantee is the cornerstone of all CSO surveys, not least of censuses of population.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Joe McHugh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2018"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2018&amp;amp;pid=JoeMcHugh&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Independence, objectivity and the guarantee of confidentiality are the core values of official statistics which have helped create a positive image of, and ensure public trust in, official statistics in Ireland.  Any action that could lead to a weakening of that public trust would be detrimental, not just to the census of population but also to the broader activities of the CSO covering areas such as economic, business and social statistics.  Concerns about data protection are increasing all the time and it is vitally important the CSO maintains the trust of all sectors of the community in this regard.</p><p>In addition to the legal and confidentiality issues, practical issues arise.  Extensive preparatory work is required to prepare the 1926 census returns for digitisation as no database-microfilm exists, as was the case for the 1901 and 1911 censuses project.</p><p>The Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht established a 1926 census working group, comprising officials from the relevant organisations, that is, that Department, the National Archives and the Central Statistics Office, to consider how best to enable the publication of the 1926 census records.</p><p>The task of preserving and digitising the 100 year old documents would have to be undertaken by the National Archives.  There is a three stage process, as follows: one, conservation of the 100 year old census forms; two, scanning; and three, indexing and digitising the information so that people can quickly identify and find the specific information they seek.</p><p>The project will require significant additional financial, staffing and infrastructural resources in the National Archives.  The archives are working towards building the necessary capacity to undertake and oversee the census, including a warehouse development plan and increasing its cohort of archivists as funding allows.  As the necessary capacity is being acquired, the census project will be a priority for the National Archives once the decade of commemorations projects have been completed.</p><p>For the reasons outlined, while the Government fully understands the importance of the 1926 census, regrettably, it is not possible to facilitate the early release of these records.</p></speech>

Even with regard to the Minister of State's own brief, the 15 year period would have enormous cultural and linguistic significance in that the Gaeltacht areas were much more extensive with Irish speakers existing in counties that today have no Gaeltachta&iacute; within their borders, and yet the Irish language and culture had the backing of the new State.</p> <p>I am concerned about this black hole in our nation's memory as we move through the centenary celebrations.  It is similar to the lack of progress around a digital legal deposit which means future researchers will not have the ability to research current issues, such as the campaigns on the referendum for civil marriage equality and repeal of the eighth referendum, where websites disappear within 100 days.  There are parallels in the lack of progress on these issues.</p> <p>Would it be possible to meet officials in the Department to discuss the issue?  As I mentioned, I have a Bill on the Order Paper which seeks to create a special status around this legislation.  I would be interested in following this up in a meeting with officials in the Department, if that was possible.</p></speech>

My apologies.  When children are placed in foster care they are essentially placed in the care of the State through the mechanism of the HSE.  Those children are the most vulnerable children in the State and are due the best protection and safeguards the State can afford.  The children in Galway were cruelly let down by the State, not 70 years ago, but in the past two decades.  How did we allow that to prevail under our watch?  There must be an independent investigation into how the HSE handled the case from the date of the initial allegation made by this lady, to date.</p> <p>There are serious questions to be answered regarding the placement and safeguarding of children in the State.  We learned recently in a report into foster services in Dublin South-Central that families were not vetted and in some cases no checks had been carried out for a period of three years.  Now we do not need to imagine the damage that can be caused in a three-year period, as the case highlighted on "Prime Time" last night shows exactly the result of such negligence and neglect of children.</p> <p>Can the Minister be sure that adequate resources are given to Tusla to deal with child protection matters?  Do we have enough social workers?  Do the social workers have adequate support to deal with their caseload?  Do foster families, the majority of whom do fantastic work, have adequate support?  Clearly, confidence in the system is diminishing if it is not gone absolutely.  What radical changes are going to be made to ensure this does not happen again?  The Minister needs to come to the House to address this matter.</p> <p>The second issue I wish to raise relates to tracker mortgages.  I commend the work of the Central Bank today and Members of the Oireachtas, including my own colleagues, Deputy Michael McGrath and Deputy John McGuinness, who have kept the heat on the banks to ensure that those who had their tracker mortgage rates wrongly removed were compensated.  I have learned today that a further 3,400 customers have been identified by the Central Bank, bringing the total number of customers affected to 37,100.  Many of those people have been compensated and some of the compensation packages have been fair while others have not.  I ask the Minister for Finance to ensure the banks implicated compensate fairly and expeditiously those who were wrongly denied their tracker rate.</p> <p>The third issue I wish to raise relates to the increase in fees for certain courses in Kylemore College, which is run by the City of Dublin Education and Training Board.  We have seen increases of 50% for certain courses and those fees cannot be justified where incomes have not been increased on a commensurate level.  No forewarning was given to many of the students who were given one month's notice to come up with the extra fees.  Ultimately, that is not fair.  I call on the Minister for Education and Skills to come to the House to explain why the increases at Kylemore College have been introduced.</p></speech>

I am deeply concerned at the absence of the BCG vaccination, which was used for TB.  I understand there are virtually no stocks of BCG left in the country.  With the immigration that has taken place over the years, I understand as many as ten people a week are being diagnosed with TB.  In addition, the meningitis B vaccine has been denied to some children while other children are getting it.  I heard a story yesterday that I found difficult to believe but I verified it.  A three year old child is not immunised against meningitis B whereas her four month old sister can be, free of charge.  </p><p>If the mother wants to have the three year old vaccinated, she has pay to &euro;350.  We all know the damage meningitis can do to children.  We need the Minister for Health to come in.  We need answers on the BCG vaccination and TB.  If TB is on the increase we need to see the vaccine made available again.  We also need the meningitis B vaccine for young children to be made freely available to all and not just a select few.  </p><p>On a side issue, as the Leader knows, I have spoken a number of times on the Defence Forces over the last couple of days.  This morning I was told that in the Leader's own bailiwick of Cork, members of the Naval Service are waiting months for duty pay.  Apparently, the same applies in the Air Corps but not so much in the Army.  I ask the Leader to get an answer on that for me.  What is the logjam?  What is holding it up?  When people are depending on something like the family income supplement, it is not good enough that duty pay is not paid in a timely fashion.</p></speech>

He is correct.  Mr. Carroll had a long history with this House.</p> <p>The eastern region is facing many challenges.  Newspapers and the media are talking about the water supply coming from the Shannon to Dublin and tackling the leakage in the city centre.  At the same time we are looking at transport challenges.  I refer to the MetroLink running from the airport to Swords to Sandyford.  Where 40% of the population lives, we are going to see many challenges.  I refer to the necessity for joined-up thinking in dealing with these challenges over the next ten years.</p> <p>On many occasions, Senator McDowell has raised the issue of the metro in the city.  I am anxious about it as well and would like to see the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, come to the House for a debate on this major infrastructural proposal.  It not only affects Dublin city, but will have a huge impact on the development of our nation.  I would be grateful if the Leader, at his earliest convenience, could organisation that debate.  We are talking in the region of &euro;3 billion being spent.  We have to ensure we are getting value for money.  I refer to the Luas green line being closed for a year, and possibly two, and the impact that will have on transport in our city during that period.  Therefore, I would be grateful if the Minister would come in to discuss this important matter relevant to his brief.  Deputy Ross was in the newspapers this morning in regard to the appointment of judges but it is important that he come into this House to discuss the issues for which he has direct responsibility.</p></speech>

Anyone who watched "RT&Eacute; Investigates" last night could not help but be really moved and disturbed by Ms Barry telling her story.  I commend her for her bravery and the other girls too.  We have these isolated cases reported.  We should not have to rely on television or the national broadcaster to bring these stories forward.  We know that when we watch one such story that there are many more people across this country in the same position.  Many of them have never been reported.  Others were reported but were never listened to.  Others went to the Garda but things were never processed.  Like others who survived horrific abuse, their strength and courage is beyond remarkable.</p> <p>What makes this case even more abhorrent is that the continuation of this abuse was openly facilitated by our State.  It was facilitated to continue.  As if that was not enough, the trial they had to endure to bring the perpetrator to account inflicted further torture on these young girls.  Ms Barry described her experience within the court last night.  That has to be changed.  We have a responsibility as legislators to do that.  I know the Domestic Violence Bill is going through the D&aacute;il this week.  However, there is much more we need to do.  She went through all that in the trial just for him to get seven and a half years.  That is not justice.  Surely, no one can argue now against the introduction of sentencing guidelines that should be drafted by a sentencing committee.  This would not encroach on the separation of powers or the autonomy of the Bench.  However, it would ensure that prison sentences are proportionate to the crime committed.  Day after day, we see perpetrators of domestic violence and abuse being let off, being given the most lenient sentences one could imagine and even being given suspended sentences as late as yesterday.</p> <p>Until we do that, women and children will continue to be failed by this State.  An independent inspection must be held as to how and why these children were failed.  Was it the lack of social workers?  For years, and indeed decades, under successive Governments, it has been said that there are not enough social workers and that the social workers that are there have impossible caseloads.  Watching that programme last night, and because we do not have enough social workers or the protection in place, it crossed my mind as to how many children were being raped last night?  How many children were being abused last night?  </p> <p>I commend the wonderful foster families that provide loving, secure homes for children.  I know many of them personally.  The vast majority of foster families really do provide loving, secure homes.  However, we are not just talking about foster homes.  We are talking about sexual abuse and abuse that happens in and outside many homes across the country.  I encourage other families to come forward and to offer their homes to children who can no longer live with their biological parents.</p></speech>

I believe she understands that, judging by the later part of her article.  No one wants to contemplate a collapse and a no-deal situation.  She misrepresents many of the statements from the Oireachtas as being an ultimatum, which is not our intention.  I do not doubt that the negotiators - the British Minister, Mr. Davis, and his team, and Mr. Barnier and his team - are competent and able people.</p> <p>However, I agree with Ms Dodds on one matter.  The trade talks will be the key to removing a no-deal scenario from the table once and for all.  There is no question of a border on the Irish Sea.  That is not in our interests either.  I mean no disrespect, but our east-west trade is worth more than our North-South trade.  That said, of course we want a seamless Border.</p> <p>People will have to learn to be patient while the negotiations are under way.  In any negotiation, there has to be give and take and compromises have to be made.  There must be some form of a comprehensive, overall UK-EU customs partnership - a customs union in another guise, under another name or whatever.  That would not be beyond the wordsmiths, lawyers and everyone else.</p></speech>

It will look after the interests of regional newspapers well and allow them editorial independence and responsibility.</p><p>That the Government did not make a decision on the proposed takeover by Independent News &amp;amp; Media, INM, of Celtic Media was a major error, in that it could have put those local newspapers in jeopardy.  I call on the Minister to be decisive and approve the deal.  He should not allow this to linger.  He should not be scared by the reaction to the non-decision on INM and Celtic Media.  Grasp the nettle, do not let the horse bolt, make a decision and be decisive.  Do not be concerned about criticism from any party.  Get the file.

I support Senator Humphreys regarding MetroLink and its potential effects.  The House needs to understand what the plans are and whether there is a plan B, C or D.  I raise this matter primarily in respect of the Na Fianna GAA club in the Glasnevin-Drumcondra area.  Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael has roughly 1 million members, including 500,000 active playing members.  Na Fianna has approximately 3,000 members, owns one pitch and is in active use of two other pitches.  Removing its pitch will ruin its community and the GAA in the area for at least six years and the schools will be badly affected.  In many cases, the GAA is the backbone of various schools' recreational activities.  There are a number of primary and secondary schools in the area, including Scoil Mobh&iacute;.  The club will appear before the transport committee after lunch today to raise its concerns.</p> <p>I call on the House to support the Na Fianna club in the challenges it faces.  As important as that, will the Leader invite the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to the House?  I support Senator Humphreys's call in that regard.  Senator O'Mahony, whom I spoke with about the situation this morning, also supports the call.  He is able to speak for himself on the matter.  Will the Leader invite the Minister to tell the House about the options as regards MetroLink?</p> <p>Unlike some people, I am in favour of a proper rail system for Dublin's north city and county.

The proposal to reintroduce bonuses at AIB is disgraceful and I welcome the fact that the Minister will be opposing it.</p> <p>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to the House to debate the issue of tax reliefs.  If we are looking at a situation where banks are seeking to restore a bonus culture against the background, for example, of AIB making &euro;1.9 billion in pre-tax profits, then we need to reconsider the fact that they can write off current profits against past losses.  It is not appropriate that the construction industry, which is also making substantial profits again, and the banks are able to effectively avoid paying tax and avoid contributing to the State and to the citizens who bailed them out.  I would like the Minister to go further than opposing bankers' bonuses and to re-examine the tax reliefs or write offs that are being enjoyed by the banks.</p> <p>I join Senator Humphreys and the Cathaoirleach in noting the passing of former Senator John Carroll who served in this House between 1981 and 1982.  He also made an extraordinary contribution to the trade union movement over almost five decades, with SIPTU and prior to that as vice president and president of the ITGWU.  He made a huge contribution in the areas of wage bargaining and payment systems in this State.</p> <p>As well as his work for the trade union movement, he was also an activist in other areas.  He was one of the people who led the campaigning in respect of Carnsore Point and the question of nuclear power.  This is an issue of great concern today in the context of the proposed Hinckley Point nuclear power station in the UK, on which Senator Grace O'Sullivan has worked extensively.</p> <p>I wanted to add my voice to those commemorating John Carroll and the contribution he made to national life.  As we note the contribution of trade unionists and the trade union movement to the public good in Ireland and in the context of my call for a debate on taxation and tax reliefs, we need to restore the tax relief for trade union membership, given that other professional bodies enjoy that tax relief.</p></speech>

I propose that we take No. 17 on the Order Paper before No. 1.  We know that LGBT people form loving, stable and committed relationships equivalent to heterosexual families and the people's support for the civil marriage equality referendum was recognition of that fact.  There is no scientific evidence to suggest that we can change or eliminate sexual orientation, although there is evidence to say that we can self-label our sexual orientation.  However, the outcomes are temporary and always unpredictable.  I want to thank the 20 Senators from all sides of this House who have co-signed the Prohibition of Conversion Therapies Bill 2018.  This is a Bill that will prohibit conversion therapy as a deceptive and harmful act or practice against a person's sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression.</p><p>A couple of month's ago the European Parliament passed a motion that reads as follows: &quot;The European Parliament [...] welcomes initiatives prohibiting LGBTI conversion therapies and banning the pathologisation of trans identities and urges all Member States to adopt similar measures that respect and uphold the right to gender identity and gender expression&quot;.  Malta has legislated to prohibit the practice of conversion therapy, as have nine American states.  The UN Committee Against Torture has expressed its concern over the dangerous and discredited practice.  There are organisations providing this service in Ireland.  However, the Irish Council for Psychotherapy has stated that efforts to change, manipulate or reverse sexual orientation and-or gender identity through psychological therapies are unethical, in accordance with its guidelines.  The State should adopt that position and apply it legislatively.  The Prohibition of Conversion Therapies Bill does so.  </p><p>In terms of LGBT people's experiences of mental health services, a survey by Trinity College and UCD was published in the <i>International Journal of Mental Health Nursing</i>in 2014.  That survey noted many negative experiences of mental health services, with 66% of respondents experiencing an assumption that they were heterosexual.  A full 29% of respondents experienced a negative reaction when they disclosed their LGBT identity, with 21% reporting comments to the effect that their LGBT identity was &quot;just a phase&quot;.  Crucially, 13% were advised that their sexual orientation could be changed to a heterosexual one.  </p><p>Brazil was one of the first countries in the world to prohibit conversion therapy but that decision was overturned recently.  Brazilians, more than any other non-EU nationals, come to study in Ireland in large numbers and their influence has been felt and welcomed among our LGBT community.  Ireland must be a beacon of hope for people everywhere and it is in that context that I am proposing that we amend the Order of Business and take No. 17 before No. 1.</p></speech>

McManus to bring the Ryder Cup to Ireland in 2026.  We have been very lucky in this country to have had people like Dr. Michael Smurfit and J.P. McManus to drive and promote golf in this country.  There are 420 golf courses in Ireland.  Indeed, there are more golf courses per head of population here than in any other country in the world.  Ireland is also the cheapest place in the world to play golf.</p> <p>I am delighted that Mr. McManus has decided to put in a bid to host the Ryder Cup in 2026 but he needs the support of the Government.  I support Senator Byrne's call for the Government, from the Taoiseach down, to get behind Mr. McManus in his bid to bring the Ryder Cup to Adare Manor in the mid-west.  The manor is surrounded by a good road network and there is an airport nearby.  It has all of the facilities needed to host such an event.</p> <p>The last time the Ryder Cup was held here was 2006.  In 1997 and 1998 the then Government rowed in behind Dr. Smurfit's efforts to bring the competition to the K Club.  A lot of work and advance planning has to be done and we are lucky that Mr. McManus is willing to put his money, his property and his facilities forward in a bid to host what is one of the biggest golfing events in the world, which takes place every two years.  There is a great need to disperse tourists when they come here, to encourage them to head west from our eastern seaboard and hosting the Ryder Cup will put us on the world stage.  I fully support Senator Byrne's remarks.</p></speech>

He was a very fine trumpeter and I well remember in the 1970s that he, along with others like Johnny Logan, very courageously took part in a concert I organised in the Olympia Theatre to raise funds for the legal action I was taking at that point.  It was very courageous of him to do so.  We managed to succeed in only losing &pound;4 because we had conflicted with a walk led by the ghastly Jimmy Saville.</p> <p>In those days, I took part in quite a number of protest marches including several organised by the Dublin Housing Action Committee as well as the PAYE marches.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We always had a brass band and it was often led by John Carroll.  It was the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers' Union brass band.  He is a loss to this community.</p><p>I support the call of my colleagues for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, to come to the House to discuss the MetroLink project.  I have heard an awful lot of drivel spoken.  Only today, I heard two people.  Senator McDowell was talking about it.  He is concerned and worried, etc.  The Senator stated that for the cost of the MetroLink, one could put in ten Luas lines.  What a vision.  Given that two Luas lines have created havoc and traffic chaos, another ten would be wonderful.  I do not know where these people are dragged up from.</p><p>Then we had that person, Mr. Colm McCarthy, who is actually an interesting economist.  He talked about buses, stating that for the cost of the MetroLink one could flood Dublin with buses.  I do not know where Mr. McCarthy lives.  He must live under a stone somewhere in Sandycove because if one looks at Nassau Street, it is buses end to end already the entire length of the street.  One can hardly squeeze a bicycle between them.  I do not know what on earth these two people are talking about - one of them trying to flood the city with Luas lines which cannot possibly work and the other trying to flood them with buses.</p><p>The real disaster is we should have built a full underground system in the beginning.  The Luas is a catastrophic mistake and we will be paying for it for years.  I say that despite the fact it is highly convenient for me.  I can get onto it in Parnell Street, whizz down to Dawson Street and trickle across here.  On the way home, if I get one marked "Parnell", I can get on in Dawson Street and whizz back up to the northside to within 100 yards of my house.  It is convenient for me but it is a disaster for the city.</p></speech>

This morning, like colleagues here, I attended a presentation in the AV room by the Passport Office.  I compliment and thank the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, for arranging that presentation.  It was worthwhile and, indeed, timely because from now on is the time of year when many think of taking a break or going abroad for a holiday to recharge the batteries.  The key message that came from the staff of the Passport Office, whom I compliment for their good work, was the request to ask people to check before they book.  That is the most important sentence that came out of it.  We all know of cases, and many Members are contacted on a daily basis, where people have booked a holiday two weeks or less before they are due to go, only to discover that one of their passports is out of date.  We all know the anxiety that particular experience causes people.</p> <p>As the House will be aware, we have two passport offices in this country - one in Dublin and one in Cork.  Unfortunately, as with many services, if one draws a line from Dublin to Galway, they are non-existent north of that line.  The Passport Office is yet another example of that.  At a time when we are experiencing a rise in the number of applications from Northern Ireland due to Brexit, it is timely that we would look again at locating a sub-office to cater for the northern half of the country.  A location such as Monaghan or Cavan would be ideal from a geographic perspective because if one lives in north Derry or north Donegal and has to travel to Dublin, it is a four and a half hour journey.  It is timely that we should do that.  I ask the Leader to ask the T&aacute;naiste to come in to the Chamber so that we can discuss this issue.</p> <p>Another simple possible solution to avoid this issue of passports going out of date - the T&aacute;naiste might intervene here - would be if the travel agents and airlines would have a precondition that before accepting a booking they would have to ensure that the passport is in date.  A further simple solution would be that the Passport Office would contact individuals, perhaps six months in advance, to advise them of their passport going out of date.  It could save travellers a great deal of stress and annoyance.  In summary, I ask the Leader to ask the T&aacute;naiste to come to the Chamber to have a discussion on this issue.</p></speech>

First, I formerly second the amendment to the Order of Business that Senator Warfield outlined.</p> <p>I will touch briefly on last night's "RT&Eacute; Investigates".  Without commenting in detail, it is timely and appropriate that we would have the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, come back to the House.  The Minister was here previously and we had a long and protracted debate about Tusla.  It was clear from last night's programme that those three brave women who had to put in the public domain their story did a service to the people of this country to give confidence to others to be able to come forward and report what is horrific abuse.  I pay tribute to "RT&Eacute; Investigates" for the sensitive way in which it dealt with that particular programme.</p> <p>I ask the Leader if he would consider, when appropriate, in the timescale the Minister has available to her, that she could come specifically to talk about progress regarding Tusla and maybe to touch on some of the commitments that the Minister gave us on her last visit here when she talked about the need to increase the number of social workers.  The Minister explained that she was seeking further funding from Government.  In last night's programme, yet again, we heard stories from people regarding the shortage of social workers.  That is not the Minister's fault.  That is not the Government's fault.  We need to be seen.  We need to do everything possible to train, secure, fund and resource social workers to support children who are in care who cannot be fostered for various reasons, but also to monitor and act as an advocate and a link for them within the social services.</p></speech>

McManus's bid to host the Ryder Cup.  It would be phenomenal for the mid-west if that were to happen.  I would also like the Government to see if it can facilitate Lahinch in County Clare hosting the Irish Open next year.  I believe it probably has an excellent chance of succeeding.  Certainly, that would help my region, the west of Ireland and County Clare if it happened.</p> <p>Like Senator Boyhan, my main purpose for speaking today is to commend the bravery of those who appeared on "RT&Eacute; Investigates" last night and to commend Ms Aoife Hegarty and the "RT&Eacute; Investigates" team for the incredible work they are doing in exposing serious wrongs in the State.  It is only a short few weeks ago that there was a public outcry over a bishop saying a mass at a particular priest's funeral, and rightly so.  That outcry was correct and proper, but I have not yet heard of anybody resigning from the HSE over what happened in this particular case.</p> <p>I believe that people should be held accountable.  It is not good enough.  There comes a time when heads need to roll and accountability has to apply and be seen to apply.  It is simply not good enough that those people were put through what they have been put through.  This is not the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s or 1990s.  This is only a few years ago.  It is time our society learned and that heads rolled and people lost their jobs over the decisions they make.  It is appropriate that we should have the Minister for Health and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in here to debate the protocols that are in place.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is only a few years ago and who is to say it is still not happening?

It was an interesting Seanad and among the 11 Taoiseach's appointees were James Dooge and four Labour Party Senators, including Timmy Conway. the late John Carroll, Pat Magner and Paddy Dunne.  Jim Higgins was also there, as was T. K. Whitaker, a man I had the good fortune to meet and for whom I had great admiration, though he took no Whip.  May Mr. Carroll rest in peace.

He was a giant within the trade union movement and for those of us who grew up in the 1970s and 1980s, he was a familiar face on television, not to mention a voice on radio, advocating for union members, collective bargaining and the rights of workers.  His role in the amalgamation of the IGTWU and the Federated Workers Trade Union, which became SIPTU, brought him much acclaim within the trade union movement.  He was a person of huge intellect and compassion and a man who focused on the rights of workers and the most vulnerable in our society.  On behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I offer the deepest condolences to his family on his sad passing.</p> <p>Senators Ardagh, Conway-Walsh, Boyhan and Conway raised last night's "Prime Time" programme.  I did not see the programme in its entirety as I was on "The Late Debate" with Senator Higgins on the radio but we certainly owe a debt of gratitude to the three women involved for their bravery in allowing their anonymity to be waived in order to shine a light on the harrowing experience they had.  It is far too easy to issue words of condemnation but this should not be happening in our society.  I agree with Senator Conway that somebody must be held to account for what happened.  There is no excuse.  We can blame systems or a lack of social workers.  We can blame a lack of money or we can say there was too much money but there was a failure of accountability which needs to be dealt with.  Three lives have been ruined and, as the Senators said, it is important we learn from this and put in place safeguards to protect the most vulnerable.  In this case, it was young children in foster care, which is meant to be a safe and secure environment and it is unacceptable that an apology was only issued by the HSE on foot of a "Prime Time" programme.  I do not try to be populist and there are very good people working in Tusla who are doing a tremendous job, but this is unacceptable.</p> <p>I would be very happy for the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, to come to the House to discuss the matter.  When I was Chairman of the health committee, I worked with the first Minister for Children and Youth to sit at Cabinet, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.  We dealt with the Children First guidelines and put in place HIQA and we all thought we would see an end to the inept maltreatment of children in care.  It is harrowing to read the reports this morning.  It is not all about money because the budget for Tusla was increased and 300 new staff were recruited.  If there is a deficit of social workers, why is that the case?  We must draw a line under this awfully upsetting era.  It is about people who are vulnerable being treated appallingly.  I agree with Senator Conway-Walsh that they were let down by the State.  There is a duty of care on all of us and a duty to hold people to account.  We, in these Houses, are held to account by the electorate, whether by popular vote in the Lower House or election to the Seanad, and it is about time there was accountability for people who operate and manage services.  I appreciate the good work that is done by many people but we must not allow this to continue.</p> <p>Senator Ardagh asked about tracker mortgages.  I commend the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach on their work in this area.  The Taoiseach said the behaviour of banks towards people on tracker mortgages was scandalous.  The banks have been dragging their feet and there is a human cost, as we are beginning to see.  People have lost their homes and investment properties and there are mental health and well-being implications to that.  I hope we can bring resolution to this as these are human beings.  We require banks to work with them and for trust to be re-established.</p> <p>Senator Ardagh also raised an issue regarding Kylemore College.  I am sure it is a matter for the ETB in Dublin but any increase in costs needs to be justified.  I hope we do not preclude people from entering or returning to education.</p> <p>Senator Craughwell raised the HPV and BCG vaccinations.  Yesterday was World Meningitis Day and one in five of 24 and 25 year olds can die from contacting meningitis so it is important that we have a vaccination programme.  A new social media campaign, #24youhavethepower, was launched to coincide with the day and when he was Minister for Health, the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, introduced free meningitis B vaccinations for infants, making us only the second country in Europe to do that.  We also need a strong campaign around vaccination.  The BCG vaccination for TB expired three years ago, in 2015, and an independent immunisation group established that the vaccination was not advisable but I would be happy for the Minister to come to the House to debate the issue.  We will have a debate on the Defence Forces next week.  It is disappointing to hear that there are members of the Naval Service, the Army and the Air Corps who are not receiving their pay.  Duty payments should be made promptly and expeditiously.</p> <p>Senators Humphreys, &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh and Norris asked about the MetroLink, as Senator Ardagh did on the Order of Business yesterday.  I am happy for the Minister to come to this House on the issue.  There is a consultation process until 11 May in which members of the public can submit their views and opinions and a number of public consultation meetings will take place.  I ask all Members to advise people to go along and make their views known.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As I said yesterday, I fully understand the concerns of Members, the residents and members of Na Fianna about the implications of this for them and, in the case of the sporting club, for the GAA.  It is important that we have a conversation around public transport and connectivity.  I pose the question to Senator Norris: what would an underground Luas have cost?  It is easy to come in here and say we should do it, but what would be the cost of that?  Perhaps that debate needs to be happen and I would be happy to have the Minister, Deputy Ross, come to the House to debate it as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>Senator Paul Coghlan raised the issue of Brexit.  We will have a debate on that in the House next week.<br/><br/>I wholeheartedly concur with Senator Leyden in welcoming the decision by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission to allow for the proposed merger of <i>The Irish Times</i>and the <i>Irish Examiner</i>and the ancillary and affiliated companies and radio stations.  It is a merger we need to see happen quickly.  I commend the Crosby family who have been involved with the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, then the <i>Cork Examiner</i>, since 1872.  I thank them for their huge commitment to the people of Cork, and of Ireland, since they commenced their involvement in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>as it is now.  It is fair to say that the <i>Evening Echo</i>and the <i>Irish Examiner</i>are synonymous with Cork.  I certainly hope that the titles can be retained and that we continue to have excellent coverage of current affairs and sport in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, the <i>Evening Echo</i>and the other newspapers the Senator referenced.  I hope the Minister, Deputy Naughten, will approve the merger quickly so that we can have continuity and certainty as well as the retention of jobs.  I commend the Crosby family and all who worked and work in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>and the <i>Evening Echo</i>in Cork.<br/><br/>I disagree with the Senator on one issue.  Members of this Government have courage and conviction.  The proof of that is that our economy is recovering.</p></speech>

I congratulate J.P. McManus on Adare Manor and support Senator Byrne's request to have Government support the Ryder Cup bid for 2026.  It would be an incredible event in Limerick and would bring an economic benefit in terms of tourism to our country.  We only have to consider the coverage we would get of it across the world in terms of the imagery, the promotion and the selling of Ireland as a place where one can play golf cheaply, as Senator Burke said, but on world renowned courses.  It would be an extraordinary event to host in Adare Manor.  I commend J.P. McManus for his willingness to become part of many events in Limerick to support charities, whether it is educational bursaries, sporting clubs or to help vulnerable people in society.  We can criticise people but, to be fair to him, he has always been to the fore in supporting causes in the Limerick region.</p> <p>Senator Alice-Mary Higgins raised the issue of tax relief.  I would be happy to have that debate as part of future debates in the House.</p> <p>I am happy to accept Senator Warfield's amendment to the Order of Business.  I commend him for bringing forward the Bill.  We will not have the debate now but his contribution to the Order of Business is one we should support.  As Leader of the House, I was happy to co-sign the Bill and be associated with it because it is an important debate.  It is also about leading change, not just in this country but across the world.  I commend him for his work on that.</p> <p>Senator Gallagher raised the issue of the passport office.  The Senator's second suggestion on the issue of the precondition for booking should be taken up.  I had an experience in early January when I was taking a flight.  I arrived at the gate.  I knew my passport expired in March but I was told I might not be able to travel.  It is about awareness.  The Senator has put forward a very good idea and I support him on that.</p> <p>Equally, the issue of a new passport office is one we need to examine because of a growing population.  We have an office in Dublin and one in Cork, which is an excellent facility.  I thank the people who work in the Cork passport office because they do tremendous work in terms of their dedication, delivery and courtesy.  There is merit in the Senator's suggestion to open the passport office in another venue.  As a way of explaining his request, he might raise it as a Commencement matter.  His second suggestion is one on which we should go to the Minister in unison and say it is a way of alerting people because the number of people who on the day of travel, or the week before, discover their documents are not in order is surprising and alarming.  I suppose it is a sign of a recovering economy that people are travelling again.  The Senator's suggestions are worth mentioning.</p> <p>I referenced Senator Boyhan in terms of the case he raised.  It is important that the Minister, Deputy Zappone, comes to the House.</p> <p>Senator Conway raised the issue of Lahinch and the Irish Open.  I would be happy to lend my support to that suggestion as well.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-04-25a.134" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1356" speakername="Andrew Doyle" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018042500002#P00300"><p>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach and Members of the Seanad for this opportunity to discuss forestry and to acknowledge the important contribution that forestry makes to our economy, our environment and our society.  While we can see the obvious benefits of forestry such as loads of timber, logs and planks being transported on our roads, the cars of workers outside timber processing plants, firewood and timber products, the contribution of forestry in other ways, for example, to climate change mitigation, biodiversity and water quality, may not always be fully understood or appreciated.  I propose to outline the development of Irish forestry to date, the way in which we are seeking to continue the progress and the benefits we derive from our investment.</p> <p>While the State started from a very low base with forest cover of less than 1.5% of Ireland&rsquo;s land area - or just 125,000 ha of forests - in the early 1900s, this has steadily increased over the 20th century.  The bulk of this increase occurred since the late 1980s, following the introduction of State and, subsequently, EU funding towards the establishment of private forests.  While the findings of the most recent national forestry inventory are due to be published shortly, the second such inventory found that the area of forest cover in Ireland in 2012 was nearly 732,000 ha, or 10.5% of the land area.  Senators will agree that this was a significant increase, one outcome of which is a vibrant export-oriented timber industry with more than 75% of the output of Ireland&rsquo;s saw milling and 80% of wood-based panel production being exported.  It should also be noted that the overall Irish forest industry, comprising growing, harvesting and processing of forest products, contributes &euro;2.3 billion to the national economy, generates annual exports of over &euro;350 million and employs more than 12,000 people.</p> <p>The economic activity of the forest sector is spread through every region of the State and makes an important contribution to regional development and the rural economy.  Forestry also represents a significant income stream for landowners.  My Department issues payments annually in respect of grant-aided forests to more than 15,000 forest owners, the majority of whom are farmers.  In 2017, a total capital expenditure of nearly &euro;100 million was paid under the forestry schemes with grants, premiums and funding for other support measures such as assistance towards building of forest roads to facilitate the management, thinning and harvesting of the timber crop.  The timber crop itself also provides a valuable and increasingly important income stream.</p> <p>The current forestry programme, under which my Department operates forestry schemes such as the afforestation scheme, runs to 2020.  The programme offers an ambitious and attractive set of forestry measures aimed at increasing timber production while at the same time improving the quality of our natural environment.  The achievement of these objectives involves the commitment of &euro;482 million over the period of the programme.  This level of investment will facilitate an increase in forest cover by almost 44,000 ha and the construction of 690 km of forest roads.</p> <p>A recent mid-term review of the forestry programme found, however, that there has been a shortfall in overall planting levels, compared to the targets in the programme, and that the proportion of broadleaf planting is not meeting the annual target.  The measures in the programme were re-examined and have now been enhanced with the aim of increasing planting levels and introducing greater diversity in terms of the species being planted, with a particular emphasis on increasing the percentage of broadleaf cover.  Forests serve a multi-functional role, which I will elaborate on later.  In view of this function, the enhanced measures also aim to support Government policy in other areas.  For example, the introduction of improved grant and premium rates for agroforestry and forestry for fibre, while aimed at encouraging more farmers to see forestry as part of their farming mix, may also contribute to biomass supply in support of the proposed support scheme for renewable heat.</p> <p>Native woodlands established along sensitive watercourses can deliver a range of water-related ecosystem services and can form part of the toolbox of measures the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and others might consider for strategic deployment under the river basin management plan.  I will shortly be launching a woodlands for water measure, the aim of which will be to deliver meaningful ecosystem services that protect and enhance water quality and aquatic ecosystems.  Further incentives such as higher rates and measures to protect broadleaf woodlands against deer damage have been put in place following the midterm review to encourage the planting of native species.  Improvements to the native woodland conservation scheme and the introduction of a continuous cover forestry scheme will also support the objectives of the National Biodiversity Action Plan 2017-2021.</p> <p>Forestry is an integral part of our landscape, a significant contributor to the economy, the environment and society and it also serves as a means to support and assist policy initiatives in other areas, as I have just outlined.  I welcome the announcement by the Government, in the context of the national development plan, of its continued support for afforestation.  Recently I announced a review of the national response to the ash dieback disease.  This includes a review of the reconstitution ash dieback scheme and the all-Ireland chalara control strategy 2013.  The review comes after a high-level stakeholder meeting in Dublin in which we received the most up-to-date scientific information on the prevalence of the disease in ash plantations in Ireland.  I believe it is time for a new approach in Ireland to ash dieback.  It is clear from the latest scientific advice that eradication here is no longer considered feasible.  Given this updated advice, our policy response must also change.</p> <p>The reconstitution ash dieback scheme will be reviewed to ensure its continued relevance and value for money, and to ensure that the forest owner is provided with a broader range of silvicultural and management options.  For farmers this new policy response will mean more options if their forests are affected with the disease and we will continue to inform and support them if they have ash dieback.  I believe that many farmers with ash dieback on larger trees would like the opportunity to grow the forest on and produce a crop of ash timber without fear of their annual premiums being stopped.  As a first step, I recently announced that the Department will no longer be ending premium payments to farmers who wish to continue managing their ash plantations where the prevalence of the disease is low.</p> <p>Among the benefits of forestry is the economic value of forestry for employment, exports and farm income.  In that context, the forest sector is playing an increasingly important role in rural development, not only through the diversification of farm income from the payment of annual forestry premiums and income from timber sales but also through the provision of sustainable rural-based employment.</p> <p>I shall now turn to the environmental benefits of forestry, which are wide ranging.  Well sited forest plantations can provide a filtration buffer preventing sedimentation from reaching sensitive watercourses; they can slow down the flow of rainwater from higher elevations thereby reducing the risk of flooding and they provide important habitats for wildlife.</p> <p>Forests also have an important role to play in climate change mitigation.  Benefits include sequestering carbon, providing an additional long term store of carbon in harvested wood and substituting non-renewable, high emissions materials and fossil fuels.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Andrew Doyle:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2170"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2170&amp;amp;pid=AndrewDoyle&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Under the provisionally agreed effort sharing regulation, up to 26.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from forests and other land uses can be accounted for in meeting our 2021 to 2030 emissions reduction target.  The majority of this will come from the State&rsquo;s investment in afforestation.  The abatement cost of afforestation is estimated to be &euro;23 per tonne which makes forestry very cost competitive as a climate change mitigation tool, particularly relative to alternative measures in the land sector.  In addition, the ability of wood to substitute for emissions-intensive materials supports other sectors in their decarbonisation efforts.  We hear increasing commentary about the bioeconomy which refers to the economic activity derived from the use of biological resources to produce food, feed materials and energy.  The concept of a bioeconomy has emerged in response to the challenges of food security, energy security, climate change and the depletion of non-renewable resources.  I understand that virtually everything that can be made from fossil resources can also be made from biological resources.  Substituting sustainably produced biomass for fossil resources facilitates decarbonisation and continued economic growth.</p><p>The Irish forestry sector has a major role to play and huge potential in the emerging bioeconomy.  This role and potential is explored in the report, Growing the Irish Forest Bioeconomy, produced by COFORD under the programme of competitive forestry research.  This report gives a comprehensive overview of the subject and the way in which the further development of forestry could contribute to Ireland&rsquo;s national policy on the bioeconomy.  It is vital that the development of the forestry sector is focused on people because forests can deliver important social benefits.  Forests, for example, provide people with opportunities to exercise, to spend time with their families in the outdoors, and to enjoy being close to nature and being surrounded by scenic landscapes.  Time spent away from the hustle and bustle of modern life can contribute to a healthier state of mind and a feeling of well-being.  For example, last year&rsquo;s green ribbon campaign included a series of six forest walks organised by the IFA in association with See Change, Coillte and Mental Health Ireland.  I understand that these "Let&rsquo;s Talk and Walk" events have been a great initiative to help get people talking openly about mental health problems, and forest trails provide a relaxing, peaceful environment for such events.</p><p>Resources within my Department are therefore focused on developing recreational and environmental aspects of woodlands which can be enjoyed by local communities and visitors alike.  This is being achieved through the enhancement of Ireland&rsquo;s native woodland resource, thereby delivering landscape and ecological benefits to society and through investment in local amenity areas in the form of so-called neighbourwoods.  Our national strategic goal for forestry is to develop an internationally competitive and sustainable forestry sector that provides a full range of economic, environmental and social benefits to society and which accords with the Forest Europe definition of sustainable forest management.  I have outlined some of those benefits.  My Department and I continue to work towards that goal through the introduction and enhancement of schemes and the roll-out of initiatives, including the development of knowledge transfer groups to assist forest owners to develop their knowledge of forestry and the design of a certification scheme to assist them to achieve forest certification.  The Department also funds forest research projects to inform our policymaking and to assist the sector ranging from nurseries, growers, processors and end users.</p><p>I hope I have given a reasonable insight into the Irish forestry sector and I look forward to hearing the contributors.  We will be taking notes.  There is an official with me from the Department, a senior forestry inspector.  I look forward to hearing the responses.</p></speech>

On behalf of my colleague, Senator Paul Daly, who is unavoidably absent, I thank the Minister of State for his opening comments.  My party, Fianna F&aacute;il, is committed to developing the forestry sector in Ireland which plays a critical role in environmental, economic and social policy.  The forestry industry, which consists of the growing, harvesting and processing of forestry, makes a massive contribution to the economy, estimated at &euro;2.2 billion per annum with around 12,000 jobs dependent on that sector.  Timber production is in the region of 3 million cu. m every year, with around 20% of this amount produced from private landowners.</p> <p>Forests, as the Minister of State has mentioned, cover 10.5% of the country&rsquo;s land area against the EU average of 38%, showing the substantial progress that has yet to be made here.</p> <p>I grew up on the fringes of Killykeen Forest Park in County Cavan, a beautiful 240 ha forest set on the shores of Lough Oughter.  That incorporates 74 acres with 28 log cabins that have recently been sold to a private entity by Coillte and I look forward to that developing in the near future for the benefit of the local community.  In the future I would like to see more investment, in Killykeen Forest Park, in particular because it is a beautiful amenity and it is open to huge development.  There could be major benefit to the local community.  Further down the road in Kingscourt in east County Cavan is the D&uacute;n a R&iacute; Forest Park which forms part of what was formerly the Cabra estate which was owned by the Pratt family.  Legend stretches back to the time of C&uacute; Chulainn, the Gaelic warrior who rested in these woods while fighting the armies of Queen Maeve of Connacht.  There is a great diversity of wildlife in the park and the flora is varied and in many areas spectacular.  Just across the border from south County Cavan, in County Longford there are plans well under way to develop a Center Parcs holiday village in Newcastle Wood.  This will be of huge economic benefit, not only to County Longford but also to the counties surrounding it, and it will bring in visitors primarily from the UK and from mainland Europe.  We welcome that development.</p> <p>It was under a Fianna F&aacute;il Government that ambitious planting targets of 10,000 ha per annum were set out in the National Development Plan 2007-2013 with more than 8,000 ha planted in 2010 alone.  Regrettably, in recent years, annual planting targets have been downgraded to 6000 to 7000 ha, significantly behind the Food Wise 2025 annual afforestation target of 15,000 ha per annum.  The recently published mid-term review of the Government&rsquo;s 2014-2020 forestry programme unfortunately confirmed this pattern, with total afforestation planting figures for the first three years of the programme, 2015 to 2017, inclusive, 7% less than the cumulative target for this period.  Shockingly, the planting targets for agroforestry, native woodlands and forestry for fibre combined were missed by 74%.  Meanwhile, overall planting targets were missed by 22% in 2017 alone.</p> <p>Forestry has a key role to play in the reduction of Irish carbon emissions.  Afforestation is a vital tool in reducing our carbon footprint, with 300,000 ha of new forests planted since 1990 absorbing a massive 18% of Irish agriculture&rsquo;s annual greenhouse gas emissions.  Ireland&rsquo;s forests removed 4.3 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in 2015 alone.  The inclusion of land use, land-use change and forestry, LULUCF, within the scope of the new EU 2030 climate change framework is a welcome development and represents a sensible approach which broadens, through carbon removal, the tools available to Ireland in reducing its greenhouse gas emissions.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Diarmuid Wilson:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2017"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2017&amp;amp;pid=DiarmuidWilson&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It will enable Ireland to access the removal of 26.8 million tonnes of CO2 over the 2021 to 2030 period.</p><p>I very much welcome the initiatives the Minister of State is bringing forward and continuing.

It is an issue very close to my heart.  I was very involved in forestry in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  Coming from a dairying background, which I did in the 1960s and 1970s, I know forestry is an extension of farming.  At that stage, massive incentives were given by the Irish Government in conjunction with the European Union to incentivise people like me to invest in private forestry.  I jumped at the chance because at that stage 75% of the funding was given by Europe to increase the acreage.  One of the things that disappointed me in the report is that the percentage of land used for forestry is one of the lowest in Europe.  We have the highest rate for tree growing in the world in Ireland with all of our rain and the climate we have.</p> <p>In the 1980s I had about 1,000 acres which I planted in the Pettigo area.  The grant that was available afforded me the opportunity to do so.  I bought the land, which was land on which, as we say in the west of Ireland, one would not raise a snipe.  It was no good for broadleaves either.  Broadleaves need good land.  It was mainly spruces and pines, which are fast growing and have huge value.  Coillte has been the backbone of this country for years and was hugely helpful to the private sector.  It was helpful to me in the late 1980s and early 1990s.</p> <p>It is necessary to fence off forest because there are a lot of wild deer in the wilds and once the top is taken off the leader, it is gone.  That is why we need protection.  Deer love the leaves of the broadleaves so they have to be kept out.  Many people think it is only a case of planting the trees and forgetting about them, but that is not so.  There is a lot of husbandry involved in the forestry industry.  The land has to be drained, ploughed or mounded, which is the best method for planting, so that the trees have more stability.</p> <p>A number of us who were involved in the private sector at that stage brought a helicopter over from Scotland to fertilise the land.  It was accurate.  That was back in the late 1980s.  It was in its infancy at the time.  I am sure it has come on in leaps and bounds since then.  The scheme under the European Union and Irish Government at that time was free of capital gains tax, which is an incentive.  I got out of it because I was moving all my business to the United States.  I was able to get out and at a good time.  It was a capital gains tax free scheme.  It was a huge incentive.  I do not know what the incentives are now because I have not kept up to date with it.</p> <p>It created employment for local people.  Much forestry is in poorer areas because the land used is poor.  Most people there were on the dole and their incomes were supplemented by planting and fertilising and by the husbandry involved in looking after forests.  It is a residual industry.  It has value apart from the resale value.  There are thinnings and the forest is mature after 30 or 35 years.  The second growth is the best growth because the nutrients are in the ground.  There are massive benefits.</p> <p>I am disappointed to hear today that we still have such low coverage.  It went from 1% to 10% in 2012.  I am sure it has increased again but it is not up as much as it should be.  We have the best growing conditions in Europe for forestry.  It is something we should look at much more closely.  It is a massive natural asset and can create a lot of employment in poorer rural areas which is badly needed when all the jobs are going to big cities and towns.  There are a lot of new rules about areas of scientific interest.  I understand all that.  The area was reduced.  If a person had about 400 acres, it was necessary to split it into four different parts and plan for 100 acres or whatever.  It has to be streamlined.  I am sure it is.  We should keep incentivising and get the private sector involved.  The money is coming back again.  The money is there and there is a lot of land.  I understand why broadleaves are not increasing that much because the land has to be very good to grow broadleaves.  Good land is used for other uses than trees, which is a long-term investment.</p> <p>I welcome the Minister of State's interest.  Forestry was good to me and I saw what it did for employment in the area.  The recreational use of forestry for forest walks, for example, is becoming bigger.  I had an old forester who guided me and helped me.  He went to the forestry school at 17.  He went out and planted land.  He felled the same land he planted and he bought land.  He had experience right through his whole life.  He lived until he was 80.  He was a fantastic guy.  His name was Joe Hanahoe.  He was an incredible man.  He went through the whole forestry system and lived, talked and breathed forestry.  Many forests in this country surround lakes and are covering them over.  We have loads of trees in this country.  It causes controversy sometimes with the locals because it is too cluttered.  We should have breaks of 50 m in scenic areas where there is forestry.  There should be a lovely view down into the lake.  There are plenty of trees.  We do not have to cover everything.</p> <p>It is a fantastic industry and I miss it.  I thank the Minister of State for his presentation today.</p></speech>

This discussion is important because forestry is an important asset.  Truth be told, more people would talk about the Amazon rainforest than they do about our forest in this country.  Put simply, forests are lungs for human existence.  They take in carbon, which is good, and give out oxygen.  Policies that the Government pursues to increase forestry and planting in appropriate places are welcome.  In the Minister of State's speech, he talked about renewable energy, with biomass being part of the mix.  We see in forests that are well-kept, particularly traditional forests with traditional species native to our own country, that there is biodiversity with thriving wildlife and plants.  In my home town of Ballina, there has been a great collaborative effort between Coillte and the Belleek Forest enhancement committee.  They reintroduce native species and the red squirrel, which had departed.  They are thriving.  They were introduced a number of years ago.  As Senator Lawless said, it is thriving as a recreational asset too.  Many people go into the forest.  Pathways have been paved.  It is part of a greenway out of Ballina.  Everybody is so proud of it.  I welcome the work that has gone on with Coillte.  It is a real asset for visitors and the community.  That should be encouraged.</p> <p>I welcome the Minister of State's announcement last week of the latest payment rounds of forestry grants of &euro;17 million.  That means that, this year, &euro;56.8 million has been paid out in State grants for forestry.  We need to incentivise the growth of forests.  We know that the realisation of the value of the asset does not happen until the forest is fully matured.  Therefore, people have to be encouraged to plant trees.  If we do not encourage them and make payments, there is no incentive for people to tie up their land with forestry.  We have a great tradition of forestry in my county.  I give great credit to former Minister for Lands, Joseph Blowick.  He was in Clann na Talmhan, back in the 1940s and 1950s, and he laid the foundation stone for State participation in forestry.  In recent times, there has been accelerated investment because we have a better appreciation of climate change and the bio-economy the Minister of State referred to.  Joseph Blowick had a vision at the time about the role forestry could play in local economies.  There was land that lent itself to forest growing and otherwise was not in use.</p> <p>The kernel of what I would have to say here today relates to the issue of land use, and competing interests of forestry and farming and food production.  There are issues, without a doubt, even though having more forests is a desirable objective.  In counties where there is much forestry, for example, Leitrim and Mayo, there are legitimate concerns among communities that there is a forest but the spin-off is not really there for the local communities because all that happens is that the forest grows, the trees are cut and they are shipped out.  It is a pressing issue in Leitrim.  People are quite despondent when they see that what used to be a farm holding is taken over and planted.  They see it as a death knell to a household or farm family that lived there.  People are looking for more than what is on offer at the moment.  What I mean by that is, giving Mayo as a case, Coillte has a substantial holding in Mayo with a forest planted, and it fells trees when they are mature but they are put on a train from Ballina to Waterford.  No value is added to the local community other than premiums that farmers or landowners might receive or that they receive themselves.  We can talk about jobs and about that potential but it is not happening in the way that it should.  I ask the Minister of State to ask Coillte to look at these counties and to seek to deliver more to the local economy.</p> <p>I will give a stark example.  We have planning permission on the Asahi site near Killala in County Mayo.  It is for a combined heat and power plant which would involve the burning of wood and the drying of willow or such to make woodchips.  It has all the licences through the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  When the promoters were looking for the source of the raw material, Coillte would not sell to them.  They may have contracts elsewhere but my point is that we were going to have a very live and real proposition to create local jobs, both within the combined heat and power plant and also to people producing timber, and Coillte did not play ball.  It is shipping its wood elsewhere.  The only alternative for this company was importing biomass.  Talk about going contrary to the theory of reducing the carbon footprint.  I know that it is a State company independent of the Minister of State but it needs to be challenged on issues such as this.  It will show maps where it is doing good work but that is all in the south of the country.  If one is planting in the north of the country and the people see nothing for it, it is not acceptable.  Coillte needs to deliver more to counties Mayo and Leitrim and any other county in a similar situation.  Other than that, we will not achieve the worthwhile targets for the reasons that have been given for why forestry is desirable.  The Minister of State might respond to that.</p> <p>There is an issue with the farm-forest partnerships that Coillte entered into with landowners, over 20 years ago in some cases.  The Minister of State will recall an awful lot of farmers complaining that they signed up to deals with Coillte because it was a State company and they had confidence in it.  They really feel let down that they have not been dealt with in a transparent way.  Some did not have communication from Coillte for decades and did not receive payments.  We had Coillte management before the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine on 27 February and they were to undertake a review of these partnership agreements.  What is the Minister of State's view on this?  What update can he give us on the review?  What communication has Coillte had with him?  Legitimate issues and concerns were raised about how Coillte was dealing with individuals.  I feel that the attitude of Coillte was that it had entered into an agreement, it was all signed up and is legally binding.  It did not involve people who had equal negotiating power.  Coillte has the legal and financial muscle and its behaviour towards the ordinary widow or widower, or whoever in the country has been persuaded to get involved in these partnerships, left a lot to be desired.  Will the Minister of State update us about what is happening?  A number of people are affected.  I look forward to the Minister of State's responses.</p></speech>

The one thing the previous speakers and I all have in common is that we would like to see more forestry in the right places in Ireland, which would require an increase in Government support for forestry.  Forestry is unsurprisingly a topic of great interest to me as an ecologist and to the Green Party.  As our agricultural model changes and adapts to a warming world and a globalised economy, forestry plays an ever-increasing role in supporting the income of farmers and managing our rural landscape.  I emphasise that we, as a party, support the principle of using forestry to enhance our natural habitants, mitigate climate change and provide income to farmers and other landowners in Ireland.  Forestry, when done right, can be an important social support, enhance the natural beauty of our island and provide habitats for species under threat.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Grace O'Sullivan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2467"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2467&amp;amp;pid=GraceOSullivan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is a "but" of course.  I am sure the Minister of State is familiar with the work of the Save Leitrim campaign, as mentioned by my colleague, which opposes the blanketing of that stunning county in non-native coniferous spruce trees.  The campaign has highlighted the social, environmental and economic effects of this campaign over recent years.  Just this week I came across a video the group made comprising aerial shots of the dark monoculture plantations blotting out large areas, damaging soil and leaving devastation in the wake of the clear-cutting that removes every tree at once and leaves behind only debris.  The social effects of these policies are as concerning as the environmental side of the matter.  The people of Leitrim have talked of the feeling of a county emptying out, of people being replaced by dark, foreboding and unwelcoming plantations, of communities separated and of the mental health effects these rapid changes can have on people living there.  The very model that the Government is supporting is one at odds with European norms.  It damages our local communities and fosters such resentment towards forestry as a policy.</p><p>Another way is possible.  The Green Party&rsquo;s forestry policy has been in place for almost two decades, with some updates here and there, but based on the sound scientific principles that forestry should do more good than harm.  We want to see a genuinely popular model closer to that followed in Germany and other European countries, which increases afforested areas but enhances rather than degrades the communities in which the trees exist.  It is a model that prioritises continuous growth, which means that all the trees are not cut down in one massive cull rather harvested selectively, over time, and leaving continuous broadleaf cover in place.  Broadleaf forests made up of natural species would also help restore the natural habitats that existed across Ireland for millennia before the land clearances of the past centuries.  In areas of lower value land and high ecological importance, they can be a home for nature, a haven for species under threat and a way of restoring soils, stabilising water flows and preventing flooding and erosion.</p><p>There is a great disparity in forest cover between the south east, which enjoys considerable coverage, and the north west, which has almost none bar the commercial plantations of places like Leitrim.  This was mentioned by Senator Mulherin.  There are commercial and ecological reasons for this and the State may have a role to play in increasing coverage in areas where it might not be profitable for farmers and landowners to do so.  State supports and the help of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, will be essential in targeting this work, and the Government must do what it can to seek such assistance from the European Union, EU, in the next round of reforms to the CAP.  Commissioner Hogan will be in this Chamber tomorrow and I hope to present those points to him as well.</p><p>The State also has a role to play in the creation of national parks, as Senator Lawless mentioned, areas in which the primary responsibility of planting and management would be the Government's.  Such national parks would be huge natural tourism magnets and a national asset that would benefit Ireland, the global climate and the local communities through employment and leisure areas.  It is my belief that we need to be aiming at planting 20,000 ha of such forestry planted per year, and that we need to be very wary of any strong EU push for biomass for energy, considering the poor delivery of most biomass on climate-related assessment criteria.  Second and third generation biomass and biofuels will have a role to play but simple growing for burning is not without significant costs and negatives in almost all existing schemes.</p><p>I will conclude by saying that we need a new forestry plan that includes national parks, which stores carbon, restores wildlife, provides recreational access and improves water quality and flood management.  We need one that is done in consultation and with the full engagement of local communities, and which takes into account the importance of locals' mental health, sense of community and county pride.  With our partners in Europe and a major pivot from short-term profits to long-term social, environmental and economic gain, we can have a forestry policy and some beautiful forests to be proud of.</p><p>I have just come from a delivery at the front gate of tens of thousands of signatures to the Oireachtas.  It was organised by BirdWatch Ireland, An Taisce and the Irish bee federation.  They are here today because of their concerns about the Heritage Bill.  Speaking about forestry in Ireland, I often wonder if we take into account the amount of linear forestry running through our landscape, providing a huge benefit to wildlife and ecological services in general.  It contributes much economic benefit as well.  This is something that should be considered and when the Heritage Bill is discussed, hedgerows should be considered as part of our overall forestry capacity.</p></speech>

Most of the forests in Ireland are planted on marginal land in areas of the west and north west, where heavier soils and wetter climate limit profitable agricultural options.  Many experts point out that this land is simply not productive farmland and forestry offers the best return to the farmer, mainly due to the grants.  It also solves the country's carbon sequestration obligations.  Some of this is correct but negative realities must be addressed simultaneously.</p><p>The general model of forestry in Ireland is the planting of large expanses of Sitka spruce trees, and the total area of Sitka spruce in my area of Donegal is the second highest of all counties in the State.  The trees are planted very close together in rows, with open drainage shores running between them.  The Department's forestry grants cover the full cost of the planting and fencing of the land, and under the scheme, the landowner receives an annual payment of over &euro;500 per hectare for 15 years.  If a farmer plants his or her own land, he or she will also continue to receive the basic payment or entitlement under the Common Agricultural Policy, which is usually approximately &euro;200 per hectare on top of the forestry payment.</p><p>The reason for very generous Government assistance for forestry is to encourage it as a means of reaching our commitments on climate change, as trees are viewed as the only way to absorb and store carbon.  For a farmer struggling to make a living on wet, poor land in the west, it is an attractive option, as indeed it is for investment and pension funds.  Land can be bought cheaply and planting it brings the security of State funding and the 15 years of guaranteed payments.  As a Government policy, grant-aided monoculture afforestation is successful in getting more land under trees.The permanent change of land use is one of the clear consequences of this policy. <b></b>However, communities living in areas where forestry is replacing farming as a model of land use suffer negative impacts as there is very little labour involved in growing Sitka spruce.  In reality, it closes down the countryside.</p><p>Economic and social activity around traditional farming has significant spin-off in the local area, with services being provided to the farm and products and materials traded with the farm.  Normal farming activity creates opportunity, which in turn creates more activity.  On the other hand, the farm planted with Sitka spruce never needs new gates, fencing or anyone to cut fodder, bale and gather it in, or to plough for reseeding.  There are no animals to feed or care for and no need for a vet to look at an animal.  There is no need for anyone to upkeep habitat or hedges, fix machinery or maintain sheds.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2321"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2321&amp;amp;pid=PadraigMacLochlainn&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Above all, a farm on which Sitka spruce is grown needs no farmer to go to the mart to meet other farmers or to call on neighbours when in need, because there are no needs.  The planted farm becomes deserted, wild and uninteresting.  The rural community that once survived on the micro-economy delivered in an area by the activity of farming suffers decline and also becomes deserted.  The economic activity created by planting, maintaining, thinning and processing conifers is very low as much of the industry is highly automated.  It is estimated that there is approximately one full-time job per 1,000 ha of forestry.  We, therefore, want a policy that encourages the establishment of local plant nurseries for job creation and to avoid having to import saplings or young trees.  For example, a system of credits for buying locally grown trees could be considered.</p><p>Farm after farm being planted in an area such as County Leitrim has a major environmental and visual impact which has been ignored, while the genuine complaints of local people are drowned out by the chorus from the State agencies about meeting our afforestation targets for climate change reasons.  When marginal land comes up for sale, local farmers who make a living from suckler cows and sheep find it difficult to complete a purchase because they are always outbid by the forestry companies, backed by hedge and pension funds.  Another problem created by our afforestation policy is the transfer of land ownership from local farmers to international corporate interests which engage forestry management companies to thin and maintain the forests.</p><p>Many farmers who plant the land themselves collect the annual grants for 15 years and are then offered a buyout by the forestry management companies on behalf of big corporate funds when the first thinning is carried out.  Such offers are hard to resist for ageing farmers as the next payment from the trees is 15 to 20 years away.  This move to corporate ownership of forestry land is happening apace and is supported by Government grants for carbon sequestration reasons.  Sinn F&eacute;in is calling for a 50 km radius limit for establishment grant and forestry premium payments.  This means that the recipient&rsquo;s main residence must be within 50 km of the forestry site.  For companies, the limit should apply to their main headquarters to ensure that the economic benefits of forestry are retained in the local area.</p><p>The timber industry in Ireland has been built around the Sitka spruce model of forestry.  The harvesting machinery, transport vehicles and the handling equipment in sawmills have all been developed for that type of timber.  However much of this fast-growing timber is of low value, with up to 50% of it going for pulp to make paper or for chipping.  Some of it is used for chipboard and fibreboard products and some is used as biomass and burned, which releases the carbon absorbed straight back into the atmosphere.  Fulfilling our climate change obligations is the reason offered for the high level of grants for forestry but the efficiency and effectiveness of the Sitka spruce forestry model as a carbon sink is in doubt.  I ask the Minister of State what studies have been carried out by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on the most beneficial crops for sequestration.  There are real worries that this model of conifer forestry is not delivering in terms of climate change.  Scarce public money is going to support the permanent change of land use to the benefit of an intensive timber industry under the guise of promoting carbon sequestration.  The knock-on effect of the forestry industry is a bad outcome for rural communities, with depopulation, declining numbers involved in farming and major changes to the rural landscape.  Ireland must move away from the Sitka spruce industrial model of forestry.  Where forestry is planted, it should be with a variety of mainly broadleaf species and continual cover such that trees are replanted as they are removed should be ensured.</p><p>There must be a fundamental change in policy direction by the Government.  The Department is involved in an aggressive afforestation strategy engaging the commercial private sector in a potentially dangerous way.  The concentration of forestry in certain geographical areas of mainly marginal land must end.  Different uses and management of land by farmers to absorb carbon more affectively must be developed and supported.  I would be obliged if the Minister of State would address the concerns raised by my party and I as well as the suggested policy solutions put forward by my party.</p></speech>

I warmly welcome the Minister of State.  What could be nicer than to have responsibility for food, forestry and horticulture and also come from the lovely County Wicklow.  I regularly walk in Avondale, which, as all Members know, was the home of Charles Stewart Parnell.  While walking there last Sunday I was struck by the vision and foresight for forestry of Parnell and his great contemporary, Horace Plunkett.  They had a vision of setting up a forestry school, engaging with foresters and taking young people out of school, probably predominantly young men at that time although there are now men and women in this profession.  It is to that approach that we must return.  We must discuss their vision.</p> <p>I acknowledge the work of Coillte, which gets a lot of stick but runs a very slick, professional and commercially viable operation.  It is the custodian of over 440,000 ha, which is an enormous block of land and forestry.  Over the past 30 years it has built on that and focused on maximising the financial business model.  It is now also beginning to address the social model in regard to how we can exploit this amazing national and natural resource.  The sustainability of forests and communities, in particular rural communities, is key.  I acknowledge what the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association has been championing in regard to some of the work in Leitrim because I have been on-site there and have seen the mass blanket of forestry.  I have heard the stories of small farmers with ambition to buy another few fields but who have not been able to do so, predominantly because they had to compete with the private forestry sector which wishes to continue to grow its business.  I have no problem with people growing their business but it must be done in a sustainable manner.</p> <p>I acknowledge that Coillte has a very good graduate training programme but it must expand to accommodate transition year students and allow young secondary school students to access placements because we must engender a love for the business of forestry and horticulture.</p> <p>Greater emphasis should be placed on nursery stock production because we all know that if one does not have good quality healthy seed and nursery stock initially to plant, one will not reap the benefits of that forestry.  That is of particular importance.  I would like greater possibilities and that student internships and internship programmes are maximised.  The Minister of State should consider that.</p> <p>I will not talk too much about carbon credits but I read a paper this morning by Fine Gael MEP, Se&aacute;n Kelly, who has done an extraordinary amount of work in the European Parliament in respect of carbon credits and has been slowly and quietly advocating for them.</p> <p>We should concentrate on training and apprenticeship and consider bringing people to this country to become involved in forestry or allow those who are here trying to be processed and who want to learn a new trade to do so in forestry.  Let us prepare for the future because if we must expand the forestry cover of in this country, we must also expand and develop the work force and knowledge base.</p> <p>Forestry in Ireland must include some broadleaf trees but many Members know that the growing of broadleafs, such as oak is a very long process.  I recently walked through an oak forest in Delgany.  Those trees are over 200 years old and less than half the height of this building.  They are slow to grow and are a very long-term project.  Their growth should be encouraged but there must be a balance between sustainability and viability.</p> <p>Senator Mac Lochlainn's point in terms of acknowledging the pressures that small rural communities are coming under as a result of blanket forestry is well made.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I say well done to the Minister of State and thank him for his ongoing engagement in this matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-04-25a.146" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1356" speakername="Andrew Doyle" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018042500002#V00200"><p>I thank all Senators for their contributions.  In response to Senator Boyhan's comments, most of the people I come across in the Department, within the industry and in the wider forestry sector have a passion about it.  I must declare an interest at this point; my son is in his final year of forestry at University College Dublin.  Last week they were in the Black Forest looking at the whole aspect of continuous cover forestry.</p> <p>In a few weeks I will travel to the Finnish Forest Research Institute, where the main species of trees are birch and the conifers, Norway and Scots pine.  There are a lot of things we need to get into context.  In my opening statement I tried to cover all areas of the economic, social and environmental benefits.  If people take the time to study what has actually transpired from the mid-term review and some of the other work we are doing with the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and with others around framework directives, they will see that there is a comprehensive policy.  All plantations, following the mid-term review, have a minimum of 15% broadleaf.  They can be put in a position and located.  Every forest site will have to be managed individually.  They can act as buffers - as aqua zones - when closer to houses, and as scenic areas.  In reality, if the conifer plantation is part of it then it can be incorporated behind all of that.</p> <p>Senator Wilson spoke of a number of places.  In Kingscourt, at the Old Cabra estate in his area, a significant amount of money has been invested with the NeighbourWood scheme.  We will continue to invest in these and others.   I was at one of the NeighbourWood schemes in Balla, County Mayo.  There is another one around the Vartry Reservoir at Roundwood.  A drone has captured footage of what has happened since before it opened.  It is located around the scenic lakes and it incorporates some 20 km of walkways so there is a lot of work being done on that whole area.</p> <p>With regard to the green ribbon campaign and the Let's Talk and Walk events, I have been on a couple of these walks at Avondale House Forest Park.  People have said that we should do more of these but part and parcel of the experience is that it encourages people to get out and about.  It is a primer in many ways.  On one of the occasions that I went out - I am a Wicklow man all right - I knew the former forest manager who was passionate about the history of Avondale.  He conducted a walk and gave us the whole history of the initiatives that took place there in the early part of the 20th century.  He also told us about Samuel Hayes, the original owner, who wrote the definitive book on forestry in Ireland back in the late 18th century.</p> <p>Senator Lawless spoke of those who think one can just plant trees and forget about them.  This was a symptom of the early days - in the late 1980s and early 1990s - of the afforestation programme.  The target then was to get 10,000 ha planted.  At this stage we have 21,000 private landowners.  This is 48% and heading to 50% of the total forest estate that will be in private ownership.  Last year we had a pilot project on knowledge transfer groups where 270 to 280 farmers took part.  There is another pilot scheme on forest certification.  We hope to roll out both of these pilots over the next period and it is part and parcel of the programme in the mid-term review.</p> <p>With regard to tax provisions, premia and revenue received from forestry is free from capital gains for income tax.  Previously it was taxable at &euro;80,000.  I am aware that some people have a problem with the replanting obligation but it is there because the owner has been given those tax incentives to promote it.  Our target is to increase afforestation cover.  It would seem wrong that having been a recipient of all those supports one could walk away and be able to restore the land to non-forestry uses.</p> <p>I have been to Leitrim a number of times.  I say this because it has come up on a number of occasions.  There are some 500 jobs supported by the wood sector and it is one of the biggest employers in the area.  Masonite is located there as are saw millers and hauliers.  Some 380 farmers receive &euro;2 million per year in premium payments.  The north west has Masonite and ECC, which is just across the border from Mayo in Galway.  These facilities have the biggest sawmills and timber processing standalone plants in the State.  I do not have the figures but they are probably the biggest consumers of the wood product.  Senators Grace O'Sullivan and P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn made the point about the production of timber for biomass energy.  It is a secondary product.  It is not the main product in most cases.  Forestry for fibre is a case in point for the likes of the plant that Senator Mulherin mentioned.  The forestry for fibre grants have increased significantly, and they have extended from ten to 15 years, to encourage that use.  With the combination of the renewable heat incentive scheme we hope it encourages a far greater uptake.  I believe it is a way of working with local communities for combined heat and power plants, especially for high demand heat industries and businesses.</p> <p>I will now turn to the issue of Coillte and the landowners' payments.  In fairness, Coillte has put its hands up and said that there was a serious lack of communication.  It has presented to me on 6 February and to the committee some time after that.  Coillte has engaged KPMG and it has said that nobody who was owed money under those contracts is now owed money and that they have communicated directly with everyone involved.  There was an amount of work that had been lax in its management structures, a fact that has been acknowledged by Coillte.</p> <p>Going back to Leitrim, 27% of Leitrim is covered in broadleaf forest.  In 2016 the average holding was 25 ha and the average plantation was 6 ha.  This puts it into context.  I acknowledge that some of the older plantations are blanket cover.  As I have already outlined, if and when those various plantations are clear-felled they will have different setback areas, different species mix and the network of roads within the area will also create open spaces.  Between the time they close in and the first thinning it is true that plantations from year seven to year 18 do look like blanket coverage, but the introduction to every plantation of the 15% broadleaf - as opposed to 10% - and with up to 15% biodiverse areas it will fundamentally change the appearance of it.</p> <p>I come from a county with the highest density of plantations.  I am surrounded by it and I planted some myself on marginal land.  I go back to the point that the real basic aspect is that we want people to consider farming as part of their enterprise; not an either-or situation.  It is really the only way we can get the afforestation numbers up.  I accept that in some parts of the State it may seem attractive.  Non-farmers are defined as sons and daughters or brothers and sisters of farmers, or retired farmers.  In 2016 only 126 ha was planted by what we would define as corporate.  There is an issue around the semi-mature plantations being bought and people selling.  In some ways they are not realising the value of what they have.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Andrew Doyle:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2170"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2170&amp;amp;pid=AndrewDoyle&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is why the knowledge transfer, the forest felling tool and all of those supports, and the encouragement of producer groups, are being supported by the Department to make people aware of it.  The Coillte partnerships were the first departure along the lines of some form of equity release post premia and then a share of the clear-fell revenue.  I think there is space and a real opportunity to make that work so that people do not sell themselves short.  It is not in the State's interest for timber to be clear-felled prematurely, because the amount of investment by the State is based on getting the maximum yield, be that in year 30, 35 or 40, or much longer in the case of broadleaves.  It is in everybody's interests that we would support that and let forest owners know that there are options other than just washing their hands of it in the sense of wanting to get out once they have got the premium.  That is a mistake.  In Scandinavia in particular all farmers have some plantation and they see that as part of their farm enterprise but they have a tradition that we do not have so they have a greater understanding.  That is something we must encourage and support.</p><p>Senator Mac Lochlainn and another speaker made a point about continuous cover forestry.  Under the mid-term review, the woodland improvement scheme and the native woodland conservation scheme incorporate continuous cover forestry for mixed broadleaves in particular.  They are eligible for three woodland improvement scheme payments of &euro;750 for three separate interventions over a period of 12 years, once the work is in line with the approved transformation under the continuous cover for forest plan.  It has been recognised, and to go back to the opening statement, we have introduced the new mid-term review changes to the scheme with the full approval of DG Environment in Europe.  The officials were put to the sword on this one and were very anxious that we would get broadleaf plantations up to 30%.  The mid-term review has addressed a lot of the concerns that existed.</p><p>On the one hand we had people saying it was disappointing that we had not reached 10,000 ha while on the other hand we had people concerned about the location and density more so than the amount.  One of the issues that has been very apparent from the challenges in increasing the numbers is that the fear on broadleaves was of not being able to get them established, so the protections that are there for broadleaves such as deer fencing and tree protection covers are specifically to deal with that.  On the other hand, more particularly with conifer plantations, competing uses have been the biggest challenge.  We have 21,000 landowners who have planted so we are working off a diminishing platform.  We have gone from 1.5% to 10.5%.  We want to get to 18% but it is like trying to knock seconds off a world record.  One gets down to fractions of seconds and then hundreds of seconds, so one is working off a diminishing platform.  That is probably the biggest single reason we have not been able to reach the figures.  It is one of them anyway.  The agritaxation changes have made it very attractive to lease land for 15 years plus, so it is comparable.  In general, there is enough land for everything, appropriately placed.  There is enough land to reach the target of 30% broadleaves with conifers as the driver of the economic part.</p><p>In terms of sequestration, both conifers and broadleaves on maturity store about the same amount of carbon.  In a way, the difference is that conifers reach maturity quicker, then they have a harvest and replant so there is a net impact in that regard.  I gave the figures on carbon storage earlier.  It is in everybody's best interests - economic, social and environmental, that we support this programme - that programmes will follow in 2021 and that we will continue in this vein.</p><p>We have an open mind if there are problems.  I have spoken to representative groups from all quarters - the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association, INHFA, the Irish Farmers' Association, IFA, foresters, the promotion people and everybody else.  In the mid-term review we had a consultation period and everybody was entitled to make a submission on it.  We have tried our best to address all of the concerns and at the same time to encourage afforestation.</p><p>I have a list of the promotional events we organised.  We had 21 information days.  We sent mailshots to 4,000 forest owners with a new afforestation leaflet.  We did radio advertising.  I have done a series of interviews, some of which were more challenging than others.  The Department produced a newsletter.  We have Farm TV, and we were responsible for miscellaneous articles in various publications.  We are trying to raise awareness.  It is about going back to the farmer, the landowner, which brings in rural communities.  This is meant to be part of the farm enterprise.  Farmers must profile their own farm and work out if some of it could yield them money, and build an asset which would yield a return to them or their successors and allow them to enhance the remainder of the farm without compromising the productivity of the conventional farming enterprise.  I think it can and I think that is something we should look at.</p><p>I referred to a farm of 25 ha where 6 ha was planted, which is a quarter.  That is probably typical although in some places it might be less and in other places more.  I would encourage people to get behind afforestation and look at the facts and the reality.  The debate does get very passionate in parts of the country.  I appreciate that.  I have done my best not to provoke anybody, but I come from a county that has a higher tree density than anywhere else in the country so I have some authority in being able to speak about the experience.  We have had a culture of afforestation since the 1950s.  We have had sawmills and people working in timber, garden sheds, post and rail mills for structural wood production and people working with what is now Coillte.  It has been part and parcel of what I grew up with, although I accept it may be different for others.  It is something that can be of benefit if it is managed correctly.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-04-25a.152" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018042500002#Z00300"><p>I thank the House for this important opportunity to update Members on housing and related matters.   In view of the time available, I will not address every single issue in housing but I look forward to coming back to any questions Members have.</p> <p>The top-line figures for house building are going in the right direction.  Planning permissions for 20,776 homes were granted to the end December 2017, up 27% year on year.  Commencement notices for over 18,500 new homes were submitted, an annual increase of 41% in the year to the end of February 2018.  BER figures show that 2,367 housing units were built during the first three months of the year, an increase of 45% on the same time last year, not including self-builds.  ESB connections in 2017 totalled just under 20,000, an annual increase of more than 30% in the year to the end of February 2018.  Since early 2014, this has increased by 128%.  Finally, registrations have increased to 9,521 units, which is 46% up on the 12 months to February 2017.</p> <p>The growing numbers show that house building and supply are moving in the right direction, rapidly and dramatically on a year-on-year basis.  Growing employment in the construction industry is further evidence of increased confidence and buoyancy in the housing sector.  Employment levels of skilled tradesmen in the construction sector was estimated at 83,000 in the first quarter of 2017, which is up by 14% on the same period in 2016.  The volume of production in the residential construction sector has been growing at an annual average rate of 22% since its low point in the fourth quarter of 2012.  In the fourth quarter of 2017, volume increased by 16.3%.  The Central Bank, in its quarterly bulletin for the first quarter of 2018, forecasts that both housing and non-residential building should continue to recover strongly.  For 2018 and 2019, according to the Central Bank, residential construction investment is expected to increase strongly, with approximately 23,000 and 27,000 new homes being built, respectively.</p> <p>The building of local authority homes is increasing rapidly and the target for the 2018 build is 4,696 homes, which is more than 50% higher than the 2017 target.  This will increase again in 2019 to 6,385 units, a further 30%, and continue to grow to a target of 8,907 in 2021.  The social housing build programme is ramping up, as is evident in the fourth quarter of 2017 construction status report.  At end-2017, 2,512 homes were completed, 3,650 were under construction and 1,912 further homes were about to go on site, with the remainder progressing through the various stages of planning, design and procurement.  Whether it is social housing homes, forecasts from the Central Bank or notices submitted to my Department and local authorities, the statistics show a dramatic increase in the number of homes being built across the country.</p> <p>We also provide ongoing social housing supports in the rental sector and almost 26,000 households had their housing needs met last year, with 100 households having their housing needs met every working day in 2017.  A further 18,000 households are targeted for support under these schemes in 2018.  The figure for last year is made up of rental accommodation scheme, RAS, numbers, housing assistance payments, HAPs, builds, acquisitions, leasing, voids, regeneration and all the different delivery streams we have for house building and social housing in the State.</p> <p>On the whole, there is no doubt that all the evidence points to real progress in terms of housing delivery.  Most important, last week we saw a significant reduction in people sleeping rough of 40%.  Last November there were 184 individuals sleeping rough and now there are 110.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Eoghan Murphy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2288"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2288&amp;amp;pid=EoghanMurphy&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This reduction in people sleeping rough, in many ways our most vulnerable people who are homeless, is welcome.  It follows the dedicated and compassionate work of the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, working with our partner organisations to increase the services available in the Dublin region.  There is still more to do because we still have many people sleeping rough on our streets.  Many of those accessing homeless services have complex needs and require other supports, notably health supports, to assist them to exit our homeless services.  Housing First is best international practice for getting people out of homelessness.  That is why earlier this year I appointed a national director for Housing First and increased its funding allocation.  I thank Mr. Bob Jordan for the excellent work he has done so far this year.  He is delivering results, and pilot programmes are now being progressed in other parts of the country, including Cork, Limerick and Galway.  My Department is also leading the homelessness inter-agency group which involves a range of Departments and the NGO sector.  This process is showing a number of inter-agency issues which need to be addressed to tackle homelessness more effectively.  I will bring forward policy proposals upon receipt of the first report of the inter-agency group which I expect later this month from the group&rsquo;s independent chair, Mr John Murphy.</p><p>The continued presentation of families to emergency accommodation is a source of serious ongoing concern for me.  I am pleased that we have been able to exit so many families from hubs and hotels.  The reasons behind the homeless figures are complicated but are linked to the collapse of our house building sector and the severe supply shortage associated with that collapse.  The staff in my Department and across the system, in local authorities and NGOs, are putting in a huge amount of work to help people and families in homelessness.  Last year, more than 4,700 adults exited homelessness.  Of the more than 100 families who presented in Dublin in February, only 20 were accommodated in hotels.  During 2017, more than 2,000 families left hotels for sustainable tenancies and the majority of those families into homes.  I saw this incredible work first-hand during the severe weather events in January and February of this year.  During that time, the people dealing with  homelessness were in work helping to provide emergency shelter.  I pay particular thanks to our partners in the NGO sector who, with the Dublin Region Homeless Executive and the Department, do so much to help prevent people from entering homelessness, provide supports for those who are in difficulties and help us to exit people into sustainable long-term accommodation.  The emergency response was extraordinary and I have no doubt that lives were saved on our streets as a result.</p><p>While homelessness is often the worst manifestation of the housing challenge, the underlying issues of housing are supply, access and affordability.  That supply shortage cuts across the entire housing system into social housing, starter homes,  affordable rental options and larger family homes for trading up, not to mention smaller apartments for singles and couples that are desperately needed throughout the country.  In terms of understanding where the Irish housing system is currently and the progress being made to get it where it needs to be, it has to be put in some context where we have come from.  What we are seeing today are the symptoms of one the last legacies of the economic collapse.  As we know, that collapse was closely linked to a property bubble and related credit issues within our banking sector.  As a result, those sectors were severely impacted.  The result was that residential construction collapsed by 90%, only a handful of social and affordable homes were being built, virtually no starter home estates were being built, there were unfinished housing developments that had to be knocked down and employment in construction fell by two thirds. The residential construction sector in Ireland was deeply impacted and it was clear that it would take a major concerted effort over time to rebuild it.  Importantly, Rebuilding Ireland, built upon the work carried out by the special Oireachtas committee on housing and which was the subject of very broad stakeholder consultation, is in place and is showing the results, some of which I have alluded to.</p><p>The building of new social housing by local authorities and approved housing bodies is ramping up dramatically, as I have said.  These numbers do not include new builds under Part V, voids, acquisitions or long-term leases, so the actual stock of new social housing coming on stream is larger again.  Roughly 7,000 new homes in all in 2017 were delivered into the social housing stock for local authorities to take people off the housing lists into both local authority homes and housing body homes.  With the additional funding I secured last year, we have increased the overall level of ambition under Rebuilding Ireland in the period to 2021, rebalancing delivery more towards construction projects.  Overall, the Government has committed &euro;6 billion to support the accelerated delivery of 50,000 additional social housing homes by the end of 2021, through building 33,500 new homes, acquiring 6,500 new homes and leasing 10,000 new homes under the various programmes.  In addition, the housing assistance payment and rental accommodation scheme will continue to play an important part in meeting social housing needs.</p><p>In terms of housing supply more generally, the Government has undertaken a co-ordinated set of targeted actions aimed at encouraging arid incentivising house building at scale again.  For example, we have the approved investment of &euro;200 million in key enabling infrastructure to open up strategic public and private sites for early development; updated, streamlined and de-risked the planning and regulatory regime to progress major house and apartment developments; approved arrangements for development finance to be made available to house builders; and put in place a help to buy scheme to help first-time buyers with their deposit.  After a lot of hard work there are really encouraging signs that home building is recovering.  All supply indicators are showing encouraging trends, as I stated at the outset.</p><p>Ireland is a great success story today, having bounced back incredibly well from the downturn.  With growth of 5.6% forecast and unemployment set to reach 5.8%, the demand for housing will also grow.  Therefore, while the increased activity and supply is very encouraging, it is important that we continue to drive the implementation of Rebuilding Ireland and increase housing supply.  It is also crucial that the new housing is increasingly affordable and accessible to those who need it.  When I took over as Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government I initiated a review of the Rebuilding Ireland action plan.  At the time, I made a firm commitment that housing access and affordability would be a central focus of my work.  As supply is increasing, the Government is committed to ensuring that people throughout Ireland can access affordable housing based on their ability to pay.  For households, particularly those renting in our cities and urban areas and trying to save to buy their first home, this can be a real challenge.  Increasingly in our modern society, people want a choice of affordable homes to rent and buy, depending on their stage of life and circumstances.  Our housing system needs to provide attractive options for both.  The new affordable housing measures I signalled in January are specifically targeted at delivering more affordable homes.  The emphasis is on delivering affordable homes from our State landbank in urban areas where affordability issues are greatest.  Initial indications from local authorities in the main target counties highlight the potential for almost 4,000 affordable homes from their land.  The target is for the delivery of at least 10,000 new affordable homes in the medium to long term.</p><p>I will be commencing the necessary legislation for the affordable purchase scheme next week, and I expect to see more local authority sites coming forward thereafter.  To deliver these affordable homes, local authorities will need to maximise the potential yields from their landbank.  To assist them in this, I have secured additional funding of &euro;25 million for infrastructure on their sites to facilitate affordable housing provision.  The call for proposals for this funding will issue to local authorities shortly.  Additionally, as part of the budget for 2018, I announced that an additional &euro;50 million in Exchequer funding will be available for a second local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, call.  This will be subject to matching funding by local authorities, bringing the total available to &euro;66.5 million.  The criteria for the second call are being finalised and I expect to announce phase 2 of LIHAF soon.  Already 30 major public infrastructure projects have received final approval under the first phase of LIHAF.  These projects will activate the delivery of almost 20,000 new homes across public and private sites by 2021.  More than 28%, or some 5,600 of these 20,000 new homes, will be social or affordable homes.  In addition, a further 5,600 of the homes will have a LIHAF related cost reduction and another 8,800 will be sold at market rates, greatly increasing supply and with many in locations offering very good affordability.</p><p>In January 2018, I also launched the new local authority home loan.  Eligible first-time buyers can now access affordable mortgages from local authorities with fixed interest rate options of 2% to 2.25% for terms of up to 30 years.  Recent activity figures show the interest in the mortgage is very high, with more than 90,000 visits to the Rebuilding Ireland home loan website and 1,350 application forms having been downloaded.</p><p>A thriving rental sector is crucial in a modern and growing country such as ours.  As reported recently, I am progressing legislative changes to give effect to a number of new actions.  The changes will provide the regulatory framework to enhance and strengthen the powers and functions of the Residential Tenancies Board.  We also need to ensure that the rental sector, especially in our cities and major urban areas, is accessible and affordable.  To ensure this we need to invest in a different type of rental offering, a so-called cost rental sector, which operates between the social and private market sectors.  Other modern European cities like Vienna, where I used to live, have delivered cost rental homes into the market at scale over many years, making a sustainable long-term impact on housing affordability.  We know from the national planning framework that Ireland will need to provide more than 500,000 new homes to accommodate our growing population and workforce between now and 2040.  We need to ensure there are enough rental options at affordable rents to make our cities attractive as places to live as well as work as we implement these plans.  I am determined to deliver a major cost rental project in Dublin in the short term and then roll it out more broadly.  We are learning from pilot projects which are helping to shape the model for future larger-scale versions.  We are working with the European Investment Bank and other key stakeholders with a view to announcing the first major cost rental project in Dublin city shortly, with a programme of cost rental projects across Dublin and other cities to follow.</p><p>Ireland is recovering positively from the crippling economic downturn, the economy is growing and we are reaching for full employment.  It is crucial that, as we grow, we match the demand for housing with supply that is accessible and affordable.  By any supply measures and given our starting point, real progress is being made under Rebuilding Ireland.  Of course we continue to face very challenging circumstances when it comes to increasing numbers in homeless emergency accommodation.  Some additional measures will be announced shortly on that.  While there are different ways to measure housing output, all indicators of home building activity are trending positively.  Housing is a top priority for me and the Government, and we are determined to repair and reform one of the sectors of our economy and society worst impacted by the downturn.  All efforts are now being concentrated towards increasing output, particularly in terms of affordable homes to rent and to buy.</p></speech>

I know he is a very busy man.  It is good to be busy, and I am busy, but it is not good to be busy if nothing is getting done.  I am not saying the Minister is doing nothing.  Far from it.  I know how hard he is working, but I have concerns.</p> <p>Housing is the key issue facing this Government.  It is not about personalities.  It is about real political priorities on which the Government has failed.  Homelessness has reached unprecedented levels, surging rents are at historic heights, home building numbers are tens of thousands behind where they should be and some 85,000 people are on the social housing waiting list.  All the while, ordinary workers cannot afford a place to own.</p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il is using the confidence and supply agreement to press for a policy shift to establish an affordable housing scheme, increase social housing spending and strengthen the rental sector.  The Government has to start delivering on housing.  After four separate plans and over a dozen launches, we need to see bricks and mortar in the ground.</p> <p>We have the four pillars in Rebuilding Ireland.  However, the flagging Rebuilding Ireland plan is behind target already.  Supply and affordability is the key issue that must be addressed to get to grips with the crisis in the private, social and rental sector.</p> <p>I welcome the news this morning about the new national regeneration and development agency, NRDA, being given the powers to buy State and semi-State lands for development for housing but I urge that there would not be a repeat of over the odds payment for those sites.  Nobody needs to get rich from that.  We just need housing.</p> <p>When the Minister outlined his expectations last week for the delivery of social housing to local authorities, with targets of almost 5,000 units including 249 in Cork city, 115 in Carlow, 165 in Waterford and 153 in Limerick - those are the few I want to mention - there was no timescale or sense of what might happen if those targets were not met or an indication of when they would be met.  I need clarification on that because it reminded me of Groundhog Day.  Last year, when the Minister was in Carlow, he turned the sod on the sites he announced the other day.  He had already gone to those sites.  What we have is the 115 houses in Carlow, which I welcome-----</p></speech>

We actually turned the sods at that time.  Work has started on some of the houses - I will give credit where credit is due - but they were last year's targets.  I need the Minister to know that.</p> <p>Let us not highlight what many of us believe are targets which fall very far short of our current waiting lists.  It is great to have a plan and a goal but as we all know, having a goal is just not enough.  There must be real incentives.  What incentives or carrot or stick approach is the Minister using to ensure delivery of those units?  I see great plans in my area but nobody is all packed, with keys dangling from their wrists.  There is no delivery of houses.</p> <p>We have a massive problem in Carlow because contrary to popular opinion, we are close enough to Dublin for people to commute.  People are buying houses in our county and renting out the remainder.  There is hardly a house left that we can buy through the local authority or that people are buying, and waiting lists are growing almost daily.  What firm handle is the Minister applying to these planned targets because that is what we need now?</p> <p>I know the Minister is aware that this is a serious issue but we have serious issues to deal with and before we engage in the usual back and forth debate on who is at fault, we need to draw a breath.  We cannot sit here and argue among ourselves, blaming the current political players for the actions of past political players.  We are not playing a history game.  We should rise above that and look at the massive issues at hand.</p></speech>

I am getting there.  Almost 10,000 people are homeless, more than 3,000 of them are  children.  We are a rich country so if money is not a problem, what is the problem?  Homeless numbers are high.  Home building numbers are tens of thousands behind what they should be.  Ordinary workers cannot afford a home and those who have secured a mortgage are struggling.  We are struggling here, Minister.</p> <p>I and my party are calling on the Minister and his party to make changes, make a policy shift to establish an affordable housing scheme, increase social housing spending and strengthen the rental sector.  This Government has to start delivering on housing.  After four separate plans and over a dozen launches, it needs to put bricks and mortar in the ground.  People need that.  They do not need announcements and fancy photo opportunities.  They need houses, and we need to see them getting the keys for their houses.</p> <p>Supply and affordability is the key issue that must be addressed in order to get to grips with the crisis in the private, social and rental sector.  In 2017, and this frightens me, only 60 apprentices registered for bricklaying and stone laying and 34 for plastering.  That is far short of what is required to meet even the Government's target of a limit of 25,000 housing units.  We are falling down in terms of the supply of bricklayers and stone layers.  How can we build if we do not have builders?  We need urgent action on</p> <p>that.  We need incentives to lure our builders back from Canada, Australia and America.  We need to examine why those who have worked abroad and raised money for a deposit for their own homes are not qualifying for a mortgage because our banks will not take rent payments as proof of ability to pay.  That is a major issue, and it is one of the biggest issues the Minister will have to deal with in the future.  We have so much to examine but we need to work together on this issue.</p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il has been working with the Minister's Government in a confidence and supply agreement on this issue and we will continue to put forward costed, credible ideas to work out all the layers of this complicated crisis.  The vacant housing Bill has the potential to bring 4,000 new units into the system by streamlining planning for above-shop unit spaces.  We have already put forward a new Bill to give the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, investigatory powers to reinforce rent pressure zones, RPZs.  This week, we have approved a new Bill to extend rent pressure zones to purpose built student accommodation.  I would argue that we need to look at the pockets of rent surges throughout the country and at rolling out rent pressure zones outside the commuter belts.</p> <p>On 17 April the Minister announced a tenancy Bill in the Cabinet which states that any landlord in rent pressure zones will commit an offence if they increase the rent above 4%.  I am very disappointed today.  I have raised that issue with the Minister on several occasions.  Our neighbouring counties, Wicklow and Kildare, are in rent pressure zones but Laois, Kilkenny, Wexford and Carlow are not in rent pressure zones.  In terms of what has happened, the Department has put together a plan and neighbouring counties are in rent pressure zones but Carlow, my constituency, Kilkenny, Laois and Wexford are not in those rent pressure zones.  That is unacceptable and I have highlighted that for the Minister on several occasions.</p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il supports measures which have legislation to empower the RTB to undertake its own investigations, with the Social Democrats, to strengthen RPZs.  We are also putting forward a new Bill to limit rent increases in student accommodation to 4%, which is the case in all rent pressure zones.  However, those steps will not address the rent crisis.  What is needed is a comprehensive cost rental model in cities across Ireland.  That should use State lands to provide cheap, affordable units to rent for average income earners.</p> <p>This tinkering around the edges will not resolve the crisis.  I have said it twice but I cannot emphasise enough the importance of building houses.  We need to examine why we are always playing catch-up on this crisis.  We are late to every battle on it, and something has to change.  Reactive policy has meant the State is always behind.  We cannot continue as people die on our streets and stress breaks up families, especially those in arrears with their mortgages.</p> <p>The Minister might ask what my party would do differently if we were in his shoes.  I will tell him.  We would increase the capital budget.  It is still 24% below 2008 levels.  A new housing agency would be established that would run efficiently and make clear decisions.  We would use NAMA and bank share proceeds to invest in social housing.  We would look at the possibility of loans from credit unions.  The issue of credit unions and so on must be addressed because there is an issue with mortgages.  The Minister has brought in a new mortgage for first-time buyers.  I do not have time to go through that with him but the people who need to qualify for that are not qualifying.  There are so many restrictions attached to this new mortgage that most people are not qualifying for it.</p></speech>

From time to time, though, there are frustrations about the slowness of the process.  Undoubtedly, even the Minister is frustrated in that regard and is eager to move the situation on.  I acknowledge his commitment to this.</p><p>The Minister is present, so I will repeat something that I said last week because I want him to hear it from me directly.  I am disappointed by the targets that have been set for the 31 local authorities with the agreement of their chief executives and the Minister.  Those targets are not ambitious.  I took the time to read the Department's website and some of the Minister's speeches provided thereon.  It is an excellent website.  The Minister referred to stretching people and being ambitious.  The figures before us are the minimum ones.  For example, 115 units are to be built in Carlow in 2018.  Lest there be ambiguity, these are the figures of the direct social housing build.  There are other forms, of course.  As I have stated time and again in the Chamber and at the committee, I do not have a hang-up about who builds houses, be it local authorities, approved housing bodies, AHBs, co-operatives, private bodies, public ones or public private partnerships.  I do not have a problem with any of those.  We want to build new homes that are affordable to rent and purchase.  The Minister agrees fully with that.</p><p>Consider the figures, though.  Cavan's is 41, Clare's is 29, Cork city's is 249 and Cork county's is 235.  Kilkenny's is 98, Longford's is 44, Mayo's is 69 and Offaly's is 19.  These are the agreed targets for social housing.  Undoubtedly, the Minister will say that there are other aspects.  Wicklow's figure is 156.  All of the areas' figures are listed and have been published in the media and via the Minister's press release.</p><p>The social housing construction projects status report for the fourth quarter of 2017 is interesting.  Today, <i>The Irish Times</i>published a timely article and released figures, which I have checked with the Department.  There were 780 social houses built in 2017.  I am open to correction.</p></speech>

I am not referring to AHB builds but local authority builds.  I take on board the Minister's assertion that this figure is not correct, but he might confirm whether it is correct to say that 1,757 voids were brought back into use.  That would be a good and impressive figure.  As reported in <i>The Irish Times</i>, 543 of that number were in Dublin city, 168 were in Donegal and 121 were in Fingal.  That is an achievement and a positive news story and I would be interested in hearing the Minister's thoughts on it.  Rather than citing the article any further, the Minister might circulate in the next few days the correct figure for the direct social housing build in 2017.</p><p>I acknowledge the positives that are happening.  Cork is in the national media today.  We read that plans for 600 new homes are to be submitted to Cork City Council next month, making it the authority's landmark project to tackle the housing shortage on Leeside.  The 22 acre site will be the single largest housing development in the city.  We must concentrate on positive news, and this is positive news.  In conjunction with the city council, Cork County Council has drafted major plans for new council designs.  This is also positive.  It is important that we use every model to develop housing.</p><p>All of the Members present are close to our 959 or so local councillors throughout the country.  The Minister used to be a council member, so he also has this experience.  He also has significant levels of contact with his group across the 31 councils.  Councillors are frustrated with the slowness of the process.  Some of the chief executives and housing authorities are frustrated.  Everyone wants progress and to be positive, so what is the problem?  Can we increase the level of direct builds?</p><p>I read something else today.  All of this information is coming from the media, so I would like the Minister to correct me if I am wrong.  The Taoiseach commented on the possibility of the Government acquiring more private land.  That is not necessary.  I have taken the time to have an assessment done of some of our local authorities' landbanks.  The Minister knows the details from his own research.  There are substantial landbanks on most of the authorities' books.  As such, we must ask why the Government is not pushing for a greater level of social housing building on council lands.  It is what the public wants and expects.  I do not wish to frustrate the private sector in this regard, but it is important that we embark on an ambitious plan.  I am familiar with a number of social housing schemes in the Dublin and Kildare areas that were built in the 1950s and 1960s.  Some comprised 300 houses.  I am not suggesting that we want schemes with 300 houses now, but their planners were ambitious.  The Minister is ambitious as well, but I am not convinced that we have set the targets for local authorities high enough.  I would be interested in the Minister's response.  What sanctions can he bring to bear on a local authority that does not perform on what are very low targets?</p><p>I do not wish to dwell on this matter any further because I am conscious that the Minister is busy and I have other opportunities through the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government to engage with him.  I thank him for that ongoing engagement.</p><p>How can we work better with elected members of local authorities and council management?  The Minister cannot micromanage the local authorities, but he can incentivise them.  He also has the power to sanction them, even though he might not want to use it.

I constantly go around in circles on this topic trying to figure out solutions.  I hate to hear other parties and the media claiming that Fine Gael does not have a social conscience and that other parties have the monopoly on concern and care for people who are struggling with the housing crisis.  We all know that is not the case.  The Government, the larger part of which is Fine Gael, is working tirelessly to improve the situation.  That includes the Minister and his predecessor, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney.</p> <p>I wish to ask a series of questions instead of pontificating about what the Minister should and should not do.  I hope he can answer them.  If not, perhaps he will send me a letter or email about them later.</p> <p>Why can we not just instruct councils to build where they have land?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gabrielle McFadden:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2399"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2399&amp;amp;pid=GabrielleMcFadden&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If they come back and say that they do not have the staff and that is why they cannot build, why can we as a Government not allow them to recruit?  If money is not an issue, why can local authorities not recruit staff who can build on the local authorities' own land?  If it is more cost-effective for the local authorities to buy in expertise and contractors, why can we not do that?</p><p>Councillors around the country whom I speak to want their local authorities to build houses in their localities.  Local authority staff want to build houses but they say they are held back by red tape.  Why can we not deal with that?</p><p>Some local authorities state that they do not have the resources to build and yet there are local authorities next door to them that have resources.  Why can three or four local authorities not come together, pool their resources and build together?  It may be more cost-effective.</p><p>What is happening to houses that are derelict that have derelict site orders placed on them by councillors?  Why are they not subject to CPOs?  Why is there not funding invested in those?  Some buildings in my area have been the subject of a CPO and they are still sitting there nearly ten years later.  Why are they not being dealt with?  Are the local authorities being held accountable for those lands?</p><p>Recently local authority staff told me that they are inundated with people presenting themselves as homeless at the local authority offices, so much so that they are not at their desks working to house people but are down meeting them coming into the reception area.  When they ask the clerk of works for the local authority to go out and inspect houses for people to move into, he cannot do so because he is the only one in the Athlone municipal area.  Why can local authorities not employ staff?  There is no moratorium on recruiting staff at present.</p><p>The previous Minister had an idea, the repair and lease scheme, that I was keen on and that I had made a submission to him on.  Why was there such poor uptake of that scheme and what can we do to improve it?  These are all questions that have been put to me over the past number of months.  I do not know the answers to them and that is why I want the Minister to answer them for me.</p><p>Earlier in the year, an article I read stated that Permanent TSB was selling the 14,000 non-performing mortgage loans.  Why could the Government not buy these mortgages and keep those people in their homes?  What was to stop us doing that if we have the money?</p><p>Everybody knows the use of hotels is not suitable for families and it has to stop.  Why can that money not be redirected and used to house families?  These are all questions that people ask me every day, and I do not know the answers.  I feel frustrated that I cannot answer them.  They seem sensible, down to earth and simplistic.  They are probably too simplistic for the Minister but I would love if he could answer those questions.</p><p>I would love if the Government could say to the banks that not one more person is to be made homeless because of a bank that we are stakeholders in and that we as a country bailed out.  No bank should ever be allowed to make a person homeless from here on in.  It is just not good enough in this day and age.</p><p>I ask the Minister to give me answers to those questions.  I appreciate all his work.  I am aware of the hours he puts into this.  I am aware of the concern that the Minister has, like the rest of his Fine Gael colleagues, for those who have housing difficulties.  I really appreciate the work the Minister is doing and I thank him.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-04-25a.191" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1385" speakername="Grace O'Sullivan" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018042500002#DD00200"><p>Here we are again making statements on housing.  It is impressive to hear the Minister talk about the numbers of houses being built, etc., but if I talk to people in my constituency in Waterford or meet people here in Dublin, the word on the street is that we still have a housing crisis.  The articles I read in the newspapers are still about those who are suffering because of affordability.  Their salary is not sufficient to enable them to afford to buy a house.  Their salary is not sufficient to enable them to afford renting.  There are students who cannot afford the rent.  When one looks at the situation on the ground and when one hears what the Minister is saying, it just does not seem to match up.</p> <p>I refer to a Goodbody report that I saw on Monday last which found that Ireland's level of housing output is among the lowest in Europe with only 2,367 housing units built during the first three months of 2018.  It is clear that we are not meeting the level of demand.  The numbers are based on building energy regulation applications rather than the number of ESB connections that the Department uses but the building energy regulation, BER, applications are a better indication of whether the houses are actually appearing on the market.  I cannot understand the disparity between the numbers in the Goodbody report and the numbers listed by the Department under Rebuilding Ireland.</p> <p>Apart from the issue of completions, we have problems that come from the developer-led approach to housing and construction.  These include, as I stated, the lack of affordability.  They also include problems with regard to quality and the real menace, that plagues me and leads to misery with regard to housing, of land speculation.  Investors bought almost one fifth of all homes on sale in Ireland in 2017 which inflated prices and rents.  This problem will likely only worsen in the face of Brexit as already we see people start to move out of the London property market.  These may decide to invest their moneys here in Ireland, as the nearest English-speaking country.  In fact, this would worsen the problem here considerably.</p> <p>From the evidence I see and the reports I read, we are still in this housing crisis.  In this crisis we still see private developers hoarding land in derelict and vacant sites.  I commend the Government on finally getting around to the implementation of the vacant site levy next year and the increase, to 7%, in the rate in year 2, as argued so heavily in the Derelict and Vacant Sites Bill I introduced to this House last year.  The local authority in Waterford states that even if that 7% levy is applied, it will be difficult to bring it in.  It is difficult for the local authorities to ensure that 7% will be paid up.  We have thus crossed the line of constricting private property rights regarding housing and construction, and without facing the wrath of the courts.  I welcome the move and I hope that it will yield new development over the coming years.  I hope a system will be put in place whereby the local authorities will be able to draw down the 7%.</p> <p>Ten thousand people were on the streets of Dublin last month marching with the housing and homeless coalition protest and many of my Green Party colleagues from around the country were there to add their voice.  My colleagues were calling for a socially-minded housing policy that helps the homeless and restricts speculators.  The Minister mentioned in his presentation the Government's support for the cost rental model.  This is something the Green Party will be focusing heavily on at a constituency level, identifying public spaces suitable for development in high-pressure areas.  I am glad to hear that on this we can work with the Government to help identify and increase the supply of high-quality and affordable rental property.</p> <p>In the fit of the information the Minister is providing with the message and the reality out on the streets, one might say there is a gap.  There will be an acceleration of activity.  Hopefully, under the Minister's stewardship over the coming months we will see a change from what is perceived as a housing crisis and be in a position to stop using phrases such as "housing crisis" and "homelessness crisis".</p></speech>

I will speak mainly about student housing if that is okay.  I am conscious it is only one part of the subject but if the Minister cannot answer questions I have today, we could revisit them in future statements.  To follow Senator O'Sullivan's point on investors buying a fifth of the available housing, I read somewhere that every time a bomb is dropped in Syria there is a flight of capital to London.  I cannot imagine there are wealthy people who would come to Dublin for a party once a year and leave the house for the rest of the year but I wonder if there are broader parallels that the Department could examine between Dublin and London, particularly in the Brexit context.</p> <p>When most of us consider student housing, we think of times when we were younger and living in accommodation not close to the standards we are used to today.  The expectation in standards of student housing has been particularly low for some time before any accommodation crisis.  It is a sector with rogue landlords who shirk their responsibility to provide adequate standards of living and attempt to manipulate an age cohort that might not be as comfortable or experienced in asserting their tenancy rights.  I spent a short time in Galway but the accommodation I saw had issues like black mould, draughts, damp, a lack of insulation and a number of repair or maintenance issues that a landlord may refuse to deal with.  Many of us may look back with fondness on our times as students but we should not lower our expectations for standards of accommodation based on age or some sort of nostalgic right of passage.  We are in a rental crisis but it is no time for us to absolve ourselves of having adequate standards.  I am sure the Minister agrees with that.</p> <p>It is more important than ever to realise and actively promote tenancy rights as our younger renters are more vulnerable at this time.  The most pressing matter I have seen with young renters is either a portion of or the entire deposit being unfairly retained by a landlord when a young person leaves accommodation in the summer after exams.  The Department has been aware of this practice for some time and has formulated a deposit retention scheme; the Department announced its intention to roll out such a scheme in September 2017.  That has yet to happen and I wonder if the Minister could progress this in time for September 2018, when student renters will move into new properties and pay deposits to new landlords.</p> <p>There is no doubt that student renters are hit by the crisis.  Our students are engaging in personal development and career advancement.  They are faced with higher fees, rising rents, sometimes part-time and precarious work, as well as escalating costs of living.  The student accommodation sector, like the entire rental sector, is rife with those who seek to take advantage of the lack of supply and proposed extortionate rates.  Inevitably, the average rent per room is driven up in the vicinity of our third level institutions.  This is done outside of rent pressure zones and, in many cases, in direct defiance of those zones.  I wish the Department well in its endeavours to clamp down on that.</p> <p>Purpose-built student accommodation is, however, outside rent pressure zones and is beyond the remit of the Residential Tenancies Board.  This issue has come to prominence with the Dublin City University student union holding a protest outside Leinster House as just one part of its action in the "Shanowen shakedown" campaign.  Rents are to be increased by 27% to &euro;9,000 for the next academic year, working out at approximately &euro;1,000 per month per room for student accommodation.  It is completely unsustainable and it is cruel and greedy of the landlords involved.  Over 50% of DCU students receive a maintenance grant and therefore their families simply cannot afford &euro;250 per week on accommodation along with all the other costs of living in a city and dealing with education.</p> <p>Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin is currently drafting legislation that would bring purpose-built student accommodation into the rent pressure zone process in order to give students some certainty about their rent.  Will the Minister give an indication of his plans to deal effectively with this as the current position is untenable?  Every year in which the loophole is not close we leave the most vulnerable people locked out of the rental market.</p></speech>

The Minister is welcome to the House and I thank him for being here.  It is an important debate.  Like Senator McFadden I dispel the idea that the Fine Gael Party is not concerned with housing and does not build social housing or support the construction of such housing.  I commend the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English.  In Cork city the Minister has opened a number of housing developments and we have just signed a contract in Deanrock estate with the Department to construct more than 60 social houses.  Go over Tramore road to Sheridan Park and one will find people living in new houses provided under Rebuilding Ireland.  If we were to listen to some people in this housing debate we would swear nothing at all is happening and the Minister is uncaring, as he was unfairly portrayed by Deputy Darragh O'Brien.  Of course he cares.  I know Deputy Murphy to be a person of sincerity and intellect who is committed to this in his Department, as is the Minister of State, Deputy English.  I always speak on housing as I believe in both the Minister and the Minister of State.</p> <p>I am impatient to see change and to have it more quickly like everybody else.  The alleviation of the housing crisis is a Government priority.  Rebuilding Ireland is ahead of its targets but we all accept there is a road to travel.  We must be honest in recognising there is no quick single fix for this.  The targeted Government initiatives are working, although perhaps we need to tweak some of them.  Perhaps we must be creative and think outside the box as well.  I know Senator Murnane O'Connor spoke of historical but it is important to recognise that the construction sector was decimated and there are now fewer people employed in the housing and construction sector.  We can compare the number of builders of houses in Cork now with 15 or 16 years ago and it is a fraction.  I appreciate that under the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, there is a new apprenticeship recruitment process but we can consider the age profile in the construction sector.  Many builders have now retired or gone abroad so we must think about how we can incentivise people to come back to the sector.</p> <p>Fundamental in the debate is that demand is outpacing supply.  Notwithstanding the Minister's speech and his actions, we must take additional measures to stimulate supply.  One of the problems is the price of development land and the way in which the price of land affects developers.  At one stage in my political life I was of the view that developers were the bogey men but they are not.  We need to have developers as part of the process, even if it is not developer-led.</p></speech>
