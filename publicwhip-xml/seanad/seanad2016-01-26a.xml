    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-01-26a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1196" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016012600002#B00400"><p>I welcome the Minister.  I join the Cathaoirleach in welcoming a great sportsman, Bernard Dunne, to the Visitors Gallery.  I am honoured to be here in his presence and to be speaking on a matter that is very close to his heart.  I would like to acknowledge that a man of his standing having an interest in DEIS schools, in students generally and in the shaping of children is evidence of the great service he does for the State.  We should honour him for that.  In saying this, I am not taking away from the work done by my colleague, Senator Eamonn Coghlan.  It is an honour indeed to have two great sportspeople in the Chamber.</p> <p>As the Minister knows, I have asked her to confirm the terms of reference for the current review of the disadvantaged schools and the date by which recommended reforms will be implemented.  I also ask her to outline the funding that will be available to implement the new delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, programme in order to cater for the new entrants that will inevitably emerge from this review.</p> <p>I thank the Minister for coming to the Seanad to debate this important issue.  There is no doubt that the DEIS programme, first introduced in 2005, has been extremely successful.  Attendance rates have improved, the gap in retention rates between DEIS and non-DEIS schools has narrowed and there have been considerable improvements in maths and reading scores.  There is also no doubt that some schools currently included in the DEIS programme no longer have the same level of need as previously.  Similarly, some schools previously outside the DEIS programme have now become centres of disadvantaged communities and urgently require access to the supports provided under the programme.</p> <p>I understand that both the overall DEIS programme and the school meals programme, which is operated by the Department of Social Protection, are currently under review.  Given the complexity of the situation with regard to DEIS designation, what are the terms of reverence for the Minister's review and by what date will the recommendations of the review be implemented?  Will she also outline the funding that will be available to implement the new DEIS programme to cater for the new entrants that will inevitably emerge as a result of the review?</p> <p>The DEIS programme has many objectives, one of which is the elimination of food poverty.  This is an essential foundation stone on which educational attainment is built.  No child can learn when he or she is hungry.  I am concerned that there are now serious anomalies in disadvantaged communities.  Some DEIS schools have funding for all their children, 60 cent for breakfast - a rather paltry sum - and &euro;1.40 for lunch.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2402"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2402&amp;amp;pid=GerardPCraughwell&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, some schools are only 50% funded.  The Minister may say this is a matter for the Department of Social Protection, but a cross-departmental approach is needed to deal with this matter.  The issue of child food poverty should be an intrinsic part of the educational policy.  </p><p>Dr. Paul Dowds of St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, has said that currently there is no systematic strategy in place to prevent children from being hungry in schools.  He has reminded us that unlike countries such as Britain, France and Poland, Irish schools have historically had a poor infrastructure for school meals and are dependent on external suppliers.  </p><p>In Ireland, there is currently no regulation of school meal suppliers and quality depends on the integrity of the supplier.  I ask the Minister, together with the Minister for Social Protection, to review the following issues: increasing the budget for the school meals programme; increasing the allocation for breakfast and lunch by 5% to 63 cent and &euro;1.47, respectively - these have not been increased for over a decade and suppliers are struggling to supply; establishing a list of approved suppliers for school meals programmes to guarantee quality; and introducing the schools meals programme into all schools where there is recognised food poverty, but which do not have DEIS status.  </p><p>I thank the Minister for attending the House and I hope she will be able to follow up on these issues with the Department of Social Protection.  I know that some of these matters are the direct responsibility of the Department of Social Protection but, overall, the Department of Education and Skills has a responsibility for education.  Hungry children simply cannot learn.  We cannot continue to have staff - as in some places I have seen - paying for breakfast cereals in order that kids will have a basic meal before starting the day.  I am not sure if the Minister is aware that is happening in some areas but it is.</p></speech>

I also wish to welcome the school students from Enniskillen who are in the Visitors Gallery.  I met them coming in the door earlier.</p> <p>I thank Senator Craughwell for raising this issue.  I absolutely concur with him that this is a very important issue.  As he is aware, I announced a process for a review of the DEIS programme last year.  The overall scope of the review is to assess the existing DEIS programme in the context of evaluations to date, and any relevant policy and other developments in order to inform future policy on educational disadvantage.</p> <p>This DEIS review process is now well under way with the majority of the work being undertaken during the course of the current 2015-16 school year.  It is envisaged that the new identification process and a revised framework of supports will be in place for the 2017-18 school year.</p> <p>One of the first tasks conducted, as part of the review process, was an invitation to the education partners to make submissions on their experience of DEIS and on suggestions for future interventions.  These submissions are available on my Department's website and will inform the overall DEIS review.  The general guidelines with regard to the review are also on the Department's website.</p> <p>A technical working group within my Department is considering appropriate eligibility criteria to assist with the identification of the level of need in schools.  This work is currently under way with a view to completion during the current school year.  That will be added to the information that is already on the website.</p> <p>Any revised identification process for schools will be clearly set out and communicated to schools.  An advisory group has also been established to review the current supports available under the DEIS programme and make recommendations for a revised framework of appropriate supports, as well as a suitable monitoring and evaluation framework. </p> <p>As is the case with the identification process, any change to the existing school support programme will be clearly set out and communicated in advance.  As Senator Craughwell so rightly said, there are issues across other Government Departments as well.</p> <p>Socio-economic differences and the link to poorer educational outcomes cannot be viewed in isolation from the broader social context.  Therefore, I have established an interdepartmental working group in order to ensure a more joined-up and consistent approach to service delivery in the future.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Jan O'Sullivan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=1754"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1754&amp;amp;pid=JanOSullivan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Representatives of relevant Departments and agencies are reviewing their current inputs to the DEIS programme in order to make a more cohesive contribution to the overall framework of supports to combat educational disadvantage.  That will include the Departments of Social Protection and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  I understand the Department of Health has an input as well and there may be other relevant Departments.</p><p>All of the groups that I have mentioned are part of the overall review of DEIS.  It would be premature at this stage to outline what funding will be made available in advance of the various groups finalising their work and recommendations for a new framework of supports.  Once this work has been completed, the costs associated with additional and-or new supports will form part of the overall consideration of the new programme to tackle educational disadvantage.  Such consideration will take place in the context of the overall budgetary planning process.</p><p>I wish to add that DEIS was established in 2006.  One of the problems has been the fact that it is impossible to join the scheme, even for new schools.  There are also issues around amalgamated schools and a number of other issues.  Overall, there has been positive progress.  We want to maintain what is good about the programme at the moment but we think it is time to have a review.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-01-26a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1196" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016012600002#D00200"><p>I take what the Minister has said.  She has worked hard and done an excellent job even as we approach an election.  I hope that we will see her back here and that when the next Government is formed we would move rapidly towards identifying schools.  I am aware of a school in Galway that I will not name but I may come back to the Minister about it.  The school is surrounded by a fairly well-to-do area but a huge number of Traveller children attend the school.  It would qualify on every level for DEIS status but for some reason such status has been impeded.</p> <p>I would prefer if the Department of Social Protection, rather than funding the school meals programme, gave a grant to the Department of Education and Skills.  Such an initiative would allow the Minister or her successor to utilise the money in the best way possible rather than having a cross-departmental thing.  I can understand how the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Health might have to work with the Department of Education and Skills.  The funding from the Department of Social Protection should be ring-fenced and handed to the Minister for Education and Skills thus allowing her to deal with the entire programme of meals and education, which is something similar to what happens in the UK.</p></speech>

That work is under way at the moment.  Any school that meets the criteria for inclusion in the new programme will be included and that is an undertaking.</p> <p>Second, a forum will take place in the spring.  I do not know whether I will be the Minister at that point but I thank the Senator for his good wishes. </p></speech>

This will include a discussion on the process used to identify schools for inclusion and the proposed framework of supports to be deployed.  I imagine that the issues about interdepartmental co-operation and whether certain things should move from one Department to another will probably form part of the discussions on the various programmes for Government which will also, I presume, feed into this process.</p></speech>

We all know that this is an important programme.  For example, literacy and numeracy results in DEIS schools have improved significantly.

The obesity epidemic is an issue that I have been vocal about for some time and my Commencement matter pertains to children in particular.</p> <p>The Minister of State will be aware of recent figures.  I was shocked by one figure in particular which claimed that over the next 14 years, or by 2020, we will spend approximately &euro;4.3 billion a year on health-related obesity costs.  To a health service that is already struggling such a cost deserves serious consideration.  There has also been a 65% rise in diabetes in the UK in the past ten years.  A similar study has not been conducted in Ireland but we are following a similar trend, if not a worse one, than the UK.  Such figures are very significant from that point of view.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Catherine Noone:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2354"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2354&amp;amp;pid=CatherineNoone&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Obesity robs children of their health and vitality.  It is an issue we are not taking seriously enough in this country.  One in four children is either overweight or obese.  We will soon be talking about one in three children being overweight or obese if we do not begin to take the issue more seriously.  Pinning the blame on parents simply will not wash.  In the long term, we have to take a societal approach.  One such measure is imposing a "no fry zone" near schools.  It is a catchy headline.  The reality is that if children are able to make an unhealthy choice, they are more likely to make it.  I propose that within a 500 m radius of a school, one should not be allowed to build or use a premises as a chipper.  There are chippers in many towns around the country but this is not about banning chippers or chips or anything of the sort.  It is simply about getting children to make healthier choices.  It is a bit like removing sweets from the till, which many supermarkets have done.  It helps in dealing with pester power and in making better choices.</p><p>I reiterate that I am not down on chippers as a business.  It is not that I think children should not eat any fried food.  Why not occasionally?  It is just that some of these outlets target children on their lunch break or after school with deals to get them eating their food.  They are business people and they have to make a living.  One can understand why it happens.  There is some international evidence to back this up.  In a study carried out in California, students with a fast food restaurant near their schools consumed much less fruit and vegetables, consumed more fizzy drinks and were more likely to be overweight or obese.  Obviously this is an issue for development plans in the council.  When it comes to planning, it is a local government issue but the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government should have some policy when it comes to this issue and should encourage local government to come up with a reasonable proposal for a "no fry zone" near schools.  It has simply gone beyond the stage where we need to do something about the issue of growing obesity levels in the country.  I look forward to hearing from the Minister of State on the matter.</p></speech>

I thank the Senator for raising this important issue and giving me an opportunity to set out the position in respect of this matter.</p> <p>In the first instance, I wish to clarify that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government does not have a role in imposing a so-called "no fry zones" in particular areas.  However, the Department has a role in advising planning authorities, through statutory guidelines, as regards the structure and content of their local area plans.  In this regard, I confirm that the Department has advised planning authorities that in adopting local area plans for their areas, that they may, in certain circumstances, adopt policies to curtail an excessive concentrations of takeaways in particular areas.  The advice given was outlined in planning guidelines on local area plans published in June 2013 and to which planning authorities must have regard to in the discharge of their functions under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  </p> <p>These guidelines recognise the important role of planning in promoting and facilitating active and healthy living patterns for local communities.  For example, section 5 of these guidelines offers advice regarding the structure and content of local area plans and sets out a range of policies that can be put in place to promote and facilitate active and healthy living patterns.  These include: promoting of walking and cycling as modes of transport; accessibility to public open spaces, recreation and sports facilities; proximity of new development to sustainable travel modes; provision of play areas; and careful consideration of the appropriateness of the location of fast food outlets in the vicinity of schools and parks.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Kevin Humphreys:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2289"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->One particular effect of these guidelines with regard to fast food outlets is that consideration be given to the appropriateness of their location in the vicinity of schools and parks, for example, in a new development area, while at the same time taking account of wider land use considerations.  However, with regard to the many schools located in or near town centres, restrictions of fast food outlets in such situations must be considered carefully on a case-by-case basis in view of the mix of existing use typically found in core urban areas.</p><p>In addition, planning policies with regard to the location of fast food outlets must be considered within the wider policy context of practical steps that can be taken to promote more widely and facilitate active healthy living patterns by enhancing the scope for activities such as walking, cycling, sports and active leisure pursuits and their associated facilities.</p><p>I do not merely speak with regard to the Department's position but that of all Departments when stating the pursuit of healthy lifestyles requires a holistic approach that requires a much broader public health discussion.  I am confident, however, that the guidance the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government offers to planning authorities in this regard fulfils an important role in achieving that goal.  I thank the Senator.</p></speech>

I note the comment in the reply given by the Minister of State regarding the Department's position to the effect that the pursuit of a healthy lifestyle requires a holistic approach, which requires a much broader health discussion.  I know that and do not suggest that were one to implement a no-fry zone around schools, the obesity crisis would suddenly disappear.  It obviously would not solve the crisis single-handedly and the issue of fast food restaurants near schools is not the sole reason for obesity.  I welcome that under section 5 of the guidelines issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, careful consideration should be taken of the appropriateness of the location of fast food outlets in the vicinity of schools and parks when it comes to planning.  However, I refer to a specific provision in the case of a new business that seeks to set up near a school and do not believe that should be left to chance.  There should be specific policy embedded in legislation whereby it is not possible to have a fast food outlet in close proximity to a school.</p> <p>While I welcome that some positive measures are outlined in what was a good reply, the Government must go further.  I thank the Minister of State.</p></speech>

While this undoubtedly is an important issue, as indicated within the body of the original reply, the guidelines give power to local government regarding new developments.  The Senator  highlighted this point in respect of section 5 of these guidelines.  There is a specific problem regarding existing businesses that would be within 500 m and I acknowledge the Senator accepts completely that point.  However, there must be much greater concentration on local area plans at local government level, which can give those guidelines to the planning authorities to show there is a concern with regard to the location of fast food outlets.  In my constituency, a burger outlet sought to open right next door to a school but it was refused planning permission for some of the reasons the Senator outlined.  Consequently, in some cases, there is a robustness to the existing guidelines.  However, this is a holistic endeavour and is not simply a matter for the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  It is about education and all the different factors, as well as working with the commercial sector.  However, it also is a parental issue and I do not dismiss the influence parents have in this regard.</p></speech>

I apologise that my voice is suffering; it was not by any means from cheering on Kerry at the weekend.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie Moloney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2356"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2356&amp;amp;pid=MarieMoloney&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Before I speak about unregistered unemployed persons, I commend and acknowledge the work the Minister of State, the Minister and the Department have done to lower the number on the live register.  I appreciate that priority had to be given to reducing the high number on the live register and that it was a mammoth task to get people back to work.  As the figure has been lowered significantly, I am now asking that attention be given to unregistered unemployed persons and, in particular, bringing them into activation programmes.  Who do I mean when I refer to the "unregistered unemployed"?  I mean self-employed persons who, through no fault of their own or as a result of the recession, have seen their businesses go belly-up.  They are no longer in self-employment and some of them cannot access jobseeker's allowance as they have property or their spouse is working.  We also have women in the home whose children have reached the age of 14 years.  They are no longer in receipt of homemaker's credits and would like to get back to work.  We have college students who are looking for their first job such.  They cannot sign on until September. even though it is acknowledged that they have finished college.  In many cases, their parents do not want them to sign on because they think it would be bad for them.  They want them to look for a job instead.  There are, therefore, a number of people who are, in fact, unemployed but not registered.  In particular, I urge that attention be given to women in the home.  A number of years ago a course was set up by F&Aacute;S for women who wanted to return to work having reared their children.  The course helped them re-enter the workforce.  A similar course should be introduced.  </p><p>I have been very vocal in this House and committees on the situation faced by self-employed persons, many of whom do not realise that even if they access jobseeker's allowance, they will not have a credited contribution because they are moving from self-employment.  This will be detrimental to them later in terms of their pensions and they do not realise it.  They are getting a few bob from the Department of Social Protection, but they do not realise the situation in which they find themselves.  Furthermore, if they do not make a voluntary contribution within 12 months of making their last contribution, they will not be allowed to make one at all.  They will then find themselves in no-man's land and in years to come will see a big reduction in their pensions.  </p><p>I think the Minister of State will find it funny when I tell him what happened yesterday when my secretary googled the words "unregistered unemployed" to see if there was any category on which I was missing out.  We discovered that on 13 December 1934 an oral question had been asked on the subject in the D&aacute;il.  Some 82 years ago a Deputy Doyle spoke about it.  He asked the then Minister for Industry and Commerce who happened to be Se&aacute;n Lemass a question about it.  It is ironic that 82 years later I am asking questions about the unregistered unemployed, although I am sure they have been asked during the years too.  I await the Minister of State's reply.  Now that things are getting better, we really need to turn towards that cohort to bring them into the system, have them activated and brought back into employment.</p></speech>

Five years ago the rate of unemployment was 15.2%.  It is now below 9% and moving in the right direction.  It was natural that there would be a concentration on assisting those in receipt of benefits to get back into employment.  The distribution of what was a scarce resource was prioritised, I believe correctly.  Now, as we move from recession into recovery, the topic raised by the Senator is timely.  We have to discuss how we spend the fruits of the recovery and can ensure everyone will have an opportunity to share in it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Kevin Humphreys:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2289"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Senator has raised the issue of the unregistered unemployed with me numerous times, not only here in the House but also privately and I understand the concerns she has articulated especially over the past two years.</p><p>When the resources available to help people who are unemployed find work are constrained it makes sense that the State should allocate those resources, in the first instance, to those people upon whom it imposes an obligation to look for work.  Having said that, many services are also available to unemployed people who are not in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment, regardless of their previous employment or self-employment status.  For example, employment services, such as advice on job search activities and the use of online job search tools, are available to people if they register as jobseekers with the Department&rsquo;s Intreo centres, regardless of their social welfare status.  In addition, unemployed persons not in receipt of payments may also be eligible to avail of upskilling opportunities, for example through an education and training board, ETB, formerly F&Aacute;S, training for unemployed people.</p><p>Although they are not eligible to receive a training allowance while undertaking the course, as the allowance is related to the level of people&rsquo;s prior welfare payment they may receive some support for travel and meals costs.  Springboard and Skillnets courses for unemployed people, funded through the Department of Education and Skills, are also open to people who are unemployed, regardless of their social welfare status.</p><p>Finally, activation services and programmes are generally available to other groups of welfare recipients who are not required to be unemployed, in other words, to be available for, and actively seeking, work.  The two main groups involved here are recipients of lone parent's payments and of disability allowance.  In fact, people on disability payments have access to a range of programmes and supports such as the wage subsidy scheme, the employability service and specialised training courses that are not available to other jobseekers.</p><p>The Department is training some staff in all of its Intreo centres to improve the quality of service offered to people with disabilities.  As the economic recovery continues and demands on the employment service to work with unemployed people diminish, the Government has signalled its intention, in Pathways to Work 2016-2020, to extend proactive engagement to people of working age beyond the primary target group of people who are fully unemployed and receiving a jobseeker payment.  Among the main groups under consideration for the expansion of services are: casual and part-time workers who receive welfare support; adult dependants of jobseeker claimants; "voluntary engagers", people who are not on the live register but wish to avail of employment services; and people in receipt of disability payments who may have a capacity to work and an interest in employment.  Pathways to Work has a number of specific actions, for example, developing a proactive approach to support qualified adult dependants of people on welfare payments access employment, and expanding the use of Intreo centres by people with a disability, an objective that will be enabled by the staff training to which I already referred.  In short, the Government is committed to assisting as many people as possible to become more self-sufficient through work and will do this by developing and building on the successful implementation of the Pathways to Work strategy. </p><p>That does not cover all of Senator Moloney&rsquo;s contribution on pensions and pension contributions but this Government has made a commitment to start expanding the supports to people who are not receiving a benefit from the Department and helping as many people as possible to participate in the recovery that has started.  There will be many opportunities for people to get back into employment and the Intreo service, which is an excellent one, in the Senator&rsquo;s town will help people who had a break in their career, either because they were self-employed and their business went bust or because they took time out to rear children, back into work.  The Intreo centres have grown roots in almost every major town in the country and they will be built on and expanded to provide a service to the citizens. </p></speech>

I have always advocated that just because a person has a disability does not mean he or she cannot work.  I am delighted that that is the case.</p><p>The extension of the community employment scheme to people in their golden years went down very well with them.  They are thrilled about this and I hope the scheme will be expanded further.  </p><p>This may be my last chance to raise the issue, about which I have been harping on for quite some time.

There is nothing more important than having a role model within the household of somebody going out to work.</p> <p>The Senator mentioned the year 1934 and the question to the then Minister, Mr. Lemass, but we should look back and learn from what happened in the 1990s.  During the previous recession there was a group of persons who lost their jobs and did not have an opportunity to go out to work and were left behind as a ersult.  With their families, they did not see the Celtic tiger.  What we saw in many instances was intergenerational unemployment.  What we must do as a team of elected representatives of the people is to make sure, as we move from recession into recovery, everybody will have an opportunity to share in the recovery.  The best way to share in it is to ensure every household will have a role model of one member being back at work in order that everybody can aspire to having a good job that pays a fair wage, a good career and a good home and being able to rear a family.  The Government, including the T&aacute;naiste, is committed to doing this.  That is the reason the T&aacute;naiste introduced the changes in Intreo offices and brought forward so many schemes to make sure persons who were unemployed could stay in contact with the workforce, whether through training, community employment schemes, the JobBridge programme and many other elements.  JobsPlus is also playing a significant role in allowing persons who are long-term unemployed to get back into employment.</p> <p>I accept fully what the Senator has said about those who do not receive a payment from the Department of Social Protection and who have not been able to access such payments in the way she and I would wish, but as we move from recession into recovery, there is an opportunity to make sure they will receive these supports which will help them to get back into employment.  </p> <p>I thank the Senator for the support she gave me in the House during the year I have been a Minister of State.  I look forward to working with her in the future.</p></speech>

However, as Senator John Crown pointed out last week, when one is closing an entire surgery department to accommodate and cater for patients in the emergency department, one knows one has a crisis.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mark Daly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2246"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2246&amp;amp;pid=MarkDaly&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Minister does not appear to be aware there is a crisis, although he is very good at commentating all of the time, as if he was not the Minister for Health.<br/><br/>Last week I raised the issue of the victims of child abuse and the fact the Minister has been attacked because she is trying to minimise the State's liability for the payment of compensation to the victims of abuse.  <i>The Irish Times</i>has stated that the State has gone to the courts to seek protection to minimise its liability because it is being sued by the victims of child sexual abuse.  In that High Court case, the State is trying to minimise its liability and to seek protection from being sued, along with the Christian Brothers.  We all know about the Louise O'Keeffe case and the ruling of the European Court of Human Rights.  To date, on the basis of that ruling, 350 cases for compensation are pending and only six cases have been settled by the State.  <br/><br/>Unfortunately, in this job, we come across some horrific cases of people who have been the victims of child sexual abuse.  We also hear about some of the victims who have gone to the courts and secured criminal convictions.  When those victims have sought compensation from the religious orders, including the Christian Brothers, they have been pursued and blocked at every turn by the religious orders.  That has happened despite the fact the victims have secured a conviction against the Christian Brothers in the criminal courts.  Victims of abuse have asked me where the State was when they needed protection.  The orders are now seeking protection through the courts to minimise their liability.  Worse than all of that, when one asks those in the Christian Brothers why it is going to court to try to minimise its liability, even though a member of the organisation has been found guilty in a criminal court, the answer one receives is that it wants the courts to decide the level of compensation.  When a member of the Christian Brothers told me that, I asked, &quot;Is that what Jesus would say to you?&quot;  If Jesus were here now, would he say that we should go to the courts?<br/><br/>A case in Florida, which was reported in the newspapers, was of a priest from Donegal who, in 2015, reported an allegation against a paedophile priest who was subsequently convicted.  The priest who made the allegation was victimised by the church.  He was locked out of his house and put on leave of absence by his bishop.  The priest reported these matters to the Vatican but he has not received a satisfactory reply.<br/><br/>Despite all of the assurances given by the Taoiseach in the other House and his fine words about protecting and looking after the victims of child abuse in this country, we can see that the State is still seeking protection not for the victims but from the victims.  We can also see that the church, as recently as last year, victimised the priests who were brave enough to report people who perpetrated child abuse.  The priests who reported the abuse suffered consequences because of their brave actions.  Will the Leader amend the Order of Business so that the Minister can come to the House and we can know why, despite all of the fine words about protecting the victims of child abuse, the State is going to the courts to seek protection from paying compensation to the victims of child abuse?</p></speech>

I refer specifically to the provision of Orkambi for cystic fibrosis sufferers which is a hugely important and pressing issue for many people across Ireland.  As I said last week, the matter is too important for it to be made a political football by us.  I thank the many colleagues from across the floor and from this side for signing up to the motion.</p> <p>I also welcome the introduction of paternity leave, which was announced today.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Cabinet has announced that it has given the green light for the introduction of two weeks paid paternity leave to take effect from September 2016.  This is a welcome first step in the recognition of fathers' rights in the workplace.  The T&aacute;naiste gave a commitment on it this time last year and it will come into effect later in the year.  It may not be possible between now and the general election but when time permits, will the Leader arrange for a broader debate not only on paternity leave and provision for fathers in the workplace but also on child care costs and the best models for child care, including the most cost effective and high quality models?  We, in the Labour Party, have given a commitment to extend paid paternity leave rights by three months over five years and to take measures to tackle the cost of child care.  It is a very pressing issue for many people.</p><p>I welcome the announcement this week in respect of physiotherapists.  Many of us raised the issue of the title of physiotherapist in the House and with the Minister for Health.  I am glad the Minister has decided not only that the title of physiotherapist will be protected under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act but also that he will protect the title of physical therapist as a varied title of physiotherapist as the best way to eliminate the ongoing risk of confusion and the consequent risk to public safety.  I am aware that new grandparenting provisions are being prepared which will allow practitioners to apply on a once off basis-----</p></speech>

It has been welcomed by practising physiotherapists, many of whom have been in contact with many of us.  It is an eminently sensible decision.</p> <p>I call for a debate on fourth level education and research funding when time permits.

I wonder if it is appropriate given this very significant inquiry - looking into the causes of the crash, looking into the way in which money was applied and looking into and criticising quite heavily the European Commissioners - that we had no representation whatever on this body.  That is devastating.  That is the result of cronyism.  This individual was transferred over to Europe as a sop to get him out of the way after he was involved in making a bags of the situation.

It is crucial to the well-being of this State and accountable to the hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people who are adversely affected by this situation.</p> <p>Another issue to which I draw the attention of the House and on which perhaps we could have a debate is the way in which planning regulations for apartments in Dublin have been changed in order to allow ever smaller apartments, tiny little one bedroom apartments into which a bed would hardly fit and for which the minimum size in terms of square metres has been reduced.  This is disastrous.  The inner city of Dublin is suffering from decisions made ten, 20 and 25 years ago which led to the continued increase in the provision of one bedroom apartments which means there is a completely volatile community passing through the inner city, leaving nothing of value behind.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->These apartments are neglected by many of the residents, although not all.  It is a recipe for disaster, socially and every other way, to have an over-abundance of tiny, cramped apartments in the inner city.  This is the Government's response to the housing crisis and the shortage of apartments and other living accommodation.  However, it is not appropriate to stuff the city with one-bedroom apartments.  An architect who appeared on television last night said these regulations are completely unworkable.</p></speech>

I am calling for an urgent debate on the matter.  The story states that the IRA broke into Special Branch headquarters in 2001 and stole thousands of documents, which it decoded.  It discovered its commander in north Belfast was an informer and that certain information was known to intelligence services in advance of the Shankill bomb.  I know the identity of this man but I will not name him here today.  The news is all the more shocking because it demonstrates the republican movement concealed this information for 15 years - since 2001 - while all the time highlighting collusion within the loyalist community.</p><p>Two children were murdered in the Shankill bombing, along with seven other innocent people and an IRA man.  All those families deserve the truth.  In addition, while the IRA commander was ordering murder and mayhem from 1991 to 2001, 68 people were murdered in north Belfast.  The British were also running intelligence agents in the Shankill area and the majority of those murdered were innocent people.  Serious questions need to be asked.  I did not hear one statement from anyone within Sinn F&eacute;in or the main Unionist parties yesterday.  Furthermore, this information shows that the IRA knew since 2001 that Denis Donaldson was an informer, yet he continued his position as a senior Sinn F&eacute;in member working in Stormont right up until 2005.  Why would Sinn F&eacute;in allow an intelligence agent to continue to act as the public face of its offices while knowing this information?  </p></speech>

There are people who can put a stop to it but they will not because self-preservation and political expedience are more lucrative for them.</p> <p>I will finish on this point.  It is traumatic, sick torture for those families to be denied answers but worse when they discover the truth has been deliberately withheld from them.  With the greatest of respect to the Leader, I do not want to hear any more waffle about truth recovery processes.  The reality is that neither Sinn F&eacute;in, the British Government, the current republican or loyalist paramilitaries or past loyalist paramilitaries are capable of telling the truth.  They are instead delaying and waiting on relatives to die in the hope that the issue will go away.  It will not go away.  Nothing short of an inquiry for all actions during the Troubles, including present actions, will suffice.</p></speech>

Over the years, I have used the platform of the Second House of the Oireachtas to inform people of and alert them to the issue of e-mail spamming and its insidious practice.  Sadly, it has reared its ugly head again in the past week.  This time the potential victims are customers of Irish Water.  An e-mail - a copy of which I received myself - is being sent, as is the practice, to customers and non-customers alike.  The e-mails have become increasingly sophisticated.  I am sure all Members of the House are familiar with banking spam e-mails, which look like the real thing.  This one looks like the real thing too and an unsuspecting consumer would be inclined to respond to the request to log on with his or her details.  The senders then get the person's bank account details and clear it out.</p> <p>I am sure the Leader will join with me in condemning this practice and highlighting to all those who are computer literate and use e-mail that no institution - financial or otherwise - such as Irish Water uses this type of e-mail to contact or communicate with its customers.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paschal Mooney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1990"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1990&amp;amp;pid=PaschalMooney&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Therefore, it is a scam.  It is the old cliche in the newspaper business, namely, "if in doubt, leave it out".  People should not touch it or click onto it but should simply delete it.  It is an insidious practice but sadly, people will be caught by it.  There are regular instances of people who succumb to this type of scamming and as a result have lost considerable sums of money, as well as enduring the emotional anguish that surrounds it.  The Leader should take this opportunity to agree with me and to highlight this insidious practice.  Hopefully, that will at least save some potential victims from losing all their money.</p></speech>

Given the current level and sophistication of technology, I am surprised it is not possible to get to the source of such scams because that is the only way in which they can be stamped out.</p> <p>All Members and all right-minded people are horrified by the reports being heard on a daily basis regarding the horrific murder that has resulted in an unfortunate victim's body parts being found in the Grand Canal at various locations close to the capital city.  Members' thoughts and prayers are with the family of the victim who suffered an horrific death.  They also have heard that in recent months there have been similar murders with similar outcomes for unfortunate victims and the media have suggested the existence of a serial killer or killers at large in Ireland.  We must support strongly the Garda, which is trying to resolve these horrific murders.  The Garda needs manpower and resources and I have no doubt but that all resources are being made available to it as it attempts to crack these particular crimes.  However, the Garda also needs the support of the public in the form of information on the movement of such dangerous criminals.  I urge the next Government, which probably will take office in less than two months' time, to commit additional resources to tackling organised crime in all its guises and to place particular emphasis on the drugs trade that is destroying the lives of so many young people nationwide.  That is my message and appeal to whosoever forms the next Government.</p></speech>

While I had hoped to make presumed consent part of organ donation, the Bill was not accepted by the Minister although a lot of attention was given to it.  The reason I mention the Bill is because of a lovely story that emerged yesterday of a young man who had just arrived back into Dublin Airport, having had a double lung transplant in England on Christmas Eve.  Looking at him, I would say he is not ten years of age, but it was a wonderful achievement.  However, the fact he was obliged to travel to England to get such a transplant is a reflection on Members themselves, who should be able to do something more than is being done.  His mother has urged people to take out a donor card, which is something all Members would encourage.  In the meantime, however, I hope Members' voices will be heard on presumed consent, which is that one assumes that unless a person has opted out, in the case of his or her death, a person is willing to have his or her organs transplanted to save the life of someone else.  The life of the young man in question was saved and he is back on its feet.  On meeting him yesterday at Dublin Airport, his mother could not get over the fact that he was smiling, was delighted with himself and was able to walk again.  Members should be able to do this; it is in their hands and they should make sure they do it.</p></speech>

Over 200 workers were working on the site.  The issues that led to the strike will not go away.  There is widespread anger in the construction sector that a lot of subcontractors are employing people but paying well below the construction rates.  This is particularly that case with people from outside the country.  This exploits workers from outside Ireland and should not happen.</p> <p>All workers, regardless of whether they are from Poland, eastern Europe or anywhere else, should be paid the same rates as Irish workers and there should be no exploitation of workers in these areas.  There is no doubt that it does exist.  Since the employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements were dismantled, there has been no registered agreement in the construction sector.  A sectoral agreement needs to be put in place.  The problem is that the contractors and developers do not want to sign an agreement.  They want to continue the lower rates of pay and do not want agreed rates.  If that is not put in place, I fear we could have more industrial action as we progress.  As there is some sign of a recovery and there are more promises in terms of capital investment, we must make sure we can ensure that all these developments can go ahead and that workers are treated and paid fairly.</p> <p>I ask the Leader to raise with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation the issues that led to this industrial action and the need for a sectoral agreement to be put in place to protect construction workers and to ensure that we have decent rates of pay and that no construction companies can exploit foreign or domestic workers.  I am sure Senators from across the House would agree with that.  I would appreciate it if the Leader could communicate that directly to the Minister.</p></speech>

Perhaps we will have time.  I want to raise one important issue, namely, recycling.  The city of San Francisco banned the 18-ounce plastic bottle last week.  Hopefully, we will all be back here speaking in the House and putting the most important issue first, namely, our environment.</p> <p>I am from the west of Ireland and am very familiar with the ocean.  If we continue the way we are going, there will be more plastic rubbish than fish in the ocean by 2050.  That is a very serious proposition.  We are bound to look at what we are doing with plastic.  This country led the way with the plastic bag initiative and it could lead the way as well on the smaller plastic drinking bottle following San Francisco.  We could look at that issue.  Some 95% of plastic packaging worth &euro;73 billion per year is lost to the economy because it is not recycled.  When, hopefully, we are all back here again, our environment should be one of the first issues we deal with.  We introduced the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act, which is very welcome, but we should also look at further recycling, particularly the glass initiative, and curb plastic pollution.  San Francisco has done it.  It is estimated that 50% of the plastic on the planet is only used once.  We must think outside the box.  The Think Outside The Bottle campaign is one of the initiatives used in San Francisco.  Will the Leader put this on the agenda for our environment?</p></speech>

Last Thursday, with the permission of the Cathaoirleach, I had the opportunity to discuss, by way of a Commencement matter, the issue of local government reform and, in particular, municipal districts and town councils with the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Ann Phelan, who, on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Kelly, stated that unfortunately as far as he is concerned the current debate on the future of local government is off the table.  I was, therefore, surprised but pleased to hear the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, concede once again that as far as he is concerned the abolition of town councils was a grave mistake and one that should be rectified.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, has indicated that he wants this issue to form part of the Labour Party manifesto.  However, that is the business of the Labour Party.  It is an issue that forms part of the manifesto of my party, Renua.</p> <p>Every political party should reflect on the fact that this country and its citizens have been well served down the years by the women and men who served in an almost voluntary capacity on town councils.  It is more rather than less democracy that we need.  I am glad that the Minister, Deputy Howlin, is brave enough to admit that the Government made a grave mistake in this area.  We should legislate well in advance of the local government elections in 2019 for the repeal of the current local government Act and put in place proper local government structures such that local means local and all citizens have a say in electing their council.  This would include former town councils and, hopefully, many more units of local government through which the people of a particular community want to be represented at local level.  This is the norm across Europe.  We moved in reverse and in a negative fashion by abolishing the town councils in 2013.</p></speech>

It was but a tinkering around the edges in terms of the weak local government structure we have in Ireland.  According to the European Commission, Ireland has one of the weakest forms of local government anywhere in the European Union.  There are many shortcomings in our local government system in terms of the lack of fiscal and oversight powers of our local authorities versus the Executive.  I commend the Leader for facilitating debate this evening of the all-party motion on the local government sector.  While I welcome that debate I agree with Senator Bradford that there is a need for the political system to re-evaluate the decision in regard to the abolition of town councils.  Many Governments, irrespective of political colour, come to office with many grand ideas in relation to reform but very often they do not materialise.  There was a golden opportunity on this occasion to bring about many reforms, given the straitjacket of the troika.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2261"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2261&amp;amp;pid=BrianODomhnaill&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->While some of those reforms have been introduced and some good work has been done, unfortunately other reforms, such as public sector reform, political reform within the Houses of the Oireachtas and budgetary oversight, were not touched.

It would have huge consequences for the economic opportunities of these islands and in particular for those in the business community who depend on Britain for exporting their goods and services, and for the many people from the State who work across the water.

He raised this matter last week and I think I gave a very comprehensive reply to the points raised last week.  I do not wish to expand on the points he made.  I read about the priest in Florida who was a whistleblower.  He suffered as a result of it through actions by his church, which was absolutely crazy.  An elderly nun who assisted him in reporting the allegations of child abuse was also ostracised.  That is a matter for another jurisdiction, but I think I dealt comprehensively with the Senator's comments last week on the matter.</p> <p>Senator Bacik welcomed the green light for two weeks' paternity leave and called for a debate on it and the cost of child care.  I doubt if we will get around to it in this term.  I am sure whoever will be in this place afterwards will arrange such a debate.

It is regrettable that there would be no representation from Ireland on this body when dealing with the issue referred to.  The Senator also expressed his views strongly against the new regulations on the size of one-bedroom apartments.  That has been debated at length and I am sure will continue to be so debated in the coming months.</p><p>Senator Cahill raised a very important matter in regard to the IRA, informers and all that went on and the fact that Sinn F&eacute;in should clarify its position on this matter.  She rightly pointed out that victims are always at the bottom of the pile, which is most regrettable.  I will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p><p>Senator Mooney raised spam and e-mails regarding Irish Water.  I got one myself.  I agree with him that this is a despicable practice.  He said that banks - Senator Mullins mentioned Revenue - do not contact their customers in that way.  Customers should be aware of that and not be conned.  People must be very wary about what they receive in their e-mails.</p><p>Senator Mullins also referred to a recent horrific murder and called on the public to co-operate fully with the Garda.  That is something we would all endorse.  Senator Quinn raised the issue of organ donations and presumed consent, which we debated in this House.  I note his point in regard to a young boy who received his transplant.  It was wonderful to see how well he looked and how young and vibrant he was after the treatment.  I am sure we all wish him well.  It is a matter that will not go away.  Differences were expressed in this House from some sides on whether presumed consent was the right approach to take.  Personally, I think it is, but there is a difference of opinion.  Some action should be taken by the Government one way or the other on the matter.</p><p>Senator Cullinane raised the issue of difficulties in the construction sector and the fact that some subcontractors are not paying proper rates.  Workers must get a fair rate of pay.  Any exploitation of workers should be condemned.</p><p>Senator Keane spoke about the ban on small plastic bottles in San Francisco.  She suggested we should adopt a similar approach to curb plastic pollution and to protect the environment.  She called for a debate in this House.  I doubt if we will have time to debate the matter in this Seanad, but I am sure it is a matter that will be raised and debated in the new Seanad.</p><p>In response to Senator Craughwell's inquiry, I mentioned the time available for the debate.  Provision has been made for 25 speakers to contribute and that will probably be the maximum offering to speak on the matter.</p><p>Senator Bradford raised the issue of town councils and recent comments by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on the matter.  The issue was also raised by Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill.  To go back on the decisions that have been made would take much debate in terms of which councils should come back and which should not if the decisions were to be reversed.  I am sure it is a matter that will be discussed by the new Members of the Oireachtas, whoever they may be.</p><p>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill also called for a debate on Brexit and the economic implications of same.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maurice Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2003"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2003&amp;amp;pid=MauriceCummins&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This has been debated at the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly and several other fora.
