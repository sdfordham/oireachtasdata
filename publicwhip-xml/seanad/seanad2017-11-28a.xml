There were three health issues raised.  As the Minister of State was coming to the House I decided we would deal with the health issues.  I have been considering that if there are a number of health issues or education issues and there is a Minister coming to the House we might as well deal with two or three of the topics.  Senator Murnane O'Connor has four minutes and if she can do it in less I would appreciate it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-11-28a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1395" speakername="Jennifer Murnane O'Connor" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017112800002#B00500"><p>I welcome the Minister of State.  The Holy Angels Day Care Centre was opened in Carlow in 1978 in the basement of Carlow's old district hospital by a Presentation nun, Sister Columba.  She was given a cheque then for &pound;100 by the South Eastern Health Board and, with the names of five children with special needs from the local area, Holy Angels was set up to provide a day care service for children with special needs of preschool age.</p> <p>In 1983, the present centre at Strawhall was purchased at a price of &pound;52,000 and prefabs were put on the site to accommodate the children.  In 2005, a needs assessment was carried out and the school was told that the current site would not allow for expansion due to the amount of children it looked after.  In 2007, Holy Angels received a donation of a site from a private individual.  Following that, the HSE assigned a design team to draw up plans.</p> <p>In 2011, the HSE told Holy Angels the project would go to tender.  In 2012, the HSE advised Holy Angels that in order for the work to commence, the HSE had to own the site.  In February 2015, a delegation from Holy Angels met with the then Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, in Carlow.  The Minister said that he could not believe that the HSE needed to own the site.</p> <p>There are currently 35 children in Holy Angels ranging in age from 18 months up to six years with a waiting list of over 20.  Holy Angels is waiting 11 years for the capital funding for its new school.  It has been overlooked for years and is at a stage where it cannot expand or take in children who need to attend the school.  It has gone from the basement of an old hospital to prefabs and is still in prefabs 39 years on.  This is 2017 and we have children with special needs in prefabs.  These are the most vulnerable children in our society who have been forgotten.  This is unacceptable.  Holy Angels has a great manager and staff with a great fundraising committee who have been fundraising in order to help with the building of the new school which will cost approximately &euro;400,000.</p> <p>I joined the board last year and I see the great work that is being done on the board and the great work that the school does.  The current situation is unacceptable.  After 11 years there is need for the capital funding that was already committed as the prefabs are no longer suitable.  I appeal to the Minister to give us the funding after 39 years.  Last year I tabled a Commencement matter for the Minister, Deputy Harris, and he came to Carlow.  Urgent work needed to be done.  The roof was leaking, the doors needed to be repaired and the floorboards needed to be replaced.  He gave us &euro;150,000 about eight months ago.  However, that was short term.  It is not acceptable now and it is not going to last.  The prefabs are not going to hold for much longer.  We have a massive waiting list in Holy Angels.  We need the capital funding and we need to provide the preschool for these special needs children that are 39 years waiting for their school.  I thank the Minister of State.</p></speech>

I also want to welcome the fact that she has raised the issue of funding for Holy Angels Day Care Centre.  I would like to outline the current position on this important matter.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Finian McGrath:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1822"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1822&amp;amp;pid=FinianMcGrath&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Health capital funding was outlined in the recently published, public Estimates for 2018, and the HSE is currently developing its capital plan for 2018 to 2021.  A project brief for the replacement children's disability services, to include the Holy Angels preschool element, was submitted to the national HSE capital steering group which agreed to recommend the project, in principle, subject to amendments to the brief and the preschool element.  The revised brief and schedule of accommodation was subsequently submitted to the national capital steering group in September 2017 for noting at the next capital steering group meeting.  I understand that the October 2017 meeting has been rescheduled to the first quarter of 2018 and the date remains to be confirmed.  Following the meeting in early 2018 the prioritisation and funding allocation of this project will be considered in relation to other service priorities and projects already approved.  Minor capital funding has been made available to undertake the essential maintenance on the existing premises and those minor capital works were completed.</p><p>The HSE has recognised that the first class early intervention services and service for school age children with disabilities are paramount.  We accept that argument.  The HSE is currently engaged in the reconfiguration of the existing therapy resources under the national programme on progressing disability services for children and young people up to 18 years.  The aims of the programme are to bring about equity of access to disability services and consistency of service delivery with the clear pathway for children and their families to disability services regardless of where they live, what school the child attends and the nature of the individual child's difficulties.  Significant resources have been invested by the health sector in disability services in recent years, including the additional &euro;31 million secured last year.  I will bring back Senator Murnane O'Connor's concerns to the Department, the HSE and the Minister.  As she said, &euro;150,000 was provided as an interim measure and we do need to act on this matter.</p></speech>

The school was originally founded in a hospital basement 39 years ago and it progressed to prefabs.  It is unacceptable to have babies and young children in prefabs.  Those children are the most vulnerable in the community.  The Holy Angels centre does a marvellous job.  The staff are excellent and the children are getting the best care they can in the circumstances.  I urge the Minister of State to provide a commitment on the issue.  I am disappointed but I will pursue the issue until we get the funding.  A new school is needed for the Holy Angels centre.</p></speech>

I know she has been pursuing this issue for a long time.  I commend the staff at the Holy Angels centre who are doing an excellent job.  I give Senator Murnane O'Connor a commitment that I will go back to the senior Minister in the Department of Health and try to make this a priority issue.</p></speech>

Huge difficulties are encountered by people in need of such treatment in Limerick and the mid-west.  As we speak, 783 people in the mid-west are waiting approximately 15 months for cataract surgery from the time they had their assessment.  That is not acceptable.  Many elderly people have come to me to raise the issue.  Following surgery people go overnight from a situation of being almost blind to being able to see.  One elderly gentleman who came to see me recently told me he was on the waiting list to have surgery on both eyes.  He was so distraught that his family came together to ensure he could have an operation on one eye at a cost of &euro;2,000.  The operation was carried out in Ireland which meant it did not qualify for the treatment abroad scheme and he was not on the waiting list for sufficiently long to qualify for the National Treatment Purchase Fund.</p> <p>We must find ways to allow such people to have the operations they need.  A proposal is before the HSE at the moment from the University of Limerick hospital group to develop a cataract surgery hub at Nenagh General Hospital.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Kieran O'Donnell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2207"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2207&amp;amp;pid=KieranODonnell&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It would seek to operate five days per week.  A full complement of staff would be in the order of 16, including two ophthalmologist consultants, two registrars, two clinical nurses, two general nurses, one advanced nurse, two ophthalmologists and clerical staff.  The revenue budget would be approximately &euro;1.75 million per annum in order to have the facility fully up and running.  There is a capital cost of &euro;500,000 to buy equipment.  If the facility is fully up and running, is will deal with approximately 45 cases per week.  The waiting list would be gone in nearly a year.</p><p>I am asking that the Department and HSE would give the go-ahead for &euro;500,000 to meet the capital cost.  It would take three or four months to commission the equipment.  The start date would be in quarter 2 of 2018.  It would be possible to get the equipment under existing tender frameworks.  The minimum complement of staff required to get the facility up and running is approximately six, involving one consultant ophthalmologist, one registrar, three nurses, and one member of ancillary staff.  Approximately &euro;500,000 per year would be required.  The Minister could allocate &euro;375,000 for revenue for 2018 and &euro;500,000 up-front to meet the capital cost.  This amounts to &euro;875,000.  What I propose has to be done.</p><p>The reason I refer to Nenagh General Hospital is because it has a state-of-the-art theatre, two brand-new theatres, a day ward and a procedure room in place.  It is a model 2 hospital.  It is very much in keeping with the thinking on elective care.  As matters stand, cataract surgery is being done at the university hospital on the regional site.  The number of procedures is in the order of 30 to 35 per week.  At times, however, the theatre must be reserved for acute emergency procedures.  That work will continue.  In addition to the 30 or 35 procedures per week at the regional site, we want an additional ten to 15 procedures to be carried out per week, resulting in up to 45 per week.  This would require an allocation &euro;875,000, including &euro;500,000 to meet capital expenses and &euro;375,000 for revenue.  Over time, the figure should be increased to &euro;1.75 million in order to carry out 45 procedures per week.  This is an urgent matter for Limerick and the mid-west.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-11-28a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1359" speakername="Finian McGrath" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017112800002#D00200"><p>I thank the Senator for raising these important issues.  He is a strong advocate for disability and health services in the Limerick and mid-west areas.  I was in Limerick recently at an awards ceremony dealing with young people with disabilities and addressing the matter of training people to work at preschool level.  I thank the Senator for his work in this regard.  I intend to return to Limerick to visit the services properly as soon as possible.</p> <p>I welcome the opportunity to address the House on this matter and outline the measures that have been taken to reduce waiting lists for cataract surgical procedures.  The position is that, given the long wait for outpatient, inpatient and day-case ophthalmology procedures, the HSE is currently undertaking a demand capacity analysis for this speciality.  The HSE has established a steering group and, to date, work has been undertaken on identifying current capacity, projecting future demand for cataract procedures, and how to enhance public hospitals' capacity to meet patient demand.</p> <p>As part of this demand capacity analysis, work is ongoing to identify possible capacity measures to address cataract waiting lists.  Possible future measures include the development of new units and maximising the use of theatre sessions that are currently unused.  There is potential to provide more eye care services within primary care, which would help to divert patients from acute hospital services.  Expansion of services at hospitals is, of course, another option.  In that context, the hospital at Nenagh has been identified as a possible location where ophthalmology services could be developed.  Such a service has the potential to help reduce the waiting time for patients in the mid-west and also to provide services for some patients from outside the University of Limerick hospitals group.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Finian McGrath:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1822"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1822&amp;amp;pid=FinianMcGrath&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I understand that the cost of service development, both capital and revenue, has been scoped out by the University of Limerick Hospitals group and has been submitted to the HSE acute hospital division to help inform the demand-capacity analysis.  I understand that work on the demand-capacity analysis is not yet complete.  I look forward to receiving a report from the HSE in due course.</p><p>The House will be aware there has been significant progress throughout 2017 to reduce waiting lists, including for cataract procedures.  The HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, have worked together to continue to drive down long wait times for inpatient and day case procedures.  Waiting list numbers published by the NTPF at the end of October show that the number of public patients on the active waiting list for cataract surgery has been reduced by over 16% over the past six months.  Between April and the latest available figures, the number on the overall list fell from 13,552 to 11,863.  The cataract waiting list fell from 10,304 to 8,667.  The waiting list of patients waiting more than 15 months for cataract procedures was reduced from 1,694 to 421.  This reduction shows the combined Impact of both the HSE's waiting list action plan and the NTPF&rsquo;s waiting list initiatives to reduce waiting list numbers.</p><p>The NTPF continues to authorise treatment for cataract surgery and to work with both public and private hospitals to access treatment for patients.  These reductions in waiting lists are promising.  I am aware and accept the Senator's point that more needs to be done to tackle waiting lists in the future.  To that end, budget 2018 provided an additional &euro;10 million in 2017 for further waiting list initiatives including cataract procedures for the remainder of 2017.  Next year, &euro;55 million is being allocated to the NTPF, which more than doubles the 2017 allocation of &euro;20 million.  This significant increase in funding reflects the fact that reducing waiting times for patients is one of the Government's key priorities.  This funding will enable the provision of treatment for patients across a range of procedures, including cataract procedures.</p></speech>

In the mid-west, 500 cataracts operations took place, covered by the National Treatment Purchase Fund at a cost of &euro;2,000 per operation, which amounts to &euro;1 million.  The aforementioned hub for cataract operations in Nenagh would provide value and enable people to have cataracts treated in their home area.  I ask the Minister of State to follow up with the HSE acute hospitals division to get a sign-off on the &euro;500,000 to enable the capital procurement to start to take place.  We are looking for &euro;375,000 for 2018 to enable the procedure and to get this measure off the ground.  I feel passionately about this.  It has to happen.  We have 783 people, mostly elderly, waiting for cataracts operations in the mid-west for up to 15 months.  That is inhuman and cannot be allowed to happen.  I ask that the sign-off now take place for the capital to enable equipment to be purchased to enable operating to begin from the second quarter of 2018 and to ensure we can reduce the waiting list over time in order that instead of people with cataracts being obliged to operate in darkness for 15 months or more, they can at least enjoy their existence and be able to see things.</p></speech>

I agree that the figure of 783 people waiting in the mid-west is not acceptable and that we have to act promptly.  If an extra &euro;55 million is spent next year to deal with waiting lists-----</p></speech>

My question relates to patient safety, clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness and the evaluation of telecommunications, in other words, GPs using telecommunications for giving one-to-one advice over the Internet.  What regulation exists on this and how are we going to develop this area, which would be of benefit to GPs, especially in rural areas where patients would be able to access doctors without having to travel long distances to meet them?  We talk about developing primary care centres where there would be a far bigger number of GPs working, but they would be a greater distance from many people in rural areas.  It is in that context that I raise this matter.  It is important that we roll this out and regulate it properly to ensure that it works and patients are safe.  As I understand it, there is nothing to prevent someone from starting such a service under the current legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-11-28a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1359" speakername="Finian McGrath" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017112800002#F00200"><p>I thank Senator Burke for raising this important matter.  I welcome the opportunity to outline the current position.  I assume the Senator is referring to the clinical and cost effectiveness and patient safety aspects of the teleconsultation services which are remotely delivered online rather than traditional face-to-face consultation.  It is important that the value of these services is given the full consideration in view of the increasing availability and also demand for such services.  The importance of ehealth or digital health to support health care reform and its role in the delivery of a modern healthcare system has been recognised for some time.  My Department published an ehealth strategy in 2013, which outlined a roadmap to improve the deployment of information technology in the health service to support health care efficiency, patient safety and care.  Delivering ehealth in Ireland means the digital transformation of a health care model that exploits the digital infrastructure to enable commonly shared capabilities and access to services and information throughout the health system.</p> <p>Ehealth has the capacity to provide the building infrastructure and the technology needed to facilitate the wider use of technology to enhance patient safety and patient care in any health care setting.  As new technologies emerge, they provide opportunity for different approaches to the treatment of patients, offering alternative health care models of integrated  care that can contribute to better outcomes, patient safety and achieve coat efficiencies in the delivery of health services.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report, published in 2017, also emphasised the importance of health information and ehealth as critical enablers to implement the change required to deliver an integrated, high quality health system.  The report advocates continued strong support of the ehealth strategy and in particular ensuring the necessary funding for the timely roll-out of an electronic health record, EHR, system. </p> <p>On the use of teleconsultations in healthcare delivery, there is emerging evidence that telemedicine teleconsultations can be implemented to support an integrated healthcare approach.  TeIeconsultations between GPs and patients can provide benefits in certain circumstances, such as the provision of care in remote locations or for chronically ill patients, providing a service in  alternative settings that are more convenient for the patient.  Such consultations offer alternative channels of service and enhance patient choice.</p> <p>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue and assure him and the House that as this is an emerging area of service provision, it will be closely monitored by my Department.</p></speech>

Especially in rural areas where we are talking about primary care centres which would lead to the centralisation of GPs creating longer distances for people to travel, is there an overall plan to deal with this issue?</p></speech>

Last week, Assistant Garda Commissioner Pat Leahy confirmed at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts that Rush Garda station was on the list of six stations that were to be recommended to the Government for reopening.  I welcome this decision.  Rush Garda station's closure in 2012 has had an adverse impact on the local community.  Rush is a town with a population of 10,000 people and is growing rapidly.</p> <p>The Government announced a re-examination of closed Garda stations.  When I tabled a Commencement matter in March regarding the need to reopen Rush station, I was told that a report would go to the Minister at the end of May.  In July, it was announced to much fanfare that Stepaside Garda station would reopen and that five other stations were listed in an interim report.  Various unconfirmed reports at the time placed Rush as one of the five.  We in north County Dublin were happy with that, but it has taken until November for the final report to be sent to the Government.</p> <p>While the reopening is welcome, there is a fear across north County Dublin that this is a false dawn.  That is why I am calling on the Minister of State to give a clear timeframe for the station's reopening.  Remedial works will have to be completed.  Vehicles and ICT equipment must be provided.  Most importantly, extra garda&iacute; will have to be allocated to the station.  There is a severe shortage of garda&iacute; in Fingal, the fastest growing county council area in Ireland.  There are 177 garda&iacute; in its division at any one time, taking into consideration sick leave, maternity leave, UN duty and so on.  That is not enough.  We must ensure that, instead of these garda&iacute; being reassigned to Rush, more garda&iacute; must be put in place so that Rush Garda station can be reopened without a decrease of service across the division.</p> <p>Assistant Commissioner Leahy stated last week that he would have preferred to allocate extra garda&iacute; to stations other than Stepaside.  Will that be the case with Rush?  Will the Minister of State give the people of Rush guarantees regarding the timeframe, whether the reopening will be fast-tracked and prioritised and whether Rush will receive the necessary resources, thereby ensuring that the station will reopen without further delay?  When will this station have its doors open and when will it serve the people of Rush again?  When will the extra garda&iacute; be assigned as opposed to merely being redistributed from within the division?</p></speech>

Unfortunately, he cannot attend because he is taking business in the D&aacute;il.  On his behalf, I thank the Senator for raising this important matter.</p> <p>The Senator will appreciate that the Garda Commissioner is primarily responsible for the effective and efficient use of the resources available to him, including in respect of the opening and closing of Garda stations.  The programme for Government commits the Government to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  A cornerstone of this commitment is the Government's plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.</p> <p>Revisiting the decision that was taken to close Garda stations at the depths of the recession is also a part of that commitment.  In this context, the former T&aacute;naiste, following the approval of the Government in June 2016, requested the then Garda Commissioner, while fully cognisant of the Commissioner's statutory functions, to identify six stations for reopening on a pilot basis to determine the possible positive impacts that such openings would have on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order.</p> <p>The current Garda Commissioner recently submitted his final report on the pilot.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy David Stanton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1053"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1053&amp;amp;pid=DavidStanton&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The report contains a recommendation that Rush Garda station be one of the six Garda stations to be included in the pilot scheme, along with the Garda stations at Ballinspittle, County Cork, Bawnboy, County Cavan, Leighlinbridge, County Wicklow, and Stepaside, County Dublin.  The Minister intends to bring the final report to Government shortly.  In the meantime, the Commissioner has written to the Office of Public Works and instructed it to progress the matter.</p><p>The Minister understands that a timetable for the re-opening of the stations concerned is dependent on a number of factors, including the brief of requirements from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the extent of the required refurbishment based on current building regulations, the need to comply with fire regulations and to provide disability access.  There are also agreed standards and specifications for Garda cell areas and custody suites which would have to be incorporated into the refurbishment.  Once the specifications have been agreed, the works will go to tender and will commence when the contract has been placed.</p></speech>

These are the specific questions to which the people of Rush would like an answer.</p></speech>

As I said, the Government is committed to a strong, visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, to provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  In addition to its commitment to achieving an overall Garda workforce of 21,000, the Government initiated a process to re-open, on a pilot basis, six of the Garda stations closed under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na district and station rationalisation programme.  As I said, the Commissioner recently submitted his final report on the pilot and the report contains the recommendation that Rush Garda station be one of the six stations to be included in the pilot.  The timeframe for the re-opening of Rush Garda station, as in the case of the other stations to be re-opened, is dependent on a number of factors, including the brief of requirements from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the extent of required refurbishment based on current building regulations, the need to comply with fire regulations and to provide disability access, in addition to standards and specifications regarding cell liaison and custody suites.  Once the specifications have been agreed the works will go to tender and will commence when the contract has been placed.</p> <p>The Senator has asked a number of questions to which I do not have answers today because the initial question asked for a timeframe for the re-opening of Rush Garda station, which as I outlined is dependent on agreement on specifications and other issues.  I will ask that the information requested by the Senator be sent to her as soon as it is available.</p></speech>

He served as a public representative since 1988 and served as a Mayor of Carrick-on-Suir Town Council on two occasions.  He was elected to Seanad &Eacute;ireann in 2011.  I would like to thank him, on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il group, for his many years of public service and wish him all the best for the future.</p><p>What we have seen in the past few hours was an element of accountability which was very much lacking in the past few weeks.  I do not intend to rehash events, but we saw parliamentary questions go unanswered, selective amnesia and a failure to comply with discovery requests by a dysfunctional Department of Justice and Equality.  The fact that further documents were uncovered by the Taoiseach at the weekend demonstrates further the inadequacies in the Department of Justice and Equality.  I was glad to hear that the Taoiseach has directed that an external inquiry into the failure to discover adequately to the Charleton tribunal those emails he found over the weekend be established.  I ask the Leader to ask the Taoiseach when this will be set up and who he intends to appoint as an independent external investigator.  </p><p>It all begs the question of what other documents, memos, letters, etc., have not been handed over to the tribunal.  Have any of these documents been destroyed?  The Taoiseach also recommended the full implementation of the Toland report.  I ask the Leader to ask the Taoiseach for more detail on when this will commence.  Time is of the essence, as the Department of Justice and Equality is one of the central pillars of our justice system and democracy.  The Taoiseach also indicated that he will examine the relationship between the Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p><p>He also outlined that replies to parliamentary questions in respect of this matter will be reviewed to ensure that answers are complete.  Ultimately, it is important that there are no more secrets in the Department of Justice and Equality or any other Department.  The concept of parliamentary accountability needs to be upheld, something the events of the past few weeks have demonstrated.  </p><p>The upside to having avoided an election is that our negotiating team at the European Council summit will have ample time to put into its preparation strategy.  The Government and Fianna F&aacute;il are <i>ad idem</i>in regard to the strategy for Ireland which is, ultimately, that we should not have a hard border.  We know a disorderly hard border will be disastrous for Ireland.  In a recent survey, the British Irish Chamber of Commerce reported that 53% of Irish firms believe Brexit presents a greater threat than opportunity to their firm.  In comparison, 28% of respondents believed Brexit presents a greater opportunity.  Our small businesses are the cornerstone of our economy.  They must be listened to and their concerns taken into account during the summit.  </p><p>We must take the time to prepare properly for these important discussions.  I call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney, to address the House on the preparations he has made to date in respect of all eventualities.  To quote his fellow Cork man - not Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin - &quot;Fail to prepare, prepare to fail.&quot;</p></speech>

I am sorry to hear he has resigned.  He was an exceptionally hardworking Senator, and a good county councillor and representative of the Local Authorities Members Association, LAMA, for many years.  He advocated strongly for city, county and local councillors in terms of their remuneration, conditions of employment and developing policy, education and training on an ongoing basis.  He will be greatly missed by his colleagues in Tipperary, the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, and LAMA, with which he worked very hard.</p> <p>He was an exceptionally hard worker and will be missed.  He was tremendously proud on his first day.  I met him the day he was first elected to Seanad &Eacute;ireann and he was particularly pleased.  We had a healthy rivalry in the last election because I was also on the agricultural panel.  He will be missed on a number of fronts and I want to wish him well in whatever he decides to do in the future.</p> <p>I renew my request that the Taoiseach be invited to come to Seanad &Eacute;ireann at some point, this side of Christmas if possible or in the new year.  It would be an important step for the House and the Taoiseach to have some sort of engagement.  It is to be hoped the Leader will take that up.</p> <p>I again ask for the Minister responsible for the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to come before the House at some stage.  There seems to be some conflict between who will ultimately fund the commitments following from the convention, in terms of the Departments of Finance or Health.  This seems to be a stumbling block.

Apart from anything else, he was an absolute gentleman any time he worked with any of us in here.  He is a great trade unionist and a great socialist.  He represents the very best values of people on the left and I wish him and his family well for the future, while acknowledging that he will be a huge loss to this Chamber.</p> <p>I request that an amendment be made to the Order of Business and ask that the Taoiseach come in to the House today to make a statement about the resignation of the T&aacute;naiste and other related matters.  It has been a fairly momentous week.  I must declare a personal interest.  I went to school with Maurice McCabe.  I was very good friends with his younger brother.  I know what a fine, upstanding family they have always been.  There was a horrendous conspiracy against Sergeant McCabe on behalf of the State, and unfortunately we now know, because of the information that has been released over the last number of days, that when the T&aacute;naiste found out about the attempt to blacken and smear his good name, she chose to turn a blind eye to that.  It is unforgivable.  This is not about anything in a personal sense; it simply is about political accountability.  That is why Sinn F&eacute;in put down the motion of no confidence in the T&aacute;naiste.  We have no doubt but that had that motion not been put down, she would still be in place today.  We did the right thing and we will always do the right thing.  Our job is to challenge the Government when we see wrongdoing and the decision by the T&aacute;naiste to basically turn a blind eye to what was happening to Sergeant McCabe and the horrendous attempt to smear his good name is simply unforgivable.  </p> <p>The Leader had to take one for the team this morning.  He appeared on "Morning Ireland" to defend the indefensible.  I almost felt sorry for him, to be frank.  </p></speech>

Not one of them stood up to say what everyone else knew, which was that the T&aacute;naiste had to go.  Instead the Leader, as recently as this morning, was defending the indefensible.  There are further questions to be answered, and that is why I want the Taoiseach to come in here.  I cannot understand how, when he received that documentation on Friday or Saturday, he waited until Monday evening to act and almost plunged our country into a general election before Christmas.  I cannot understand that.  The Minister for Justice and Equality has important questions to answer.  We know that he sat beside the Taoiseach when the latter was unintentionally misleading the House.  It is not good enough.  The fact of the matter is that unfortunately, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il tried to circle the wagons on this matter for a few days.  I believe that no one in either party has the confidence to deal with the corruption at the heart of the Department of Justice and Equality.  I am asking for the Taoiseach to come in and deal with this matter.</p></speech>

Denis was a great support to me when I became an elected Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</p> <p>I will speak briefly on the resignation of the former T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and the latest political crisis that has threatened the stability of the country at a crucial time as we head into Brexit negotiations and as we work to pass the budget.  There was the threat of an election over a complex issue that few have been able to follow in all its detail.  There were public meetings and canvassing in Waterford this week and last, and the message clearly was that this had to be sorted out and an election avoided.  I am glad to see the threat of an election receding but we need to ensure that this does not end in resignations alone.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Grace O'Sullivan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2467"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2467&amp;amp;pid=GraceOSullivan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Resignations do not resolve issues, rather root-and-branch reform of systems is what is required.  This is why the Green Party tried to amend the terms of reference of the inquiry earlier this year to include the Department of Justice and Equality in the remit.  All sides now need to work together to ensure that the full truth emerges at the inquiry in the new year and that the resolution of these issues will follow from its findings, including real changes to the way the Department handles such cases and information into the future.  </p><p>The reason we need to get back to the work we were elected to do here is that people want action on local and national issues that affect their everyday lives.  In Waterford, there are particular issues that are constraining the immense potential of the city and the metropolitan area.  At recent events in the city highlighting digital creativity, community voluntary activity, regional development and educational opportunities, the intelligence, skills, eagerness and potential energy of the people of Waterford city and county were always evident.  I would like to ask the Leader when the Government will be delivering the funds that are promised to the North Quays Strategic Development Zone in Waterford city.  With the public consultation closing this week, and a city transport development plan  under discussion that will reshape the face of the city, it is crucial that Waterford city's position as the capital of the south east is locked down in the developing national planning framework and the capital investment plan.  Greater certainty around the provision of emergency medical care in the region is crucial for the continued development of the city and county, and this is something I expect the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, will be addressing shortly as part of a national review of services. </p><p>Of particular and immediate concern is the nature of emergency medical transport for the region, as well as the provision of out-of-hours cardiac and mental health care.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation recently met in Waterford city.  The committee heard from experts in the region about these issues and the crucial need for a technological university for the south east region that could go so far to unlock its potential.  I am eager to debate this in more detail, and I hope we have the opportunity to do so in the House soon.</p></speech>

We in the Labour group were all very sorry to hear of this resignation.  I want to pay tribute to him, and to thank you, a Chathaoirligh, and all our colleagues from the other groups, who have spoken so warmly and kindly about Denis's time here, and have paid such nice tributes to him.  Clearly, as someone who served with him in the Seanad since 2011, I am well aware of all of the work he has done, of his long career in local government, the pride he took in local government, the huge amount of energy and effort he put into maintaining close connections with councillors and the huge work he did on their behalf.  Senator Boyhan has spoken very strongly about that.  I pay tribute to his work through the Local Authorities Members Association, LAMA, his work as a trade union representative, which I thank my colleagues for remembering, and the strong advocacy in which he engaged for those involved in local government.  I know that Dennis will continue to remain active in the Labour Party, and I am glad he will.  On behalf of the Labour group, I wish him and his family very well in the future and say again how sorry we are that he has decided to resign.</p> <p>I also pay tribute to the former T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, for her work, in particular the huge amount of work she did on pioneering legislation around sex offences and domestic violence.  Committee Stage of the Domestic Violence Bill 2017 will be taken tonight in the Seanad.  She was a strong champion for equality, for women's rights in particular, and it was good to work with her.  Having said that, her position had become untenable.  As the Labour Party leader Deputy Brendan Howlin said yesterday and again yesterday evening, it became untenable for her to continue, given the revelations that had come out.</p> <p>I also note the role of Deputy Alan Kelly in pursuing the truth through parliamentary questions, getting only obstructionism and a drip-feed of answers from the Department of Justice and Equality.  If the Department had been more open and the answers had been forthcoming, we would never have had the unedifying spectacle we have had in recent days, of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Sinn F&eacute;in seeking truth through other means and raising the spectre of a general election which nobody wanted.  The Labour Party played the role of an honest broker in this.  Deputy Kelly's questions, pursued through the parliamentary procedural route, should have brought forward the answers that we are still only getting now.  As Deputy Kelly has pointed out, there are still questions to be asked, particularly of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charlie Flanagan, and we look forward to getting the answers to those over the coming days.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is vital that we get them expeditiously and see true reform of the Department of Justice and Equality.  Under a previous Labour Party coalition Government, that Department was split into equality and law reform on the one hand and justice on the other.  We should see similar far-reaching reform now on foot of these revelations.  We will support the Sinn F&eacute;in call to invite the Taoiseach in here on that ground.  We will also ask that the Minister for Justice and Equality come here to answer the questions that Deputy Kelly raised in the D&aacute;il over the coming days.  </p></speech>

Denis, who lives quite close to me on the other side of the Tipperary-Waterford border, was a stalwart Labour Party public representative and trade unionist.  I wish him, his family and his Labour Party colleagues the very best because he is a huge loss to national politics.  He was always a champion for local politics at national level through his first role as a leader of the Local Authorities Members Association, LAMA, and since he entered Seanad &Eacute;ireann in 2011.  He always made councillors and local authority policies and issues a very high priority.  I sincerely wish him well.</p> <p>On recent controversies and the resignation of the former T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Fitzgerald, I too acknowledge the Trojan work that Deputy Fitzgerald did when she became Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  She set up many of the institutions of the State that are now responsible for the protection of children.  She introduced legislation that will ensure many generations of children in the future will be protected.  She led the way in much of that groundbreaking legislation.  We now understand that, since the Taoiseach ordered the trawl of documents in the Department of Justice and Equality, further information and documents have been disclosed.  The Charleton tribunal is charged with examining all of this in fine detail.  I believe, however, that the Department of Justice and Equality needs to be turned inside out in respect of the way it conducts its dealings because it is obvious that Sergeant Maurice McCabe has been the victim at many levels, not only within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but also of collusion within the State and the Department of Justice and Equality.  I am annoyed about that, as are colleagues of mine.  I believe fundamentally, however, that the former T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Fitzgerald, will be vindicated when the Charleton tribunal has the opportunity to examine, according to due process and natural justice, the fine detail, the evidence, facts and truth behind much of this.  </p> <p>While I acknowledge the right of any Member of Parliament to raise issues of concern regarding public accountability I will take no lectures from Sinn F&eacute;in and find it ironic for Sinn F&eacute;in to lecture my party and indeed a person of the fine standing of the former T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Fitzgerald, when its party turned a blind eye to sexual abuse, to the families of the disappeared, to bullying within politics and still turns a blind eye to bullying within politics.</p></speech>

He has been involved in Labour Party politics since he was a very young man.  He followed in the footsteps of his uncle Michael Kavanagh, who was a founder member of the Labour Party.  For more than 23 years, he served as a town councillor and a county councillor.  In 2011 he was elected on the Administrative Panel with me to the Seanad and was re-elected in 2016.  I wish him and his family well in his retirement.

The town is twinned with County Cork and there are both political and business links to the region.  Having visited Georgia recently I can attest to what a beautiful country it is and what beautiful people they are.  Georgia is a vibrant democracy.  It is ironic at a time when we are discussing Brexit in this country and our neighbours in the United Kingdom are anxious to get out of Europe that those people see the value of democracy and are trying their very best to join the European Union.  We should give them every support we can in that regard.  I pay tribute to the Georgian Embassy in Dublin which is a very active mission and in particular the ambassador, George Zurabashvili.</p></speech>

As one of the radicals in this House I say there should be more of us.</p> <p>On the way to the House this morning I was listening to my car radio and wondering about current political events when an ad break took place.  I do not know how many other Members heard the particular advertisement but it announced that there was good news for the self employed and that from now on they would be entitled to certain social welfare benefits, to which they were previously not entitled.  I suppose that is good news.  The announcement then said, "This is a Government of Ireland initiative sponsored by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection".   The advertisement finished with the statement that the hope is that the self employed will not have to make use of the measure, which is a fairly obvious thing to say.  I asked myself about this "Government of Ireland imitative" being used as a logo on State announcements.  It immediately became apparent to me that it is the strategic communications unit which is now going to stamp every State advertisement, in particular at politically sensitive times, that the good news is a Government of Ireland initiative.  That is what the &euro;5 million is being spent on.</p></speech>

There has been an increase, not a decrease, of 3.5% according to the Environmental Protection Agency.  This is having a grave effect on public health.  Fifty years of progression in public health and disease elimination is threatened as a result of these emissions and the pollution of our planet.  Seven per cent of expenditure worldwide is on health and this is increasing rapidly because of pollution.  Our future will be worse instead of better.  Not only will we miss the 2020 targets but we are also on the path to miss the targets for 2030 and 2050.

I wish him and his family well in the future.</p> <p>I wish to raise an issue I became aware of last night concerning a women's refuge.  I was going to raise it today when debating the Domestic Violence Bill but I feel this is not appropriate because we will be discussing amendments.  The issue probably does not fit in with that debate.  The matter is related, however.  A women's refuge in Tallaght was approximately seven months into the process of purchasing a house in Rathcoole.  South Dublin County Council had pledged &euro;500,000 for the purchase of the house.  Seven months into the sale process, it withdrew the &euro;500,000 because of some sort of refurbishment fee that would be needed.  The council directed the refuge to the capital assistance scheme.  Perhaps the Leader can advise me what Department this falls under.  It could be the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p> <p>At a time when we are discussing legislation on domestic violence, we now have only ten refuge beds available for women.  The facility in Rathmines has been closed for the past two months.  In the next few weeks, Saoirse refuge will possibly lose the house in question.  It would have afforded 17 women refuge over the coming months.  I would like the Leader to examine whether there is a way of prioritising an application under the capital assistance scheme or of approaching the local authority to ask it why it has withdrawn the &euro;500,000.  This is to ensure the refuge will not lose the important house in Rathcoole.  Having services and resources on the ground is very important if we are to introduce legislation and implement change.</p></speech>

Denis has made a huge contribution to local and national politics and to Labour Party politics in Tipperary, across Munster and across Ireland over almost 30 years in elected office of one description or another.  As Senator Gavan said, Denis was a very proud socialist.  His socialism was of a practical variety.  He did what he said.  He believed in what he was doing and he believed what he was doing was right.  He was and is a solid trade unionist and somebody with an enormous track record of delivery in his community and across the country.  I do not believe there is a former or current county councillor in this country who does not know Denis Landy personally.  Denis has always provided any excellent service to city and county councils across this country.  Indeed, he was a very proud town councillor representing Carrick-on-Suir for many years.  He was a very proud advocate of town councils and what they can achieve.  He would be very amused by the remarks of Senator Michael McDowell.  Senator McDowell referred to himself and to Denis as radicals in the same breath.  It may be fair to say they are on different ends of the political spectrum, but radicals nonetheless.  I do accept that Senator McDowell is, indeed, a radical, but one with whom I may not always agree.</p> <p>I do agree, however, with Senator McDowell's reference to what I would describe as the misuse of State funds to promote political ends.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerald Nash:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2281"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2281&amp;amp;pid=GeraldNash&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I almost crashed my socialist-issue Skoda when I heard those advertisements which give the impression that the State is awarding some kind of gift to the self-employed in the form of the benefits they would receive and to which they are entitled through the payment of a PRSI stamp.  It is not radical for self-employed people to be provided with these benefits.  It is a welcome and necessary step that I welcome.</p><p>It would be remiss of me not to reflect on the resignation of the T&aacute;naiste.  I take no satisfaction whatsoever in the decision the T&aacute;naiste had made and I mean that sincerely.  I served with Deputy Fitzgerald at Cabinet level and we all know that she has many fine qualities.  We and the entire country knew that by 7 p.m. last night, only one option was available to the T&aacute;naiste but unfortunately it took some time for the T&aacute;naiste and Taoiseach to accept the inevitability of what was happening.  My colleague, Senator Bacik, made the point articulately earlier that we need not have been in the middle of a political crisis over the past few days, had the answers to the questions tabled by my colleague, Deputy Kelly, in the normal course of parliamentary accountability, transparency and democracy, been addressed.  Quite the opposite happened.  Those questions were thwarted, he was denied the truth and he continues to be denied the truth.  Answers were delayed and obfuscation was the order of the day.  When the Minister for Justice and Equality addresses the D&aacute;il later, which I am told he intends to do, the first thing he should do is apologise directly to my colleague, Deputy Kelly.</p></speech>

I wish him good health and happiness to himself and his family, whatever he chooses to do from here on.</p> <p>I raise the issue of road safety.  In 2016, 188 people lost their lives on Irish roads.  We can all imagine the pain and suffering those families are going through.  One interesting statistic is that for every road death, eight people are left with serious, life-changing injuries.  Another statistic worth noting is that in 2015, 166 people lost their lives and, of that figure, 45 were between the age of 16 and 25, and 130 were male.  With that in mind, I compliment the garda&iacute; in the Cavan-Monaghan division on an initiative undertaken by Sergeant Tony Campbell who, for the third or fourth year running, has organised an event for all transition year students in County Monaghan.  The same project is also being rolled out in County Cavan.  I attended the event yesterday and more than 400 transition year students were present.  Some had already commenced driving and some were about to start.  It is basically a road safety roadshow and an appeal to young drivers to slow down and be conscious of the rules of the road.  The initiative involved young people being presented with the reality of what happens from the moment a crash occurs until the road is cleared.  It was attended by the local safety officer of Monaghan County Council, local garda&iacute;, a paramedic, a consultant from the emergency department in Cavan General Hospital, an undertaker, a coroner and a mother who lost her child and who gave testimony.  It was a striking presentation and was very worthwhile.  From speaking to some of the students, it left a lasting impression.</p> <p>I bring this up today because I ask the Leader to mention this project to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  It is a template that could be rolled out throughout the country and which would be beneficial to all young people who have just commenced driving or are about to commence driving.</p></speech>

I wish him and his family well.  It was a big decision for him to make and no doubt he will leave, through his contributions, a lasting imprint in the House for years to come.</p><p>My colleague, Senator McDowell, mentioned the Government information unit that is based in the Department of An Taoiseach.  The &euro;5 million spending there is additional to the &euro;170 million already spent by the Government and State agencies in promoting Government services.  That is &euro;175 million being spent this year on the promotion of Government services.  There are serious questions about the public good and where that crosses over into political promotion, and some recent communications have been in the realm of the latter.  That is wrong and something that should be corrected.  This is happening at a time when answers to parliamentary questions in the other House have not been forthcoming and the information that has been sought and which should have been provided has been withheld.  We are spending all this money on promoting information to the public, but a Department at the heart of a scandal has been withholding relevant, factual information from a Member of the other House and his fellow Deputies.  It is scandalous.  We have to get real and I hope that the Government will take this as a rude awakening to get its act in order because what has happened in recent weeks cannot be allowed to happen again.</p></speech>

He represented all the best traditions of the Labour Party.  His priority was always the underdog, the working man.  He was an outstanding public representative at local authority level for many years.  He and I go back a long way.  We were on the executive of the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland together for many years.  He was a great facilitator and a man who knew how to work within the system and get results.  I regard him not only as a colleague but as a personal friend.  He will be missed from this House and I wish him good health in the future.</p> <p>I am also personally saddened on the resignation of the T&aacute;naiste.  It was inevitable as facts unfolded, but it is not a day for triumphalism and it is no joy to anyone in either House that this happened.  I cannot say I am surprised but I am disappointed at Senator Gavan taking the opportunity to have his usual swipe at my party.  I would remind him that it was the stance of my party leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, that brought these emails into the public domain.  I congratulate him and the Taoiseach on their efforts over the past four or five days to reintroduce stability to public affairs.  It is very easy for Sinn F&eacute;in to table motions of no confidence-----</p></speech>

The bid, which is a considerable piece of work with a number of high-level endorsements and a significant budget, was put together by members of both councils.  Unfortunately, it has transpired that the European Commission will not recognise bids from what it deems to be UK cities after 2019 and the fallout of Brexit.</p> <p>Here is another tangible disaster, another negative impact of taking the North out of the EU against its will.  We are all aware of the negatives.  We have rehearsed them in this Chamber and elsewhere for legitimate, genuine and understandable reasons.</p> <p>The Irish Government, which has been playing an important role in Brexit over recent weeks in particular, has a role to play in championing and supporting the bid from Belfast and Derry cities in the same way that it would for Galway, Dublin or Cork.  This is a major opportunity, not least when one considers the cross-Border impact within the context of Derry city and Strabane district.</p> <p>Through the Leader, I call on the Irish Government, in particular the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, to engage with both councils at chief executive and mayoral levels and to become champions and ambassadors at European Council and Commission levels to ensure that this immediate, unwanted and unfortunately tangible impact of Brexit is offset, the bid prevails and B&eacute;al Feirste and Doire are the European cities of culture in 2023.</p></speech>

This was done without consulting practitioners in the sector.  I am told that the announcement came from out of the blue.</p> <p>I call on the Minister, Deputy Zappone, and her Department to explain why this happened.  Why is the age exemption being removed from children in the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme from September 2018 and why was it announced by Pobal to early years providers without any warning on 24 November?  Practitioners and parents are concerned, as am I.  There are many children for whom this is a vital exemption.  Some need an extra year before they start school and can still meet the age criteria, but now they will not be allowed to do that because they will have done their two free years.</p> <p>Why is the Minister telling parents that it is up to them to finance this when many do not send their children every day during the free scheme years and could have built up enough days that the Department should pay for this?  Some parents do not feel that their three year olds are ready for a five-morning week.  Some five year olds still need extra time to avoid having to request staying back later on.  Why can they not be accommodated?</p> <p>Children transitioning to national school need to be independent and confident, have good social and emotional skills and be able to communicate, all of which meet the Department's criteria under the Aistear curriculum framework.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2470"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2470&amp;amp;pid=JenniferMurnaneOConnor&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->With this exemption removed some children will not be able to adhere to those criteria.

This announcement does not contribute to this and it will not serve well the children who require extra supports in early years education.  </p></speech>

I wish to be associated with the comments regarding Senator Landy, with whom I had many a ding-dong across this parliamentary floor.  I always found him a very able combatant in that regard and an absolute gentleman when I met him afterwards.  He is also great craic and great company.  He is a wonderful man and I wish him all the best.</p> <p>I have previously called for the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to come to the House to update Members on the progress of the work of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes.  I am acutely aware that many of the survivors are elderly and have many health issues and other issues they want to have addressed.  Some of them are living in unsuitable conditions and they seek practical supports, which are not being made available to them.  They also are looking for the truth as to what happened to their siblings, mothers and loved ones connected to them.  I hope we can have that debate.</p> <p>I have also raised on a number of occasions the issue of the St. Anne's site, also known as Lenaboy Castle, in Galway city.  It is a former Black and Tans barracks.  We know from historical documents that there are tunnels under this building and some of the land surrounding it.  I understand that heritage and archaeology reports have been done on the site.  We have asked for these to be made available but there appears to be some blockage in that regard.  We want to ascertain whether there are burial grounds on the site.  Is the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government aware of these reports, has he had sight of them and has he been consulted on the transfer of that building and land to Galway City Council, which has also been given &euro;750,000 by the Sisters of Mercy as part of that deal?  If, God forbid, there is need for an archaeological survey at this site, similar to that being carried out in Tuam, will there be an associated cost and if so, will it fall on the State, Galway City Council or some other agency?  I wish to ascertain whether the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government has been made aware of these issues and whether he has received a report in this regard.  If so, will he report to the House on it?</p></speech>

This was yet another year in which the Department for Housing, Planning and Local Government failed to bring this deadline to the attention of young people and other potential voters in this State, leaving much of the responsibility for registration of potential voters to civic society groups.  This deadline for registration was crucial as an election looked imminent and in the context of the upcoming referendum in 2018 on the eighth amendment.</p> <p>A report of the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in 2008 found that the process of voter registration is archaic and outdated.  Since then, there has been no genuine reform.  Any queries or proposals on electoral reform in this House, for example, have been batted away and no real progress has been made.  This year Galway County Council provided a facility which allowed people to input their details on the RFA form online to become a registered voter.  While this was a show of ingenuity, it was in the absence of a centralised system or structure.  I ask that the Leader request the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to come before the House to reaffirm his commitment to establish an electoral commission and to outline the timeline in which this can be achieved.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, the 11 people who died were all young people who had been trapped in a gym by the fire.  I also wish to convey my condolences to the Georgian ambassador who is a great friend of Ireland at a time when his country is endeavouring to gain access to and become a member of the European Union.</p> <p>I call on the Leader to respond.</p></speech>

As Senator Wilson rightly said about the people of Georgia, and I had the opportunity to visit Georgia recently, they cherish democracy and freedom.  It is important, in the context of where we are in society and life today, that we join in expressing our sorrow and sadness to the Georgian people through their ambassador in Ireland.  He is a very amicable and personable man who does a huge amount of work.  On behalf of the Fine Gael group and that of the House, all of us individually and collectively extend our deepest sympathies on the loss of life in the tragic fire.</p> <p>I join with all Members of the House in their expressions of sadness that our colleague and friend, Senator Denis Landy, has decided to retire due to ill health.  All that I wanted to say about him has been said.  As Leader of the House, I got to know him through our work on the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE.  As Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh said, he was a very convivial colleague.  He was a great man to make his point at a meeting.  He was an extraordinarily well read Member.  I had the pleasure of being with him in America as part of an OSCE mission to oversee voting and we had a wonderful trip.  He was a man of huge insight, and still is.  As has been said by many of his colleagues here today, he was a trade unionist in the old style of the movement.  He was a socialist.  He was a very proud member of the Labour Party and is still a member.  I hope he remains committed to working, as he has done, on behalf of the people of Tipperary.  He was a valued local authority member.  As a Member of this House, he played a pivotal role.  Up until recently he issued emails to advocate on behalf of councillors. </p> <p>Denis had the distinction of being elected to two different panels - the administrative and agricultural panels.  He will be remembered for his work as a representative of councillors.  I want to wish him well in his retirement.  He is a sad loss to this House because he brought a different perspective.  As Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh rightly said, one could have many a battle with him on the floor of the House or at a committee but he was always willing to park any difference when one left the debate.  He was a wonderful colleague.  He had a huge depth of knowledge about many different issues.  I really enjoyed his company on the trips with the OSCE.  I thank him for his service to the Labour Party and to the local authority in his native Tipperary.  I also thank him for his work as a Member of the Oireachtas.  I wish him well and hope that he will be able to actively contribute to the House as a non-elected Member.  I thank him and his family for their many years of service as a member of the political class.</p> <p>I thank Members for their contributions on the resignation of the T&aacute;naiste, Frances Fitzgerald.  On a personal level, and on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I want to express my sincere thanks to the T&aacute;naiste for her work as a Minister, as a pioneering Minister for equality throughout her tenure in the Departments in which she served.  As Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, I had the pleasure of working with her as the first member of the Cabinet to be a Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  I had the pleasure of working with her on a number of initiatives in that Department.  She was exemplary as a Minister.  I had the pleasure of working with her on the marriage equality referendum where she launched a Fine Gael LGBT group.  On a personal level, she has been a huge source of support and advice to me along my journey in life.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->She is a friend and a woman whose advice I cherish.

Senator McDowell's memory is either failing him or he is forgetting that he was in the Cabinet which approved many an advertisement on behalf of all Departments.  As he knows well, Departments spend money on public advertising.  Senator Warfield referenced voter registration.  There is a campaign organised every year around the register.  Whether the advertisement is outdated or not is a different matter, and how we can improve the advertisement is an issue which we can discuss.  Certainly the issue of social welfare advertisements is not new.  We had advertisements regarding social welfare fraud, road safety and the Wild Atlantic Way.</p></speech>

At that formative time in young people's lives, they are listening and hearing about road safety and it lands in their mind.  I know from my time as a transition year teacher, it is a very important module in terms of road safety.  I very much encourage the Senator to pursue that, perhaps with the Department.</p> <p>Strangely, I agree with the point made by Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile on B&eacute;al Feirste and Doire mar Phr&iacute;omhchathair Chult&uacute;ir na hEorpa.  I very much agree with Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile that there is a need for us to support Belfast and Derry as European capitals of culture.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I know from Cork, my home city which had the distinction of being the European Capital of Culture, that the title brings significant economic and tourism benefits to a city.  In the case of Belfast and Derry, it would be a fantastic statement.  I will support any initiative which would result in all of our island remaining part of the European Union.  While there are clearly disagreements about what will happen, we should champion this wonderful idea.  I will be pleased to lend my support to it, having seen the benefits that the title of European Capital of Culture delivered for Cork. </p><p>I am at a loss regarding the matter raised by Senator Murnane O'Connor as it is an issue I am not familiar with.

Finality is needed in this case because, as the Senator stated, the women in question are getting older and deserve answers.  While I do not wish to give the Senator a short answer, perhaps, given the busy legislative programme in the weeks before Christmas, he will consider raising the issue as a Commencement matter.  If not, we will try to have the matter discussed after Christmas.  I cannot give a commitment to discuss it before Christmas, however, although I share the Senator's views on its importance.</p> <p>To respond to Senator Warfield, in the previous Oireachtas a joint committee produced important work on the electoral register.  As the Senator is aware, there are many difficulties with the register.  It is important the State continues to invest in encouraging people to vote.  I am aware the deadline for voter registration has passed.  It was ironic that there was a great deal of activity at the weekend arising from the possibility that an election could be held.  In Cork city and county, people go door to door to speak with people about the electoral register.  Perhaps we need to use social media to attract people to vote.  The issue can be debated. </p> <p>On behalf of the Government, I will reluctantly oppose the amendment proposed to the Order of Business.</p></speech>

It was a budget to promote fairness and provide for modest but sustainable improvements in people&rsquo;s lives.  Many of the measures to help us achieve those goals are contained in the Finance Bill 2017 which we will discuss today and I would like to set the scene by looking at some of the Bill's key components.  In order that we can have as much time as possible for our discussion, I will be as brief as I can.  I do not propose to go through the Bill section by section.  Instead, I will focus on particular sections which I think may be of interest to Senators.  I will also describe some of the measures introduced on Committee and Report Stages in the D&aacute;il .</p><p>In budget 2018, the Minister is continuing to fulfil the Government&rsquo;s commitment to make steady and sustainable progress in reducing the income tax burden, with a particular focus on low and middle income earners.  He has been very clear that his intention is to preserve a broad and stable income tax base.  Therefore, in order to ensure that he does not narrow the tax base, the USC measures to be introduced in section 2 of this Finance Bill focus on reductions to USC rates while maintaining the current entry threshold to USC of &euro;13,000.  In section 3 of the Bill, the Minister is increasing the entry point to the higher rate of income tax by &euro;750.</p><p>As part of the reform agenda, the Minister also intends to establish a working group to plan, over the coming year, the process of amalgamating USC and PRSI over the medium term.  Throughout this process, the income threshold of &euro;13,000 will be maintained as the general point of entry to the new amalgamated charge.  A key objective of the group, and of the Minister for Finance, is that this process does not narrow the tax base but ensures that our personal taxation system is both competitive and resilient in the future.  He aims to set up the working group after the passage of the Finance Bill and it will include officials from all relevant Departments and agencies.</p><p><b></b>Section 7 of the Bill provides for the introduction of a 0% rate of benefit-in-kind taxation on electric vehicles.  While this relief is provided for in the Bill for an initial period of one year, the Minister has made it clear that the zero rate will remain in place for a period of time, a minimum of three to five years, sufficient to incentivise the uptake of electric vehicles.  This section also provides for a tax exemption from benefit-in-kind when these vehicles are charged in the workplace.  </p><p>The Minister and I are conscious of the challenges facing small and growing businesses around the country due to the changing international environment.  Research has shown that employee financial participation can be effective in increasing competitiveness and helping companies to attract and retain staff in a competitive labour market.  Therefore, section 10 of the Finance Bill provides the details of the new key employee engagement programme announced in budget 2018, which will support small to medium enterprises in their efforts to attract and retain key employees in a competitive international labour market.  This programme will facilitate small to medium enterprises in providing key employees with a financial incentive in the form of share options linked to the success of the company.</p><p><b></b>Section 12 of the Bill introduces a scheme of accelerated capital allowances for the construction of buildings and structures for use in the provision of child care services or fitness centre facilities by employers to employees.  The scheme also provides relief for expenditure incurred on related equipment.  The rationale for introducing this relief is to help tackle the cost and availability of child care facilities, both of which have been cited as barriers to work.  The measures will also support the Government&rsquo;s vision for a healthy Ireland by supporting the provision of fitness facilities by employers.  The tax relief will not commence immediately, as approval by the European Commission from a state aid perspective is required, on foot of which the scheme will commence by ministerial order.  </p><p><b></b>Section 13 introduces a new, time limited deduction for pre-letting expenses in order to encourage owners of vacant residential property to bring that property into the rental market for a minimum of four years.  Section 16 reflects an amendment which the Minister brought forward on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il in respect of the employment and investment incentive.  This is to ensure that it is consistent with EU general block exemption rules on eligible investors so as to ensure that private investors in the scheme are independent of the management of the company.</p><p><b></b>Sections 23 and 30 together form a package of anti-avoidance measures being introduced in order to deal with a number of specific tax avoidance schemes which have been uncovered by Revenue.  Essentially, the schemes involve converting what should be taxable income payments into capital payments in order to avail of the lower capital gains tax, CGT, rates.  The potential charge to capital gains tax is then often avoided by the use of CGT reliefs such as retirement relief and entrepreneurial relief, resulting in funds being extracted by shareholders entirely tax free or at a significantly reduced tax liability.  It is unfair that some individuals are engaging in these tax avoidance structures solely to take advantage of lower tax rates.  This leads to unfair outcomes and puts other taxpayers who do not engage in such avoidance arrangements at a competitive disadvantage.  The Minister is therefore taking steps to counter these avoidance schemes.</p><p><b></b>Section 25 amends section 291A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to limit the deduction for capital allowances for intangible assets and any related interest expense, to 80% of the relevant income arising from the intangible asset in the accounting period.  This measure was recommended in the Coffey review in order to ensure some smoothing of corporation tax receipts over time.  It applies in respect of capital expenditure incurred on intangible assets after 11 October 2017.</p><p><b></b>Section 33 provides for a change being made to section 604A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  This ensures that CGT relief in respect of chargeable gains made on a disposal of land or buildings which were acquired between 7 December 2011 and 31 December 2014, will now apply where the asset involved has been owned for at least four years, with the full relief applying from the fourth to the seventh anniversary of acquisition and tapering off thereafter.  As things currently stand, that is before this amendment, no relief from CGT on any chargeable gain made on disposal of qualifying land and buildings was available until seven years after acquisition.  A full relief was then available at the seventh anniversary and a taper applied to the relief thereafter.  This measure is being introduced at this time to incentivise the release of additional development land and buildings onto the market so as to help boost the supply of new housing, sooner rather than later.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Michael D'Arcy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2208"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2208&amp;amp;pid=MichaelWDArcy&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A similar measure in section 19 of the Bill removes the five-year exemption which applied to capital gains arising on the disposal of Irish lands that have been held by an Irish real estate fund for more than five years.<br/><br/><b></b>Sections 34 and 71 allow that the leasing of agricultural land for solar panels will be classified as qualifying agricultural activity for the purposes of specific CGT and capital acquisitions tax, CAT, reliefs subject to certain conditions.  CGT retirement relief and CAT agricultural relief will now allow solar panels on agricultural land to be considered qualifying assets.  In order to ensure that genuine agricultural activity will continue to be carried out on the farms concerned, no more than 50% of the total farm holding can be used for solar panels.  This will maintain the overall objective of agricultural relief in particular.  This might also be an appropriate point to mention another agriculture related issue.  Following discussions with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine, the Minister for Finance has committed to undertaking an update of the 2014 review of agricultural tax measures ahead of next year&rsquo;s budget.  This will include a particular focus on the issue of income stabilisation.  The issue of data collection relating to the operation of schemes will also feature and there will be engagement with all relevant stakeholders.<br/><br/>Sections 35 to 47, inclusive, of the Bill relate to the taxation of sugar sweetened drinks.  Senators will be aware that the Minister announced in the budget that he would be introducing such a tax in April of next year, subject to approval from the European Commission, to coincide with the introduction of a similar tax in the UK.  The tax will apply to non-alcoholic, water and juice-based drinks which have an added sugar content of 5 g per 100 ml and above.  Sugar sweetened drinks with less than 5 g of sugar per 100 ml will be outside the scope of the tax.  If the sugar content is 5 g or more but less than 8 g per 100 ml, a tax of 20 cent per litre will apply and for sugar sweetened drinks with a sugar content of 8 g or more, the rate will be 30 cent per litre.  These figures are inclusive of VAT.<br/><br/><b></b>Section 60 gives effect to a number of measures relating to stamp duty.  The rate of stamp duty applicable to conveyances and transfers of non-residential property is increased from 2% to 6% as of 11 October 2017.  Transitional provisions apply for purchasers with binding contracts in place before 11 October and where the instruments for the transfers are executed before 1 January 2018.  The end date for consanguinity relief is extended for another three years to 1 January 2021 while the upper age limit of 67 years for availing of this relief is removed.  The rate of stamp duty where consanguinity relief applies is being fixed at 1%.  The threshold above which residential leases are chargeable to stamp duty is increased from the current &euro;30,000 to &euro;40,000 per annum.  This higher threshold should ensure that the vast majority of renters will not be liable to stamp duty.<br/><br/><b></b>Section 61 of the Bill provides for a stamp duty repayment scheme for land purchased for the development of housing.  This is to ensure that the increased rate of stamp duty does not contribute to house price inflation.  The scheme will also provide a stimulus to the timely delivery of much-needed new residential accommodation.  The scheme has a number of conditions that are designed to ensure that only those builders and developers who provide completed housing units within a reasonable period of time can qualify for a refund of the difference in the amount of stamp duty payable at the rates of 2% and 6%.  <br/><br/><b></b>Section 67 allows a farmer to claim relief from stamp duty where he or she both sells and purchases land for the purpose of consolidating an existing farm holding, subject to a number of qualifying conditions.  Where the qualifying conditions are satisfied, stamp duty will be paid only to the extent that the value of the land that is purchased exceeds the value of the land that is sold.  A reduced rate of 1% will be charged on the excess, if any, of the purchase value.  A number of qualifying conditions must be satisfied before the relief can apply, the most important of which is that Teagasc must issue a certificate stating that a sale and purchase or an exchange of farmland was made for farm consolidation purposes.<br/><br/>I said at the outset that I would be brief so the last item to which I will draw to Senators' attention is section 76.  Over the last year Revenue has committed significant resources to a PAYE modernisation project.  It is the most significant review of the PAYE system since its introduction in the 1960s and will result in a move to a real time PAYE system from January 2019.  This section introduces a number of technical provisions necessary to give effect to the new processes, including two preparatory changes having effect from 2018.<br/><br/>I look forward to hearing Senators' views and of course, we have Committee and Report Stages coming up where we will have an opportunity to discuss matters in more depth.  I understand that in advance of Committee Stage a briefing with officials is being scheduled for any Senators who may wish to attend.  I commend the Bill to the Seanad. </p></speech>

I am contributing to this debate on behalf of my colleague, Senator Horkan, who is unavoidably absent this afternoon.  Fianna F&aacute;il will be supporting this Bill on Second Stage but will be submitting a number of amendments on Committee Stage.</p> <p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill 2017.  The Bill puts many of the announcements made on budget day on a legal footing.  This, the second budget under the confidence and supply arrangement, has a greater than 2:1 split between services and tax reductions.  It will be the second progressive budget in a row after five regressive budgets by the previous Fine Gael-Labour Party Government.  Fianna F&aacute;il is curbing the right wing policies of Fine Gael and has its stopped its US-style approach to taxes.  Our focus has been on ensuring that tax reductions are focused on low and middle income earners and on maintaining a 2:1 budget ratio that emphasises services.  We also demanded that pensions and all social welfare payments be increased by &euro;5 for the second year in a row.  Fianna F&aacute;il wants to ensure the delivery of action on housing, health and Brexit.  We are not interested in spin.  In contrast, this Government is so obsessed with spin, particularly under the current Taoiseach, that it has allocated &euro;5 million to the strategic communications unit in the Taoiseach's office, as alluded to on the Order of Business this afternoon by a number of colleagues.  </p> <p>It is clear that the key test for this budget, or indeed any budget, is the delivery.  Building houses, slashing hospital waiting lists and improving public services must be the real, on the ground results of budget 2018.  We have taken measures towards these aims.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, for example, will have an allocation of &euro;55 million in 2018.  The Indecon report illustrated what Fianna F&aacute;il has been saying since the cruel and callous cuts in 2012 were applied to lone parents.  We have made a step towards correcting this cut.  Separately, retaining the mortgage interest relief will benefit up to 420,000 people.  Our continued role in the confidence and supply arrangement is based on progress in these key areas.  The budget is only a set of announcements; what matters is delivery.  </p> <p>The Government has increased stamp duty on commercial property from 2% to 6%.  This includes agricultural property.  As a result of Fianna F&aacute;il's influence, however, the relief on the transfer of farms to relatives was loosened.  Consanguinity relief reduces stamp duty to 1% for inter-generational transfers of farmland.  The current limit, where the transferring farmer had to be under 67 years of age, is to be removed.  The Finance Bill also provides that where a contract was agreed before 11 October 2017 and will be executed before 1 January 2018, the stamp duty will remain at 2%.  The Coffey report, to which the Minister of State alluded, recommended that capital allowances on intangible assets be restricted to 80% and this will be implemented under this legislation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Diarmuid Wilson:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2017"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2017&amp;amp;pid=DiarmuidWilson&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Fianna F&aacute;il has called for a reduction in USC for middle and low-income workers.  Last year, we succeeded in getting a reduction in all three bands.  Again due to the confidence and supply agreement, this year there will be a reduction in the 5% and 2.5% rates and an increase of &euro;600 to the band to &euro;18,772.  This will benefit more than 1.8 million people including married couples earning over &euro;13,000.  We believe this is the fairest way to reduce tax.  The Government has announced an increase in the standard rate tax band by &euro;750.  While we are supportive of this measure, it will only benefit people earning more than &euro;33,800, leaving everybody else untouched.  Mortgage interest relief has also been extended.  We believe that we are the only party that pushed for the extension of this relief because of what it would mean to nearly 420,000 people.  These people and families bought houses when property prices were at their peak.  They have suffered worst from negative equity whereby the mortgage exceeds the value of the house.  Housing is a key part of the confidence and supply arrangement and Fianna F&aacute;il budgetary negotiating priorities.  It is receiving a &euro;500 million capital increase, an additional &euro;148 million for the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme and an additional &euro;18 million for homelessness services.  However, there is no affordable housing scheme, which must be addressed by the upcoming capital plan.  </p><p>With regard to health, boosting the National Treatment Purchase Fund by &euro;55 million to tackle hospital waiting lists was a key Fianna F&aacute;il demand in the confidence and supply arrangement.  We have secured a reduction in the prescription charges for those under 70 by 50 cent to &euro;2 and in the drug payment scheme threshold from &euro;144 to &euro;134, as well as an additional &euro;435 million for the mental health service in order to achieve service levels proposed in A Vision for Change..  There will also be an increase in personal assistance hours, home help hours and home care packages.  </p><p>In education, there will be a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio from 27:1 to 26:1.  Additional funding for the DEIS schools meals programme and additional career guidance posts also will ensure that each school is equipped to help their pupils reach their full potential.  Increasing the threshold for postgraduate grant eligibility was a central Fianna F&aacute;il demand.  It will help to expand access to fourth level education.  Fianna F&aacute;il will stand by the commitments we made in the confidence and supply agreement.  We did that last year and we intend to do the same this year.  We will engage in robust debate throughout the course of this Bill and I indicated to the Minster that we intend to submit some amendments on Committee Stage.  </p><p>I reiterate that we will be supporting this Bill on Second Stage and I look forward to the Minister's reply.  </p></speech>

He obviously likes it here.  The budget has been in place for virtually two months.  The hallmark of a budget is to set in place an overarching vision and framework of where a Government is at.  Operating with limited resources, a budget should be about what one wishes to achieve with the resources available.  First, that should be about spreading those resources in the fairest way possible.  I see Fine Gael as party that is very much pro-enterprise.  We want to create an environment where people create jobs.  It is not a sin to create a job.  Equally, we have to look after workers and we also must look after less well-off people who have fallen on trouble times.  We must ensure that people do not fall through the cracks and that they can come back.</p> <p>On those measures, and with the resources available to us, dealing with the issue in terms of being pro-enterprise and in respect of families, we have sought to push measures to expand the standard rate bands.  The Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, was very much to the forefront in highlighting this prior to the budget and was trying to push its inclusion in the budget.  I welcome the mortgage interest relief.  I see that as the start of a process in which we look at all times to take the pressure off hardworking families.  I agree with my colleague Senator Wilson, who admirably stepped into the shoes of his colleague, Senator Horkan, and delivered his contribution with aplomb but the issue really is that the-----</p></speech>

The humble politician is an oxymoron in its own way.  The issue is the standard rate of tax and I look at it as entailing a series of measures.  It cannot be done overnight but what was put forward in this budget was that the Government will seek to do that and, to follow in that vein, to increase the standard rate bands.  It makes absolutely no sense that someone who is on a salary of approximately &euro;35,000 pays a 40% rate of tax.  If one adds USC, it is just below 50%.  It makes no sense that someone who is working receives just about half of every euro he or she earns.  That has to change and I welcome that change.  I also welcome the increase in social welfare benefits.  I do not consider increasing tax bands and increasing social welfare payments to be mutually exclusive.  We must look after all sections of society.  Within the context of social welfare payments, we seek to create an environment where it is not a disincentive to work and where it is perceived as a measure for people that should be temporary.  For some people, it will be permanent such as those who have disabilities across a range of areas.  We are also looking to create that environment.</p> <p>On the business side I welcome the retention of the 9% rate of VAT for the hospitality sector.   I certainly believe there is a need to look at and review it in terms of hotel beds.  One sees it in Dublin in particular, where rates are very varied.  There is a need to conduct research on that and examine whether it is being abused.  In rural areas where businesses are trying to survive, it certainly made an enormous difference at a particular point in time and still serves a purpose.  We must make certain that it is not open to abuse for various sectors.  There are questions to be asked about the hotel bed sector.  </p> <p>Other issues arise in respect of the measures that were brought in.  The amalgamation of USC and PRSI is being looked at.  It is extremely important that people see that they get something back.  There is a perception among the public to the effect that PRSI payments serve only one purpose, which pertains to the State pension, and that USC serves no purpose.  It was brought in effectively as a "war time" tax .  It was punitive in the way it was applied to gross income.  If we are amalgamating the payments, we have to show that the public is getting a return in various forms for that payment.  The State pension is one such return.  While benefits have expanded across a range of areas, that particular theme should continue.  The pension review also factors into that, as it makes no sense that someone who starts much earlier in life in a job can get a lower pension than someone who starts later in life.  We have to find a way to square that circle.   We see it continually where through no fault of their own, people started to work at 16.  Perhaps others had the benefit of going to college - their family could afford it - and they may not start working formally until the age of 20 or 21.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Kieran O'Donnell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2207"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2207&amp;amp;pid=KieranODonnell&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The four years for which the person who started at 16 worked could result in him or her getting a lower pension because the number was being averaged.  If there is a move towards total contributions, basing it on what one pays is a fairer system.  I have seen occasions where there was a cohort of women in particular who were in jobs in the public sector that they were obliged to leave and, through no fault of their own, some of them do not qualify for pensions.  I feel very strongly about it and hope this will be factored into the review of the USC and PRSI amalgamation.  People will accept change as long as they see benefit in it and not change for change's sake alone.</p><p>An item which came up in the area of enterprise was an amendment intended as an anti-avoidance measure for management buy-outs, MBO.  The Minister of State is probably aware of it.  It was discussed on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il in respect of bona fide MBOs.  I note that it was accepted and there is a statement of practice coming from Revenue for bona fide management buy-outs.  That group includes, for example, people who have engaged in farm consolidation, where a reduced rate of stamp duty applies.  I am looking at succession in this regard.  There should not be a situation in respect of someone who joined a small company and worked with it over many years and where the original owner is nearing an age where he or she wishes to retire or sell on to that person.  That is a bona fide management buy-out because that person has grown with the company.  I may touch on that on Committee and Report Stages on that since it has come up.</p><p>I want to touch on-----</p></speech>

I look forward to the measures for affordable housing and, more specifically in the context of Georgian Limerick, I look forward to the Limerick city initiative.  I will discuss it on Committee and Report Stages.  There were two aspects.  Tax relief was brought on for the living city initiative.  There is a very slow take-up in Limerick.  We are a Georgian city.  Limerick city centre cannot return to vibrancy unless we address Georgian Limerick.  The footprint of Limerick city is comprised of Georgian houses.  We have only had nine take-ups of tax reliefs recently with an owner-occupier in one case and the rest being rental properties.  I might discuss that on Committee and Report Stages.  I intend to bring representatives of Limerick City and County Council to meet the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, shortly to discuss heritage grants to boost Limerick but I may want to look at tax measures to see what can be done.  There may be a need for a review or for special treatment because, of all the cities in Ireland, the real Georgian city, considering the proportion of houses concentrated in the city, is Limerick, my home city.  I look forward to Committee and Report Stages and thank the Minister.</p></speech>

It is a missed opportunity, where tax cuts were championed ahead of investments in key services that could begin to address the crises in health, housing and education.  Apart from the objections Sinn F&eacute;in had to prioritising tax cuts over much needed spending, I will highlight several measures that could have been introduced on Committee and Report Stages in the D&aacute;il, which could have increased revenue for the State and would have seen a more equitable tax system in place.  That USC and income tax cuts of &euro;335 million are being made at a time when we have a housing emergency and a health service that is creaking at the seams is inexcusable.  These are political decisions and many people are gobsmacked by them.</p> <p>I note that Fianna F&aacute;il did not support the amendment in the D&aacute;il to ensure that farmland was excluded from the threefold increase in stamp duty up to 6%.  Does the Minister of State have an update for me on this point, as promised to my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty?  Fianna F&aacute;il had an opportunity to support this amendment yet it abstained.  It was amusing to see that as the Finance Bill passed through the various stages in the D&aacute;il, Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies could be seen scurrying down to get into the Chamber in time to abstain.  If the current crisis has shown us anything, it is the true nature of the dysfunctionality in Government.</p> <p>My colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, also tried to ensure that many of our pillar banks, which were bailed out by the taxpayer, pay their fair share of tax.  The banks confirmed before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, that they have 20 years to go before they will pay any tax.  The Minister says he waved a big stick at the banks over the tracker mortgage issue.  That seems to have worked well for the scary Minister, Deputy Donohoe.  He has the chance to show a bit of backbone in this Finance Bill by removing this loophole and taxing them.  It is intolerable that this Finance Bill does not end the tax break for the banks.  AIB is on course for a &euro;1.5 billion profit this year.  Bank of Ireland made &euro;1 billion last year.  That is more than &euro;300 million on the basis of 12.5% tax.  It makes no sense that we would waive that, especially when taken with the fact that we still refuse to collect the &euro;13 billion owed to us by Apple.  How much longer can the Government claim that time is needed to solve the housing and health crises?</p> <p>Recently the term "single malt" has come into the public domain following an excellent report by Christian Aid but this information is not new and has been in the public domain for some time.  It is infuriating when Ministers pretend to be amazed that these tax structures exist when they legislated for the increase in the cap of intangible assets to 100% and are fully aware of the outworkings of Ireland's double tax treaty network.  Does the Minister of State agree that international reports of us providing a zero tax rate on billions of euro of multinational profits is bad for our international reputation?  Why did the Government not accept the Sinn F&eacute;in amendments in the D&aacute;il?  As drafted, the Finance Bill will only apply this cap to assets onshored from 11 October 2017.  That means the hundreds of billions transferred here in recent years, especially at its height in 2015, can be still be used by companies to potentially neutralise their corporation tax.</p> <p>This is totally unacceptable and I welcome recent comments from Mr. Seamus Coffey.  He recommends that the Government's new cap on the write-down of intangible assets apply to all assets as opposed to the Government's proposal, which grandfathers the new measure, meaning that the 80% cap will only apply to intangible assets acquired post budget.  Due to the proposed cap not applying to all intangible assets, the State is missing out on a huge amount of corporate tax revenue that might not materialise in the future.  Seamus Coffey further notes that if the cap applied to all claims, existing and new, then the additional corporation tax to be collected in 2018 could be up to &euro;1 billion using the 2015 figure published by Revenue and estimates from that time used by the Department of Finance, as opposed to the &euro;150 million the Government expects to raise.  It is &euro;1 billion compared with &euro;150 million.  We are paying for these onshore assets because they count towards our GNI, pushing up our EU contribution.  We leave these companies to pay no tax through their intangible asset write-downs and the State is picking up the tab for increased contributions to the EU budget due to the tax-free earnings many of these companies have from intangible assets.  The State makes payments of approximately &euro;200 million per annum to the EU budget as a result of this gross income, which makes no contribution to Ireland's national budget.  Over a ten-year period, this would result in payments of approximately &euro;2 billion.  We divert money from potential spending programmes to pay for the associated EU budget contributions this untaxed income requires each year, as well as an increase in the EU budget contributions counting towards the fiscal space.</p> <p>The Government must amend its current proposal to include all intangible assets to safeguard our tax base and ensure the State is not unnecessarily picking up the tab for increased EU budget contributions related to tax-free multinational corporation activities.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator M&aacute;ire Devine:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2468"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2468&amp;amp;pid=MaireDevine&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Government needs to amend its current proposal to include all intangible assets, safeguard our tax base and ensure the State is not unnecessarily picking up the tab for increased EU budget contributions related to tax-free multinational corporation activities.  The Seanad affords the opportunity to consider the Finance Bill again in light of all the debate in the D&aacute;il over the past few weeks.  It is vital that the elements of the Bill that seem to let some of the highest earning companies off scot free in terms of tax be examined again.  When I meet people, they are incredulous over the fact that Bank of Ireland and AIB will wait 20 years until they pay any tax.  It is not too late.  Sinn F&eacute;in will be offering amendments again to this Bill.  We will not support it in its current form.  It is predictable and it is a missed golden opportunity to regain tax revenue for our people.</p></speech>

Oxfam highlights that corporate taxes lost worldwide amount to &euro;84 billion per year.  A third of this amount would be enough to pay for universal, global essential health care.  This stands in sharp contrast with Ireland's worldwide reputation as a leader in humanitarian work and development work, delivering essential services worldwide.  It also highlights the lack of joined-up thinking between our taxation policies and our commitments to the elimination of poverty, both nationally and globally.</p> <p>Our role in tax avoidance is also out of line with our commitments under the sustainable development goals, SDGs, which the Irish Government played a key role in brokering.  Under the SDGs, we are committed to working in global partnership to address inequalities between and within countries.  Specifically, we have agreed on the following: "By 2030, progressively achieve and sustain income growth of the bottom 40 percent of the population at a rate higher than the national average".  Can the Minister of State offer his assurances that the Bill he presents here today delivers on this commitment?</p> <p>I would like to raise a question about two specific aspects of the Bill.  First, I note that for the key employee engagement programme, KEEP, there is a budget of &euro;10 million allocated, yet I am concerned that this figure does not include an estimate of the revenue that will be lost to the Exchequer as a result of tax foregone under this scheme.  What is the net effect of this measure?  I am also concerned that the Government's outline for this scheme does not provide a sufficient mechanism to monitor it, including the level of uptake from the scheme and a calculation of the indirect cost to the Exchequer through foregone revenue.</p> <p>Schemes such as this need rigorous analysis and scrutiny to ensure that all costs are taken into consideration.  Such analysis needs to be freely available, to both the Oireachtas and the wider public.  I wonder if the Minister of State could share his thoughts on the net effect of the measures, in addition to the basic cost to the State.  We need to be careful to avoid implementing a scheme that could result in an upward transfer of wealth and make income inequality worse rather than bridging the gap between rich and poor.  We must be very wary of tax deals that could narrow the tax base, which base is vital for investment in public services such as housing and health services.</p> <p>The second issue I would like to raise is the cost to the Exchequer of the knowledge development box scheme.  This scheme, which offers tax breaks for companies for investment in research and development, should also be subject to rigorous scrutiny and a cost-benefit analysis.  It could impose a heavy cost on the Exchequer.  I urge the Minister of State to consider how the scheme will be effectively monitored, how companies that participate in the scheme will demonstrate its value, and how the costs to the Exchequer will be calculated both before and after.  It is important to ask whether this revenue lost would be better spent on investment in research through our public universities and research institutions, driving research excellence and retaining innovation within the public domain and ensuring that it serves the public good.</p> <p>It was disappointing to note that this year's budget did not deliver on the Government's commitment to gender and equality auditing or an accompanying equality statement.  I call on the Government to deliver on this commitment, not only as part of the budgetary process but also in the delivery of the Finance Bill.  This offers both accountability and transparency regarding our commitment to the elimination of inequality - economically and between genders.  This is consistent with what we in the Civil Engagement group have been calling for regarding accountability, transparency, sustainability and long-term thinking.  I thank Senator Alice-Mary Higgins specifically for her hard work on this point in particular.  We are calling for fairness in taxation.  We are a low-tax country at a time when we have major unmet needs across all sectors, be they associated with the disabled, children, older people, those will mental health problems or those requiring addiction services.  We need to meet our international standards and commitments and reflect on this.</p></speech>

He is a regular here.  It is always good to see him.</p> <p>I welcome many of the provisions in the Finance Bill.  They have been outlined very eloquently by many in the House, including our own spokesperson.  I am disappointed, however, that an exemption from the local property tax is not being extended to people in Mayo with pyrite in their homes and people in Donegal with mica in their homes.  With regard to pyrite, the exemption already exists for homes in Leinster.  It has been officially established that there is a problem with pyrite in Mayo and I do not understand why what has been done for people in Leinster cannot be done for people in Mayo.  I appreciate that the Minister of State was in the House last week dealing with a Commencement matter I raised but it is not good enough to tell people to revalue their property.  One has to treat people equally.  The problem is more serious in blockwork than in foundations, which is where the pyrite is found in Leinster.</p> <p>We must always consider those for whom Christmas will be bleak.  I want to highlight, in particular, the cohort dealing with vulture funds or hedge funds.  I want to single out one vulture fund in particular, namely, Promontoria.  It has come to my attention on a number of occasions.  Businesspeople, professionals and farmers are trying to deal with it.  "Trying" is the operative word.</p> <p>Over Christmas, as with August, the courts go on holidays for a few weeks.  This seems to result in an escalation in the number of proceedings that Promontoria issues.  In the run up to court holidays, people may find it difficult to get lawyers.  People are slapped with proceedings.  I refer to cases where, to my mind, people are making a very real effort because they do not want to be declared bankrupt and want to sort out their affairs.  I encountered a case that really highlighted to me what is occurring.  It is the case of a professional man who, as with a number of others, got into debt.  He has been able to reach a financial arrangement with several banks but he cannot deal with Promontoria.  He made an offer to it and it did not even make a counter-offer.  In my experience of proceedings, trying to sort out cases, mediation and negotiations, I have never heard the like.  Now the individual has been slapped with a High Court summons requiring the full amount owed.  If he is declared bankrupt, none of the other creditors will get paid at all.</p> <p>One of the vulture fund's tactics is to require people to go to Belfast to visit an office.  The man working there is a former Scotland Yard agent.  I do not want to be crude in this Chamber but must state that he introduces himself to people when he sits them down by saying, "I am a prick but do not mind that".  It proceeds from there.  That says it all.  I am raising this because an increasing number of people have been complaining about their dealings with Promontoria.</p> <p>A number of issues arise in this regard.  The vulture funds are unregulated.  What engagement is there between the Department and these vulture funds?  They are supposed to have a special relationship manager for debtors to deal with, yet the debtors do not get to know the identity of that relationship manager, unless they get to go to the North and meet the unsavoury individual I have mentioned.  For the most part, the vulture fund I referred to operates through its agent, Capita.  It is most unsatisfactory.  The fund does not seem to want to hammer out deals.  It seems to want to put people to the pin of their collar.  What are we doing for these people, who are making a genuine effort?  How are the vulture funds controlled?  How are they taken to task?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michelle Mulherin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->What meetings are taking place between the Department or officials in the Department and Promontoria?  The irony of it is that this particular professional had told me that he had just paid &euro;80,000 in preliminary tax while Promontoria, as I understand it, pays next to nothing in tax.  Is this person supposed to go to the wall when he is trying to sort out his affairs?  This is repeated throughout.  People cannot seem to get a handle on these vulture funds.  They need to be taken to task, and I would appreciate any information the Minister of State has on that. </p><p>I would also like to see some advancement on the pyrite issue, including a redress scheme, so that people can be informed of the work that is going on.  I know that the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is working on it.  I would like people to know that there is work going on in the Department of Finance to try and help people who have pyrite and mica in their homes.</p></speech>

We are dealing with very important legislation which will have an effect on the future development of our country and the city of Cork.  I want to speak about Cork in particular.  We have allocated &euro;155 million to the city of Cork for the acquisition and building of more than 624 housing units, and I want to focus on that for a moment.  There is a whole of Government approach to Rebuilding Ireland, and I hope that as part of future Finance Bills and budgets we can look at how we can incentivise the private sector to build.  I attended a briefing with Cork City Council yesterday morning where its social housing ambitions and plans were discussed.  However, the city council is almost building more houses than the private developer, and that cannot be right.  A balance must be struck.  In particular, in Barrack Street, part of Douglas Street and in the inner city of Cork, we can have a scheme to encourage living over shops and encourage regeneration through tax incentive schemes.  Those schemes have existed in the past, but they can be brought back again to incentivise and acquire lands and buildings.  In certain sections there are problems with capital allowances and stamp duty, but this is about ensuring we take the investment we have made in Cork, for example, the public realm in Barrack Street, and incentivise either the local authority or a developer to intervene and make it habitable.  Vast parts of that area of the city are not inhabited.  As part of the national capital development plan, or Ireland 2040, we have an ambition and strategic vision for the development of Cork, and I want to ensure that with a combined approach, working with local government, we will see an emphasis on collaboration to develop more social housing in Cork.</p> <p>It is also about ensuring that the city of Cork, and the county, has the ability to reach its full potential in the context of increasing employment in order that the shared vision can be realised.  We are talking about having a total population of 500,000 in Cork by 2050 and having 120,000 jobs in Cork in the next 30 years.  That requires a facilitation by Government, which should have a collaborative approach with other stakeholders to ensure that we have sufficient infrastructure.  Cork should also be designated as a complementary city or location to Dublin.  It is also about Cork being connected.</p> <p>I want to promote the idea of Cork as a place of opportunity.  Cork city and county council put together a joint statement which outlined a vision and a roadmap for the future.  I am a small bit concerned about one area, and that is the issue of aviation.  The Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, is the umbrella body which drives Cork Airport.  The airport has experienced huge success in recent years, and Niall McCarthy and his team deserve immense credit and praise.  However, it is critical that the transatlantic route is continued, especially in the off-season.  As the Minister of State knows, load factors are difficult to estimate, but we need to ensure that Cork Airport, the second largest airport in the country, supporting 4,500 jobs, has the support to promote and market the North American route.  It is not just about key infrastructure and investment but also about having a focus for the future.  Central to that is the airport and the transatlantic flights.</p> <p>This is about people and having the economic conditions in place in terms of housing and office space.  It is also about connectivity in a global sense, allied to business development and innovation, and governance and marketing.  I hope that as a consequence of what we are trying to achieve through the Action Plan for Jobs, Rebuilding Ireland and Ireland 2040, we can do that in Cork.</p></speech>

I do not know enough about the aviation point raised by Senator Buttimer.  I will try to get some answers if possible.</p> <p>Housing, especially social housing, was something of a recurring theme in the Senators' submissions.  I am glad to hear that people are also talking about affordable housing.  There is a problem with housing, and much of the focus is on the purchase of property.  However, I believe that the private rental sector is the area where we have the biggest problem.  Rents have doubled, and people who are earning decent salaries cannot afford to rent a house.  If somebody wants to buy a house, according to the property pages in any newspaper, they can pay from &euro;100,000 to &euro;3.1 million.  He or she may not get what he or she wants, but that choice is there for quite a few people.  However, perhaps expectations need to be lowered.</p> <p>The local property tax exemption for pyrite buildings was brought up by Senator Mulherin last week.  In 2018, there will be a review of local property tax.  That is the place to progress this matter.  We must ensure that those areas where there are problems with houses and blockwork, similar to what happened with pyrite in Leinster, are the areas where the exemption will apply, such as in Mayo and Donegal.</p> <p>I will not mention any individual vulture funds, but the legislation is in place since 2015.  The funds are not regulated, but the service agents which operate on behalf of the funds can be regulated.  That has been in place since 2015.  The exact same laws and regulations apply for financial institutions.  The laws that apply to the banks also apply to the vulture funds.  That message has got lost for quite a few people.  One of the initiatives I have taken was meeting the Banking Payments Federation of Ireland, BPFI, a number of months ago to put across my opinion that it was not doing its job well enough.  Many Members of the Oireachtas, whether in the Lower House or this House, are trying to work on behalf of their clients, and while they may manage sometimes to get people on the phone, at other times they do not even get to speak to someone on the phone and are told that they will be conversed with by letter and not by email.  I asked the Banking Payments Federation of Ireland to consider putting in place a structure where Members of Houses of the Oireachtas, who represent the public and who have an issue with a bank can deal with the account with the BPFI - all of the banks and the service agents.  They should not be told that somebody else has to be spoken to about it or that it is a matter for the credit line further up the chain of command.  Instead, Members of this Oireachtas should be able to meet the right people in order that some form of a deal can be hammered out.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Michael D'Arcy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2208"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2208&amp;amp;pid=MichaelWDArcy&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is not concluded, but I am working on that.</p><p>In response to Senator Black, I will raise a couple of issues.  This country is not a tax haven.  I want to be very clear on that.  I ask people to stop repeating the easy line that this country is a tax haven.  There are some groups of countries that like to say that if a country levies taxes below a certain threshold it is a tax haven.  Put it into context.  We choose in this jurisdiction to have a low corporation tax, but we have high income taxes.  That is our choice.  Why do we do that?  We do not have a large number of corporations.  It is as simple as that.  So we charge a rate of 12.5%.  That is the nominal rate.  The effective rate is about 10.5%.  Our primary deductible is research and development.  There are other jurisdictions with a much higher rate than ours.  Some of them have twice the rate.  Some of them have three times the rate.  However, there are countries that have multiples of our nominal rate and a lower effective rate.  Do not be fooled by what is being said by some.  </p><p>I want to touch on Senator Devine's point about the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  She refers to a rate of 1%.  That is correct, it is the correct rate of tax for those countries.  We have tax arrangements with 73 countries so that there is not a double taxation of income.  That is a structure that is in place with countries all over the world.  The UK has tax arrangements with 140 countries.  We have a much smaller number than them, and that is appropriate.  I will name some Irish companies; Kerry and Glanbia.  There are 100,000 people in the United States who are employed by Irish companies based there.  Those companies pay tax in Ireland, because that is their domicile.  There is a flow of income in both directions, not just one.  However, everybody talks about only one direction.  For 11% of those companies to pay a rate of 1% in Ireland is correct and appropriate.  Glanbia, Kerry and so many others have thousands of employees in the United States and pay their taxes here.  Nobody talks about that.  Everybody says we are a tax haven because they only pay 1%.  That is appropriate, correct, and in line with other tax jurisdictions. </p><p>Tax avoidance was referred to.  We absolutely do not support tax avoidance.  We have done everything we can in the base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD.  The world is globalised.  Companies are not based in a single country.  I went to the International Monetary Fund, IMF, meeting last autumn in Washington DC.  As an example of what I am talking about, a Boeing airplane is made in 47 different countries.  It is finalised and assembled in the US.  The Bombardier airplane in manufactured in about 52 countries.  Some 3,000 Bombardier staff work in Northern Ireland.  That is the globalised world we live in, and yet people are saying that we are doing something wrong.  We are not. </p><p>Senator Devine always seems to get it wrong, she seem to get the wrong end of the stick.</p></speech>

It was agreed in the confidence and supply arrangement between the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il.  I want to put it into context.  I absolutely support the reduction in income taxes.  The quantum of money raised by income taxes has doubled since 2011.  In 2011, the State took in &euro;11 billion in income taxes.  In budget 2018, we are projected to take in &euro;21.5 billion.  That is the great reconfiguration in this State.  The income tax payers are paying the taxes.  I repeat, income tax revenue has doubled.  Senator Devine and her party are entitled to their view.  I disagree with her.  When the actual quantity of money has doubled, the income tax payers must be entitled to earn more money.  Senator Wilson has heard me say this on so many occasions when I was a Member of this Chamber, as has Senator Bacik.</p><p>There is something very wrong with a tax jurisdiction where people on the average industrial wage pay the higher rate of tax.  I have tried to get analysis of this done, and I think it happens in practically no other jurisdiction within the OECD.  I have also made the point on several occasions that when I am out and about trying to encourage companies to come and locate here, the first thing that a lot of foreign direct investment prospects or financial institutions talk about is the point at which one pays the higher rate of tax.  Not everybody is on &euro;100,000, &euro;120,000 or &euro;130,000.  A lot of people are on the average industrial wage.  We begin paying the higher rate at lower earnings than anywhere else, and the reduction in income tax is something I absolutely support.</p><p>I want to touch on one other point.  Senator Devine spoke about how horrified she was by the stamp duty increase.  Her own budget submission proposed to double it from 2% to 4%, with a tax take of &euro;190 million.  I am sure she is aware of this proposed stamp duty increase.  Is she not aware of it?  That was Sinn F&eacute;in's submission.  </p><p>Senator O'Donnell referred to the hospitality sector.  That is the hard question that we are going to have to face at some stage.  We have forgone a lot of money, but it was the right policy structure at the right time.  One of the things that we have to do is increase stamp duty from the emergency period rate of 2%.  Stamp duty was always 6%.  On some occasions it was 9% or 11%.  However, it is now at the normalised rate, which is a sustainable rate of 6%.  I support that.  We have to get back to normalised rates.  At stage we will have to move the rate of VAT in the hospitality sector back from 9% to 13.5%, to put in place a sustainable tax base that will withstand external shocks, internal shocks, and every other type of shock. </p><p>Affordable housing is something I am very strong upon.  As Senator Wilson knows, I am not the most political politician Members will come across.  It is very easy for people in the Opposition to beat up Fianna F&aacute;il.  It should be given credit for putting in place a structure whereby the Government is allowed to act.  It is very easy to step off the pitch and say everything is wrong, but everything is not wrong.  We have come from a remarkable place where we were bankrupt and this nation did not have a shilling.  One of the things that I knew would happen eventually was that the lag would catch up.  There is a lag in housing, homelessness and other areas because we did not have the money to invest and reinvest.  A lot of people in the Opposition beat up Fianna F&aacute;il, but it chose to be responsible and ensure that a Government is in place, and it should be commended instead of being criticised for that.</p><p>I have touched upon the Coffey report, stamp duty and lower middle incomes.  Regarding IT and intangible assets, we have made a change in line with the Coffey report to bring it from a 100% deductible to a 80% deductible.<b></b>We have a figure of &euro;150 million.  I think that is a low-ball figure.  Senator Devine says there is &euro;1 billion it, but there is not.  If we set the rates at the levels she is talking about, the property will go somewhere else.  That is what happens.  It is a globalised world. </p><p>Senator Wilson referred to affordable housing schemes.  Members have heard me speaking about affordable housing schemes on numerous occasions.  There is an anomaly concerning people who have average earnings.  Where I live, the average industrial earnings are between &euro;30,000 and &euro;40,000.  Those people are not in the space where they can afford to buy their own home.  Where I come from, a three-bed semi-detached house costs  &euro;175,000.  Do the figures and work them backwards and it is clear these potential buyers need an enormous deposit.  That is not always available.  In many cases parents are helping and people are working hard to save that deposit, but it is nearly impossible to do so with the rents that couples now have to pay.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Michael D'Arcy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2208"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2208&amp;amp;pid=MichaelWDArcy&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is nearly impossible for couples to save the deposit given the high level of rents.  It is something that I pushed very strongly when I was in the Seanad and now that I am in the Department of Finance I am seeking to put in place an affordable housing scheme for people on average and low wages so that they can afford to buy their own home.  Anyone who has heard the Taoiseach speak about the republic of opportunities will have heard that is one of the things he has prioritised also.  How much time do I have left?</p></speech>

Senator Mulherin raised the mica issue.</p> <p>I wish to make one other point about housing.  We have a &euro;6 billion pot for housing.  We probably have a capacity issue in terms of how quickly we can try to encourage people out of the commercial property sector into the residential property sector.  That is what this budget is about, namely, making land available, encouraging and enticing people who have land to make it available, so we can get moving on the construction of properties because the biggest issue we have is supply.  We lost the last decade but we will be in a much better position for the next decade.</p></speech>

Much has happened since 4 July when the House last debated Committee Stage.  I am delighted that discussion on this Stage of this important Bill has resumed.  All of us want its passage through the Houses expedited.</p> <p>I do not propose to spend a long time discussing the amendments given that the House discussed this group, amendments Nos. 3 to 6, inclusive, in the previous debate.  I wish to address amendment No. 6, which is in my name.  Without going back over our previous discussion, the purpose of the amendment is to provide for a list of criteria or factors which the court would be required to consider in the decision as to whether to grant an order.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The reason we put forward this amendment, and indeed why others put forward similar amendments, was our real concern over inconsistency in the criteria currently used.  As long ago as 1999 the Law Society advocated that there should be either detailed statutory guidance or a list of criteria to be considered by the courts in determining whether or not to grant protective orders.  The Law Society expressed concern about inconsistency at that point and all of us with any experience of the courts would be conscious of this.  Inconsistency, indeed, is tacitly accepted in the Government's own amendment No. 35, which goes some way to addressing the issue in my own amendment by providing for a requirement to give reasons.  This provision is also in our own amendment No. 6 but our amendment goes further in providing for the specific criteria. <br/><br/>I will briefly say a bit more on this.  Apart from what the Law Society has stated, we also know that there is a very high attrition rate between the number of interim barring orders granted, for example, and the number of actual barring orders.  In 2015, for example, 77% of interim barring orders were granted but fewer than 33% of barring orders.  Why is this?  Again, the Law Society has expressed its concern.  It is, they say, impossible for lawyers to advise clients on their current prospects of success.  The only guidance here is the Supreme Court decision in O'B <i>v. </i>O'B in 1983, where Mr. Justice O'Higgins set, for the most part, a high threshold for the granting of a barring order and referred to the fact that it must be a case of serious, repetitive and continuing misconduct and not the &quot;ordinary wear and tear of married life&quot;.  No barring order was granted there.  This contrasted with the dissent in that case of Mr. Justice Griffin which set out the detail of a case in which there had been evidence of cruelty and control.  That case, then, set the bar very high.<br/><br/>All of us here are delighted to see from the new amendments put forward by the Government last week that there will now be an offence of coercive control.  That recognises that this may be an issue and that it may indeed change the nature of the threshold that applicants have to pass so as to get an order from the courts.  We maintain, however, that it is important that we have a detailed list of criteria set out in legislation to really guard against the inconsistencies that currently bedevil the system.  <br/><br/>I also very much welcome the new amendment No. 47b which sets out the new aggravating factors where an assault offence is committed in an intimate and committed relationship.  This is very welcome, and though it does not go quite as far as we would have wanted as compared to the specific domestic violence offence we had looked for, it goes quite a good deal of the way.  I wonder if the Minister might agree in principle to look at introducing a list of statutory criteria for the courts.  I have made the case strongly and we are all of us very concerned about this.  We mean to press this matter because it really is a key principle.  </p></speech>

I welcome this amendment and confirm that Fianna F&aacute;il will be supporting Senator Bacik on it.</p> <p>I would also like to take this opportunity to briefly mention the issue of the legal aid available to victims of domestic violence.  There is currently a minimal contribution of &euro;130 for legal aid so I would like the Minister of State to give a commitment that anyone making an application for one of these orders be given a waiver across the board.  Where the issue of coercive control arises, victims of domestic abuse do not have access to money and would find &euro;130 very difficult to come by.  This is the minimum contribution - it sometimes amounts to more - and this money is very hard to come by for anyone in an abusive situation.</p> <p>Legal representation is a priority for people like this who are particularly vulnerable.  Rather than mention this matter at a later stage, I would like to mention it here.  As I said, we will be supporting Senator Bacik on this amendment.</p></speech>

I would like to say, however, that this amendment from Senator Bacik and the Labour Party is very close to my own so I would be happy to withdraw mine and support Senator Bacik's instead.  This is a very important amendment, so if it is defeated I can presumably resubmit my amendment on Report Stage.</p></speech>

I also thank the other organisations and interested parties who have been helping and debating with everybody on this.</p> <p>At the last debate on this Bill, we considered the issue of factors to be taken into account by judges when considering applications for domestic violence orders under the Bill.  I outlined at that time that extensive consideration had been given to providing for such a list.  On foot of the Senators&rsquo; amendments and my commitment to this House, officials worked throughout the summer, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, to see if a single list of factors could be developed with each item in the list as legally clear as possible.  I appreciate the positive motivation for these amendments.  Indeed, this positive motivation and the intended outcome became clearer through the detailed legal consideration over the last number of months.</p> <p>Notwithstanding this painstaking work, the fundamental point remains the same.  No list can be exhaustive.  The circumstances of some victims will inevitably be missed, therefore, as illustrated in Senator Norris&rsquo;s very insightful initial remarks on this topic.  If a circumstance is taken on board under an all-embracing final clause rather than because it is set out in the legislation, it may open the door for argument by the respondent that it is not actually domestic violence.  Closer scrutiny has also highlighted the very real danger that a permissive list may become a mandatory list, either by law through a finding of a higher court, or in practice through the actions of legal advisers for respondents.</p> <p>My concern is that even the most clear-cut cases, which are fully worthy of an order being granted, may give rise to long, drawn-out and gruelling sessions for the applicant, where questions are raised on up to 18 different grounds.  This would be a disaster for the victim and I know it would be a consequence that is entirely unintended by the proposers of these amendments.  It is because of these justified and very real concerns of hugely negative unintended consequences for victims, that I am very slow to agree to these amendments. </p> <p>In order to place my opposition to and worries about these amendments in context, Senators will have noted that, as Senator Bacik has already stated, following commitments to this House and again after extensive work by the Department and the Attorney General&rsquo;s office, two Government amendments have been tabled on issues where it had previously been indicated that the Government was not minded to accept amendments.  These amendments provide for an offence of coercive control and aggravating factors in sentencing where the offender and victim are, or have been, in an intimate and committed relationship.  We will discuss these at a later point. </p> <p>I have some further notes here so I may have to return to them later.  I am minded to listen, though I must point out that amendments Nos. 4, 5 and 6 seek to prescribe in the Bill a list of factors that a judge hearing a domestic violence case must consider in reaching a decision in a domestic violence application.   Further, the proposed amendments attempt to define violence and psychological violence.  The amendments go on to include additional factors that a court must consider when deciding applications for an emergency barring order or a protection order.</p> <p>The bulk of domestic violence cases are dealt with under the summary jurisdiction of the District Court.  In deciding whether to grant a domestic violence order, the court has a wide discretion.  The threshold for the granting of an order is that the court is of the opinion that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the safety or welfare of an applicant or a dependent person requires the order.  This does not restrict the court in determining what is relevant in deciding a domestic violence application. </p> <p>There are so many factors that could cause a court to consider that someone is in danger and I do not want to limit the courts' discretion or independence on this.  As it stands, an applicant can put forward to the court any factors he or she considers relevant to the application.  The judge will consider each case on its merits and make a decision based on all the evidence put forward.  The amendments as proposed risk becoming a lawyers&rsquo; charter involving arguments on both sides which in itself risks prolonging a case.  We return to the difficulty in drawing up an exhaustive list of behaviours that constitute domestic violence.   Although I understand the intention behind the proposed amendments, given the complexities and the possible delays that could arise in arriving at a decision and a wish to retain wide discretion for judges hearing these cases, I am again very concerned about accepting these amendments now.  I am willing, however, to examine further, as I did earlier, the points made by Senators during the debate.  I am also willing to consult again with the Attorney General and with the Parliamentary Counsel on these matters to see what amendments could be proposed for Report Stage.  My advice, however, is to be extremely cautious.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy David Stanton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1053"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1053&amp;amp;pid=DavidStanton&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We do not want to make things worse for victims.  We have to be very cautious on this.  I am really keen to work with Senators, as we have shown with other amendments that were discussed earlier and will show with amendments that will be discussed later on.  However, I urge caution on this for the reasons I have outlined.  I am anxious to hear what the Senators have to say on the points I have made and I am very open to argument on this.</p></speech>

He is very welcome back.  I thank him and his officials for the engagement we have had on these issues since the last time the matter was discussed here.  I think we all very much welcome the two new Government amendments, namely, amendments Nos. 47a and 47b.  We recognise that they go a long way to meeting many of the concerns we had raised previously.</p> <p>To deal with two points the Minister of State raised in respect of amendment No. 6 and why he said he could not accept an amendment that would list a set of criteria, we sought to address that problem of having an exhaustive list which would preclude reference to other factors in our proposed section 5(1)(k) in amendment No. 6 by stating that the court should have regard to "any other matter which appears ... to be relevant to the safety and welfare of the applicant and any dependent person".</p> <p>Further, I would have thought that our list was a sensible list.  It is a list that a court should have regard to in any case.  It is not in any way intended to prolong a hearing to the detriment of the applicant, nor do I think it would have that effect.  However, it would provide a structured framework within which these applications could be made.  This sort of structured framework is currently lacking in the making of these applications.  The intention is not to tie the discretion of judges.  The discretion remains with the judge.  It simply requires the court to have regard to these factors.</p> <p>Lastly, NGOs working on the front line with victims and survivors of domestic violence have been very supportive of and have been pushing for an amendment such as this one.  I understand that their view is that, of the group of amendments, amendment No. 6 would best meet the needs of victims and survivors in the courts.</p></speech>

However, I am sure we are all very glad we are here and not out canvassing for an election on 19 December.</p> <p>The Minister of State seems to have two opposing ideas in his mind at the same time.  One is that the list is exhaustive and the other that it is too restricted.  With regard to the question of it being too restricted, one of the reasons I will be withdrawing my amendment and supporting Senator Bacik's is that she has put in a kind of catch-all provision at the end which includes any other relevant matters.  I believe such a phrase cures that situation.</p> <p>The Minister of State has a very human feeling that witnesses and people in the court could be subject to long and gruelling questioning and cross-examination on the basis of this list.  However, I do not think barristers need this list if they are determined to be difficult.  We saw that in the McCabe case where all kinds of rubbish was introduced and there was aggressive cross-examination and so on.  That is in the gift of the barrister involved.  They will not need this list.  If they are determined to be troublemakers and go down this avenue, they will go down it and they will produce their own list which may well be more extensive than this one.  However, I would say that the majority of barristers would not be like that.  They would be decent sensible people.  It would probably be pretty unusual for a barrister tendentiously to raise all these issues.</p></speech>

His engagement with us and all the organisations with which we are working closely and the genuineness he is bringing to progressing this important legislation is very welcome.</p><p>To come back to the issue of consistency, organisations working at the coalface report time and again that cases with similar facts have very different results.  This is not a situation that we want to continue, which is why we want to be tight in the definition.  It is very hard for judges to see what they do not know or understand, and there has been inconsistency.  In 1999, the Law Society in Domestic Violence: A Case for Reform advocated for the introduction of either detailed statutory guidance or a list of criteria to be considered by the courts in determining whether to grant protective orders.  The society stated:</p><blockquote>There is considerable divergence among District Court judges in the exercise of their discretion ... The provision of detailed statutory criteria to guide judicial discretion is an approach adopted elsewhere in Family Law.  The Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, Family Law Act, 1995 and the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996 each set down clear and detailed criteria for consideration by the courts in the exercise of discretion under the legislation.</blockquote> <p>If there was not a problem with consistency, we would not be speaking about it.  However, due to the nature of domestic violence, there is a lack of understanding.  It is not in these parts where there is great knowledge and understanding, but it is not everywhere.  Therefore, at this time we want to ensure that it is known and understood.  The amendments in this grouping ensure that domestic violence is clear and understood.  The list of factors to be taken into account by the court in deciding whether to make an order under the Domestic Violence Act are very clear and create an absolute understanding.  This is about achieving culture change.  It is so important.  We are not just shifting words but also minds by the words in the legislation.</p><p>Of these grouped amendments, amendment No. 6 is the most logical and suitable option.  Its subsections (1) and (2) set out an open list of factors.  Its subsection (3) then defines &quot;violence&quot;, including psychological violence and controlling behaviours.  Finally, its subsection (4) requires reasons for decisions to be provided to the parties in writing.  While there is a potential conflict with other definitions in the definition of coercive or controlling behaviour, that may be addressed on Report Stage.</p><p>There is precedent for such an approach in divorce law.  I absolutely recommend the Law Society's submission.  It is not just people like me who are coming from a social work background that support this amendment.  Lawyers also support it.  If the Law Society believes it is possible, I hope the Minister of State will give it careful consideration.  We will be pressing this.</p></speech>

In fact, I think that I can accept the amendment now with the proviso that I may come back with an amendment to it on Report Stage.</p> <p>I ask Senators in the interim to have another look at the issue and to consider what I said as well.  I am not into winning votes or that kind of stuff.  I am genuine about the arguments being put forward.  It is not a case of having a win over the Senators or the Senators having a win over me.  That does not come into it.  I ask the Senators to have a good look at the arguments which I have put forward.  If they think there is merit in them, they might come back to me.  We will accept amendment No. 6, which I figure is the remaining one, and I will have a proposal on Report Stage to improve it.  If that is acceptable to Senators, we can discuss it on that Stage.</p></speech>

I am happy to work with the Minister of State and his officials on any amendments he feels may strengthen it and make it more effective.  I should note that the criteria we listed are borrowed from the Law Society's recommendations.  That is where we got the list of what I would regard as sensible criteria.

This improvement in protection for victims of domestic violence has been sought by organisations working with victims.  The former T&aacute;naiste indicated when the Bill was published and on Second Stage that this amendment would be brought forward on Committee Stage.</p> <p>As regards amendment No. 8 put forward by Senator Higgins, the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 introduced access to domestic violence orders to those living together in "intimate and committed relationships", replacing the provision from the original 1996 Act, which referred to those living together as husband and wife.  The intention was to cover unmarried persons of the opposite sex and of the same sex, who were living together but had not registered a civil partnership.  The wording was taken from the definition of "cohabitant" in section 172 of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010.</p> <p>Concerns raised by voluntary sector groups about the suitability of the wording were given careful consideration and it was decided to proceed with the amendment unchanged.  While I would be cautious about changing the wording at this point, I am willing to look at the wording again, if Senators wish, in advance of Report Stage or if time does not allow for that then when the Bill goes to the D&aacute;il.  Perpetrators of domestic violence should not be able to avoid having orders made against them where necessary for the safety or welfare of the applicant by arguing that the existence of a relationship with another person means that the relationship with the applicant was not a committed one and that an order should not be made for that reason.  The Department will examine whether a suitable alternative wording can be formulated to address the issue by way of a Report Stage amendment or when the Bill goes to the D&aacute;il if time does not permit it to be addressed in the Seanad.</p> <p>I note that the Senator proposes to replace the word "committed" with the word "personal".  The advantages of the proposed change are not clear.  The intended meaning of the word "personal" is not clear.  While it is possible for two people to have an intimate relationship of very short duration that is not committed, is it possible to have an intimate relationship which is not personal?</p> <p>I note that while the Senator is proposing to replace "committed" with "personal" in section 5 for the safety order and in section 8 for the emergency barring order, no amendment has been proposed to the same wording in section 6 for the barring order.  For those reasons, I do not propose to accept the Senator's amendments, but I will look at the matter again before Report Stage.  I understand Report Stage might be very soon so the Bill might be in the D&aacute;il before we get time to do that.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State and also the former T&aacute;naiste who was present for the first debate on the Bill for her work on it.  It is important to recognise that violence happens in relationships where people do not live together.  I warmly welcome and will be supporting Government amendment No. 7.  I think that is a very important change.  Senator Higgins has sponsored amendments Nos. 8 and 16.  She had hoped to be here but she is away on official business.  She intended to withdraw amendments Nos. 8 and 16 and she hopes to be here for Report Stage to make a point on the matter.</p></speech>

It shows growing sophistication on the part of the Government.  Relationships nowadays come in many different varieties and quite a few successful relationships, and some unsuccessful ones, consist of a situation where the parties concerned do not live together.  The amendment is a recognition of that and it is a very good thing.</p> <p>I do not know why people are coy about the word "sexual".  It is what lies behind the personal element.  I am sure what is meant is that the persons concerned have a sexual relationship without living together.</p></speech>

The concern is that without the protection of a court order, there is no power of arrest, and therefore in practical terms, no real protection for victims of domestic violence.  It was suggested that undertakings are often proposed as a means of avoiding legal responsibility.</p><p>Having considered the matter in consultation with the Attorney General, I propose to amend each relevant section of the Bill to provide that in all applications for domestic violence orders, where the court is satisfied that the safety or welfare of the applicant or a dependent person so requires, it shall, instead of may, make an order.</p><p>The amendments will make it clear that where a court is satisfied that the threshold for making an order has been reached, it must make an order.  This would still permit the use of undertakings in appropriate cases where the threshold for an order has not been reached, but the court considers that some form of intervention is necessary.  Solemn undertakings can sometimes have a useful role in a case where an order cannot be granted.  For those reasons, I do not propose to accept amendment No. 31.</p><p>It is important that the right balance be struck in the interest of justice and I believe that my amendment is appropriate and proportionate.  In relation to concerns about delaying court proceedings, which are referred to in amendments Nos. 36 and 41, that is not a matter that can be resolved by legislation.  It is a matter for the court to manage the cases before it.  I believe judges are mindful of the needs of victims and the importance of timely decisions.  This is particularly so at District Court level.  The court has the power to direct the proceedings before it.  I would be wary about limiting judicial discretion and directing judges as to how they run their courts.  They are best placed to decide if a respondent is seeking to delay the process and, if so, what action to take.</p><p>As regards cross orders, which are referred to in amendment No. 36, I am aware of anecdotal reports of respondents in domestic violence cases filing cross appeals in an effort to confuse the applicant and the court and distract from, and by implication, discredit the application.  That is an unpleasant experience for the victim.  However, by law, we cannot deny individuals access to the courts.  The courts can and do restrict access to repetitious or vexatious litigants and applicants can apply for an Isaac Wunder order if that is the case.  It is then a matter for the court to decide the <i>prima facie </i>merits of the case and whether the litigant is to be permitted access to court.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy David Stanton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1053"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1053&amp;amp;pid=DavidStanton&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Whether a cross order is granted is also a matter for the courts to weigh and then decide.  Domestic violence is complex, as I have said before.  We must permit in law for access to orders in the small number of cases of mutual violence.  In addition, a statutory bar on cross applications could give rise in a minority of cases to an undesirable "rush to court" situation.  A perpetrator of domestic violence might lodge an application to court, when he or she becomes aware that the victim is about to seek an order, to potentially bar or obstruct the victim&rsquo;s access to the courts.  For these reasons, I do not propose to accept these amendments.</p></speech>

Let us remind ourselves what safety orders are.  A safety order is a court order prohibiting a violent person from doing one or more of the following: using or threatening to use violence, molesting or frightening the applicant or a dependent person and watching or besetting a place where the applicant or a dependent person resides.  The strengthening of the language from "may" to "shall" is entirely welcome.</p> <p>I disagree with the Minister of State on amendment No. 36.  This amendment encompasses arguments made in amendments Nos. 31 and 41 regarding the hierarchy of court orders and conduct of proceedings.  It stops the court from accepting undertakings in cases where violence is being used, where there is a risk of violence and where court orders have been broken in the past.  I support my colleagues across the House on amendment No. 36 but I will not support calls to withdraw amendments Nos. 31 and 41.</p></speech>

I wonder if there is any way of drafting amendment No. 36 to meet the concerns the Minister raised about tying the court's hands in procedural matters.  It seeks to address a really serious issue where respondents are abusing court procedures to delay or prevent the making of orders that would otherwise be made.</p></speech>

Then there is the question of whether the respondent has used any form of violence or if there is a risk the respondent may use violence against the applicant or any dependent children.  These are serious matters, as is the question of allowing the court to have cross orders established in situations where there has been violence.  In each of these related sections of the amendment, it comes back to the crux of violence and the desire to stem violence against vulnerable people and their children. </p></speech>

We have made huge improvements in this area.  We cannot deny individuals access to the courts and that is crucial in the context of amendment No. 36.  We have to be very careful not to put something in that might scupper the whole Bill.  Undertakings can have a useful role where an order cannot be granted and that is why amendment No. 31 is of concern.  I am pleased that the Government amendment is being accepted as it will make a big difference.</p></speech>

The option is left open but it requires compelling reasons.  The court, though, can make the decision so its hands are not completely tied.</p></speech>

A concern has been raised by Barnardos and others that an exception should be made for urgent communication relating to the welfare and care of children.  Amendments Nos. 10, 13, 15, 18 and 29 seek to do this but it is done most neatly in amendment No. 54.  In this amendment the language is tighter and it inserts a new section addressing the same concern.  I support that amendment and ask the Minister to accept it.</p></speech>

I thank them for proposing these amendments, which are designed to ensure that essential text messages, emails or other electronic communications about child access or the sharing of child care decisions, which can be helpful in difficult relationships, are not prohibited where a court otherwise orders that there is to be no electronic contact with the applicant on the part of the respondent.</p> <p>I am pleased to say that section 5 of the Bill already covers the eventuality anticipated by the Senators and a whole range of situations which none of us may have anticipated.  Section 5(3) provides that &ldquo;a safety order may be subject to such exceptions and conditions as the court may specify&rdquo;.  In each of the sections dealing with the five types of order in this Bill, a similar saver already exists.  Therefore, the Senators&rsquo; amendments regarding urgent electronic communications are not necessary.</p> <p>I would also be concerned that the amendments could introduce doubt into the application of the broader provisions allowing the courts to specify exceptions and conditions.  It is my position that there is no need for these well-intentioned amendments.</p></speech>

I would argue that what the Senators want to include is encapsulated by that subsection.  The wording is very broad and gives the court discretion.  It is similar to the point the Senators made earlier.  It is a catch-all phrase which the courts may interpret in any way they wish.  What that means is that what the Senators are trying to achieve is covered by this very broad subsection (3).  </p> <p>There is no need for the amendments, as the point is covered very neatly by this very broad provision.  I ask the Senators to consider withdrawing those amendments as their point is already covered.</p></speech>

It is an issue that has been raised by quite a number of groups and NGOs working with victims of domestic violence.  Women's Aid says that a significant gap in the proposed legislation is a lack of measures to provide for immediate protection in an emergency situation when the courts are not sitting.  It points out that while garda&iacute; may arrest a perpetrator, he will be usually granted station bail within a few hours and a woman, often with children, in the absence of immediate protection, will have no option often but to leave the family home.  Women's Aid has suggested ensuring access through an on-call judge to out-of-hours barring orders service.  That is what all of these amendments seek to do.  </p><p>Amendment No. 19 in my name simply states that an application for an emergency barring order may be made <i>ex parte </i>in certain circumstances and may be made by telephone or electronic means.  I am conscious that the other Senators have sought to achieve the same aim in their amendments.</p><p>I am happy to withdraw my own amendment in the interests of having consolidated support for one of the other amendments.  I hope the Minister of State would see fit to come some way to meeting us on this issue.  </p><p>A related issue was raised by a practising lawyer, to whom I am grateful, who talks about a real problem with bail.  Because of breaches of section 17(1) of the Domestic Violence Act 1986 is a summary only offence, there is no possibility for an objection to bail on grounds that a serious offence may be committed while on bail, because it does not constitute a serious offence.  That exacerbates this problem of lack of access to emergency protection, where somebody has a series of convictions under section 17(1), that still will not be grounds for a garda to object to bail or indeed for a judge to refuse bail, because none of the series of offences will be a serious offence in itself.  That illustrates the problem for individuals, particularly for those in a situation out of hours seeking emergency protection.</p></speech>

I became aware yesterday that there are only ten beds available in women's refuges and I raised this on the Order of Business, as the service in Rathmines is closed.  The service in Tallaght is struggling.  As there is no provision to protect women in their own homes, especially if the they do not have family to whom they can go, and if they cannot flee their home and seek refuge anywhere, to have access to an emergency barring order would ensure that women can remain safe within the refuge of their home and not have to leave the house in the middle of the night because they cannot access a refuge.  This is a simple amendment which states, "On request from a Garda attending a domestic violence incident, a Garda of appropriate rank, can authorise communicating with an on-call judge to apply for an out of hours barring order".  It is straightforward and simple.  Senator Black and I will press this amendment.</p></speech>

The Bill will make a significant difference to women in Ireland when it comes to situations of domestic violence.  I thank the National Women's Council of Ireland, SAFE Ireland and other NGOs that worked with me and my colleagues in the Civil Engagement group and with Senators across the House to advance this Bill.  It has been a co-operative effort and that is politics at its best.  We can see that here this evening.</p> <p>One can see from this grouping of amendments that there is a clear cross-party desire to get a proper system of emergency barring orders in place.  I speak in support of the amendment tabled by Senator Ruane and me.  In essence we are trying to make it as easy as possible for people to get an emergency barring order when they need it.  Throughout the Bill as a whole, we must always remember that we are dealing with vulnerable people in extremely difficult situations.  Our job as legislators is to make their access to justice as smooth as possible.  This is our goal.  Our amendment is similar to amendment No. 26, but the language may be slightly stronger.  If passed we would be happy to work with colleagues across the House on strengthening it before Report Stage.</p></speech>

We know that domestic violence can take place at any time in the day or night, weekend or weekday.  We also know that access to protections it provides can often be poor.  If one is assaulted and then calls 999, one will be told to get a court barring order.  If the assault happens at the weekend, one will have to wait until Monday, sometimes later for access to the courts.  That kind of waiting can often be fatal.  I am reminded of the day we celebrated on Friday.  That delay can cause deaths.  This is not an inconsequential focus on out-of-hours services.  It literally can put people's lives at risk, unnecessarily.</p> <p>The amendments introduce emergency timebound barring orders from an on-call judge, as happens elsewhere to provide people with immediate protections they need.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colette Kelleher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2484"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2484&amp;amp;pid=ColetteKelleher&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The process needs to be simple, accessible and effective.

My colleague's amendment No. 27 has slightly tighter language than amendment No. 26.  "Communicating" is better phrasing than "calling".  This amendment could be strengthened on Report Stage by substitution of "the rank of Inspector or above" for "of appropriate rank".  We ask the Minister of State again to take our ideas and suggestions into consideration.  The delays in people getting access to those protections can cost them their lives.</p></speech>

Offences are repeatedly committed while defendants are out on bail, not only in these cases but in many criminal cases.  This is a growing problem in addressing the world of the criminal.  My amendment states &quot;an application may be made by telephone or other secure electronic means&quot;, and it is important to say secure electronic means.  It also makes it &quot;subject to the applicant&rsquo;s undertaking to swear an affidavit or information&quot; - I put this phrase in which is not in Senator Kelleher's amendment - &quot;before the next available ordinary sitting of the court&quot;.  It shall not necessarily hold things up to any great degree.  Amendment No. 26 also deals with an emergency situation where, for example, there is an incident of domestic violence and a garda is called.  The amendment states:</p><blockquote>On request from a Garda attending a domestic violence incident, a Garda of appropriate rank, can authorise the calling of an on-call judge to apply for an out of hours barring order.  The return date shall be the next sitting day in the nearest available court.</blockquote> <p>That is intended to ensure there is no delay.  I respectfully disagree with my two colleagues.  I think my amendment is at least as equally tight and emphatic but there is the fact that I put it down.</p></speech>

I draw Senators' attention to the emergency barring order provided for in section 8 of the Bill, which I argue is a very innovative provision that allows an applicant with no ownership of a property or a lesser share than the respondent to have the respondent barred from the property for up to eight working days.  An emergency barring order may be granted <i>ex parte</i>, meaning that only the applicant is present for the application.  The interests of justice demand that the court has the opportunity to assess the demeanour of the applicant face to face.  Allowing an email or phone application would not be appropriate or proportionate given the seriousness of the consequences for the person barred from his or her property.  Allowing applications to be made by telephone or email, where it would be difficult to verify the identity of the applicant, could give rise to malicious applications by third parties.</p><p>In cases where there is an immediate risk of harm, I understand that urgent applications for domestic violence orders are dealt with as a priority by the Courts Service.  The Courts Service has advised me that, in most cases, applicants for domestic violence orders are willing to wait until the next court sitting.  In exceptional circumstances, a judge can be accessed out of hours through An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There are two distinct situations in which applications are heard outside normal court hours.  In the first situation, the application is made where the court office is open but the court itself has risen for the day or is not sitting on that day.  There is not always a court sitting each day in each district outside of larger cities.  In these cases, the applicant is asked whether he or she believes it would be safe to wait a day or two until a court sitting is available.  It is reported as rare that the applicant cannot safely wait until the next day.  In some extreme cases, it may be apparent that a delay could put the applicant or dependent children in grave danger.  In these cases, the clerk of the court will contact the judge assigned for the district, or another judge if the first is unavailable, and explain the gravity of the application.  The judge will decide whether it warrants a special sitting.  The Courts Service has reported that it has no record of a judge refusing to sit when requested.</p><p>The Courts Service of Ireland records data on out-of-hours sittings in criminal proceedings but no data are yet available on the civil proceedings for a protection order or an interim barring order at special sittings.  These are the orders that would be sought under this Bill with regard to immediate danger.  I have more notes on this but I believe I have made a substantive point.  I am told there have been a handful of occasions where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has made known to an on-call clerk a potential domestic violence application and on one occasion, a solicitor contacted the clerk directly.  In these cases special sittings were arranged.  There is provision and practice already to deal with the Senators' concerns.  Requests received outside office hours are much rarer as members of the public cannot contact a court clerk directly.  However, in every district, there is a clerk on call to take requests for special sittings from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, almost invariably for criminal matters.</p></speech>

I think out-of-hours calls are rare because they do not happen and there is nobody at the other end of the phone to take a call.  Time is of the essence when somebody is seeking an emergency barring order.  Even waiting until the next morning or until Monday is unacceptable.  Even in the most extreme cases where it could cost lives, if this is the first time that a woman reaches out for help and it is 2 a.m, 3 a.m. or 4 a.m., when she has never done so before, it only takes a day or two of waiting for court proceedings for a person to manipulate and coerce that woman away from what she would have done in that moment at 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. when her life was at threat.  Even waiting for the next day or for a judge to decide whether there should be an extra sitting is not good enough or strong enough.  This amendment provides that a garda of appropriate rank may authorise the calling of an on-call judge.  It is about that communication and not having to wait to make that application or for a court proceeding.  Emergencies have to be addressed when they happen and not two days later.  It cannot ever be put on hold.  The section of the Bill to which the Minister of State refers does not cover emergency out-of-hours barring orders.  The crucial part of this is the out-of-hours provision.</p></speech>

What we are contemplating here is not a situation that can wait for a few hours, a day or whatever period it is.  It is a situation where violence is imminently present and a person, usually but not always a woman, has to be protected.  The other matter is that of bogus calls.  That is why I put down "secure electronic communication".  I assume it is not beyond the wit of members of the Garda to identify themselves in a way that a bogus caller would be unable to do.  While I can imagine a situation where somebody might make bogus calls if he or she wanted to be a nuisance and pester and harass somebody, I believe members of the Garda would be able to identify themselves as such.  Perhaps we could recommend that the Garda gives consideration to a situation where its members can identify themselves as being particular garda&iacute;.  The question of bogus calls is not an insurmountable problem.  They can be dealt with in the rare instances that they occur.</p></speech>

It points to an issue at the heart of the difficulty with our law on domestic violence, which is that it operates at the intersection of criminal and civil law.  Having practised criminal law, I am familiar with the on-call judge system which operates for criminal cases but, as we discussed on the last occasion, a problem with the current enforcement of domestic violence is that very little is prosecuted under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act or under criminal law relating to assault.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The 2014 Garda Inspectorate report, which was critical of the policing of domestic violence generally, raised concerns about high numbers of call-outs but low numbers of arrests.  Therefore, it seems that garda&iacute; are leaving it up to victims.  I do not want to denigrate garda&iacute;, who are doing difficult and important work in policing domestic violence, but a practice has arisen in the criminal justice system where it is effectively up to victims to be prosecutors by taking actions through the civil courts for barring and safety orders when criminal proceedings could actually be brought.  It is not embedded in practice in civil applications to use an emergency or out-of-hours service.  Whether that takes a legislative provision of the sort that we are tabling or there is another way of doing it, there needs to be a clear route of access for victims to get emergency protection during non-court sitting hours.</p></speech>

For the reasons that Senator Bacik outlined, the burden sits with the victim, who may or may not decide to pursue an order or may come under duress in the intervening period.  From Friday night to Monday morning is a long time for someone who is being persuaded by another person of whom he or she is afraid.</p> <p>When there is no such thing as out-of-hours provision, of course the level of activation of out-of-hours services will be lower because it does not exist save for in exceptional circumstances.  I would be happy to work with the organisations in order to provide the Minister of State with evidence of the scale of the issue.  For the reasons cited by my colleagues, it is greater than he has described.</p></speech>

I have dealt with that, as it is important that someone be available in person.  The second issue has to do with delays in emergency or extreme cases where an applicant or children could be in grave danger.  Court clerks are on call and can call the judge assigned and explain the gravity of the application.  The judge will decide whether a special sitting is warranted.  I am told that the Courts Service has reported that it has no record of a judge refusing to sit when requested.  This is what I am advised is happening in practice.</p> <p>Usually, domestic violence applications are heard in the District Court area where the applicant resides, but an emergency application can be heard anywhere in the district.  When construed together, the Domestic Violence Acts and the relevant provisions of the District Court rules provide that, if a judge of the district is not available, another judge can hear the matter, but the hearing must still take place in the district.</p> <p>Requests outside of office hours are rare, as members of the public cannot contact a court clerk directly.  However, there is a clerk on call in every district to take requests for special sittings from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which is called for by the two amendments.  I am told that there have been a handful of occasions in which the Garda has made known to an on-call clerk that there was a potential domestic violence application.  On one occasion, a solicitor contacted the clerk directly.  In all of those cases, special sittings were arranged.</p> <p>Perhaps we need to beef up the knowledge out there of the availability of this approach.</p></speech>

The issue of malicious applications by third parties was mentioned.

In most cases, people are willing to wait until the next court sitting.

It seems to us that the question of eight days for an emergency barring order is not enough.  I suggest that this be extended from eight working days to 28 working days.

Eight days does not seem sufficient to allow the applicant to consider the situation appropriately.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 23 in my name would extend the length of time that an emergency barring order could last from eight working days, which is less than two weeks, to 20 working days, which is effectively four weeks.  We view this as a reasonable extension that does not go too far.  It would provide sufficient protection for the applicant.  The period of eight days is too short.  I ask the Minister of State to consider at least one of these amendments.</p></speech>

It is important that such orders be of sufficient length to provide the protection required.  We need to keep people safe for as long as possible, particularly where children are involved, as they require consistency and security.  No child should be made homeless when escaping domestic abuse.  Extending the length of emergency barring orders is in the best interests of the child.  Ideally, I would like to see orders being extended to six months, but I understand that this is a complex matter and there are constitutional issues involved, in that such an extension would infringe on other rights.  We must strike a balance between eight days, which is a very short period, to as long as possible.  Amendments Nos. 21 to 25, inclusive, suggest various lengths.  I will support amendment No. 23, which seeks to change the period to at least 20 days, but I would like the period to be longer, in particular because children are being placed in a difficult situation due to the insecurity of a barring order of only eight days.</p></speech>

We have given careful and serious consideration to the maximum duration of an emergency barring order.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy David Stanton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1053"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1053&amp;amp;pid=DavidStanton&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It was considered that eight working days, which could amount to 13 lapsed days if granted on the eve of a bank holiday weekend, is appropriate or proportionate in this context.  An emergency barring order may be granted <i>ex parte</i>, meaning that only the applicant is present for the application.<br/><br/>The intention of the emergency barring order is to facilitate those who are not eligible to apply for a barring order or an interim barring order to make arrangements to clear their possessions out of a property and make some interim arrangements for alternative emergency accommodation.  I am of the view that given the emergency nature of the order and its consequences for the respondent, to allow it to be renewed for a total period of up to six months would be disproportionate and may give rise to constitutional difficulties, especially if such renewal was permitted on an <i>ex parte</i>basis.  For these reasons, I am uncomfortable with these amendments and I propose not to accept them at this stage.  <br/><br/>However, I am willing to consider the matter further, maybe before the D&aacute;il Stage.  I am not sure if we have time on Committee Stage to do it but I will consider it further in consultation with the Attorney General to ensure that the duration of an emergency barring order specified in the Bill will enable appropriate protection for applicants without unjust or disproportionate consequences for respondents.  <br/><br/>I am looking at bringing forward amendments to this if possible and proportionate.  Senators may be aware that the duration of an interim barring order granted <i>ex parte</i>under the Domestic Violence Act 1996 was limited to eight working days by the Domestic Violence (Amendment) Act 2002.  This arose from the Supreme Court decision in the case of D. K.<i>v.</i>Judge Crowley, where the Supreme Court held that constitutional justice requires the setting of a limit of relatively short duration on an interim barring order granted <i>ex parte</i>.  There is already constitutional case law around this.  Senator Kelleher is actually right in her concerns about this.  <br/><br/>It is considered that eight working days, which on the eve of a bank holiday weekend could be as long as 13 days elapsed time, is a reasonable duration for an emergency barring order.  Given that the grant of an emergency barring order will have serious implications for the respondent, it was considered prudent to provide that the duration of the emergency barring order will be consistent with an interim barring order granted <i>ex parte</i>.  It is understood that the courts and legal practitioners appear to be at ease with this eight day provision.  We just have to be careful here.  </p></speech>

I am not sure whether this would fail a constitutional test because it is a renewal.  It is not extending the initial order.  It is just renewing the order.  I suppose it is a moot point but it probably would have to be examined and dealt with in court.  It does seem to me that this is a good idea because it indicates a situation where there is a transition from the first situation which is an emergency situation.  The court can then consider whether it is wise to extend or renew this situation.</p></speech>

We are actually saying that an owner of a property can be barred for up to eight working days or maybe 13 working days by using this innovative emergency barring order.  This is very new.  It is innovative.  The advice I have is that eight working days is something one could work with.  If we go beyond that we are talking about property rights.  A constitutional challenge is not just a theoretical consideration.  If successful, a constitutional challenge could negate the anticipated benefits of the innovative provision of an emergency barring order.  We could lose the whole lot if we go too far.</p> <p>What I would like to do here is to provide for the eight days.  Let us see how it works in practice.  It is very innovative and new.  Senator Norris's argument about it being renewed in fact is the same, it is an extension.  It is another way of saying up to six months in total.  Let us tread carefully.  This would give people an opportunity to move their possessions out of a property.  In other challenges we have seen property rights reign supreme.  We have got to be very careful.   Let us put in the eight days which could be 13 days.  That would allow somebody them to move their possessions out and get some breathing space.  I would be very slow to accept this amendment.

I am prepared to look at it again if possible and appropriate.  However, I think we are really pushing the boundaries here.  I do not want to run the risk of losing the whole thing through a constitutional challenge.  There is too much to lose.</p></speech>

I accept that there has been a threshold set around the eight day limit.  However, I am really concerned about the best interests of children in this situation and urge the Minister to be willing to look at the interface between the balancing of rights.  There is the balancing of constitutional rights but there is also the balancing of the rights of children to be safe and secure; there is a need for consistency for them.  The amendment I am supporting is amendment No. 23 because that is the best of the pick here.  It will be up to my colleague Senator Bacik whether she presses it tonight or withdraws it resubmits it. It is that whole interface with children, and the general issue of children in those situations, that I want the Minister to particularly take some stock of.</p></speech>

I agree with the Minister.  It would be open to challenge in the higher court.</p></speech>

Clearly it is very welcome to see this provision in place.  I see that section 8, subsection (16) specifically states that no further emergency barring orders shall be made against the respondent on behalf of the same applicant until a month has elapsed after the last day of the period of eight working days.  However, there is a proviso there that a further emergency barring order may be made within the one month period where there are exceptional circumstances.  I am happy to withdraw my amendment No. 23 and to work with Senator Kelleher and others to see whether we can strengthen that provision.  I can see there is within that some scope for taking account of the best interests of the children which is the real concern as Senator Kelleher has expressed.  A lapse too soon of an emergency barring order might leave children exposed to danger.  I see there is a provision in subsection 16(b), I think, if I am reading it right, for a further emergency barring order to be made within one month of the expiry of the eight days.  That does give some room for manoeuvre.  It does go some way to addressing the concerns we have all expressed in putting forward this group of amendments.  I happy to withdraw my own amendment No. 23 at this stage and to look again at whether that meets the concerns we have or whether it needs further amendment.</p></speech>

There is no provision for them at all.  It is worse than useless.  It is a typical Irish situation where one grants a barring order but there is no provision for the welfare of the children whatever and they are then just left hanging.  The amendment wanted to ensure that, "the court consider the safety and well-being of any children and take measures."  Therefore, the court would then have to ensure the welfare of any such children.  </p><p>The amendment continued, "Provide for the availability of experts to the courts", which is the provision that creates the expense.  The amendment further continued, "to assess the risk the perpetrator poses to children and the impact on them of direct and/or indirect abuse".  Again, the provision is very important.</p><p>The last part of the amendment states, "Establish a national system of Child Contact Centres to facilitate post-separation contact for children of victims of domestic abuse that ensures and protects their physical and psychological well-being".  I think that is what we all would like to see.  I am very sorry that the amendment has been ruled out of order.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-11-28a.434" nospeaker="true" time="14:30:00" ><p>Government amendment No. 35:</p><p>The purpose of this amendment is to provide for a statutory requirement for courts to give reasons for decisions relating to applications for orders under the Bill.

SAFE Ireland recommended that the reasons for making or not making an order under the Domestic Violence Bill and for making it subject to conditions, if any, should all be recorded by the court and a copy of these reasons should be made available to each party with the minimum of delay.

This amendment proposes to insert a new section into the Bill to require courts to give reasons for decisions to grant or refuse applications for orders, including reasons for a decision relating to exceptions or conditions to which an order is subject.

The question of whether the District Court should be required to give written reasons for decisions was considered earlier this year in the course of debates on the Criminal Justice Act 2017.  Section 9 of the Act has introduced a requirement for courts to give reasons for bail decisions, but does not require written reasons for bail decisions.  This is because written decisions are not the norm in the District Court and the volume of work involved in implementing a requirement for written reasons could be considerable.  It would have cost implications and, more importantly, could entail delays in the processing of cases before the court.  As all District Court proceedings are recorded on the digital audio recording system, in circumstances where clarification of the reasons given is required or is in dispute, there will be a record of the proceedings. 

For the same reasons, I would not favour requiring written reasons for decisions relating to applications for orders under the Domestic Violence Bill.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 35 mentions reasons but not written reasons.  Amendment No. 35 also states:</p><blockquote>(a) to grant or refuse the application,<br /><br />(b) if applicable, to make the specified order subject to exceptions or conditions, and<br /><br />(c) to vary the exceptions or conditions referred to in <i>paragraph (b)</i>.&rdquo;.</blockquote> <p>We will look again at the area around amendment No. 6 and will try to improve that.  I probably should have asked Senators to withdraw the amendment.  However, I felt at the time that we would accept it with a view to amending it and that is what I suggest that we would do.  I am prepared to bring forward an amendment to amendment No. 6.  Amendment No. 35 is a different amendment and I have not looked at any conflict.</p></speech>

This is provided for in section 16 of the Bill. </p> <p>The District Court rules, Order 59, Rule 10, states that copies of domestic violence orders shall be sent to the applicant and respondent by ordinary pre-paid post.  In most cases, service by post ensures that the applicant does not have to have contact with the respondent. </p> <p>It should also be borne in mind that the orders provided for in this Bill are civil orders.  As such, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not normally involved in serving these orders.  I do not propose at present to depart from this long-standing situation. </p> <p>I might come back with a further comment later.</p></speech>

For example, if the person to whom the order is sent claims not to have received it and so on, it could be made sure of by a garda actually producing the order, waving it and telling him, and it is usually a him, that this order has been granted.</p> <p>The amendment includes the qualifying clause, "The views of the applicant for a safety or protection order shall be sought by the Garda&iacute;, when deciding whether the Garda&iacute;, should or not serve the relevant orders".<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It seems to me that it adds in quite a substantial point.

There are cases where a person might try to evade the service of an order and create a delay.  There is a role for a member of the Garda to personally serve the order.  In this group, I will be supporting amendment No. 39.  This amendment clearly states the circumstances in which a judge may order that if a respondent is likely to evade receiving service of a domestic violence order, the order may be served by a member of the Garda.  It is for cases where a person may seek to evade it, that is, exceptional circumstances, and it gives the judge the scope to allow that.</p></speech>

SAFE Ireland suggested that section 22, which allows applicants for orders to be accompanied in court by a person of their choice, including a support worker, should be amended to allow a particular accompanier to be replaced if there is opposition to the continuation of an individual in that role, on a reasoned basis.  It is proposed to amend section 22 to clarify that the court can refuse to allow the applicant to be accompanied by a specified person at any stage of the proceedings in case a difficulty arises with an accompanier during the proceedings.  The amendment also makes it clear that the ground on which a court may refuse to allow accompaniment by a specific person is that it would not be in the interests of justice for the individual concerned to accompany, or continue to accompany, the applicant.  The court will be required to give reasons for such a refusal.</p> <p>SAFE Ireland has also suggested that section 22 be amended to allow for accompaniment of applicants in interim barring order and protection order applications as well as in safety order, barring order and emergency barring order applications.  As it was the intention that all applicants can be accompanied if they so wish, the amendment will clarify that section 22 will apply to all applicants for orders under the Bill.  The definition of the term &ldquo;applicant&rdquo; in section 2 includes all applicants for orders under the Bill.</p></speech>

I agree with the Senators that a breach of a domestic violence order is reprehensible.  While I appreciate the purpose of the amendment, I am concerned that unintended consequences detrimental to victims could follow from this amendment.  Orders granted under this Bill are civil orders and the threshold of proof in cases is on the balance of probabilities.  This is not as onerous as the threshold for criminal cases, which is beyond reasonable doubt.  In addition, orders are granted in most cases in the summary jurisdiction of the District Court.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy David Stanton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1053"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1053&amp;amp;pid=DavidStanton&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is a very real concern that if the possible consequences for the respondent are up to five years in prison, an appropriate fine or both, this could have a chilling effect in respect of the granting of orders.  Respondents would be expected to contest the cases more vigorously, and in the interests of the justice courts may be less inclined to grant orders.  This would be to the disadvantage of victims.  </p><p>I should mention that the same concerns were highlighted by the Law Reform Commission in its 2013 report on aspects of domestic violence which examined the issue of the appropriate penalty for the offence of contravening an order under the Domestic Violence Act 1996.  Therefore, I do not propose to accept this amendment.  I request that Senators take what I am saying very seriously and not push the amendment.</p></speech>

As I said, there is a concern that prosecutions for breaches of barring orders and so on often involve people who stack up convictions for such an offence, yet because none is a serious offence they cannot be denied bail if charged with a further offence on the basis that they may commit a serious offence.  </p> <p>There is a valid concern about the time limit for service of a summons in respect of a minor offence because these are not indictable offences.  I take the Minister of State's point; there may be another way to deal with this issue which involves a change in policing practice and charging people under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, in particular the aggravated version of the offence which will be provided for in amendment No. 47b.  There are other ways of dealing with the difficulties.  </p> <p>I wish to acknowledge that practising lawyers on the front line and NGOs have pointed out the practical difficulties arising from the fact that a breach of these orders is only a minor offence, and I take the point of the Minister of State as to why this is so.  It is worth highlighting the practical difficulties which arise in cases where a respondent has a cumulative series of convictions for breaches of barring orders, none of which is serious on an individual basis but perhaps more serious charges should have been pressed.  It is more of a policing issue.</p></speech>

The section provides that where criminal proceedings are brought for contravention of an order under the Bill, it will be an offence to publish or broadcast any information or photographs which could lead to identification of the victim or the person charged or a dependant of either of them.</p> <p>It was brought to my attention that the definition of "publishes" is drafted so broadly that it could criminalise any innocent mention of a case, including the accused person&rsquo;s identity, by the complainant to anyone.  This could merely be an email or text message to a relative or friend in the course of ordinary private correspondence, such as a message saying that, &ldquo;John&rsquo;s trial for breaking the barring order is on tomorrow&rdquo;.</p> <p>Having looked again at the definitions of "broadcasts" and "publishes" in section 33, I agree that the current definitions are too broad for the intended purpose of the section.  It is not the policy intention to criminalise private conversations.  The proposed amendments aim to make it clear that only public communications will come within the scope of the offence.</p></speech>

We had a very good debate on this.  Having considered the points made by Senators on Committee Stage, I am proposing this amendment.  I agree that behaviours in a domestic setting which involve emotional abuse, humiliation and fear can be as harmful to victims as physical abuse as they are an abuse of the unique trust associated with an intimate relationship.</p> <p>The provisions of the new offence have been carefully drafted in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.  Senators will appreciate that to be effective and enforceable, a criminal offence needs to have a clear definition.  For that reason, the new section proposed by this amendment seeks to define coercive control as clearly as possible.</p> <p>The offence will be committed where a person knowingly and persistently engages in behaviour which is controlling or coercive, which has a serious effect on a relevant person and which a reasonable person would consider likely to have a serious effect on a relevant person.  A person is a relevant person in respect of another person if he or she is the spouse or civil partner of that other person, or is or was in an intimate and committed relationship with that other person.</p> <p>The new section goes on to define what is meant by "serious effect".  A person&rsquo;s behaviour has a serious effect on a person if the behaviour causes the person to fear that violence will be used against him or her or if the behaviour causes serious alarm or distress which has a substantial adverse impact on the person&rsquo;s usual day-to-day activities.  I commend the amendment to Senators and I look forward to hearing their views on it.</p></speech>

It is truly groundbreaking.  I congratulate the Minister of State and his officials for listening and considering the issue.  He was sceptical and could see a lot of difficulties, but he was persuaded.  I am delighted the Government has listened to the arguments made and has come back with such a comprehensive amendment in the area of coercive control.</p> <p>We all know domestic violence is not always about a broken arm or a black eye.  Women, in particular, although not exclusively, have suffered for years, but this was not recognised as abuse.  It is vital that we recognise in law that psychological abuse does happen.  According to SAFE Ireland, one in three women in Ireland have experienced psychological violence from a partner at some point in their lives, a startling and arresting statistic.  A law against coercive control was recently introduced in the UK.  It is a significant problem not just in Ireland but all over the world.  The Bill will be much stronger because of this amendment and amendment No. 47b.</p> <p>I again thank the Minister of State and his officials for taking the time to carefully consider the issue.  I would like to pay tribute to all who were involved in progressing this, especially the inspiration and doggedness of Dr. Evan Stark.  I would add one minor concern about the penalty.  Like everything else, I would it to be more severe at up to ten years rather than five.  It is great to be present for a debate in which this offence is named and recognised.</p></speech>

I congratulate the Minister of State.  I see him blushing from afar.  It is fully warranted in this instance because, as Senator Norris said, this very important, welcome and critical amendment shows the influence and contribution of the Seanad when passing legislation such as this.  The congratulation and commendation of the Minister and his officials are worthy.</p> <p>I want to extend congratulations to Senator Kelleher for her dogged determination on this issue during previous debates on coercion.  I am sure the amendment will be very much welcomed by NGOs and stakeholders present in the Gallery, as well as those watching from afar.</p> <p>Having spoken briefly with Senator Clifford-Lee about the remarks of the Minister of State, I wish to seek some clarity.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2477"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It may have been only a mistaken turn of phrase on the part of the Minister of State, but he referred to an "intimate and committed" relationship.

These are all important provisions for victims of domestic violence.</p></speech>

It is important to acknowledge the importance of the amendment.  There are as many situations of coercive control as there are women who have been subject to it.  It can last years and it can be extremely subtle.  There is such an abuse of power as well as manipulation and gaslighting.  I have met many narcissists who literally spend their time trying to undermine everything a woman is as a person and who use every vulnerability a woman has against her.  This amendment goes a long way to acknowledging how entrenched control and manipulation affects women, for the most part, and men as well.  It has a lasting effect and it can take many years to get over the traumatic experience of being controlled and manipulated in that way.</p> <p>I thank the Minister of State on behalf of myself and all the women I have supported over the years for acknowledging these matters in the legislation.</p></speech>

It is important to tease out these matters.  When I was Chairman of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality we had some hearings on this issue and they involved some colleagues here.  Again, they were persuasive.</p> <p>Officials from the Department and the Office of the Attorney General have done considerable work on this over the summer.  The term "and" is in the proposed legislation.  However, I am prepared to look at it again to see if it is the most satisfactory wording.  We have looked at this carefully.  The suggestion is that we use "or" instead of "and".  I believe there are issues around that.  I will not go into them now but I will certainly take this issue away and have a look at it to see whether we can improve it.  We have been advised that the current wording is the most suitable wording.</p> <p>I have taken on board the comments of Senators to the effect that this is an important and ground-breaking amendment.  Let us hope it will make a big difference to the people who need the kind of support the legislation will hopefully give.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-11-28a.535" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017112800002#DDD01100"><p>This amendment arose out of our debates last time.  It is an important amendment.  I have tabled the amendment taking account of the concerns raised by Senators regarding sentences where violent offences are committed against a person's spouse, civil partner or person with whom he or she is in an intimate and committed relationship.</p> <p>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that where offences involving physical or sexual violence are committed in a domestic violence setting, that fact shall be an aggravating factor at sentencing.  The relationship is key in this regard.</p> <p>The list of relevant offences in the provision includes already long-established offences of violence and sexual violence.  Non-fatal physical violence is captured by offences under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997, including assault, assault causing harm, causing serious harm, threats to kill, coercion, harassment, endangerment and false imprisonment.  Sexual offences, including sexual assault and rape, are relevant in domestic violence situations as well.</p> <p>I hope that the proposed amendment to provide for aggravating factors in sentencing for offences committed in a domestic violence context will address the concerns expressed by Senators on the effects of such behaviour.</p> <p>I am aware that the Femicide Watch report of 2017, recently published by Women's Aid, reports that data on the Irish criminal justice system suggest the system is less severe for men accused of killing their current or former partners than it is for men accused of killing other persons.  Women's Aid has recommended that when offences, including physical violence, violence resulting in death, psychological and sexual violence and stalking, are carried out by a current or former partner or spouse, then the intimate relationship should be considered an aggravating factor when it comes to sentencing.  This would acknowledge the unique position the offender was in, including the fact that the offender had intimate knowledge of and access to the victim and so brutally betrayed that trust.</p> <p>The new sentencing provision will apply to any offence that involves violence or the threat of violence to a person.  The amendment covers manslaughter, harassment and coercion.  It will ensure that aggravated sentencing will apply where a person is convicted of the manslaughter of his or her current or former partner or spouse.  The amendment will not affect sentencing for the offence of murder because a conviction for murder carries a mandatory life sentence.</p></speech>

The provision includes where the offence is committed against a former or current spouse.  It goes on to add in other elements where the offence is committed, for example, in the presence of a child.  There are various others elements but I will not list them all because I know we all want to get on with the Bill.</p></speech>

The offence under section 3 of the 1997 Act, assault causing harm, is an offence that may, in more serious cases, be subject to trial on indictment in the Circuit Court and is an arrestable offence.  Section 4 provides for the most serious category of assault, that is, causing serious harm, with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.  It would be imprudent to distort the continuum of seriousness provided by sections 2, 3 and 4 of the 1997 Act.</p> <p>Section 32 of the Bill provides for a power of arrest without warrant for breach of a domestic violence order on receipt of a complaint by or on behalf of the person who applied for the order.  An assault of the type covered by section 2 of the 1997 Act would usually constitute breach of an order and so would be arrestable as breach of the order.</p> <p>I note that, with regard to powers of arrest generally, almost all the offences under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 are arrestable offences.</p> <p>As regards the time limit for the bringing of charges under section 2, the six-month time limit for prosecuting offences applies to offences that can only be tried as summary offences.</p> <p>Section 2 of the 1997 Act is intended to deal with assault in its most minor form and, for that reason, it can be prosecuted summarily only.  To extend the period for prosecuting an offence under section 2, as proposed by the amendment, would be a disproportionate departure from the intention of the Oireachtas to provide for the swift administration of justice, except of course where there are compelling reasons to do so.  I do not believe that it would be appropriate to significantly extend the timeframe for bringing prosecutions against individuals who are accused of an offence under section 2 unless there is justifiable cause.</p> <p>The second, and perhaps more pressing issue with this amendment, is the fact that it would extend the period for prosecuting all offences of assault under section 2 and not only those that relate to incidents of domestic violence.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy David Stanton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1053"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1053&amp;amp;pid=DavidStanton&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->While the intention is understandable, this is an overly broad amendment for this Bill, which is focused on domestic violence.</p><p>As regards aggravating factors, the short answer to the Senators&rsquo; proposal is that courts will have the power to take a wide range of aggravating factors into account when it comes to sentencing and, in practice, do take account of many factors.  However, it could be counter-productive to set down in an Act of the Oireachtas a list such as that proposed by the Senators in their amendment.</p><p>Aggravating circumstances for criminal offences are not usually listed in statute.  It is primarily a matter for individual judges to identify and determine what are the appropriate aggravating factors to be taken into account in determining a sentence in a particular case in line with the jurisprudence of the Irish courts.  The courts have recognised that the aggravating and mitigating factors of sentencing regarding the particular offence should be identified and applied by the sentencing court.  The courts have a duty to pass an appropriate sentence in each case, having regard to the particular circumstances of that case, not only in regard to the particular offence, but also in regard to the particular offender.  Where a person is convicted on indictment, the Director of Public Prosecutions may apply to the Court of Appeal for review of a sentence she regards as unduly lenient and, in that case, can raise issues regarding aggravating circumstances.</p><p>In providing an exhaustive list, as in the Senators&rsquo; amendment, all other aggravating factors will be excluded.  Given the complexity of domestic violence and the inexhaustible capacity of human beings to devise new ways of being cruel to each other, particular cases may in the future give rise to other aggravating factors.  These could not be taken into account if the Senators' amendment was on the Statute Book.  The new section to be inserted by amendment No. 47b will ensure that where offences involving physical or sexual violence are committed in a domestic violence context, that fact shall be an aggravating factor at sentencing.  As the aggravating factors in the Senators&rsquo; amendment would apply to all offences under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 and not only domestic violence cases, such a wide-ranging amendment to that Act would not be appropriate to be dealt with in this Bill.  Again, I ask the Senators not to press this amendment.  I do not propose to accept it.</p></speech>
