As all of us will know from the work she did on behalf of survivors of abuse and her establishment of the Aislinn Adolescent Addiction Centre, she worked tirelessly.  It was sad to hear of her passing.  I wish to express my condolences and those of the Fianna F&aacute;il group in the Seanad to Christine's husband Donal and their children, Darragh, Conor and Cliona.  I hope she has now found rest.  I also hope we do not forget the work she did to improve services for children, improve the way we look after people who have been abused and ensure that such terrible events will not happen in this country in the future.</p><p>I wish to comment on the Order of Business for today and this week.  I do not direct my criticism at the Leader, but it is pathetic that we are having statements on a Bill that has not even been introduced.</p></speech>

Tomorrow we are scheduled only to discuss Strait&eacute;is 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge 2010-2030 and a Private Members' motion, and there is no business on Thursday.  The blame for this situation should not be laid at the Leader's door.</p><p>With regard to the level of business in the Oireachtas, which comprises the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, I remind Members that since January - the turn of the year - only one Bill has been published and introduced by Government.  Last week in the D&aacute;il there were three days of statements, which will be continued this week, and no legislation, which is no way to run the Oireachtas and Parliament.  I put the Leader on notice now that I know what is going to happen later in this term.  We will have a glut of legislation and we will have Ministers acting like the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, who published and introduced six Bills in the last two weeks of the last term, and it was only with the Leader's intervention that we were able to ensure that there was proper debate and scrutiny of the legislation.  I am not making a party political point.</p> <p>This is a political point about the operation of the Oireachtas.  I understand from officials that no further legislation will come to either the D&aacute;il or the Seanad until the end of March.  It is a joke.  We will have a situation in which the Leader will be under pressure in this House, the Taoiseach, the Chief Whip and other Ministers will be under pressure in the D&aacute;il, and we will have the most prevalent use of the guillotine to shut down debates in the D&aacute;il.  I thank the Leader for not allowing that to happen to the same degree here in the Seanad.  I will conclude on this because this is a matter for the Cathaoirleach's office too.</p><p>Neither House sits next week due to the St. Patrick's Day celebrations.  I understand that and it is fine.  Our Taoiseach and Ministers have an important role to play abroad.  What have we got the following week and the week after that?  It is a joke, and we have been saying this.  Last week we endeavoured to seek debates on some important ministerial orders.  We in the Seanad will have to stand up for ourselves with regard to moving the legislation that is on the Order Paper, which Members from all parties here have produced.</p></speech>

I met her at a wedding last August.  Her passing is very sad.  She should be remembered and respected for her contribution to Irish society and the way she stood up for people who were abused in our society.</p><p>On a more positive note, I welcome the decision made by D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council last night.  By an overwhelming majority it decided to accept the business improvement district scheme and have it introduced in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  We have talked about the fate of rural towns on a number of occasion in the House.  Many people do not realise there are areas of urban Ireland, of which D&uacute;n Laoghaire is one, in which there has been a serious number of business closures.  One third of the main street of D&uacute;n Laoghaire is boarded up; therefore, it is great to see that the business community has agreed to the initiative proposed.  I would welcome a review of the business improvement district scheme.  Perhaps we might have a debate on initiatives that could help small towns that are struggling.</p></speech>

The Government is not intent on introducing any real reform of the House.  It will tinker with the university seats and leave it at that, which is unacceptable.</p><p>I also extend words of sympathy to the family of Christine Buckley.  I did not know the family, but I have met her daughter.  Christine was a very remarkable woman.  She had a toughness which she certainly needed to sustain her campaign.  In later years certainly, she was a very sharp dresser.  She was a glamorous and remarkable woman.  We should also remember the part played by the late Mary Raftery in making Christine's story known.  She was a very remarkable television person.  </p><p>Yesterday the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, made a very important statement in Cork on fluoridation.  He announced that an international panel of experts would be established to inquire impartially into the question of fluoridation.  I know that Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan has raised the issue consistently in the other House, but we have also raised it in this House.  It was raised here after I had unearthed John Gormley's suppressed report on the scientific evidence.  The Minister made a commitment to do something about the matter and he has now lived up to his commitment.  This is a good day for Seanad &Eacute;ireann because we all did our job in raising this major issue in the public arena.</p><p>Yesterday marked the 55th anniversary of the invasion of Tibet by China.  Traditionally, Ireland has held a most honourable position on Tibet.  Although Frank Aiken was responsible for introducing Red China to the United Nations, he insisted on the independence of Tibet, a decision which has never been reversed by either House of the Oireachtas.  Naturally enough, the Department of Foreign Affairs, now the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, slid away and nastily accepted the absorption of the remarkable country of Tibet.  It is different from China in ethnicity, race, religion, geography, approach to life and everything else, but look at the devastation China has wreaked on it.</p> <p>If I may finish this - I feel very strongly about it - it is important that people like the Dalai Lama be supported, because they show a peaceful way and a way of respect for the environment.  At the moment those in Tibet are not even allowed to learn their own language.  There are appeals from schoolchildren to be allowed to learn their own language.  Some 126 people have burned themselves to death.  I am ending on this, a Chathaoirligh, and I am very grateful to you for your gracious indulgence.  I learned yesterday that the spouse of one of these people who immolated themselves - I think it was a husband of a woman who was a nun - is being charged with her murder.  He did nothing.  This utter disrespect for human rights and for the rights of the Tibetan people, their culture, their identity and their religion should be discussed.  I ask the Leader if we can please have a debate on Tibet.</p></speech>

I am talking about what our colleagues in the US Senate discussed all of last night, which was climate change, in an effort to get people to stop laughing about it, as those on the Government benches have just done, and to take the issue very seriously.  We have a day on Thursday with nothing to do, so why not open up on Thursday and emulate our colleagues in the US Senate by having a full-scale debate on climate change.  We have seen the effects of climate change in recent weeks and months, with extraordinary weather patterns causing flooding, damage and devastation throughout the country.  We have seen strange weather patterns in previous years also, with very cold weather during the winter and very warm weather last summer.  This is causing huge damage to society and it is causing worse damage in poorer parts of the world.  We have an obligation to emulate our colleagues and to look at what they are doing, and we have a free day when we should be working.  If we had an all-day debate on climate change we could move that debate forward, and perhaps parliaments around the world will copy the example of the US Senate and have that debate.  It would be a worthwhile way of spending our day.</p></speech>

We thought we had some respite on reading newspaper reports on Friday that the intergovernmental agreement on which these industrial wind farms were predicated had fallen through, but it has led only to greater anxiety and distress.  Families are having feuds, neighbours are not talking to each other and communities are split down the middle.  That is wrong and it need not happen.</p> <p>We can produce renewable energy on a sustainable and socially acceptable basis for our own needs and to create jobs and a secure energy supply with a proper and balanced portfolio.  However, what we were told and guaranteed by the Department, Minister, developers and State agencies was that if there was no agreement with the United Kingdom, these wind farms would collapse and evaporate.</p></speech>

The Minister said the economist must be taken seriously.  He was correct in the past when nobody else was.  If the Central Bank were to make contact and gain access to some of the data underpinning the professor's speech, it would be helpful.  This is my experience having had Professor Kelly as a student some time ago.</p><p>During the period in which the Irish banking system was laying the seeds for the destruction that followed in 2008, namely, between 1998 and 2005, it increased lending by &euro;192 billion, of which 1% went to manufacturing and 0.5% to agriculture.  Some 81.5% was for personal lending, real estate and financial intermediation.  ISME has warned that because property-obsessed banks lent to the small and medium-sized industries on the basis of property, they face the Armageddon that Professor Kelly has drawn to our attention.  We need banks that have an interest in manufacturing and agriculture and they need to stop creating property bubbles.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Finance to come to the House to speak about a new banking system that is based on the productive capacity of the economy and not on property bubbles?  Professor Kelly has issued a warning on a property bubble and I am delighted the Minister is taking it on board.</p></speech>

I support the call for a debate on the comments of Professor Morgan Kelly because the matter is serious.  Some 95% of all working people are employed in small and medium-sized enterprises.  If what the professor is saying is true, it must be heeded.  Considering that there was a debate on this for an hour and a half, what was in the news represented only pinpoints.  I would like a full debate on the matter to get to the bottom of what the professor is saying.  This is the right place to have such a debate because the House has been noted for having good debates.</p><p>  A Senator referred to the fluoridation of water.  I believe an article in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> stated the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, has agreed to a review by international experts.  I would like a new and full debate on this.  If there is to be a review, we want to be sure we have the facts.  Some 15 years ago, as a member of South Dublin County Council, I tabled a motion on this subject.  I do not use fluoridated water and had to import a contraption from the United Kingdom that removes the fluoride.  I was not prepared to take the chance.  However, privileging emotion over facts can sometimes be inadvisable.  I am not a scientist and do not know the facts but I like to err on the side of caution.  We seek a rational analysis.</p><p>  I look forward to the debate on renewable energy; that is all I will say about that.</p></speech>

We were told the midlands project was totally for export, and now that it seems to be dead in the water we are told it will go ahead anyway.  The people of Ireland and I have lost trust in both those organisations.  There is a clear conflict of interest which is causing this serious problem.  Yesterday politicians called Mr. Frank Flannery's position untenable because of perceived conflicts of interest while at the same time we have Mr. Brendan Halligan, a Government lobbyist and a consultant with Mainstream Renewable Power, peddling wind and hot air to the Government and not concentrating on any other aspect of green energy.</p><p>Last night I attended a meeting of Roscommon and Mayo Protection, RAMP.

I have no doubt that the Government will commission a health report on e-cigarettes.  Where is the report which has been commissioned on the effects of electric and magnetic fields associated with 400 kV lines near people's homes and their back gardens in which their children play and near playgrounds?  The Government  does not want to hear that there is a possibility that overhead 400 kV lines will endanger lives.  The politicians who told us that the midlands project was designed for the export of wind energy need to come into this House to tell us, if it is designed for the export of wind energy only, why consideration is being given to going ahead with it, as it makes no sense.  The reason we need to know is we have lost faith and trust in EirGrid and the wind energy sector.</p></speech>

In a similar vein, Professor Morgan Kelly, in his very interesting views on potential negative impacts on the SME sector, to which the Minister for Finance has responded, has indicated that Irish universities are no longer able to give a young person a good education at a reasonable cost.  He has said that in his experience, when the country was apparently awash with money, growth in the university sector did not take place in academia but in administration.  He has indicated that many of his colleagues in his department left UCD to take up more lucrative offers abroad and that administrators now outnumber lecturers by two to one.  I call on colleagues in all parties to agree that the Seanad should facilitate a proper committee-style debate on the future of third level education.</p> <p>It should be done without preconditions or preconceived notions about how best to fund and structure the sector.  It could be the first of many debates on various subjects and we should be in a position to call experts before us to give evidence.  This House is supposed to be a forum that permits deeper and more considered analysis of matters.  Perhaps the Leader might consider my suggestion which I would be happy to discuss further with him.</p></speech>

The Government has allegedly already given upwards of &pound;1 million to the centre and plans to give more.  I ask the Leader to arrange a discussion with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht on our education, archaeology, architecture, inland waterways, walled towns, landscape, hearts and souls.  That is what our Irish heritage is.  The budget for the Heritage Council has been cut from &euro;22 million to &euro;5 million.  Did everyone hear the list I recited?  I am speaking about our hearts and souls, what future generations of children will touch and feel of the history of the country.  I am grateful that the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has taken up the suggestion Senators made last year to provide &euro;5 million towards creating jobs in the heritage sector.  We could upskill people in the construction industry to restore beautiful old buildings.  The Taoiseach spoke about giving &pound;1 million or more to the Irish world heritage centre in Manchester, but I am here to speak about Irish heritage centres in Ireland.  Giving &euro;5 million for them is an embarrassment.</p><p>  Senators David Norris and C&aacute;it Keane spoke about fluoridation.  Now that we are charging citizens to be self-medicated through the water supply, can we have another debate on the matter?  There is more science on the subject.  We are charging citizens for water, but we are pouring in fluoride.  I have no problem if we want to put fluoride in toothpaste or with using salt which people can choose to ingest, but this matter should be debated in the Seanad.</p><p>  I am embarrassed for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  He made a brilliant announcement on wind energy generation last year, but it has now fallen to pieces.  We should think carefully and ensure everything is in place before making such public announcements.</p></speech>

Last Friday the United Kingdom withdrew from discussions on progressing the memorandum to an intergovernmental agreement.  That has caused confusion in local communities because the previous Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources advised the public that the expansion of the grid was necessary to advance the export of wind energy.  As there is now no agreement on exporting wind energy, there is no market and there will be no wind farms.  The question that now arises is whether EirGrid will be allowed to spend almost &euro;4 billion of the taxpayers' money to build a grid that is no longer necessary.  Communities across the country have been so outraged and upset by EirGrid's proposals that 35,000 people made submissions to the company.  Will these communities get an answer to this question or will we continue in the vein of talking from both sides of our mouths?  I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister to come to the House to provide clarity on this issue.</p></speech>

I know we will have a discussion on it this afternoon but I would like to hear what is happening at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and what the Government's proposals are.</p><p>It was interesting to hear Senator Naughten speak about education.  We have spent a lot of money investing in education over the years but I refer to a more recent development, namely, the national induction programme for teachers which I believe is a real problem for us.  We have educated a fairly large number of teachers who have received degrees and qualifications after four years.  Many of them could not get a job so they have had to go somewhere to get one, including Canada, Spain and elsewhere.  The Teaching Council requires that one must become fully qualified which means one must attend something like ten weekend courses.  Someone in Spain, Canada or elsewhere trying to earn a living must come back here to attend courses.  As far as I can see, these courses having nothing to do with education but with handling things such as what one does if one comes in late for work.  </p><p>We must recognise the situation of students who qualified, got their degrees and thought they were fully qualified teachers but who have not been able to get a job in Ireland and have to go somewhere else.  Now they cannot become fully qualified because of a new qualification insisted upon by the Teaching Council.  I think it is called a newly-qualified teacher programme.  We must find some way to resolve that.  I will write to the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, with the details of that but it is something the Leader could also raise with the Minister.</p></speech>

Her bravery in bringing institutional abuse to the fore must be admired by every Member of the House.  She succeeded in helping so many deal with it over the past number of years.</p><p>I support the call for a debate on the fluoridation of water.  As I travelled to the Seanad this morning, I heard two so-called experts on radio.  I was deeply concerned that as a result of the utterings of one of them, many people would be quite worried about the health of their children.  The sooner we get some experts to come to this House to put the record straight on the dangers or otherwise of the fluoridation of water the better.  </p><p>We had a debate on the situation in Syria and the Central Africa Republic recently but given that we may have some time available to us in the coming weeks, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Gilmore, or the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, should come to the House.  The reports emanating from Syria in recent days are that the Syrian armed forces are using the starvation of civilians as a weapon of war and that people are being starved into submission.  In recent days, the director of the World Food Programme said the agency would need &euro;309 million between now and May and that food aid operations were cut by 20% in March due to budget shortages.  An even greater humanitarian crisis is emerging in Syria.</p><p>The United Nations is starting a formal inquiry into human rights abuses in the Central African Republic.  There are reports of genocide, serious atrocities and human rights abuse there.  It would be appropriate for us to keep this issue very much on the agenda of Seanad &Eacute;ireann and for the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Gilmore, or Minister of State, Deputy Costello, to come to the House as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

I refute that as someone who was a Member during that period and during the final three years of the rainbow coalition.  I do not have a recollection of such a lack of legislative business in the first three months of a year.  I cannot, nor do I not wish to, point the finger at the Leader.  He can only deal with the legislation that comes from the other House and very little is coming from there.  However, will he continue to encourage Ministers to initiate legislation in the House?  We have a proud and long record of initiating legislation here.  The more far-sighted Ministers take legislation in the House first because they know it will be dissected and analysed in a much more timely and non-contentious fashion than in the Lower House.</p><p>  I assume Senator Mary Ann O'Brien was not referring to an either-or scenario in respect of the funding of the Irish Heritage Centre in Manchester.  I do not think she meant there should be funding here instead.  I echo her complimentary remarks on the opening of the heritage centre.  I know not only the centre but also many of the principals involved, particularly Michael Forde from Mayo, who has been the leading light on a project that goes back 20 years, which successive Governments have sympathetically supported.  In practical terms, the &euro;1 million mentioned was allocated several years ago.  This is a great day for the Irish in Manchester.  The original site for the heritage centre was toxic and it was in the ownership of Manchester City Council, but such was the strong influence of the Irish community in the city that the council handed over the site on which the centre will be developed <i>gratis</i>.  It is a wonderful achievement and it is a testament to the work of Michael Forde and his hard-working committee.  I hope the Government will continue to support this project.  The fact that the Taoiseach was present yesterday says a great deal about that.</p><p>  Will consideration be given to a debate on wave energy in the overall context of energy policy?  The reason I raise it is that the<i> Irish Independent </i>has again highlighted an issue with fracking, as it did last week.  It devoted two pages yesterday to the potential for wave energy and the significant investment that is being made.  Will the Leader consider debating a report published by committee C of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, of which I am proud to be a member under the chairmanship of Deputy Jack Wall?  The report focuses on the potential of wave energy and it issued to both the British and Irish Governments in the latter part of last year.</p></speech>

Then again, a little passion is no harm.</p><p>I have just come from the Mansion House, where the Neurological Alliance of Ireland launched a survey it carried out entitled &quot;Living with a Neurological Condition in Ireland&quot;.  It will make grim reading for Members and I ask all of them to read it because it contains important findings which have a bearing on everybody suffering with a neurological condition.  Will the Leader arrange a debate on the survey and on the progress of the implementation of the national neuro-rehabilitation strategy, which is due to be published?  A group comprising all stakeholders was set up and an executive and clinical leaders were appointed.  They are working on the implementation of the strategy, but it has been going on for a long time.</p> <p>It is time to push on with this strategy.  There is so much in this report and the strategy to be discussed that we need a stand-alone debate.  It is not enough to say that the Minister will be coming in here next week to discuss another issue.  If he is coming in to discuss one issue we cannot divert him and bring up what we want to bring up.  Let us have a stand-alone debate in due course. </p></speech>

I welcome it.  I learned with regret this morning of the passing of Christine Buckley.  She was a courageous and tireless campaigner on behalf of the victims of institutional abuse.  She was inspired by a fight to get justice for the people wronged in these places.</p><p>In July 2012 when we debated the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Bill she was in the Visitors Gallery.  I was happy then to have the opportunity to meet her because I said at the time that what happened in these schools was Ireland&rsquo;s Holocaust.  The schools were nothing short of concentration camps where innocent children were beaten, raped, tortured and abused.  What happened to children in those homes stayed with them throughout their lives and continues to affect the survivors and their families.  There are thousands of them here and abroad.  I have met them living on the streets in London.  I know a victim who walks the streets in my own town.  He has never been right.</p><p>It took Christine Buckley 15 years of counselling to be able to come forward in 1992 and speak publicly of what happened to her.  It took another couple of decades for the Ryan report to acknowledge what happened to these victims.  There is no form of public acknowledgement of this, no display or memorial.  There is nothing.  These industrial schools covered the country, from Letterfrack to Clonsilla, from D&uacute;n Laoghaire to Glen.  They were all over the place yet we do not acknowledge them.  It is high time we had a debate on this.  Will the Leader invite the Minister for Education and Skills, who I believe is responsible for this, to have a debate on this issue and acknowledge these schools?  Let us open them up, and show them up for the concentration camps they were, like Auschwitz.  Let us not keep putting our heads in the sand about this. </p></speech>

The cooperation between Manchester City Council and the Irish community is wonderful.  It was great that the Taoiseach was there yesterday.</p><p>Much has been made of the recent commentary by Morgan Kelly about our SME sector and the stress testing of our banks to happen later this year. </p> <p>It was prudent of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, to have the Central Bank examine the underlying data used in connection with his speech at UCD.  I find myself much closer to the views of the Governor, Mr. Honohan, on stress testing.  I believe the outcome will be mild and tolerable and that we should not get excited.  Let us remember that the SME sector has suffered like every other sector.  Now it is a few years on and the banks are largely restructured at this stage.  I do not think there is any reason to get into a sweat about the SME sector and the banks.  It is vital for the State and the taxpayer that the banks end up profitable and that the SME sector survives so that the economy will thrive.</p></speech>

I welcome yesterday&rsquo;s announcement by the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, of a &euro;15 million allocation to bring vacant local authority houses back into use.  Local authorities must submit their proposals by 28 March, which is not a long time away.  It is expected that the fund will bring approximately 500 houses back into use and create jobs in the building and green energy sector in local communities.  It is good news for local authorities and, in particular, for those on the long waiting lists for local authority housing.</p><p>As a former sportsman and one who is interested in sport of all descriptions, I acknowledge the contribution made over the years by Brian O&rsquo;Driscoll to rugby in this country.

It is an incredible initiative that will follow on the success of The Gathering and will bring to the world stage the beauty of the landscape and scenery we have in this country.  We have unspoiled, charming and spectacular countryside.  There is no reason the Wild Atlantic Way could not be at the same level as the Camino in Spain and other spectacular walks throughout the world.  Cycling, hiking, walking, running and outdoor sports are a phenomenal tourism product that is growing at a rapid pace.

She was a remarkable and courageous lady and I express my condolences and those of the House to her family.</p><p>On legislation being introduced in this House, as I have said on numerous occasions, I can only play the cards that have been dealt to me.  Legislation is very slow in coming to this and the other House, as can be seen if one looks at what is being discussed in it.  I will relay Members' concerns and have already relayed mine about the flow of legislation.  When it eventually comes - l do not see it coming before the end of this term - I have no intention of rushing it through the House for any reason, unless it is emergency legislation.  The system is not working.  I mentioned some weeks ago that there was a need for a whole-of-government approach.  Departments are pushing their legislation, as are the parliamentary draftspersons, and I am aware that the Taoiseach raised the matter at the Cabinet recently.  It is a source of concern and a matter that must be addressed.  As I mentioned, the Taoiseach is also concerned by the lack of legislation.  Senator Aideen Hayden mentioned the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  Senator Feargal Quinn and the Cathaoirleach have mentioned that the committee will not meet to discuss these matters until 26 March, but a number of proposals have been made.  I submitted the Government's proposals last week to the office of the Cathaoirleach and we will discuss the matter on 26 March.  </p><p>Senators David Norris, Michael Mullins and others raised the issue of the fluoridation of water and the fact that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, intended to set up an expert panel on fluoridation.

I have great respect for their endurance and will call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to debate the issue in the House.</p><p>Senator Colm Burke raised the matter of the drafting of legislation.  I will raise the matter with the Government Whip and he, in turn, will raise it with the Attorney General.  The matter is being and needs to be examined.  </p><p>Senator Thomas Byrne spoke about climate change.  We can certainly have a debate on the issue in the House.</p> <p>However, I certainly have no intention of meeting through the night.  Actually, I believe it was Senator Byrne who mentioned the nonsense of meeting through the night only a few weeks ago and I would go along with the Senator in that regard.  We can have a debate on the issue but not through the night.</p><p>Senators Whelan, Kelly and Landy raised the issue of wind farms, but there is a matter for the Adjournment tabled for this evening on that issue as well as a Private Member's motion to be debated tomorrow.  In that context, I do not propose to pre-empt what the Minister will say on the matter.  Senator Barrett referred to the Minister for Finance's response to the recent comments of Professor Morgan Kelly.  I believe the Minister responded in a correct and diligent manner on the subject.  The Minister for Finance was in this House last week and Senator Barrett contributed to the debate with him.  However, only ten Senators contributed to the discussion with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on the Action Plan for Jobs.  We can certainly invite Ministers into the House but when debates are requested we must fill those time slots when the Ministers set aside time to come here.  </p><p>Senator O'Donnell spoke about the need for increased lending by the banks to the SME sector.  Again, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation was in the House last week to discuss the Action Plan for Jobs, but we can certainly ask the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, to come in to discuss the issue of lending to small businesses.</p></speech>

Our next public consultation will be about human rights but I will speak with Senator Naughton privately to discuss her ideas in that regard.  Perhaps we can organise such a debate later in the year.  Senator O'Brien referred to the opening of the heritage centre in Manchester, as did several other Senators, and I am sure everybody here welcomes the Government's support for that development.  I would be very surprised if the Government's contribution to heritage projects in Ireland amounted to only &euro;5 million.  I will invite the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan, to discuss Irish heritage.  The Minister was here last week discussing one of the matters raised by Senator O'Brien - namely, our inland waterways.  We will ask the Minister to come in to discuss the other matters to which the Senator referred.  I do not know whether Senator O'Brien contributed to the debate on inland waterways last week.</p> <p>Senator Quinn asked when the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, CPP, meeting will be held.  I note his points made about the courses organised by the Teaching Council and the difficulties for teachers working abroad in attending them.  I will bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for Education and Skills.</p><p>Senator Mullins raised the conflicts in Syria and the Central African Republic.  As he pointed out, we already had a debate on them but a further debate is needed.  The use of starvation of people as a weapon of war is despicable.  I am sure the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade will be called before the foreign affairs committee to address these matters.</p><p>I agree with Senator Mooney about initiating more legislation in this House.  The Government has committed to having 50% of legislation initiated here.  I understand there are two Bills to be introduced in the next couple of weeks but they are both commencing in the other House.  We will keep this matter under review.  He also called for a debate on the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly report on wave energy, which we can consider if we can get a Minister.</p><p>Senator Moloney raised the recent survey on neurological conditions by the Neurological Alliance of Ireland and called for the implementation of the national neuro-rehabilitation strategy.  I will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister for Health.  It should be discussed by the Joint Committee on Health and Children.</p><p>I note Senator Heffernan&rsquo;s points about industrial schools.  Some of the points he made I agree with but others may have been a little over the top.</p><p>Senator Paul Coghlan raised the recent remarks by Professor Morgan Kelly, as well as the subsequent remarks by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, on the outcome of a banks stress test.  The outcome will be important not alone for the banks but the country and small businesses.</p><p>Senator Brennan welcomed the allocation of &euro;15 million to refurbish local authority houses that have been closed.  This is long overdue and the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, should be complimented on getting that allocation.  There are far too many local authority houses boarded up while there are many people looking for such accommodation.  Senator Brennan also lauded the rugby career of Brian O&rsquo;Driscoll.</p><p>Senators Conway and Comiskey raised the Wild Atlantic Way and other greenway projects in their counties.  They called on the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to address this matter.  I will invite him to the House for an overall debate in tourism in early course.</p></speech>

When it is enacted, the Bill will reform arrangements for the election of six Members of the House by institutions of higher education in the State.  While I welcome the opportunity to present draft legislation in this form, today's debate is not about what I have to say.  I am more interested in what the Senators have to say.  Last month I sent the Cathaoirleach a copy of the general scheme for the consideration of the Seanad, and I am here to listen to the views of Senators.</p><p>At present three Senators are elected by graduates of the National University of Ireland and three by graduates of the University of Dublin, Trinity College.  The general scheme is an early but important part of the legislative process to implement the 1979 amendment to Article 18.4.2&deg; of the Constitution to extend the right to vote to graduates of other colleges and universities.  It will create one constituency with six representatives elected by the institutions of higher education in the State.  It is estimated that up to 800,000 people will be entitled to register under the planned reforms.  When the present arrangements were established in 1937, the National University of Ireland had 9,000 electors and Trinity College had 3,400.  At the 2011 Seanad elections a total of 151,000 voters were on the combined registers for the two university constituencies.  The reforms represent a significant expansion of the electorate and will make the election more democratic.  The implementation of this constitutional provision could have been done at any point since 1979.  The Government is now taking action to implement the will of the people.</p> <p>The approach being adopted is for a broad definition of institutions of higher education to be applied in order to include universities, institutes of technology, and other higher education institutions and private colleges in the State.  In publishing a legislative proposal in draft form in this manner, the Government looks forward to a public debate on its contents.  As well as being discussed here today, the general scheme has been forwarded to the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht for consideration.</p><p>It says something about the diversity of third level education in Ireland today that my Department has identified 81 different colleges and universities to which a copy of the general scheme has been sent.  Written submissions have been invited from these institutions.  In addition, submissions have been invited from citizens and from any other interested individuals or groups.  There is a deadline of Friday, 11 April 2014 for the receipt of submissions and all those received are being published on my Department's website.  Some members of this House have already set out views on the issues addressed in the general scheme in the context of the three Private Members' Bills on Seanad reform published by Senators in 2013.  I acknowledge the work of Senators in presenting those Bills.</p><p>In parallel with the consultation process that is now under way, there are practical issues that will need to be addressed in order to implement the planned reforms.  Aside from questions of policy, the modalities of voter registration and the running of elections will give rise to particular administrative challenges, especially given the scale of change to the electorate that is envisaged.  To progress work on these matters I have established a technical working group comprising departmental officials and nominees from stakeholder bodies.  This group, which met for the first time last Friday, 7 March, will make observations on operational matters, including in respect of the creation and maintenance of a register of electors and the administration of elections in the new Seanad constituency, and issues of cost arising from the implementation of the proposed new electoral arrangements.  The technical working group, which is chaired by my Department, includes nominees from the Department of Education and Skills, the National University of Ireland and Trinity College.  The Irish Universities Association, Institutes of Technology Ireland and the Higher Education Colleges Association, which represents a number of private colleges, have also been invited to nominate a representative to participate.  I have asked the technical working group to report back to me by May of this year.</p><p>Today's discussion is about the general scheme before us and it might benefit proceedings if I briefly outline its main provisions.  The Bill proposes to amend the Seanad Electoral (University Members) Act 1937.  There are eight heads.  Head 1 is the standard initial section of a Bill.  Head 2 provides for the election of six members in a newly-formed Seanad institutions of higher education constituency and defines the term &quot;institution of higher education in the State&quot;, which is used in the Constitution.</p><p>Head 3 provides that a person who has been awarded a degree or equivalent qualification recognised through the National Qualifications Framework from an institution of education in the State will be entitled to register.  In practice this would be the equivalent to what is known as a level 7 qualification in the framework.  Head 3 also provides that the award must be validated by an awarding body in the State.  Head 4 provides that there shall be one register of electors for the constituency and that the register shall be established and maintained by a registration authority designated by the Minister.</p><p>Head 5 deals with technical provisions related to voter registration following on from other sections of the Bill.  Head 6 provides that the Minister shall appoint a returning officer for the constituency.  Head 7 makes provision for new arrangements for the nomination of candidates to bring them more into line with reforms made in respect of other electoral codes.  Head 8 makes provision for an alternative arrangement for the filling of casual vacancies based on the replacement candidates list system that operates for European Parliament elections in Ireland.</p><p>Having described the provisions of the general scheme, I look forward to hearing the views and ideas of Senators.  It is open to any Member to make a written submission in addition to making comments here today.</p></speech>

This is a gratuitous act of revenge against the universities, because it simply will not work.  I said a couple of weeks ago in the House that the only way it could work was if the Taoiseach was prepared to be generous and gracious and give some of his powers of appointment away to create a larger constituency.  I said at the beginning that I felt this would be very difficult to work because there might be up to 500,000 people entitled to register, but the Government now says the number is 800,000.</p> <p>Let us just look at this; it is complete nonsense.  What we propose is quite acceptable and we all spoke about it when the Government was doing sweet damn-all about activating this reform.  The Minister was not a bit bloody interested in reform but now cannot wait.  Let us see what the effect will be, however, because he is not reforming the whole Seanad but just doing a little bit to gratify the Government and get at the people who speak out openly in this House.  We will have 800,000 people electing six members, 1,000 electing 43 and one person electing 11.  Is that what the Minister calls democracy?  If so, I was quite right to say he is a hypocrite.  While I like him personally, I do not like hypocrisy.  This is the greatest bit of bloody hypocrisy I have ever seen in my life.  It is matched by several other elements in this Bill.  The general scheme states, "As a consequence of having a model based on a single constituency, no graduate would have more than one vote in the election of members by the institutions of higher education."  Come on, now.  What kind of eejits does the Minister really think we are?  This is not necessary.  The Bill is not necessary to achieve that objective.  I am glad the Minister is looking embarrassed and picking his lip.  He is quite right to because he has left intact the fact that the political people will still be left with six votes each if they have a graduate degree.  There are five votes for the parties.  Those concerned are saying they are desperately worried that somebody with a degree from both Trinity and UCD might have two votes but do not give a rattling fart for the fact that there are five votes on the political panels.</p><p>As far as I am concerned, this scheme does not take into account Northern Ireland or graduates abroad.  What is the meaning of the franchise section?  Are we now to be run by the bureaucracy?  What happened to representative democracy?  The Minister does not give a sugar about it.</p><p>I am staying on merely to hear my colleague, Senator Barrett, on whose time I hope I have not trespassed.  I regard this as the most contemptible piece of blatant hypocrisy.  The Government will get nowhere with it.  The public will not be fooled and will accept only real reform.  The entire Seanad must be reformed instead of this tinkering around.</p></speech>

Speaking in County Sligo on the day after losing the referendum, the Taoiseach said "We know now that like the all-Ireland final, it is not going to be replayed so we have to deal with the question of how you make a Seanad effective."  I have my all-Ireland ticket from that fixture.  Our side won.  Normally it is the winning team whose captain gets to make the speech but the Taoiseach is trying to introduce a scheme whereby the captain of the losing side gets to make a speech.  This is ironic given that he would not debate the issue before the Senate referendum.</p></speech>

He is now to seek revenge on the Independents, the five of us who defeated five political parties, namely, Fine Gael, the Labour Party, People Before Profit, Sinn F&eacute;in and the United Left Alliance.  That was a major achievement.  Why did we succeed in that?  It was because we provide the vital checks and balances and, strictly, that is what a second Chamber does.  That is what the Government is trying to eliminate.  I have from the European Economic Review of 2010 an article stating, "we show that bicameralism improves the accountability of legislators in the electorate where the same party controls the two chambers".  That is what the Government is trying to do away with.</p><p>I have tabled 328 amendments.  Nobody will move such amendments when the political parties take over the seats because we will not have the money or resources to canvass 800,000 people.  That is what the Minister is at; it is still the same power grab.  The checks and balances that are so vital cannot be in place if this scheme is implemented.  We must oppose the monopoly of ideas, which is what bicameralism is designed to correct.</p><p>The whipping record in this House is appalling.  The Government whips people time and again.  If we do not move the amendments, it never will.  The procedure will be in secret such that an effort will be made to persuade the Minister at party meetings.</p> <p>That is not good enough in the type of democracy we need so badly in this country.</p><p>The filling of casual vacancies under head 8 is the abuse practised in the European elections and we referred to it recently.</p></speech>

It is the worst aspect of the abuse of democracy in European elections.  The general scheme proposes to extend this malpractice and abuse to this House.  It really is a disgrace.  Why does the Government have no ideas on reforming the Taoiseach's 11 nominees, the local authorities' 43 seats or the fact Independent Senators are recruited by political parties?  Senators Coghlan and Bacik have joined political parties.  Our whipping system means this is the end of their independent voices.</p></speech>

We are entitled to make this speech because the Government side lost out.  I am delighted to make the winning captain's speech, unlike the Taoiseach using Croke Park analogies in his.  We found young people are totally alienated from the political party system because it is run more rigidly than anything by Mr. Stalin or any other enforcers of the party Whip system.  This is one set of people the Government had better address and it is not doing so today.</p><p>A total of four fifths of the other Chamber wanted to abolish this Chamber, and it tells one something about the low standing they have in their constituencies that the majority of people voted to keep it.  In Dublin working class constituencies, where every Deputy wanted the House abolished, we won handsomely with more than 60% of the vote.  The Government ought to consider why it has alienated working class people so much.</p><p>My colleague, Senator Norris, referred to the absolute anger this measure has found among our graduates in Northern Ireland.  We are the only part of the Oireachtas for which people who reside in Northern Ireland have a vote.  A referendum was held to deprive them of this vote and they had no vote in the referendum.</p></speech>

The leader of Fianna F&aacute;il, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, asked me on the day of the count in Dublin Castle how on earth the "No" people won Donegal.  It was because our supporters in Northern Ireland got their friends, hotels, grocery shops and the man who gives one a bag of potatoes over the hedge when one is on holidays in Donegal to vote "No".  I am sure this shocked the Government to the core.  We want to have better relations with Northern Ireland, and President Clinton referred to it only last Friday.  To throw out of the Oireachtas the only constituencies where a substantial number of Unionist people have voted and made a very valuable contribution to the House seems particularly short-sighted.</p><p>This is the same power grab by sore losers who would not accept the verdict of the people last October.  It will weaken the Seanad.  Now the Government will really invent a Seanad which I will vote to abolish the next time because it will be crowded out by Fianna F&aacute;il light against Fine Gael light and the Fianna F&aacute;il reserves against the Fine Gael reserves.  When we are not here to move vital amendments, which I have done 328 times, they will not be moved.  The existing power structures, the permanent government, the public service, the Cabinet structure and the inner circle of Ministers will have even fewer checks and balances, and as the Minister knows very well, this is not for what the people voted.</p></speech>

A consultation process is now open, which I welcome, and it will close on 11 April.  I ask everybody to make submissions to it and, as the Minister said, he is here today.  We have had many debates on this matter.  The Minister has taken notes.  Obviously, one cannot do everything in one day.  I admire the Minister for what he is doing today.  There is much more to be done but one cannot do everything in one day.  A consultation process is open and the general scheme of the Bill has been referred to Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht, which will debate this further.  People are invited to make submissions on how a university panel could be more inclusive in the future, and I welcome that.</p><p>One suggestion I would make is that we could replicate in legislation Article 33 of the Free State Constitution and establish a cross-party or non-party system for the representation of important interests and institutions in the country, but that is a matter for another day.  It is reasonable to suggest that we have it within our collective power to make many changes.  I admire the Leader of the House who has made some changes, including inviting people in to address this House.  This House was established to represent different voices in the community and it is open to us to do that.  We have already started to put that into practice.  Legislation is not needed to do everything.</p><p>It has been suggested that the estimated eligible electorate for the new enlarged constituency for the Seanad will be 800,000.  The electorate for the university seats in 2011 was 151,399 and the Minister has also given figures.  The possible ways this will change the dynamics of the university system has been shouted down here because it will take more people to elect a candidate but many more people will have a vote.  We can note the percentage of the people who have a vote in the university system and when it was established and that franchise will now be extended to include the Institutes of Technology.  More than 73,000 in this year alone applied to the Central Applications Office, CAO, and all of those now will be included in the electorate.  We have a highly educated workforce.  Restricting the vote to the NUI electorate only recognised one educational system but now most of the educational systems or, as the Minister said, 81 colleges will be included.  That is a huge step forward.   It is estimated that 800,000 will be entitled to register under the planned reforms.  This is a more reflective figure in regard to third level education in Ireland today.  All third level institutions will be given the recognition they deserve.  Students pay the same fees in all third level institutions.  Students are educated to the highest level in all institutions, be it institutes of technology or universities.  The system was elitist and discriminatory but this Bill will change that.</p><p>The Seanad was established to get people from a spectrum of backgrounds involved in our political system to reflect a variety of experiences and sectors and the institutes of technology reflect a varied variety of experiences.</p> <p>These include all types of education and not solely what is known as academic education.  I would support the further extension of the franchise, but we cannot do everything in one day.  I am sure the Minister will be back after the consultation has concluded.  In addition to the national qualifications authorities, other bodies may also grant awards and degrees.  The existence of 81 different educational establishments represents a significant step forward in higher education.</p><p> In 2013, Professor John Coakley conducted a wide-ranging study on the system of Seanad election.  He made reference to the 1979 constitutional amendment, which was passed by a huge majority.  Citizens have been waiting 35 years for that decision to be implemented.  The process of implementation is finally starting today with public consultation.  In regard to the debate on the unrepresentative nature of university representation, Professor Coakley found significant differences between the two universities.  In a paper on the topic, he stated: <blockquote>The NUI electorate broadly reflects the distribution of the Irish population, though with a stronger Dublin bias (this accounts for 31 per cent of the electorate, as compared to 28 per cent of the overall population).  In the earlier years, the Dublin share was rather higher.  The proportion resident outside the state, 3 per cent, has been shrinking over time.  The University of Dublin, perhaps not surprisingly, lives up to its name in having a much stronger Dublin orientation (47 per cent of the electorate). [...]<br /><br /> It is likely that getting qualified graduates to register for Seanad elections poses a considerable challenge, especially in the NUI, where the electorate has not kept pace with the growing pool of graduates.  This no doubt reflects the university&rsquo;s own diverse structure[.]</blockquote>The Minister will have to ensure there are sufficient staff to address this challenge.  All of us are familiar with alumni who do not bother to keep in touch with their former universities or to keep their addresses updated.  All university and institute of technology graduates should ensure they have provided up-to-date information so that they can vote when the election is held.  However, not everybody goes to universities or institutes of technology.  Perhaps one day we will recognise other skills, such as mechanical skills, and all of the educational bodies.  One educates the mind, the body, the soul and the hand.  All spheres of education should be taken into consideration.  The educational system should help to develop an all-inclusive society in which everybody has a vote.  I realise that we are trying to introduce reform without holding another referendum, but perhaps we will find in the future that we have to go down that road.</p><p> I will not rehearse all of the recommendations contained in the 11 reports on Seanad reform.  The Minister has taken them on board, however.  This is the first step in reform but, after 35 years, it is a good step.</p></speech>

He has returned to the House unbowed from his visits prior to the referendum, but I have not been able to figure out his personal views on the future of the Seanad.  I mean this as a compliment to his Chinese traits of inscrutability.  We are now presented with the heads of a Bill to extend the franchise in Seanad elections.  I am bemused by those on the Government side who are lauding this wonderful initiative and saying that after 35 years it is wonderful the Government is doing this wonderful thing.  It raises the question of why successive Administrations did not implement the 1979 constitutional amendment.  Through various Governments of different hues and colours, the matter was never on the radar.</p> <p>I have to be somewhat cynical in my response to this latest initiative that it perhaps might not have been taken by this Administration but for the fact the people took a decision last autumn.  Senators Zappone and Quinn, who are in the House, should continue to bask in the reflected glory of that wonderful democratic achievement.  Has the Government been brought kicking and screaming to the table in regard to this initiative in that it had to be seen to be doing something in response to the people's decision last autumn?  That then begs the question as to why previous Administrations did not bother implementing this.  Despite the fact the Minister has set up a technical working group to look into the ramifications of the decision taken by the Government, does he have any views on how this will pan out?  </p><p>The Minister referred to expanding the electorate for the university seats from 150,000 to 800,000 as a challenge.  I think that is under-stating the reality of the situation facing this Administration when it comes to setting the parameters and logistics of dealing with this initiative come the next election as 800,000 is a lot of people.  The Minister said this will make it more democratic but I am not so sure.  I am sure the university Senators will outline what the turnout has been, notwithstanding the fact Senator Keane quite correctly identified a problem of registration in that many people ignore the requests to update their addresses, etc.  That means a considerable number of third level graduates do not participate in the election.</p><p>On the positive side, if all 800,000 people vote, although they will not, it means that there will be very few households in this country which will not be aware of the impact of the Seanad elections in that a voting form will be sent to quite a significant number of households.  That must be a good thing from the point of view of the profile of the Seanad in that more people will empathise with it and with what it does.  </p><p>One of the main issues which arose prior to the referendum was that people did not empathise with this House.  There is a variety of reasons for that not least - I return to my favourite theme - the continuing studious ignoring of the workings of this House by the major media organisations.  The only time they come to this House is if they think something exciting will happen, such as the Government being defeated on a motion, as it was recently following Senator Quinn's initiative.  The press Gallery was agog with excitement and anticipation but we rarely see members of the press.  I appreciate they watch the proceedings of this House on their monitors, so I am not suggesting for one moment that they must be physically present to pick up on things.  However, what annoys me about the printed and electronic media is that they tend to ignore the legislative programme this House pursues on a daily and weekly basis, notwithstanding our remarks on the Order of Business today about the lack of same currently, but I suggest that is only a temporary aberration.</p><p>What I find very frustrating is that Senators on both sides prepare their contributions and Ministers who come to the House testify on a regular basis how impressed they are with the standard of debate and the manner in which Senators go about their business and yet much of this is ignored.  If I was to make any plea, it would be to the print and electronic media, especially to &quot;Oireachtas Report&quot; on RTE with which I have taken issue on more than one occasion, that on the odd occasion, they would look beyond the banter on the Order of Business and take extracts from some of the main business in the House as it pursues its legislative role.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources Deputy, Rabbitte, said on one occasion that &quot;Oireachtas Report&quot; was watched by drunks and insomniacs because of the outrageously late hour at which it is transmitted. </p><p>How does the Minister envisage making this election with an electorate of more than 800,00 more democratic?</p> <p>It will impose an enormous cost on candidates.  Will a free leaflet, litir um thoghch&aacute;n, be sent to every voter courtesy of the Government, as happens with general elections?  That is essential and that would have to be done.  The Government will have to bear that cost because otherwise it will make a fool of the concept of democratisation of the Seanad election in this instance.  If one of the major obstacles to members of the public putting themselves forward for election to the six university seats is finance, there will be nothing democratic about that.  That would be similar to the American model and that would mean that those who have the most money will be able to run in elections because there will be no cap on expenditure.  Currently, there is no such cap.  While there are regulations governing how and where candidates procure money and how they spend it, there is no cap on the amount they can spend.  There will be a cost.  Will we end up with a two-tier system?  I am treading on dangerous water but university graduates might have more money in their pockets than those who have not attended university.  There must be a larger percentage of graduates and there could be a two-tier system under which those with the most money win the seats.</p><p>My second concern relates to the branding of the new seating arrangement.  Since the foundation of the State, the NUI and, in particular, TCD have been an integral part of the electoral process under the old Seanad and the new 1937 Constitution.  There are reasons for this.  Both the Cumann na nGaedheal Government and the Fianna F&aacute;il Government that succeeded it in the 1930s must have felt there was a value nationally to having a TCD brand.  Senator Barrett and others during the lead up to the Seanad referendum referred to what they believed to have been the cutting off of the franchise from those of a Unionist persuasion on this island.  I am again a little concerned that if the brand disappears under the new arrangements, this may lessen rather than strengthen the ties between the Unionist community in the North and the rest of the island, which would be detrimental to the ongoing relationship between the South and the North.</p><p>There has been a great deal of criticism of the fact that while the institutions in the North are working and the institutions in the North and South are working effectively together and there is a strong rapport between Ministers on both sides of the Border, when one filters down to ordinary life, citizens are experiencing an increasing ghettoisation of Northern Irish society.  More peace walls have been built since the Good Friday Agreement than prior to it.  It is becoming increasingly difficult rather than less difficult to reduce this ghettoisation according to people who operate on a cross-community basis to whom I have spoken.  In other words, Nationalists are shopping and socialising in their own community while Unionists are doing the same.  This is an issue that both Governments must face.  I wonder if the TCD brand is abolished whether there will be less input by those of a Unionist persuasion into southern Irish politics than might the case if it was retained.</p><p>I acknowledge this is a complex issue and many questions still have to be addressed about how election to the university seats can be made more democratic.  It is a huge challenge for the Government parties.  Having taken the step they have taken, how will they see it through?  It is vitally important, whatever system is agreed on by the technical group, that additional expense is not placed on candidates who put themselves forward for the university seats and that the Government will take steps to ensure the election is resourced.  The Minister referred to setting up the register of electors and the process.  It is essential that no financial obstacles are put in place of those who wish to put themselves forward as candidates.</p> <p>It is essential that no financial obstacles are put in the way of the candidates who wish to put themselves forward.  The Minister, as a Deputy, is not expected to canvass an electorate of 800,000.  Under the current system, we are not expected to do it in order to be elected.  I do not see why this burden should be placed on people in order to satisfy some public perception, or so the Government can be seen to do something in response to the people's decision of last year.  It is not enough simply to put a spin on this and to do it as a PR exercise.  It involves serious thought on how it will pan out.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-03-11a.289" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1148" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="17:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014031100026#Z00200"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House, particularly to debate this important issue.  I am delighted we have the opportunity to debate the general scheme of the Bill to extend the university franchise at this early stage.  It is a welcome change to our normal processes and I hope we will see plenty more of this because it gives us a real opportunity to make an input and give the Minister our ideas on changes or possible amendments to the legislation.</p><p>We have been waiting 35 years for this Bill.  The people voted to change the Constitution in 1979 and successive Governments have failed to deliver the reform the people voted for then.  I am delighted this legislation is before us, particularly in the wake of last October&rsquo;s referendum whose result is that the Seanad be maintained.  I campaigned with Democracy Matters and others to retain it.  I am also very proud to speak as one of the Senators elected by Dublin University graduates, an electorate of 50,000.  These are Irish citizens resident in the jurisdiction of Ireland, Northern Ireland and all over the world.  I think I sent my litir um thoghch&aacute;n as far afield as the Pacific Islands to at least one graduate who is an Irish citizen registered there.</p><p>Many of Senator Mooney&rsquo;s comments were very constructive on the complexity of this legislation, and the logistical complexity of rolling out an election to so many electors.  We in the university seats already have the right to send a litir um thoghch&aacute;n to each registered graduate and I hope that will continue under the new regime.  In the interests of cost, however, instead of having one litir um thoghch&aacute;n per candidate per graduate, we should instead have one item of correspondence to each registered elector, containing text and photographs from each candidate.  This would be one composite litir um thoghch&aacute;n.  That would be very welcome.  I regularly receive objections from people about the amount of mail they receive in every Seanad election.  Some people do not like the waste of State money and of paper.  We could streamline that process without losing the democratic right to communicate with potential electors.  That would be very important if there are to be 800,000 electors.  I am also conscious on the practical side of the huge difficulty the alumni offices in Trinity and NUI have maintaining an up-to-date register of electors.  Senator Mooney addressed the very practical difficulty of rolling out this new legislation.</p><p>I have just received yet another e-mail from a constituent saying I have sent my newsletter to their parents&rsquo; address.  Many graduates register on graduation at their parents&rsquo; address.  Inevitably, they move on and change addresses many times and often do not update their details with the alumni offices.  That will present a huge difficulty for the broader register of electors to be put in place.  These are mere logistical difficulties, which can be overcome in time.  The technical working group has had its first meeting to consider these practical difficulties.  All of us on the university panel will be very glad to help and make observations based on our experience.</p><p>This Bill is very welcome.  I am glad the Government is finally moving on it and I hope it will have cross-party support.  Since I was first elected in 2007 all the university Senators have called for this reform.</p> <p>All of the university Senators without exception have called for this reform to be made.  There are many obvious reasons it is hugely important that we would make this reform.  I want to address the merits of the Bill before mentioning one issue in particular that might change.</p><p>In response to some of the points made by Senator Norris, this is not an attempt to capture the election of university Senators by the political parties.  I do not see it in that context and I do not think it should be seen in that context.  Senator Norris referred in particular to the new procedure that will be set out in head 8 for replacement candidates from a replacement list as is the case with elections to the European Parliament.  That applies to all MEPs elected to the European Parliament.  The Independent MEP, Marian Harkin, has a replacement in the same way as MEPs from political parties.  It is a sensible approach.  It is a sensible recommendation given the logistics and potential cost of running a by-election.  What is important is that the replacement name is put out in the public domain so that when people vote for someone they know who the replacement will be as well.  That is also the case with elections to the European Parliament.</p><p>If that were the only reform to the Seanad electoral system it would represent a deeply disproportionate model whereby we would have six Senators elected by 800,000 people and the remaining 43 Senators elected by a very small number of several hundred, and 11 people to be appointed.  Just because that would be disproportionate does not mean we should not welcome the reform but we should not stop there with reform.  Senator Keane put it well when she said that this is the first step of reform and there are already other reforms that have been suggested.  I hope that in the lifetime of this Government we will see other reforms also, in particular to the method of election for the 43 Senators elected on the vocational panels.  I will address the matter in a moment.  It is important that the reform is welcomed in itself.  I would be disappointed if colleagues who support reform, increased democratisation and opening up the university seats would oppose the Bill simply because they feel it might be the only reform.</p><p>In terms of the merits of the Bill, the obvious benefit is that it will end the discrimination that currently exists against graduates of other universities and higher education institutes.  It will open up the Seanad for the first time to much larger numbers of voters &ndash; 800,000.  There is an argument about elitism in allowing only university graduates and college graduates to vote.  We have in fact a very high level of participation at third level, as shown by the numbers who would be entitled to vote.  The higher education institutions have made huge efforts in particular in recent years to increase diversity in the make-up of the student body.</p><p>The final point is that without changing the Constitution we cannot change the provision that requires that there would be six Senators elected by university graduates.  In the context of the current constitutional framework the most democratic way to deal with the six university Senators is to ensure that we are elected by graduates of all the third level institutions.  I do not see that as abolishing the TCD brand.  As a Trinity graduate I am sure Trinity will be well represented.  I very much hope it will be even with the new system in place.  I say that in response to Senator Mooney.</p><p>The second merit of the proposed change is that it will abolish the current rule whereby a number of citizens have more than one vote for the university panels.  Someone who has a degree from Trinity and a master&rsquo;s degree from UCD, for example, has two votes.  That seems inequitable.  Third, in head 7 we see an improved nomination system in terms of 40 people who are registered.  I have one difficulty with the nomination system which I will address later.</p><p>The fourth merit of the Bill is in head 8, namely, the replacement candidate system which I mentioned.  In head 5, I hope I am correct in my interpretation that head 3 appears to reserve the rule that an Irish citizen resident outside the jurisdiction will still be entitled to vote in Seanad elections.  That is hugely important because as Senator Barrett has said, that does enable a large number of Irish citizens resident in Northern Ireland to have a voice and representation in the Seanad.  I would not like to see that changed.  Head 3 appears to retain the current rule and does not require that someone is resident in this jurisdiction which is very welcome.</p><p>One particular flaw, as I see it, in the scheme of the Bill as currently drafted &ndash; I hope we will see it changed &ndash; is that in head 7(7) a deposit of &euro;900 is currently required.  Other speakers have mentioned the need to ensure that financial considerations do not put people off running for election.  It is important that we make sure the deposit is not too high.  I believe &euro;900 is too high.  I am grateful to the Minister&rsquo;s officials for clarifying that the current deposit rate for the D&aacute;il is &euro;500.</p> <p>The deposit for a European Parliament election is &euro;1,800.  I can see the rationale is that this is a much bigger electorate, but I am not sure, given the status of Deputies versus that of Senators, that it is justified to have a deposit double the deposit for a D&aacute;il election.  Will the Minister revisit that issue?</p><p>A deposit of &euro;900 for the Seanad is a very high deposit and may dissuade meritorious candidates.  It is also a huge departure from the current Seanad university panel model, where we do not have a deposit system, but simply ten nominees.  I am all in favour of having a greater number of people who can nominate and believe the suggested figure of 40 as sensible.  Ten nominations is too few.  The requirement for 40 nominations should not put people off running.  If people cannot get 40 people out of 800,000 to nominate them, perhaps they should not be considering candidacy.  The &euro;900 deposit does not seem fair.</p><p>The main issue with the legislation is that this should not be the only reform taking place.  It would lead to a skewed system of representation in the Seanad if this was the only reform made to the Seanad electorate in the lifetime of the Government.  I am glad we have already initiated a process of investigating other potential reforms.  While we press ahead with this, it is essential we also introduce other reforms.  As the Minister is aware, we had a meeting with the leaders of all the groups in the D&aacute;il and Seanad with the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste in December.  One of the points made there was that the Senators elected to the five vocational panels should also see an expansion of their electorate, beyond the current limited number of people who can vote, drawn from the councillors, sitting Deputies and Senators.  </p><p>I would like to see universal suffrage, or perhaps suffrage on a regional basis, in line with the European election constituencies.  I would also like to see a further important reform that would reduce the potential costs, namely, to have the elections on the same day.  I am conscious the Bills put forward by Senators Quinn, Zappone and Crown contain many of these changes, such as the universal suffrage principle and the timing of the election.  The D&aacute;il and Seanad elections should be timed for the same day and we should define postal ballot in such a way that people can cast their ballot in the polling station, along with their general election ballot.  This would get rid of the current critique of people - including myself - who failed in D&aacute;il elections running for the Seanad.</p></speech>

He has been here on a number of occasions on this issue and it is great to have him engage with us again.  I also wish to say "Aye, aye" to the captain of the women's team.</p><p>I view this Bill as the start of the opening up of the Seanad to make it more democratic and inclusive.  However, I must ask the question which has been touched on by many other contributors.  Why has the Government not taken this opportunity to make the Seanad fully democratic?  I would love to hear an answer to this question.  What is the rationale for not making this Bill fully inclusive by including a vote for all citizens?   What is the rationale for not incorporating the principle of universal suffrage?</p><p>As others have mentioned, the Bill implements the will of the people from 1979, but it is also reflective of the attitude of 35 years ago.  It is not reflective of the most recent poll of the Irish people from 2013.  Therefore, what is the Government&rsquo;s reasoning for this? </p> <p>If cost is the answer, one must ask if that is a sufficient reason.  If cost is the answer, would that mean that local, European or general elections should be restricted in order to save Exchequer funds?  Should we worry about the cost of the other types of elections?  </p><p>It is 2014 and we should be seeking to ensure that we have a better electoral system and a more democratic system of government than we did 35 years ago.  In that context, I will be attempting to put forward some amendments to this Bill to open the Seanad up more, given that it seems that this is the only Bill that will come before us.  If wider reform, based on the principle of universal suffrage, is not on the agenda then it is really important for the people to be clear that this decision rests with this Government.  I have put forward motions, as have some of my colleagues, to widen the electorate for the Seanad but those motions have been defeated.  It is very important for people to be aware that if that does not happen, ultimately, then that decision rests with the Government, although the Government may yet consider amendments to the Bill to that effect.  </p><p>I would like to identify a number of areas of the Bill which I welcome and to make some recommendations on certain elements that could be changed, apart from opening the Seanad up to the whole electorate.  I welcome the establishment of a single register of electors for the reconstituted higher education constituency, as referred to in head 4.  This new infrastructure will allow for a smoother transition and greater flexibility should we extend the franchise to all citizens at some stage in the future.  Under this Bill it is estimated that the Seanad electorate for the higher education panel will be over 800,000 people.  The electorate for the 2011 general election was just over 3 million.  I do not think it is such a huge leap to go from just under 1 million to 3 million in the interests of democracy.  As I indicated in my remarks on political reform last month, I believe that a permanent independent electoral commission is required in order for us to be in line with international best practice in this area.  I ask that the Government consider this in drafting the Bill.</p><p>I welcome the definition in the Bill of an ordinary bachelor degree as being level 7 in the national framework of qualifications, as contained in head 3.  This is very significant because it opens the Seanad to people who may not have experienced a traditional route into education or who have experienced educational disadvantage.  I expect and hope that it will bring a much greater diversity of background to the Seanad electorate, which can only be better for our democracy and for the laws that we make.  </p><p>My final comments centre on a recommendation to change one aspect of the Seanad nomination process within the Bill which could potentially be included under head 7.  This Bill is an opportunity to open up the Seanad but it is also an opportunity to modernise the process through which nominating bodies to the Seanad apply and are approved.  Prior to the Seanad referendum, my Independent Senator colleagues and I held a meeting of the current nominating bodies along with a significant number of civil society organisations who were interested in becoming nominating bodies.  It was a very well attended, vibrant meeting with over 60 participants.  As part of the event, I presented information on how Seanad elections work.  I outlined the number and type of panels, how people are nominated, including a mention of the sub-panels and I also described the five vocational panels.  Having had some key meetings with Ms Deirdre Lane and Ms Jody Blake prior to that meeting, I was also able to explain how they could register an interest in becoming a nominating body and how they might qualify to become a nominating body.</p> <p>Many organisations have expressed an interest in becoming nominating bodies.  However, we found the administrative process through which organisations apply to become nominating bodies is most outdated.  The rules under which the bodies must apply date from the 1947 Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act and contain no provision for electronic communications.  Applications must be posted or hand-delivered.  More critical than that, the criteria for becoming a nominating body are not absolutely clear to those who wish to apply, as this provision of information is restricted within the 1947 Act.  We need to amend the criteria required to become a nominating body so that those organisations which nominate can represent the wide diversity of civil society organisations that have been established since the 1950s.  These amendments to the 1947 Act could be incorporated within this Bill which would be a positive move by the Government.</p><p>In 2014, we need a more open, transparent and modern process for selecting nominating bodies.  If such a process were more straightforward, civil society&rsquo;s interest in the Seanad could be harnessed to create a more accessible and representative Seanad.  I would be happy to discuss these issues further with the Minister&rsquo;s officials.</p></speech>

Many good comments have been made on the heads of this Bill.  Like others, I welcome this process of change but recognise change comes slowly and cannot be all together.  I say, &ldquo;Well done&rdquo; to the Minister for being in the Chamber for this debate even if there are other jobs that need to be done.</p><p>Senator Bacik referred to the difficulties with the Seanad&rsquo;s electoral register and this expanded group of 800,000 graduates.  The devil will be in the detail.  If we knowingly expand the electoral register, which we appreciate already has problems, will we set aside some expertise to ensure it is a meaningful 800,000 people, not just names on paper?  As we know, many of them are already paper members.  As a graduate entitled to vote, I had a curious incident in the last election when I was trying to chase down my lost university panel ballot papers.  The post office was bemused and puzzled by the fact I was chasing them down and believed it never had anyone seeking their misplaced ballot papers before.  In the end I just made the deadline.  Voting in Seanad elections is not considered a priority by university graduates eligible to vote in Seanad elections.  If we are going to expand the register, we have a job to do to educate graduates.</p><p>I share Senator Bacik&rsquo;s observation that the &euro;900 sum for a candidate's deposit seems rather high and out of step with the &euro;500 required for a D&aacute;il election.  That is a matter the Minister can easily review.  I agree with Senator Zappone&rsquo;s point about the archaic nature of the legislation governing, as well as the lack of clarity around, Seanad nominating panels.  If we are changing the way the elections for the university panel are done, one would imagine those nominating bodies would be next in line asking where is their opportunity to change.  I do not believe there is a single Senator who would not want to see this area changed.  While I know it is not part of this Bill, when does the Minister intend to address that area?</p> <p>I share the notion that at some point we will have a universal franchise in the House and that elections for both Houses will be on the same day, which means that those who fail in one election will not be able to stand in the other election.  I do not offer any criticism and I accept it could happen at another time with another Government.  This is progress.</p></speech>

The question before the Government of our Republic with respect to this Bill is a very simple one: does it believe in democracy or does it not?  A second question is whether all citizens of our Republic and those qualified to vote have equal rights in selecting their public representatives, or whether some have more rights than others.</p><p>  In formulating the Bill, the Government is transforming its prior 35-year sin of omission into a sin of commission.  The Government, in common with Labour Party and Fianna F&aacute;il Governments in these Houses since the seventh amendment of the Constitution in 1978, sat on its hands and was guilty of a sin of omission by not instituting the reforms that had a clear mandate from the people.  Since the Constitution was first implemented in 1937, all politicians in the House have committed a greater sin of omission, which was not to reform the Seanad to make it democratic.  It is widely recognised that the cultural antecedents of our Seanad include vocationalism and a notion of <i>noblesse oblige</i> that came from the British House of Lords.  Perhaps it would not have been said as bluntly as this, but some people were felt to have a greater right to determine the shape of our national Parliament than others.  This is a small and grudging step in the right direction.  I am going to be gracious enough not to impugn the Government's motives for bringing it to the House at this particular time with respect to the outcome of the recent referendum.</p><p>  If I had been an anti-apartheid campaigner living in South Africa before its liberation and the P. W. Botha Government had come up with the idea of extending the vote not to Africans but to people of mixed race, which would have made South Africa a slightly more democratic place but would have represented a heinous offence against democracy and fair play, I would have looked at it and said that, on balance, in the struggle to get full and free votes for everyone, it represents a chink in the armour.  Perhaps this represents some advance.  If the Saudi Arabians decide to introduce some limited form of representation for women or to allow women to drive cars between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. but not all day, we might say it was an advantage compared to the current situation but still an affront to the notion of decency and fairness.  During penal times, if a suggestion was made by some quasi-reformer that the laws be changed to allow Catholics to have property and voting rights but only if they lived in Dublin, were over 5 ft. 6, or had not converted to Catholicism from some other religion, one might have said the upshot was a slightly more democratic solution but one that is far short of representative democracy.</p><p>  The Government is embarking on a transformation from a sin of neglect and a sin of omission to a deliberate sin of commission, which has its name all over it.  The Government is introducing a Bill, of which it is the <i>auteur</i> and the father, in which voting rights will be extended to some citizens of the Republic but not to all.  The Government cannot hide behind the fig leaf of the 1937 Constitution or some Pope Pius X interpretation of what was vocationalism.  This is the Government's work, and on this work shall be its name.</p> <p>We have two Bills that would address the fundamental democratic deficit in the Constitution, which deficit will remain after the Government's Bill to implement the seventh amendment with the result that there will be two castes of people in the country, namely those who are eligible to vote in some elections and those who are not.  The Government should produce, with but a fraction of the legislative effort made in the Taoiseach's office and the Office of the Attorney General, legislation that would combine the Bill of Senators Quinn and Zappone and mine.  This this would extend the franchise to every citizen and every person deemed qualified to vote, be it through citizenship or domicile.  Thus, the Minister could fix the democratic deficit and leave a great piece of work as his legacy.  I urge him to remember that if some of us are confronted with the choice between voting "Yes" and "No" on a Bill that extends the franchise from approximately 150,000 people to 800,000 people, we will vote "Yes" because it is better that more can vote than fewer, but it is an inadequate solution.</p></speech>

I agree fully that third level graduates should be represented and, therefore, I am in favour of the first little step we are taking in this legislation.  However, there is a long way to go.  The context of the Bill is that 158 days ago the people rejected the Government's proposal to abolish the Seanad.  On 4 October 2013, the people, who in this State are sovereign, gave the Government an unequivocal message that they wanted to see the Seanad not only retained but also reformed.  That is a basic aspect of what we are talking about.  In support of that statement, I ask Senators on all sides of the House to reflect on the nature of the campaign five months ago.</p><p>  The referendum campaign was hard fought and informative, and it raised key constitutional issues.  All sides in the debate accepted that the Seanad, in its current form, is badly in need of change.  Those of us who were prominent on the &quot;No&quot; side of the campaign did not ask people to reject the referendum in order to defend the <i>status quo</i> but to vote &quot;No&quot; to help to create a democratic Seanad in which every single citizen would have a stake.  The outcome of the referendum provides the Government with a strong mandate to begin that very process.  The voters have made clear that they want a future Seanad that is more efficient, democratic and representative.  I have said many times that the Taoiseach now has the opportunity to make a name for himself by being able to achieve something that no other Taoiseach has been able to achieve since the Constitution of 1937.  He is in a position to do something and will be able to stand up later and say, &quot;Look at what I did.&quot;  Unfortunately, this is not being done.</p><p>  If the Government's Bill is to be its sole response to the people's vote, we will not have fundamental reform.  It is fair to say the Bill represents a minimal response.  It is lacking in political vision and courage.  That is disappointing because, in the immediate aftermath of the Seanad referendum, the Taoiseach seemed ready to embrace the cause of meaningful reform.  I remember the words he used on the evening of the result .  He acknowledged that the result had brought &quot;clarity&quot; - I love the word - on the issue of the future of the Seanad.  He stated that the people had undoubtedly &quot;decided and confirmed that the Senate is retained as part of our constitutional institutions&quot;.  He stated also that there is a continuous need for change and reform in politics and that the Government should reflect on the best way in which the Seanad can be made an effective contributor to change in politics.  These are good words.  Is the proposed Bill the only action we are getting?  Is this all we are getting today?  To echo the song I mentioned, is that all?</p><p>  At the Fine Gael Party conference on 12 October 2013, a week or so after the referendum, the Taoiseach promised to extend voting to all third level graduates, which is the essential provision in this Bill.  He described the measure as a small first step.  Now, 156 days later, it seems to be the only step.  Somewhere along the way, the small first step seems to have become the Government's only step in dealing with the Seanad franchise.  On 18 December, the Taoiseach ruled out giving voting rights to all citizens in Seanad elections.  Specifically, he stated that he did not believe the framers of the Constitution intended that there should be universal suffrage for the Seanad in the same way as there is for the D&aacute;il.  This assertion by the Taoiseach is not correct.  The Constitution makes it clear that the Seanad is not to be elected in the same way as the D&aacute;il - that is, by geographical constituencies.  However, the articles of the Constitution dealing with the Seanad, Articles 18 and 19, clearly do not exclude universal citizen suffrage in Seanad elections; they intend the opposite.</p><p>  Senators Crown and Zappone both had Bills on Seanad reform - I was happy to support both - and they were passed in this House.  What must we do to ensure the Government does more than the least it can do?  I urge the Minister to take the steps to listen to what is being said here.  We have a chance to do something and make the House the strong constitutional body it is capable of being.  The Minister will find the answer in the two Bills I have mentioned and probably in the Fianna F&aacute;il Bill also.  In the two Bills that have already passed through this House, there is an answer for the Minister.  This should be acted upon.</p></speech>

That was voted down point-blank by the Government.  The coming of this Bill to the House proves us right.  The Government never really had any intention of reforming the Seanad.  It got a blow on the chin from the people when the referendum was defeated.  We never believed the Government would reform the Seanad, which is why we said we did not want what we regard as an elitist and totally undemocratic House to be kept.  The Bill before us proves we are correct.  It is nothing more than window-dressing.  It is another PR stunt by the Government, or a fig leaf to cover up for its embarrassment on having lost a referendum.  The reform is cosmetic and elitist.</p><p>In October 2013, the Government&rsquo;s referendum proposal to abolish the Seanad was rejected by the people, but all participants and parties involved in the campaign were clear in saying the Seanad in its current form is elitist, undemocratic and unacceptable.  The result cannot be viewed as a vote to retain the Seanad in its present form.  Piecemeal reforms are just not good enough.  The House should be fundamentally redesigned to better serve the people.  As a first step in the process, the matter should be referred to the Constitutional Convention, in which citizen members have a controlling majority.  The Seanad must become a fully inclusive, representative and accountable institution.  This requires direct election by way of universal franchise for all citizens on the same day as the D&aacute;il vote.  When we hear certain Senators calling for an element of universal franchise in the election of some Members while calling for the exclusion of the university Members, we realise it is quite hypocritical.  We need Northern and diasporic representation.  Fifty percent of Members need to be female and the representation of marginal and minority groups is required.</p><p>For the Seanad to truly fulfil its potential of having a balancing function in the Oireachtas, its powers must be increased.  It must have a distinct and complementary role and functions that do not merely replicate those of the D&aacute;il in a weaker form.</p> <p>In particular, the primary role of the Seanad should be: independent initial scrutiny of EU legislation from proposal stage; scrutiny of statutory instruments and ministerial appointments; to ensure equality proofing of all legislation; and to best represent the general public interest and reflect the priority of public accountability in decision-making.  The Seanad should also act as a forum for dialogue between the many interests in Irish society, ensuring the inclusion of those sectors with less power and influence.  It should use public consultation and deliberative democracy for enhanced citizen participation.  A reformed Seanad would have a specific focus on consulting with children and young people about the impact of proposed decisions directly affecting them.  </p><p>In a unitary state it is right that if the electorate's political and geographic interests are represented through the Lower Chamber on a population basis, their social, economic and cultural interests should be represented through the Upper Chamber on a sectoral basis.  This is an important distinction that should not only be retained but strengthened in a new Seanad.  The Seanad should also include the representation of regional interests on a non-population basis to redress the power imbalance for those currently marginalised by reason of residence in the North, the west, Gaeltacht areas and the diaspora.</p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in does not support this Bill.  The proposal to give all third level graduates a vote in future Seanad elections in light of the recent campaign around the abolition of the Seanad and the subsequent rejection of this by the electorate, by extension of the university franchise simply does not go far enough.  After the defeat of the referendum, the Government gave an undertaking to reform the Seanad.  In other words, it acknowledged that people wanted a reformed House and not abolition.  The promise of reform was a signal that it respected the wishes of the people but let us be clear, extension of the university franchise does not constitute meaningful and genuine reform.  One of the very arguments put forward by the Government, and Fine Gael in particular, in favour of abolition was that the Seanad was elitist and dysfunctional.  Extending the franchise to all third level graduates does nothing to alter the situation or to challenge the elitist nature of the Upper House.  Any modern democratic state that would limit the franchise to people who had a third level degree cannot in all seriousness consider itself modern or democratic.  I am sure there are a number of Senators here who do not have a university degree, and I certainly respect them as fellow Members of the Seanad, but are we saying that they should therefore not have the same right to vote as the other Members who do have a degree?  There should be no place in a 21st century democracy for such elitist nonsense.</p><p>To decide who can vote on the basis of educational attainment is nonsense and blatant elitism.  It is educational apartheid and apartheid is the state of being apart.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes in one person, one vote and universal franchise.  We need a properly reformed Seanad, one that is democratic, accountable and egalitarian and that works in the best interests of good governance.  Piecemeal, cosmetic change reinforces elitism.  We need to bring an end to that elitism.  Extending the vote to everyone is a first step towards real reform.</p><p>D&aacute; bhr&iacute; sin, n&iacute;l baol ar bith go nglacfaidh muid leis an sop in &aacute;it na scuaibe seo at&aacute; an Rialtas ag cur os &aacute;r gcomhair.

I recall that the Minister was a very constructive Senator.  I took on board much of his wisdom at the time - that is why I am here.</p><p>  I would say to the six Senators elected from the university panel - Senators Norris, Quinn, Crown, Mullen, Barrett and Bacik who jumped through the hoop and is now a Labour Party Senator even though she was elected from the university panel -  that they have nothing to fear from the extension of the franchise to approximately 1 million people.  Extending the franchise to the general public would be the ultimate step but that is not likely to happen.  I am sure the Cathaoirleach might not be enthusiastic about that but he cannot say anything about that because he is the Cathaoirleach.  </p><p>  Since the referendum in 1979 no Government has brought forward legislation to implement the decision of the people at that time, which was that this franchise would be extended, particularly to the colleges and the new universities like the University of Limerick.  I request the Minister to consider adopting a Bill that I  published on 22 October 2013, which I handed to the Taoiseach.  We wrote a note to each other and I said at the time &quot;a joint project, I hope, will be the case&quot;.  The Minister is accompanied by two senior officials and I am sure they are aware of that Bill.  </p><p>  The Long Title of my Bill was:<blockquote>An Act to provide for the amendment of the Seanad Electoral (University Members) Acts 1937 to 2006, to provide for the provisions of the seventh amendment of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann and to extend the franchise of the university panel of Seanad &Eacute;ireann to all people who are over eighteen and legally resident in Ireland and are holders of an appropriate third level qualification from an Irish Institute of Higher Education and to provide for related matters.<b></b></blockquote><b></b>It provided for amendment of section 6 of Act of 1937 as follows:<blockquote>Section 6 of the principal Act is amended by the substitution of the following for section 6:all Universities and Institutions of Higher Education in the State shall be a constituency (in this Act referred to as the University Constituency) for the election of six members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann; <br />every person who is for the time being registered as an elector in the register of electors for the University constituency shall be entitled to vote in that constituency; and<br />the Minister may make regulations to give effect to any matter or thing that is referred to in this Act.It also provided that:<br />every regulation made under this Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas;<br />no person shall be entitled to vote at an election in a university constituency unless he is registered as an elector in the register of electors for the constituency.</blockquote>    It further provided that: <blockquote>the qualification of &lsquo;degree&rsquo; referred [to] ... shall be construed as defined in the framework of qualifications established by the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland or its successor bodies, under section 7 of the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act 1999;<br />the qualification of &lsquo;diploma&rsquo; referred in subsection (1) shall be construed as defined in the framework of qualifications established by the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland or its successor;<br />any person, who would not be disqualified for membership of the D&aacute;il under section 41 of the Electoral Act 1992, and may vote in that university constituency, may declare their candidacy in that constituency.</blockquote> There are quite a number of excellent private colleges such as Yeats College and Hibernia College.  These are private institutions that bring students to degree qualifications level.  I want to ensure that they will be included in the extension of the franchise.  It will be up to every college to hold a register of electors.  The students who have qualified would be on that roll and that would be made available to the candidates.  The majority of candidates would only canvass by way of the Internet.  The voting could be defined as electoral voting.  It would be a confined way of voting, bringing back a system of automatic voting machines in a sense, although not bringing back those machines as they have been scrapped.</p></speech>

He is long enough at it.  He published the heads of the Bill but will he publish the Bill and be damned?  He should not confine this to the universities and institutes of technology but should extend it to everyone in Ireland who has a qualification, whether educated abroad or otherwise.  If someone has a third level qualification, as far as I am concerned, he or she should be entitled to vote in this election.</p><p>It is only wishful thinking to think it will be extended to a general franchise for all, which I would love.  I would love to run for the Seanad in the constituency of the west, which would have six or seven seats in the Seanad.  It would be a lovely electorate.  The election could be held on the day of the European Parliament and local authority elections and not on the day of a general election, so we would not depend on the D&aacute;il.  </p><p>Those are all very aspirational ideas.

It is positive that the heads of the Bill are being debated rather than the specific legislation.  A couple of Ministers use the Oireachtas committees to present heads of Bills but we are using the Seanad, which is very appropriate.</p><p>I listened with interest to my colleagues and my difficulty is that ten Governments since 1979 have refused to respect the people's decision in the 1979 referendum.  We finally have a Government which is acting on the June 1979 result but I am a little worried about the type of response proposed.  We are suggesting a national constituency to select six Senators.  Presumably, there will be hundreds of thousands of voters and the figure could perhaps reach 1 million.  That will fundamentally change the type - I will not say the quality - of Senator traditionally elected to the university panel to contribute to this House.  </p><p>In the aftermath of the referendum on the Seanad and of the huge input not only into the referendum debate but into the Seanad over the past 20 or 30 years of Independent and university Senators, some of the more cynical among us could say that what is being proposed is political revenge rather than political reform because a national constituency of six seats with an electorate of hundreds of thousands will certainly ensure that the type of Senator - I will not say colourful characters because that is an unfair description - traditionally returned by the university panel electorate will possibly not be the type of Senator elected under the new system and that concerns me.  </p><p>The Minister is as much a scholar of politics as anybody in this House and if he looks at the university panel down through the years, only two party political figures were elected.  The President, Michael D. Higgins, was, to the best of my knowledge, elected to the university panel in the early 1980s as was a former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Jim Dooge, who never hid his Fine Gael colours.  However, the typical university Senator, whether elected by Trinity College, Dublin, or National University of Ireland graduates, is a very independent-minded Senator but I fear if we have one national list of six Senators, that type of Senator will never be elected again.

She stood as an Independent candidate in the presidential election.</p><p>  The debate needs to move on as soon as possible to the question of a universal election to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I have read various interventions to this debate by Ministers who seem to suggest - I am not sure whether they are deliberately attempting to misinform us or whether they have been deliberately been misinformed by someone else - that somehow it would require a further constitutional referendum to allow universal suffrage but it would not.  It simply requires the political will to put in place a system where every citizen of this State can vote in a Seanad election.</p><p>  The Minister will recall that 12 or 18 months before the Taoiseach announced that he was in favour of abolishing the Seanad, Fine Gael proposed that on the same day as the European Parliament and local government elections, every citizen of this country would vote to elect the panel of Senators.  What was good enough for Fine Gael in 2008 should be good enough today.  That proposal stacked up in that every citizen of this country would vote to elect Senators in a panel system.  It would require a bit of political ingenuity, legislative work and much political courage but if it was good enough for the Fine Gael document in 2008 or 2009, it is worthy of consideration today.  This could be done if there is a political will to allow every citizen to vote in the Seanad election and, as the Minister knows, it does not require a further constitutional referendum.  </p><p>  It was back in 1992, when Bill Clinton defeated George H. W. Bush, that the phrase &quot;It's the economy, stupid&quot; was coined.  George H. W. Bush lost the US presidential election and Bill Clinton won it because the people's only concern is economics.  We saw that in 1997 when the excellent rainbow Government was beaten by the <i>Irish Independent </i>headline: &quot;It's Payback Time&quot;.  We probably saw this in the last general election also that the economy was not only the primary but the sole consideration of the electorate.  However, I think there has been a very dramatic sea change in public opinion over the past number of years.  As the Government is attempting to rebuild the economy and as we are trying to rebuild a different sort of political way of managing our country, we must build a new type of politics.  Part of that politics must include universal suffrage for each House of the Oireachtas.  The means of giving every citizen a vote in a Seanad election exists; it is not complicated and does not require constitutional change.  I hope that as part of the wider debate around this Bill, we will reflect on that.  </p><p>  Some 40% of the people voted in the referendum last October.  Some people say it was only 40% but it was quite impressive compared to the traditional turnout for referendums.  I appreciate what my Sinn F&eacute;in colleague said that the third option was not on the ballot paper but all of us know that on the streets, in the pubs and in the clubs, the majority of people who rejected the Government's proposal did so because they wanted a reformed Seanad and did not want things to remain as they were.  All the evidence from the polls would appear to suggest that.  </p><p>  This is a response to a historical question from 1979 and not to the people's decision of last October.  I hope that, collectively, we will try to respond to what the people said last October that they wanted a much different and much more universal Seanad where every citizen would have a vote.  I wonder what the outcome would be if somebody questioned the constitutionality of allowing some citizens to vote but not others and brought that challenge all the way to Europe.</p></speech>

When the Taoiseach came into the House following the referendum, he gave an undertaking that he would bring the heads of the Bill before the House and the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  We are honouring that commitment by having this discussion.</p><p>The intent of the Bill is to give effect to the wishes of the people who decided in 1979 that all third level graduates should have a vote and it has taken until now for a Government to take action in that regard.  We will never know why that happened.  The logistics of the change will prove difficult as we need to find out the number registered in each third level institution because under the Constitution they must be written to by registered letter to be eligible to vote for Members on the university panels.</p><p>Senator Sean D. Barrett has also published a Bill in respect of the university franchise and suggests a number of seats should be allocated to the universities on the Culture and Education Panel.  I am not sure what the constitutional position is in that regard and whether that would be possible, but I am sure it will be examined in the coming weeks and months.</p><p>I pay tribute to the role TCD and NUI Senators have played.  They have in the past played an important role and made excellent contributions, as have the current Senators on these panels.  However, they are democrats and would wish their electorate to be increased, if that is the wish of the people and it was the case in 1979.  It will be a much larger electorate - probably between 700,00 and 800,000 - which will be difficult to canvass for candidates.  Candidates from TCD which has a smaller electorate than other universities and panels will probably feel their chances of being elected will be lower than heretofore, but I cannot go along with this because university graduates, irrespective of which college they qualify from, will vote for the people they think will best represent their wishes in the House.  The cream will always rise to the top and I have no doubt that, based on the contributions university panel Members have made during this term and given their qualifications, they will be viewed positively by whatever number of graduates decide their fate in the next election.</p><p>The Government has made it clear that this is the only legislative change that will be made during its term.  It has made a number of proposals regarding procedures which I have forwarded to the Cathaoirleach to be discussed at the next meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  It will probably take a number of meetings for us to make decisions on the changes to procedures and Standing Orders.  The Government parties are, therefore, serious about reforming the House and the way we do our business and are acting on the wishes of the people by enacting legislation to give effect to the 1979 referendum result.</p><p>I welcome the debate we have had on the heads of the Bill and we will have a more in-depth discussion when the Bill is taken in the House.  There will be even greater contributions from all Senators on that issue.  Members elected to the university panels will be affected most and other Members will listen to them, but graduates, irrespective of the institution from which they qualify, will vote for the best people they believe will represent their views in the House.  I look forward to making a further contribution when the Bill is published and introduced in the House.</p></speech>

A number of issues were raised, which will be considered.  </p><p>With regard to the contributions of Senators Feargal Quinn and Katherine Zappone, the reason the Government is not implementing the policy decision on universal suffrage is it subscribes to the view that we do not need a replication of the House of Representatives in the Seanad.  That is the fundamental issue on which we disagree.</p><p>The manner in which Seanad electoral reform is carried out is a separate issue and all matters raised in the debate have been raised by the party leaders in the consultation process in which they are engaged with the Taoiseach and they are being reflected on by him.  However, I am sure the Taoiseach and the Government will consider other proposals to bring to the House, not just this legislation.  As the Leader stated, the manner in which the House operates and how it conducts its business under Standing Orders are under consideration by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I agree with him that these matters need to be addressed, but I refer to suggestions made by Senators David Norris and Sean D. Barrett.  Reform that provides for the will of the people to be implemented in the context of the 1979 referendum should not be anything to fear.  There is scope for a wide variety of people to become candidates before the graduate electorate, albeit a larger one, but those who have been elected to the three seat NUI panel or the three seat TCD panel have made a major contribution and will continue to do so.  Their names are well known in Irish life and even more well known in the graduate community.  I do not subscribe to the view that if one is a graduate of a particular college, one will be in any way disenfranchised.  I expect Members, particularly those of long-standing, to be confident in their own ability to be elected through an expanded franchise.</p><p>A number of the contributions focused on Seanad reform outside the scope of the heads of the Bill, but because the Bill is dedicated exclusively to the notion of how the membership of the university panels will be constituted from the next election, it is appropriate that the general scheme be discussed by Members.  I thank them for their contributions in that respect.</p><p>I will reflect on the issues raised and reiterate that it is the Government's desire to facilitate debate and consultation on the general scheme of the legislation, while reserving the right to bring forward further proposals in the future, legislative or otherwise, in the House in the context of reform, which we acknowledge is the wish of the people.</p><p>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh engaged in a little revision.</p></speech>

I wish to ascertain the level of funding that will be available from the State to co-fund the moneys available under the European Commission proposals.  It is my understanding that the new Leader programme will involve 54% of EU funding which will require 46% of national funding to be secured.  That will mean a cut in the region of &euro;87 million to Leader funding.  Overall funding has been reduced from &euro;370 million from &euro;283 million under the current Leader programme.  That amounts to a cut of approximately 23%.  I hope that is not the case and that the Minister will clarify what discussions are taking place, what level of funding will be put in place and what efforts are being made.  The funding comes under the remit of the Common Agricultural Policy.  While I appreciate that it is a matter for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and that is the Department engaged in the negotiations, the reason I raise the issue is because the Leader programme comes within the remit of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p><p>I raise the alignment process as a caveat to the funding issue.  Concern has been expressed by local development companies around the country at the proposed alignment process by which Leader funding will come under the remit of local authorities.  I would like an update from the Minister as to what is happening.  The crux of the issue is the funding that will be available.  There is currently a stop-gap arrangement as funding under the previous Leader programme has run out and local community development organisations who administer the current scheme are not able to fund new projects.  Given the lack of opportunity for community groups to apply for funding, is there a mechanism by which funding can be made available?  What level of funding remains to be drawn down in the current Leader programme?  The Minister might not have the answers tonight but I seek clarification on the questions asked.</p></speech>

The governing EU regulations provide that a minimum allocation of 5% of that funding goes to the Leader programme.  The Government has decided to increase that to 7%, which I welcome.  Therefore, &euro;153 million in EU funding will be available to Leader during 2014 to 2020 and will be co-financed by Exchequer funding.  The Senator is correct that the level of co-financing has yet to be determined.  Discussions are ongoing with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on the matter.  Following conclusion of the discussions I will be in a position to announce the overall value of the Leader elements of the programme.  The discussions are not yet completed but they are likely to be completed in April.</p><p>The second question related to alignment.  We have had a number of meetings recently, including last week, on the role of the local community development committee and the role of the community structure.  We made substantial progress.  Equally, because of the community and local authorities coming together through the local community development company, we have to work out the nuts and bolts of the arrangements as to who will do what in terms of the roles and responsibilities involved.  Public accountability is important in the disbursement of the money.  The moneys will be paid to local community development committees through the director of finance in local authorities but the local community sector will be involved in a series of activities which will be the subject of discussion in the coming weeks.  We are confident that we will be able to work out arrangements.  The level of administrative finance that is required from a community point of view, in addition to the employment and contractual obligations of boards of Leader companies will be less onerous because the responsibility will be taken over by the local authority.  I hope that will be helpful to the boards of directors of Leader companies who are worried about these matters on the conclusion of the Leader round of funds.</p><p>On the previous occasion coming up to 2007 there was an end to the programme and it took two years for the following programme to commence.  I am anxious that there will be a shorter gap before getting the next round of programme funds going in early 2015.  Most of the companies will be able to continue in their contractual sense, in particular the local development companies, up to the end of this year.  if companies have enough money administratively to continue to the end of the year they will be able to do so but I hope the short gap between the end of this programme and the beginning of the new programme will amount to not more than a couple of months.</p><p>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill is aware that all of the money has been committed at this stage.  I have asked Leader companies to tell me if they had projects in 2009, 2010 and 2011 that are not going ahead so that the funding can be reallocated.  All of the companies have indicated that the projects are committed and none of them will be discontinued.  I must take them at their word because they are private companies.  We have no other money to allocate except to roll out all of the moneys that have been committed and to meet those commitments during the course of 2014.</p></speech>

I am very grateful to him for coming to the House to respond to my question.  As the Minister is aware, there is a great deal of anxiety and speculation concerning the status of the intergovernmental agreement between the UK and the Government on the wind export project.</p><p>I have been inundated with contact from communities from Knockmore in Mayo to Kildangan in County Kildare and Ratheniska, Rosenallis and Vicarstown in my native county of Laois.  Communities have been living in the shadow of the prospect of the development of what they see as daunting, imposing and unnecessary giant industrial wind farms which were proposed to be constructed by both semi-State and private developers for the purpose of wind energy export.  As I understand from previous pronouncements by the Minister in the Seanad, as recently as 19 February the intergovernmental agreement was contingent on the two Governments concluding an agreement and that the wind energy export project was predicated on that basis.  That being the case we are a little taken aback at the pronouncements from some of the companies and agencies in the past 48 hours to the effect that they insist on proceeding with the projects.</p> <p>I cannot see how this could be the case as they were always intended to be export projects.  The market was deemed to be within the United Kingdom, as there is no capacity or demand within the Irish system in terms of energy generation or within the grid.</p><p>Second, I ask the Minister to bring absolute clarity to the situation for families across the country and for the various developers involved so that they can know where they stand and not be left in limbo wondering about the status of the intergovernmental agreement.  Was today the day the agreement was to be signed between the Irish and British Governments - since the Taoiseach is in London as we speak with the British Prime Minister, David Cameron?  There is also a question of the implications of this latest development for our entire energy policy and strategy as it impacts on EirGrid, Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte and in terms of the energy strategy being pursued by Sustainable Energy Ireland, all agencies which fall within the remit of the Department.</p><p>I am grateful the Minister has come into the House for this matter and hopefully he can bring some clarity and finality on this issue.</p></speech>

We can now exploit those renewable resources to generate electricity, reduce our import bills for gas and oil and contribute to decarbonising our energy systems.  Thanks to technology, we now have the technical capacity to create a new traded sector in green energy.  Last year I signed a memorandum of understanding with my UK counterpart, Ed Davey, and since then our two Departments have been working towards an intergovernmental agreement, as required by the EU renewables directive, to facilitate trade in green energy between Ireland and Britain.</p><p>The contemplated midlands wind export project has been greatly misrepresented, often wilfully and sometimes dishonestly.  When the plan to build out and modernise the grid was settled in 2006, the midlands export project was not even a beam in the eye of its originators.  It is a private sector project that can only proceed as permitted by an intergovernmental agreement.  Otherwise, the British side cannot count the imported power as coming from renewable sources and include it in meeting its own renewables targets.  Nor can the project proceed except in compliance with a national policy and development framework, after a strategic environmental assessment that identifies the areas not suitable for wind farms.</p><p>We have done a cost benefit analysis, which shows significant economic benefit for both countries.  On our side, we estimate approximately 6,000 job years at construction stage, revenue streams to local authorities and local communities and, most importantly, an annual dividend from trading to the Irish Exchequer.  In addition, from discussion we have had, Ireland would be in a strong position to develop a supply sector for the industry.  Furthermore, the midlands export project would offer new business opportunities to Bord na M&oacute;na, because it is difficult to see the development of any such project without taking into account the tens of thousands of acres of cutaway bog in the ownership of that company.</p><p>All of this must be settled within a very tight framework, both because of European Union requirements and because the private sector developers must, before they invest, know that they will benefit from the UK support systems.  However, key policy and regulatory design decisions remain to be taken by the UK Government, which means that we are still a considerable distance from settling on the specifics of what the Irish Government and the renewable generators believe must be the basic components of any intergovernmental agreement.  I repeat what I said in this House on 20 February 2014, namely, that without us seeing a considerable dividend in terms of revenue and employment for Ireland's benefit, there will be no such agreement.</p><p>Against that standard and following my meeting last week with Secretary of State for Climate Change and Energy, Ed Davey, I now find it difficult to see how, within the timeframe, it is possible to deliver the project as envisaged.  I take this opportunity to repeat what I said on 20  February, namely, that whether or not the midlands export project goes ahead, this country will still need a grid that is fit for purpose.  The plans to develop the grid do not have, and never did have, anything to do with the midlands export project.  The midlands export project remains a novel one which, if realised, will bring jobs and wealth to Ireland.  It does not appear that it can be realised at this time.</p></speech>

This has now been diluted to a projection of 6,000 jobs.</p><p>Was it not the case that when this policy was devised in 2006, his predecessor, former Minister, Eamon Ryan, said the grid expansion was to facilitate renewables?  Therefore, I put it to the Minister that this does have implications for EirGrid.  I see nothing categoric in his answer to refute the fact that communities are being left in limbo as to whether these export projects will proceed.  It seems to me they are merely being deferred.</p></speech>

The midlands wind export project was not even contemplated in 2006.  The refurbishment of the grid has nothing to do with the wind export project, which is a separate, stand alone ring-fenced project with a different technology sub-sea DC cable and so on.  It would be helpful if there was less agitation based on misrepresentation, especially in the midlands.</p></speech>

This issue was brought to my attention again last week when we had the deplorable case of two little girls of six and nine years of age in Westmeath who had been raped.  This case highlighted the issue concerning sexual offenders and how we deal with them.  I have been in contact with victims' groups here who believe we do not focus our attention on the rehabilitation of offenders.  At any given time, there are approximately 300 sexual offenders in our prisons and we release 100 of them each year into our communities.</p><p>I acknowledge that the Minister, Deputy Shatter, has made considerable progress in this area with the introduction of the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill 2012, which deals with the mandatory reporting of child abuse, but we need to go further.  We need to ensure that sexual offenders are properly managed within our communities.  We should also provide mandatory programmes in our prisons as part of the wider approach to managing these offenders.  All my comments are based on the need to protect our children.  This is a child protection issue and children, rather than the offender, should be to the fore in all of our discussions on ensuring offenders do not re-offend.</p><p>An increasing body of research shows that simply imprisoning offenders is not effective in reducing the risk of re-offending on release.  It has been shown that well designed evidence based rehabilitative approaches in our prisons can reduce re-offending rates among sexual offenders.  This is the kernel of the issue.  I do not believe we will cure sexual offenders, but mandatory programmes while they are in prison are essential, as are rehabilitative programmes on their release into communities.  </p> <p>The act of committing a sexual offence against a child is a heinous crime and the Legislature is morally obliged to protect children against it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-03-11a.351" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1069" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="18:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014031100038#MM00200"><p>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter.  He apologises that he is unavoidably absent for this important issue.</p><p>In the management of sex offenders, the focus of the work is multifaceted and involves both the assessment of the risk of re-offending and the monitoring of compliance with relevant court supervision orders.  While in prison, a convicted sex offender can avail of relevant treatment to address his or her offending behaviour.  The treatment of sex offenders is centred in Arbour Hill Prison where the Building Better Lives programme is undertaken.  The programme comprises group interventions in three modules and allows responsive and flexible delivery of rehabilitation services which take account of individual risk, needs and capacity.  The Baseline project is a joint initiative between the northside inter-agency project and the Prison Service psychology service which provides group programmes for young offenders with a history of sexually harmful behaviour.  It also continues work into the community for those with convictions for sexual offences.  The group programmes are rolling programmes with new participants joining and others leaving groups in response to progress.</p><p>Not all sex offenders are suited to group programmes and other prison-based therapeutic interventions include one-to-one interventions.  Sex offenders also engage with other services to address other related needs, such as mental health needs.  The Probation Service engages with sex offenders in individual work throughout the course of their sentence.  This work primarily focuses on reducing the risk posed by the individual following release and also on any child protection issues which may arise.</p><p>Mandatory participation in treatment programmes is a concept that is often mooted which is to some extent understandable.  However, mandatory participation in any form of intervention or rehabilitation is not a realistic option.  While offenders can be supported and encouraged in their efforts to address their offending behaviour, ultimately experience has shown that successful completion of an intervention programme depends on the willing participation and commitment of appropriately motivated individuals.  The challenge, accordingly, is to use a range of channels to motivate and incentivise as many offenders as possible.  This includes individual counselling which plays a vital role in the change process.</p><p>The Sex Offenders Act 2001 introduced a wide range of measures aimed at reducing the risk to the public from convicted sex offenders.  Those measures include notification requirements, often referred to as the sex offenders register, sex offender prohibition orders and post-release supervision.  Compliance with these requirements is mandatory and a failure to comply can result in further prosecution for a sex offender.  Part 5 of the Act provides for the post-release supervision of a convicted sex offender by the Probation Service.  The period of supervision is set by the court and is based on consideration of the offender's rehabilitative needs, as well as the need to protect the public from serious harm.  The period of post-release supervision can be subject to additional conditions of counselling or treatment.</p><p>Section 99 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 provides that sex offenders can be sentenced to part-suspended sentences.  Such sentences involve an offender serving a period in custody followed by a suspended portion in the community.  The sentencing judge can impose conditions of Probation Service supervision and treatment to this order.  In managing these cases, the Probation Service works closely with the Garda and other partner agencies to ensure the co-operation and compliance by the offender with supervision in the interests of community safety.</p><p>The Probation Service co-facilitates Safer Lives, a sex offender treatment programme, in three locations for moderate to high-risk offenders and this programme is based on the Building Better Lives programme, a strength-based therapeutic approach. The Probation Service and the Probation Board of Northern Ireland have an all-island approach to working with sex offenders.  Both agencies use the same risk assessment tools and undertake joint training.  They also have a protocol for the sharing of information on the management of sex offenders.</p><p>Much work has been done since 2009 when the detailed discussion document on the management of convicted sex offenders was published on the Department's website.  This document, prepared by a high level group involving the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Prison Service and the Probation Service, examined the arrangements then in place for the management of sex offenders with a view to strengthening inter-agency co-operation and further enhancing public protection and safety.  Its remit included a review of the procedures and legislation relating to the assessment, monitoring and supervision of convicted sex offenders.</p><p>I appreciate the opportunity to have outlined for the House, on behalf of the Minister, the structures that are in place.  I hope this is helpful in assuring the Senator in that regard and we can all recognise the valuable work being done by the agencies involved to comprehensively manage sex offenders, as well as the issues that arise within our prisons and in our communities.</p></speech>

The management of sex offenders is taken seriously and the Department undertook a wide-ranging review of the law in December 2013.  On foot of this review, the Government recently approved the Minister&rsquo;s proposals for the drafting of a new sexual offenders Bill.  It is priority legislation and is being drafted.  It will include measures to put risk assessment on a statutory footing, strengthen the current notification requirements, shorten the period for registration from seven to three days, make it easier to apply for a sex offender order and enhance the application of post-release supervision.  It will be published in late March or early April.  A joint Prison Service and Probation Service working group has been established to review sex offender risk and offence-related issues.</p></speech>
