On arriving, they were sent to Kinsale Road Accommodation Centre in Cork, where they slept in a cramped single room, washed with strangers in communal showers and ate at set times in the canteen.  The mother was told she was prohibited from working.  They were also told that they had no right to child maintenance, social welfare or rent allowance payments.  Instead of being granted such basic rights, they were granted a weekly allowance of &euro;30 between them, a pittance of a handout.  Four weeks ago, after enduring six tortuous and isolated months at the centre, garda&iacute; were called to the centre to investigate the suicide of the very same young Korean mother.  This is the direct provision system in Ireland in 2016.</p> <p>In the aftermath of the tragedy, the secretary of the Kinsale Road Accommodation Centre Action Committee, Mr. Mahmud, publicly stated the inhumane treatment of this woman in a direct provision centre had triggered her suicide.  His comments are far from controversial.  He joins a plethora of organisations and reports that condemn direct provision as an horrendous, dysfunctional system in which the State has caused and continues to cause a great deal of physical and mental damage to asylum seekers.</p> <p>In 2015 the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions described the direct provision system as not being fit for purpose.  HIQA, in the same report, stated it had grave concerns about the mental health of those in such a system.  In 2j015 the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights stated it was a severe violation of human rights.</p> <p>We are leaving people in the centres for years.  There are now over 4,500 asylum seekers in direct provision centres, over half of whom have been in the system for five years or longer.  Imagine living for five years or more in a direct provision centre without being entitled to look for a job, a house or a third level education.  We are sitting back and doing nothing while the people concerned watch years of their lives pass them by.  Children are being born in direct provision centres and raised within a system that institutionalises them into accepting such a dysfunctional and inhumane way of life.  How can we allow this to happen?</p> <p>Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, the former Minister of State with responsibility for equality issues, visited a centre in Galway and said the system was inhumane and that he would not stand over it.  However, he has now left the Cabinet table and asylum seekers are still in the centre.  What exactly will the Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton, do about it?  Earlier this year the Government dropped its commitment to implementing the recommendations made in the McMahon report which called for reform of the direct provision system.  That decision was a disgrace.  When exactly will the report be implemented in full?  When will asylum seekers be allowed access to third level education?  When will they be allowed access to internships and apprenticeships?  When will a standard setting committee and inspectorate be established?  When will those in direct provision centres be given the right to work?  When can we start to debate the system we would like to see replace the shameful and discredited direct provision system?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-10-04a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016100400002#C00100"><p>I thank the Senator for raising the issue.  I welcome the opportunity to update the Seanad on behalf of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality on developments in the provision of services for asylum seekers in Ireland.  Of the 23 recommendations made in the report of the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions, 13 have been implemented, where feasible, in respect of health and community welfare and a prescription charge waiver; six are in progress or under examination in the areas of catering, family space, an independent inspectorate and ombudsman; three relate to the recast reception conditions directive and have not been implemented; and one, recommendation 8.1 which calls for the replacement of the direct provision system, has not been implemented.</p> <p>The Senator mentioned the McMahon report on the protection process, including the direct provision system, which was published in 2015 and is the key driver of change.  The report of the Public Service Petitions and Oversight Committee raises some of the same issues covered in the McMahon report.</p> <p>The T&aacute;naiste and I are committed to reforming the direct provision system in line with the programme for Government, with a particular focus on families and children.  Significant inroads have been made in dealing with the length of time spent in the direct provision system and the position will be further improved with the implementation of the International Protection Act 2015 and, in particular, the single procedure.</p> <p>The T&aacute;naiste is introducing a number of pilot projects before the end of 2016 which will see the installation of catering solutions in accommodation centres.  They will facilitate families in cooking for themselves.  It is intended that they will be rolled out in more centres in 2017.  This work will proceed alongside changes to the accommodation profiles to provide more living space for families.</p> <p>The Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, through centre managers, is engaging locally to develop "friends of the centre" groups.  An equality and diversity training programme will also be rolled out for centre staff.</p> <p>The Department of Education and Skills has introduced a pilot scheme to allow asylum seekers avail of third level education.</p> <p>The rate of payment for children in direct provision centres has increased to &euro;15.60 since January 2016.  The Department of Social Protection continues to make other support payments, including back to school payments. </p> <p>Legislative change to extend the remit of the two Ombudsman offices to direct provision accommodation services is being put in place.  The RIA and other Departments providing direct provision services have always been subject to the Freedom of Information Acts.</p> <p>Health services for asylum seekers are mainstreamed and provided on the same basis as for Irish citizens.  Asylum seekers in direct provision accommodation qualify for a medical card and do not have to pay the prescription charge.  They can access the same GPs, mental health and other health supports as any other medical card user in their locality.</p> <p>Ireland did not opt in to the 2003 reception conditions directive or its 2013 recast.  The main reason for this relates to a right to work for asylum seekers who are awaiting a first instance decision on their application after nine months, which is contrary to national law.  The Refugee Act 1996 provides that applicants for international protection shall not seek or enter employment or carry on any business, trade or profession during the period before the final determination of their application.  This prohibition is restated in the International Protection Act 2015.  The key concern in this regard is that both the asylum process and the wider immigration system would be undermined in giving immigrants who secure entry to the State on foot of claims to asylum the same access to employment as immigrants who follow the lawful route to employment.  There is an effective visa and immigration system in place for those who wish to lawfully migrate to the State for employment purposes.</p></speech>

It does not deal with the questions I asked the Minister of State.  It is a very disappointing response, in particular, to the question about the right to work.  Ireland is one of only two countries in Europe that does not recognise the reception conditions directive, which reflects very badly on us.  The people concerned deserve to have the right to work.  The Minister of State did not give a timeframe for when increased payments to adults will be made.  Pilot schemes which allow access to third level education are no replacement for actually giving people their rights.  What I take from the Minister of State's answer is that he is happy for the people concerned to continue as second-class citizens in the State.  That is no way for a republic to act.</p></speech>

It is important in the first instance that those seeking protection in Ireland be provided with supports while they await a decision on their request for protection.  Food, shelter, health and education are among the basic supports provided.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy David Stanton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1053"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1053&amp;amp;pid=DavidStanton&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->What we are working towards is the enhancement of supports for such persons.  This includes the provision of supports for those in the asylum process, programme refugees arriving from UNHCR refugee camps and those relocated within the EU from the Mediterranean hotspots.  For those who are granted permission to remain in the State, there are other needs to be met based on transition and integration, and employment, health and welfare.</p></speech>

This issue relates to the need for the Minister for Finance to ensure that the introduction of a first-time buyer's tax relief is extended to those who have had to surrender their homes on foot of a court order, for example, those who have been divorced or those whose house has been repossessed.  Starting over again will be a lot harder as the period between now and the retirement age of 66 is shorter and the repayments will be much higher.  In many cases, people's circumstances have changed and they are now in a position to start over by buying a new home.  However, those who have had to surrender a home on foot of a court order find they have to pay a deposit of 20% under the Central Bank rule.  I ask the Minister for an extension of the tax relief scheme to include all those who have lost their homes on foot of a court order.</p> <p>The Minister of State last week addressed the issue of local authority mortgages and I believe this needs to be addressed in the budget.  The statistics in regard to mortgages issued through local authorities through the home choice loan scheme demonstrate that since 2009, only 21 loans have commenced, which is an average of just three a year over a period of seven years.  This is a huge issue that needs to be addressed given that in the same period, some 1,100 standard local authority mortgages have commenced.  I ask the Minister of State to examine the provision of mortgages through the local authorities and to extend the scheme and the cap, as there is an issue in this regard.  Overall, some people are not qualifying for mortgages and this needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

The second issue raised by the Senator is one that was raised in the House last week and it is under constant review.  I made it clear to the Senator's colleague that we will take on board suggestions.  However, with regard to schemes that have a low drawdown, we cannot force people to take part in a scheme.  They are choosing the other scheme as they judge it has better conditions, which has resulted in the respective figures being 1,200 versus 21.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The reason for that is that product suits them better but I made it clear if the Senator has ways to make it better, we will take on board all suggestions.  There was a lack of suggestions in last week's debate.  We are open to suggestions and the Minister and I are keeping everything under review because we want to make mortgages available to people who want to buy homes, where appropriate.  Local authority mortgages are only available if applicants have been refused credit by two lending institutions.  We will take on board all suggestions.</p><p>With regard to the issue raised, the macroprudential rules are set by the Central Bank of Ireland, which is independent of the Government.   The Minister trusts that the Senator and her party have brought their concerns regarding the classification of the cohort of buyers that she referenced to the attention of the Central Bank as part of its review of the macroprudential residential mortgage lending measures.</p><p>A key priority for the Government is the development of a fully functioning housing market that responds adequately to the needs of our citizens.  To this end, Rebuilding Ireland - An Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, was launched on 19 July last by the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  He has primary responsibility for the delivery of this action plan with cross-departmental support, including from the Departments of Finance, Health, and Social Protection.  As a complement to the structural actions contained in the action plan, a commitment to introduce a new tax-based help-to-buy incentive was also announced, with the full details of the incentive to be provided on budget day.</p><p>The Government is conscious that there is a supply shortage of housing and of the challenges individuals face in meeting the macroprudential rules for residential mortgage lending.  It is against this background that the Minister for Finance has asked his officials to design the new incentive.  One important consideration that was taken into account was that the incentive could not be designed to circumvent the requirements of the macroprudential rules but to assist home buyers in meeting the deposit aspect of those rules.  In this regard, the Senator will be cognisant of the supports that have been provided by successive Governments in recognition of the difficulties faced, in particular, by first-time buyers.  These have taken the form of grants and additional mortgage interest relief for such purchasers.</p><p>Subject to the approval of the Oireachtas, eligibility for the new incentive will be backdated to take effect from 19 July 2016.  This was the date of the publication of the action plan and the Government did not wish to cause any interruption in the housing market as a result of potential purchasers deciding to defer purchases, pending the commencement of the incentive.  The Minister for Finance will outline the full details of the incentive, including eligibility criteria and implementation method on budget day next week.  He is sympathetic to the situation of those who have had to surrender their homes on foot of a court order.  However, there are many potential scenarios in which such orders have been or will be made and it would be difficult to treat all of those scenarios in the same manner.  Some individuals may have access to a residual equity amount following such orders.  Furthermore, those who have divorced, may have had access to grants or increased mortgage interest relief by virtue of previous classification as a first-time buyer.  It would again be the case that such individuals may have sold a family home, with the proceeds being split between the parties.</p><p>There are many individuals who face the difficult task of saving the increased deposit required by the Central Bank macroprudential rules for non-first-time buyers.  However, this rule takes account of existing equity that can be available to such buyers.  The Minister has concerns that providing additional access to relief for special cases would lead to additional lobbying across the board.  Responding legislatively to difficult cases does not, in general, make good tax law or practice.  Furthermore, he is of the view that it would be inequitable to treat one class of non-first-time buyers more beneficially than another class, particularly when such individuals may have already received additional supports from the State when they first bought homes.  I hope this brings clarity to the issue for the Senator</p></speech>

He referred to homelessness but there is a housing crisis and a lack of supply.  People who are unable to secure a mortgage will end up renting for the rest of their lives and something needs to be in place for them.  To get a local authority mortgage, one has to have been refused by a bank and a building society.  This applies to first-time buyers as well.  I want to make sure everybody can get a mortgage.  I am delighted first-time buyers will get tax relief but that needs to be extended.  If it is not, the housing crisis will worsen because the core issues leading to homelessness will not have been addressed.</p></speech>

We can fix this issue if we have the full support of all Departments, the Independents and &euro;5.5 billion of taxpayers' money.</p><p>Please bear in mind that the incentives to be identified in the budget next week will target a particular sector.  It is quite clear to us that first-time buyers are finding it difficult to purchase a house due a low supply of houses.  What will be implemented in the budget next week has to do with the supply of housing.  At the moment, there is not a supply of houses for that price range or market and, therefore, we must stimulate the first-time buyers' market.  One must analyse the solutions in terms of the overall action plan and not just what will be in the budget next week to address the concerns raised here today.</p></speech>

I am somewhat disappointed that no Minister from the Department of Health is here.  This issue was raised by my colleague, Senator Devine, on an Order of Business.  Indeed, she raised the matter with the Taoiseach when he was in the House last week.</p> <p>The Minister of State will be aware that in December 2015, the Psychiatric Nurses Association of Ireland, PNAI, and SIPTU's nursing unions reached an agreement with the Department of Health and the HSE to restore full recognition of the 36-week internship from 2011 onwards.  It would appear that the Department unilaterally changed this agreement and only sanctioned recognition for those who graduated from this year onwards.  This has created the anomalous situation where nurses and midwives who graduated between 2011 and 2015 will earn less than those who graduated before 2011 and, in some cases, less than those who graduated this year.</p> <p>Apart from being discriminatory, receiving different pay for the same work is profoundly demoralising and will affect already challenging retention rates.  I do not need to remind the Minister of State of the outright failure of the bring our nurses home campaign, of the importance of retaining nurses to ensure that the winter beds initiative can be delivered and that the annual overtime agency costs, currently in the region of &euro;22 million, will be reduced.  Denying this particular cohort their incremental credit is a false economy.  I am aware that following their demonstration on 27 September, the unions met the Minister for Health who agreed that there was a pay anomaly and that he would make representations to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>I have three questions for the Minister of State present.  Why and on whose authority was it decided to change the 2015 agreement in the first place?  When and how soon will the anomaly be reversed?  Will he guarantee that the anomaly will be reversed before budget 2016?</p> <p>We are all acutely aware of the precarious nature of industrial relations right now.  We are sitting on a tinderbox.  I have called for the reopening of the Lansdowne Road agreement, as I want everybody in under the umbrella.  I believe having everybody in would suit the Government and the overall recovery policy for the country.  </p> <p>The current situation is totally unnecessary and is something that we must guard against.  I would appreciate if the Minister of State would answer my three questions.</p></speech>

I am here to speak on behalf of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe.  He was invited to attend but could not make it.  I cannot answer for the Minister for Health but I do not think he was invited.  Perhaps there is some issue there.  I will set out the scene in respect of the issue raised and answer some of the questions.</p> <p>In response to the last question on whether I can guarantee that this will be changed before budget 2016.  I cannot guarantee that because it is budget 2017 that will be announced next week.  I cannot guarantee that it will be changed then but I know about the issue and will set out the timeline.</p> <p>It was asserted that there was no consultation but that is not the case.  There has been consultation between the Department of Health, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the unions and even the Workplace Relations Commission.  Plenty of consultation has taken place.  It is unfair to say that there was no consultation but I know the point that the Senator was trying to make.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> The main issue the Senator is raising is that the INMO and other nursing unions, the PNA and SIPTU, have initiated a campaign aimed at restoring incremental credit for the 36-week clinical placement undertaken in the fourth and final year of their degree programme in respect of former nursing trainees serving in the period 2011-15.</p><p>The background to this issue is that incremental credit for the 36-week clinical placement undertaken by fourth-year student nurses was abolished by the then Government in December 2010 as part of a range of measures aimed at reducing the public service pay bill.  Prior to this decision, nurses following graduation would go onto the second point of the salary scale after 16 weeks on taking up appointment with the HSE.</p><p>The issue of the incremental credit for the trainee nurses concerned was raised during the negotiations on the Lansdowne Road agreement and, arising from this, a chairman's note to the Lansdowne Road agreement specifically provided for consideration of the matter.  The details in this regard were to the effect that incremental credit for the trainees concerned would be examined in the context of nurse and midwifery recruitment and retention.  This process of examination involving the relevant management and union interests concluded in January 2016 and subsequently the Department of Health forwarded a business case to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform proposing the restoration of incremental credit for the student placement - for those who did not qualify for it between 2011 and the end of 2015 and future graduates.</p><p>On consideration of the business case, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform agreed to sanction the restoration of incremental credit for the clinical placement in respect of trainees "currently on placement or who will in the future be assigned a placement".  However, the DPER sanction also stated that the question of extending sanction to post-2011 nurses not in receipt of such credit may be reviewed on foot of consideration of whether the sanction granted would result in an increase in retention rates of trainee nurses in 2016 and 2017.  This requirement to review the impact of the incremental credit in terms of its effect on recruitment and retention rates among the trainee nurses concerned was considered reasonable and prudent, having regard to the original terms of reference provided for in the chairman's note to the Lansdowne Road agreement.</p><p>In this context in February 2016 the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform sanctioned recognition of the 36-week placement as qualifying for incremental credit for students on a placement in 2016 and into the future.</p><p>As mentioned already, the sanction stated that the question of awarding incremental credit for the placement to nurses who graduated between 2011 and 2015 may be reviewed on foot of consideration of whether the sanction granted in respect of 2016 graduates and future graduates results in an increase in the retention rates for these graduate nurses.</p><p>Those nurses who undertook the placement in 2016 recently completed their placements and are only now in the process of getting registered so it will only become evident in the immediate term the extent to which the restoration of the credit will result in an increase in the retention rate of graduate nurses.</p><p>There are many initiatives currently under way to improve nursing staff levels throughout the country.  The HSE is offering permanent posts to the 2016 degree programme graduates and is offering full-time permanent contracts to those in temporary posts.</p><p>The HSE launched an international staff nurse recruitment campaign which focused on attracting nurses back from the UK to jobs in Ireland last year.  There was a particular emphasis on targeting Irish nurses who left Ireland in the last few years and want to return home.  They were offered a relocation package of &euro;1,500, nursing registration costs with NMBI and funded postgraduate education.</p><p>There has been an increase of 1,163 nurses employed in the public health services, which brings us to a total of 35,538 in August 2016, numbers having fallen by 4,000 from 2007 to 2014.</p><p>Notwithstanding the terms issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to the review process on the impact of the sanction for currently serving trainee nurses, officials from the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform met recently to discuss whether there was scope to accelerate this review process for the restoration of incremental credit to 2011-15 graduates.  Furthermore, the Minister for Health has written to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform about this matter.</p><p>This issue is accordingly being reviewed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in consultation with the Department of Health with a view to bringing the matter to a conclusion at the earliest time.  However, the Senator will understand why I cannot give him a commitment on the timeframe in this regard.  I know he wanted it before the budget next week.  I cannot give him that, but he will probably be happy enough to see that there is ongoing consultation on efforts to accelerate this review process, although it was in the context of retention rates.  That gives space and flexibility for this issue to be resolved, but it will probably take a little time.</p></speech>

Indeed it is at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that this query was aimed.  I am rather shocked by the response that has been drafted for the Minister of State by the Department.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

An agreement was reached between the HSE, the Department of Health and the nursing unions and somebody at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform decided to see whether it would work for the current graduates and if it did to apply it retrospectively to the people who stayed in this country.  I met a number of nurses in Buswell's Hotel, some of whom had returned as mature students to take their nursing qualification.  By virtue of the fact they had children and were married, they could not emigrate like the remainder of their colleagues but they will go at the first opportunity.  They will do so because somebody at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform decided to see how the incentive would work with the graduates of 2016 and if it worked to perhaps apply it to the poor unfortunates who stayed in the country.  It really is not good enough.  A deal is a deal and the incremental credit should immediately be restored to the graduates of 2011 to 2015.  If there are only 1,500 of them, that is all there is, so it will not cost a fortune.  When the Minister of State goes back to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, will he ask him to have a look at this in the interests of fairness if nothing else?  We must be fair in how we deal with employees.</p></speech>

The Senator raised the issue of fairness.  We must be fair to everybody involved in the Lansdowne Road agreement and in terms of public sector pay.  There is flexibility in the agreement but it is within the agreement that solutions must be found.  A process was identified by which we could track this and if it proved to help to increase retention rates of nurses, there might be scope.  This is the process that was set out and which I understand was agreed through consultation.  Progress has been made on this, with some good changes already made over the past year or two.  A little more time and more data measuring and reviewing the figures might give us the solution the Senator desires.  The Ministers, Deputies Harris and Donohoe, desire to see more nurses working here on the front line because we need them there.  There must be fairness for all involved in the Lansdowne Road agreement and the Senator understands there must be a process in how this can be addressed.</p></speech>

She has been a frequent visitor since her appointment.  I wish to raise the issue of psychological services in west Cork, in particular child and family psychology services.  Recently, I was told by the HSE that there is a 22 month delay for a child to receive these services.  I was very shocked to learn there is a wait of 22 months in cases where early intervention is required.  The case I dealt with involved a very young child and 22 months is almost one third of that child's life.  Issues such as dyspraxia need to be dealt with at a very early stage.  Issues arise if we do not intervene early.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Tim Lombard:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2466"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Research has shown that for a child's quality of life, physical and social well-being and economic potential into the future, early intervention is important.  There has been a major cut in this service in the past few years, the restoration of which is vital.  A scheme has been put in place under which nurses are offered &euro;1,500 to return home.  What initiatives are being put in place to improve psychological services in Cork?  This is an emotive issue in that we are speaking about children, in particular.  Mothers and fathers are concerned about their children not having an appropriate start in life and every delay of one week is a major worry for them.  That parents have to wait 22 months for a first response from the HSE is shocking.  I hope provision will be made in the budget to ensure parents will not have to wait almost two years to have a child assessed.  Even at that point they are only getting a foot on the ladder in that the child will be the subject of an assessment but there will be no delivery of a service.  This is a major concern.  </p><p>I hope the Minister of State will use her powers to ensure this issue is addressed.  If it not addressed, it will impact on society.  While the development of mental health services is important, this, too, is an important issue.  With proper funding, we can address this and other mental health issues and, I hope, provide the service the people of Cork, west Cork in particular, deserve.</p></speech>

In addition to delivering interventions to service users with a wide range of clinical presentations and across different organisational environments, the service provides advice for other primary care service providers, including GPs.  The majority of referrals to the child adolescent and family psychology service are from GPs and primary care and community-based referring agents.  An increase in the number of priority referrals in primary care services represents the complexity and severity of concerns being referred for psychological input.  Some are re-referrals to the service, in respect of which assessment and intervention have been offered but difficulties have returned or are of significant complexity and impact as to require repeated blocks of intervention.  Other priority referrals relate to severity of impact on the day-to-day functioning of the child or young person and may indicate that difficulties pose a risk to his or her development, social, emotional and behavioural functioning.  </p> <p>The total number of patients on the primary care psychology service treatment waiting list in August was 1,124, of whom 523 had been waiting for longer than 52 weeks.  The CHO has an approved complement of 12 whole-time equivalent staff.  There are eight whole-time equivalents in place and recruitment of the remaining four whole-time equivalents by the HSE's national recruitment service is awaited.  A number of actions are being undertaken within the psychology service to try to reduce the waiting list, including providing drop-in clinics which result in people not joining the waiting list; maximisation of the input of training psychologists and facilitating group work and staff training in so far as possible.  Notwithstanding such actions, the increased complexity of cases has resulted in the rate of referrals significantly exceeding the rate of discharge, leading to increased waiting lists.  </p> <p>The HSE considers that the current referral rate may not truly reflect psychological need in the community.  This raises a concern that the absence of intervention at the earliest possible opportunity is likely to result in children and adolescents requiring long-term more complex intervention.  Local management is liaising with the national primary care office on further initiatives to reduce waiting times and numbers, including examining the potential recruitment of additional psychology staff for a period of 12 months to address the waiting list for those waiting longer than 26 weeks.  Separately, clinical psychologists in child and adolescent mental health services within the CHO work across eight multi-disciplinary teams.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2339"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2339&amp;amp;pid=MarcellaCorcoranKennedy&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Recruitment to CAMHS in the past 12 months with a specific remit for reducing the teams' waiting lists has successfully reduced waiting lists to fewer than 12 months in many sectors.</p><p>I can also advise the Senator that the HSE's national service plan 2016 provides dedicated funding of &euro;5 million to address psychology services in primary care through the development of early intervention and counselling for young people.  A revised model of care, focusing on facilitating better access, has been developed collaboratively by the primary care and mental health services in the HSE and is being considered by the Department of Health.</p></speech>

This all comes down to staffing, which is probably the key issue in this debate.  I would like to welcome the Minister of State's statement regarding the 12 whole-time equivalents.  However, four are still to be appointed.  The actual issue is similar to the nursing issue, namely, whether we have the correct quality of workmanship and staff available.  When we are trying to recruit staff to the sector, do we have to go abroad?  What incentives are in place to bring those living abroad here to work?</p> <p>The Minister of State previously stated during another debate that the State is trying to entice nurses home by paying them an extra &euro;1,500.  Are we going down that road in order to try to entice people to fill these roles?  It is to be hoped that if staff are recruited services can be delivered.

The industrial relations situation in Ireland is an absolute shambles and it does not seem to be improving.  We have a failed Workplace Relations Act, continuous transport strikes, threatened Garda stoppages and still no sign of the promised public service pay commission that was agreed in the confidence and supply agreement.</p> <p>A recent survey of industrial relations practitioners conducted by the Employment Law Association of Ireland showed that the majority are extremely unhappy with the new Act.  One in every two legal and industrial relations practitioners is dissatisfied with the new system.  Three in five believe that the format of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, adjudication system is inconsistent.  Two in five are dissatisfied with the quality of the adjudicating officers' rulings.  One in two had problems with how the WRC processes applications for adjournments and a few other details.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Catherine Ardagh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2473"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2473&amp;amp;pid=CatherineArdagh&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Now that the days of the employment appeals tribunal are over, when hearings were held in public and chaired by a legally trained professional, they are now held in private and treated by employers as a dry run, away from the scrutinising eye of the media.  Non-legally trained professionals adjudicate in disputes, from which inconsistent decisions stem.  Most employers and employees will appeal the decisions of adjudication officers to the Labour Court and there will be a backlog of cases in the Labour Court in the next couple of months.  It was envisaged that the current system would be more cost-effective, but it is not.  It does not provide value for money for the public and does not give aggrieved employees redress in any form.  They are the ones who will ultimately have to bear the cost of high legal fees when matters are appealed to the Labour Court, either by themselves or their employers.  I ask the Leader to call on the Minister to address the House today on the ongoing strikes hitting the country, not just the WRC.</p></speech>

It is a fully costed alternative to the failed policies on tax breaks for those who least need them which have resulted in a lack of investment in key services for those who need them the most.  For far too long, any proposal Sinn F&eacute;in has brought forward has been dismissed out of hand in an arrogant, nonsensical, illogical and obstructive manner.  I am more than happy to engage in any economic debate based on sound, solid actualities, but the schoolyard gobbledygook I have had to endure from Members of this House from whom I would have expected more only serves to expose and underpin the leprechaun economics with which we have been credited globally.  The infantile dismissals of Sinn F&eacute;in's economic policies and other policies on key areas, including health, education and rural Ireland, do an injustice to the citizens we are here to serve.</p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in's priorities are to provide for fair taxation to reduce the cost of living and invest in public services.  We have clearly shown that by using the &euro;1 billion in the fiscal space available, combined with measures to introduce tax fairness and bring about savings, we could reduce the cost of living and invest in public services, increase capital investment to build homes, schools, health facilities, undertake flood relief works, repair and maintain roads and develop an all-Ireland economy to achieve long-term growth.  We want to invest in the all-island economy to strengthen our response to Brexit, for which we have a strategy.  In the document published today we are putting forward concrete and costed proposals to deal with the uncertainty in the period ahead.  I commend the document to the Seanad and call on the Minister for Finance to consider our proposals and reconsider his plans to prioritise tax cuts over much needed investment in services that have been neglected for too long.  It is a fully costed document that makes full use of EU fiscal rules to allow for massive investment in public services, averaged out over a four-year period so as not to be limited by the fiscal space available.  This is the clearest example of an option being open to the Government and it will be interesting to see if it grasps it for the good of the people or if, as in the case of Apple, it will refuse to take it in favour of pursuing its own sectional interests.</p></speech>

Over 500 cyclists took time to tell the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, that the current allocation of funding to promote activities such as walking and cycling was a meagre 1% of total transport expenditure and totally inadequate.  Recent cutbacks in the transport budget of the Dublin City Council have potentially led to existing plans for infrastructural development to be scrapped.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Grace O'Sullivan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2467"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2467&amp;amp;pid=GraceOSullivan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is regressive, to say the least.</p><p>I was a keen rural and urban cyclist while living in the Netherlands for ten years.  It is clich&eacute;d at this stage to want to emulate the Dutch on cycling issues but there is a good reason for this.  The Netherlands has turned cycling not only into a transport solution but also into a positive attribute of the cities and regions.  A country with more cyclists is more livable and attractive, with less air pollution and traffic congestion.  It is more attractive for both inhabitants and tourists.  A fine example of this is the recently opened Waterford greenway cycling and walking system, which was largely started up on a voluntary basis.  It is open and very attractive.  It has safe infrastructure and it is already attracting tourists and allowing people of the south east to see more of their beautiful countryside along Ireland's Ancient East.</p><p>A vibrant cycling sector can serve as a source of jobs in sales, rental and repairs much as the implementation of infrastructure can provide direct employment.  Tourism is one of our largest industries.  We must always strive to ensure Ireland is welcoming and a safe destination, particularly for heritage enthusiasts who come here to see our outstanding natural beauty.</p><p>The issue of cycling safety has been brought into stark relief recently with the death of Donna Fox on the streets of Dublin and the tragic deaths of 11-year-old Tim Ross, as he was cycling to school in Offaly, and 13-year-old Daniel Roche, as he was cycling home near Drogheda.  I wish to hear from the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, whom I do not believe to be much of a sport at the moment, on what he is going to do to tackle the urgent issue of funding and restore faith in cycle safety on our roads.  I would like to hear his vision for cycling and walking in the lifetime of this Government.</p></speech>

I endorse what she said in calling on the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, to outline plans for cycle safety and increase the level of cycling on our roads.  During the term of the previous Seanad, I organised an Oireachtas all-party cycling group for those of us involved in cycling and keen to promote both cycling and greater cycle safety on roads across the country.  I hope Senator Grace O'Sullivan, other Members and I can work together to set up a similar group in the lifetime of the current Seanad.</p> <p>I welcomed the opportunity to speak to the Taoiseach and raise a number of issues with him last week when he came to the House.  Since then, we have heard from the UK Prime Minister, Ms Teresa May, on providing greater clarity on the timeline for Brexit.  I welcome the fact that we will have a further debate tomorrow at which we will be able to discuss Brexit.</p> <p>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to come to the House on a future date specifically to address a different matter I raised with the Taoiseach on Thursday, namely, the issue of Syria, the appalling bombardment of civilians in Aleppo, in particular, and the abandonment of the peace process by Russia and the Syrian Government.  We need to hear from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on the action Ireland proposes to take in ensuring a stronger stance is taken, unilaterally and at EU level, against Russia to try to bring it back to the negotiating table to ensure some respite for the besieged civilians in Aleppo.  In particular, our Minister should be calling in the Russian ambassador to explain to him the actions of the Russian Government in breaking the ceasefire and returning to this appalling bombardment.</p></speech>

However, this funding is secured in the face of one of the most difficult application processes I have ever come across in my years of completing forms.  It is not only putting off groups from applying in the first place but is also stopping many groups from being successful in pulling down much-needed funding for higher education and community activities.</p><p>I call on the Leader to invite either the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, or the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, under whose briefs this falls, to come to the House to debate the matter.  Why are Irish groups not achieving as much as they could from these funding schemes?  What efforts can be made to simplify the process?  What impact will Brexit have on agreements under Horizon 2020 already in place, which are cross-border or between universities in Ireland and the UK?  What will be the impact in 2019 when the UK formally exits?</p></speech>

The 15 October deadline is fast approaching and due to the severe downpours we experienced during our so-called summer, land conditions are particularly difficult.  It is important that farmers see that every effort is made to get this extension beyond 15 October.  I understand our friends in Northern Ireland have been successful in getting an extension.  It is possible to show reasons as to why the slurry spreading did not take place.  I urge the Minister, Deputy Creed, to seek a similar extension of the 15 October deadline in order to facilitate the spreading of slurry.</p></speech>

It would be opportune to do something in the forthcoming budget.  About 8,000 people are affected, most of them along the western seaboard.  The changes in the 2012 and 2013 budgets by the then Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, have had a very severe negative effect on farm families, many of whom do not have off-farm income.  After the collapse of the construction industry the effects for those in the west were more severe.  As against a national average of one in five working in construction, it was one in four in the west.  We know only too well the problem with agricultural commodity prices at the moment.  These farmers cannot make ends meet and cannot support their families.  They will be driven from the land unless the farm assist payment is increased.  I support the IFA's call to restore the income and child disregards.  The plight of these farmers and their families needs to be recognised.</p></speech>

PDFORRA asked me to raise the issue.  It is holding its annual conference in Cork where the matter will be further discussed.  It acknowledges that this drug provides protection against malaria, but an alternative needs to be sourced and offered in line with UN guidelines.  The Government, through its actions, is ignoring United Nations advice.  Those in the United Nations know what they are talking about at this stage.</p> <p>The side effects of Lariam include anxiety, depression, paranoia and suicidal behaviour.  Many of those due to take these drugs will not do so and these side effects are the primary reason for not taking them.  There are many cases backlogged in other countries and inquiries are taking place into the effects of Lariam on individual soldiers and their families.</p> <p>There have been far too many medical scandals in this country regarding drugs.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator M&aacute;ire Devine:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2468"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2468&amp;amp;pid=MaireDevine&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->When concerns were highlighted in the past, they were ignored.  There are 51 claims in regard to the use of Lariam at the moment.  The Department continues to say there are no plans to withdraw the drug yet it has been withdrawn and taken off the market for safety purposes.  I reiterate this decision is against the advice of the United Nations and is placing our Defence Forces at risk.  I would ask the Department of Defence to be fully cognisant of this and to act now and provide a safe alternative.</p></speech>

An analysis was undertaken over the summer months to identify the amount of commercial rates being paid in local authorities and the lack of discretion allowed to councillors.  For example, Cork County Council collected over &euro;118 million in commercial rates, which is local tax, and some &euro;27 million of that was collected from the top ten companies.  In one of the local authorities in Dublin, over &euro;314 million was collected, &euro;67 million of which was collected from the top ten companies.  The average amount paid per ratepayer in Cork is &euro;11,647 from a total of 10,200 ratepayers.  In Cork city alone, 5,500 ratepayers paid an average of &euro;10,899.</p> <p>One of the points is that discretion must be given to councillors, in particular in areas where there is a need for redevelopment of urban areas where an incentive is required.  Councillors should have discretion so rates can be adjusted for specific areas and, at the same time, that adjustment can be absorbed in the overall rate for the rest of the local authority area so it is cost neutral.  A number of councillors have raised the issue with me that they do not currently have any discretion in this area yet they are supposed to be in charge of their area.  If necessary, we need to bring in amending legislation if this cannot be done under the existing structures.  It is a very important issue, in particular in order to encourage new businesses to start out in an area businesses have moved out of or to encourage development in particular areas.  It is a discretion that should be given to individual local authorities.</p></speech>

It is one of the only sectors where investment has gone backwards in recent months in that we have seen funding cut for the design of two major greenways.  Ministers were appointed on 6 May and, since then, nearly every Minister has outlined a list of priorities.  It is 151 days since Deputy Shane Ross was appointed Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport but we have not seen a list of priorities in that 151 days.  We expect the budget next week yet we still do not know his priorities.</p> <p>Why is it important?  We have well over 200,000 people working in the tourism sector and over &euro;7 billion in revenue comes from that sector to the State coffers yet we do not know what are the Minister's priorities.  When he was on the Opposition benches, he clearly outlined his disgust and dismay in regard to the boards of the Dublin Airport Authority and the quangos.  He mentioned this with great humour at times, when he would take off his glasses and lean back and give out about the boards of Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann and several others.  Yet, since he was appointed Minister, we have never heard him remark about the appointments for which he has responsibility or how he wishes to see investment made.</p> <p>The Minister's budget is quite significant at well over &euro;1 billion and heading for &euro;2 billion since the last budget.  I would like to see the Minister come to the House to outline his priorities.  We have heard about every other Department and about him vetoing the appointment of judges, yet we have not heard of him vetoing appointments to boards over which he has control.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Kevin Humphreys:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2289"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->He has talked about investment in Waterford hospital.

We have no benchmark against which to judge him on the budget and whether he has been successful in securing investment in his area of responsibility.

A few months ago the Minister for Social Protection was out of the traps first with promises of improved conditions for councillors, while last week the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government floated a kite on councillors' conditions and remuneration.  This is not a ball for potential Taoisigh to thrash around while trying to curry favour among councillors who have had enough and are not being fooled by this showmanship.  Almost half of them are full-time councillors and their representational payment is 20% lower than that of someone on the minimum wage.

This issue has been on the agenda and needs to be addressed.  The deadline is the night of 14 October.  It is a major issue for the agricultural community following an exceptionally wet summer.  Covers in some areas are too heavy to access slurry.  Farmers are still cutting grain in my part of the world; therefore, slurry cannot be spread on the stubbed ground.  This usually happens on pig farms.  Something needs to be done for the agricultural community.  I hope the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine or the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government will examine the issue.  The derogation was taken away in Denmark and we have to be conscious of this, but 15 October is not an appropriate deadline for farmers to cease spreading slurry.  Enforcing it will create a hazard and I hope something can be done.  Addressing it should not be happen on the final day.  Farmers are spreading as much as slurry as they can because they have to.  If the decision is left to the last minute, the damage will be done and it will be no good for farmers or the environment.  The issue needs to be addressed this week, if possible, in order that farmers can have a road map.</p></speech>

Thankfully, following a great deal of hard work, diligence and commitment by a range of people on the ground in the Ardoyne and on Twaddell Avenue, the events last weekend passed off peacefully.   The agreement reached meant that immediately after the morning parades we saw the dismantling of what had become known as loyalist Camp Twaddell.  There is now a moratorium on evening parades returning along that stretch of road, which has presented, particularly in the past two and half years, major problems for community relations, community safety and the welfare and well-being of young people in local neighbourhoods.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2477"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This matter has put a huge stress on the policing budget for the city and for the North more generally.  </p><p>Last week, when I took the opportunity to raise this matter I commended the mediators and those who were involved in the negotiations that sought this agreement.  Many members and many members of the public will be familiar with Fr. Gary Donegan.  For 15 years he has been a priest in the Holy Cross area of Ardoyne.  Fr. Gary, along with his colleague, Fr. Aidan Troy, walked that dangerous and gruesome path with the girls of the Holy Cross School in 2001.  Those images stay with us but Fr. Gary, unlike those of us who watched the events unfold on television and from afar, stomped those pathways with the young girls and their families.  He endured horrific and horrendous verbal, psychological and physical abuse as a result.  He has been a steadfast leader and a great shepherd for his people in that community that has been tested with the killings, the legacy of the conflict, and with suicide rates that are, unfortunately, exceptionally high in the area.  He has administered to people in very difficult times.  Therefore, I was astounded that people would choose to attack Fr. Gary on Saturday morning.</p></speech>

He has been a great friend to the process of reconciliation and peace building in the North.</p> <p>What we saw manifest on the streets on Saturday morning in no way represents the people of Ardoyne.  They are a very proud, good and far-sighted community who have lent their support to this positive agreement and will continue to do so.  The people who attacked Fr. Gary used the same tactics that were used not just against the girls of Holy Cross School but against him in the past.  A clear message must be sent from both Houses of the Oireachtas that Fr. Gary has our full support.</p></speech>

Everyone in this House will be aware that last week was Carbon Monoxide Awareness week.  The reason I raise this matter today is that this is a preventable issue.  The risk of carbon monoxide poisoning is something that we should be aware of 365 days a year and not just for one week.  The campaign was a timely reminder to us all of the importance of increased awareness of carbon monoxide.  Due to the fact that it is a colourless and odourless gas it is highly dangerous.  Every year people die unnecessarily from carbon monoxide poisoning in this country while many more people attend accident and emergency departments and GP services with symptoms such as nausea, headaches, breathlessness and vomiting.</p> <p>I ask the Leader to schedule a debate on this important issue as I know other Senators are concerned about this matter.  Senator Norris was a co-sponsor of a Private Members' Bill that was tabled by former Senator, Mr. Feargal Quinn, two years ago.  The legislation was called the Building Control (Carbon Monoxide Detection) Bill 2014.  My party colleague, Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill, spoke on the legislation at the time.  Carbon monoxide awareness is a major issue for families, homeowners and landlords.  Responsibility for the issue falls between two Ministers - the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, and the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney.</p> <p>The State, through the 31 local authorities, is the largest landlord in this country.  The local authorities have made provision in their 2016 budgets to receive rental payments of &euro;391 million from local authority tenants.  The role played by each local authority is crucial.  I want to know whether they are meeting their legal and statutory obligations in terms of ensuring that all domestic boilers are serviced annually.  On foot of information supplied to me by elected local authority members, I have submitted detailed queries on this matter to the chief executive of each local authority.  I have asked them to outline the number of local authority homes in their areas and the corresponding number of boilers that have been serviced in the each of the past five years in the same areas.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Keith Swanick:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2459"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2459&amp;amp;pid=KeithSwanick&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Everyone in this House has heard of the hippocratic oath, which I have taken.  There is a phrase in it that everyone knows instinctively but which is often overlooked when it comes to public policy.  It reads, "prevention is preferable to cure".  Illnesses and deaths from accidental carbon monoxide poisoning are preventable; therefore, I urge the Leader to arrange a debate on this and related matters in the coming weeks during which we can examine proposals that would place a much greater onus on landlords and the State to ensure safety standards are maintained.</p></speech>

For many years I have referred to the situation of self-employed persons who pay tax and PRSI but receive no social welfare benefits if they need them, despite the fact that the people they employ in their businesses receive them.  I understand the Government is considering this issue and that there may be some changes.  Today on the wireless I heard a man talk about the fact that he had taken out a pension policy 15 or 20 years ago.  He paid &euro;500 a month into the scheme.  When he retired or his business collapsed or whatever happened, he discovered that the pension scheme into which he had paid was absolutely useless because the value of the pension was being subtracted from the value of the State pension.  That meant he received absolutely no benefit.  He had literally been throwing his money away.  It was of no use to him whatsoever, apart from perhaps the satisfaction of realising he was saving the State a small amount of money.  I successfully raised this issue in the House many years ago in the case of a blind person who had gained a place as a PhD student in Trinity College Dublin.  The local authorities were subtracting the value of the scholarship from his blind pension payment.  I thought this was unconscionable and did get movement on the issue.  This injustice perpetrated against the self-employed, in a period when we are looking for as many entrepreneurs as possible, is a substantial discouragement.  Why should the man in question not get the benefit of the pension scheme into which he paid for many years?  I ask the Leader to suggest to the Government that it address this issue in the forthcoming budget.</p></speech>

It arose from its disgraceful and vindictive decision to summarily close the bank account belonging to the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign.  It would be bad enough for any bank to make this decision, but Bank of Ireland is not any bank; it is a bank that was bailed out by taxpayers and in which we have a shareholding, yet it is now acting as the agent for the apartheid state of Israel.  It is beyond a disgrace.  As a Bank of Ireland customer my entire life, I will be changing my bank account and urge others to do the same.  However, beyond this, I ask the Minister for Finance who represents taxpayers who do business with the bank to come into the Chamber to explain what he will do about its disgraceful, vindictive and malicious behaviour.</p></speech>

The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom has outlined broadly her position, while the Taoiseach outlined to the Cabinet today what action we were taking.  However, we need a dedicated Minister for Brexit, someone who would have complete control over all of the negotiations on the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union.  The Government must insist on Ireland having a representative at ministerial or ambassadorial level at the negotiations, at the negotiating table, as this is the only country, unfortunately, which has a land border with the United Kingdom.  None of the other 26 countries in the European Union has a land border with it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Terry Leyden:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=636"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=636&amp;amp;pid=TerryLeyden&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is a very special case and the Government must lay down to the European Union that we must have representatives at the negotiating table at the most senior level.  Anything else would be unacceptable.  The Government has leverage in this regard.  We voted in the first instance to reject the Lisbon treaty and we probably made the right decision because it contained the Article 50 option to opt out which has allowed this disaster for the European Union to take place.  From my experience as representative of the Government from 1989 to 1992 dealing with the Single European Act and the negotiator on behalf of the former Department of Industry and Commerce, Britain worked very hard to get the best possible deal over a very long period since it joined and it succeeded.  It is a shame it will throw away all it achieved over that period.  The more discussion there is the better.  The Joint Oireachtas Committee European Union Affairs will discuss it with the Minister of State, Deputy Murphy, at 5 p.m.  The House should have a further opportunity to discuss Brexit in the near future to monitor the developments that are taking place at a very rapid pace.</p></speech>

The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine dealt with this in recent weeks.  It is a major issue for the farming community and this is a practical way farmers can be assisted through the difficult times they face.</p> <p>The substantive issue I want to raise today is na c&uacute;nt&oacute;ir&iacute; teanga.  Will the Leader raise this with the Minister of State with responsibility for the Gaeltacht, Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne?  This is announced around this time every year and in Donegal Muintearas Teo. delivers the programme for 26 weeks across a wide range of schools, mostly in the Gaeltacht.  It has approximately &euro;42,000 less this year but initially it was asked to deal with 13 more schools.  It has advised all of the public representatives in the county it cannot do this.  When we consider the struggle the language faces, particularly in the Gaeltacht, this needs to be addressed.  There is a real problem and we are asking for a resolution.  Will the Leader raise this with the Minister of State and ask him to get back to me directly on the matter?</p></speech>

Generally around this time there tends to be a fairly concerted attack on the public service, and we see it with every budget, but I wonder whether it is more orchestrated this time.  I am not quite sure where it is coming from but we seem to have some outrageous statements being made just as the Minister is establishing a commission to inquire into public service pay.  The question of public service pensions has been given a new dynamic in this debate.  I read in today's newspaper that it is now considered that anybody who retires at the age of 60 on a Civil Service pension is a millionaire because in theory it would cost &euro;1 million to purchase the pension he or she gets.  This totally skews reality because everybody knows public servants, be they nurses, teachers, garda&iacute; or whoever, contribute to their pensions throughout their working lives.  They are soft targets for the Exchequer in everything.  They must pay for everything.  They pay their taxes and a public servant can never say he or she cannot or will not pay because someone in the public service will pay and that is a fact.  I sympathise greatly with what Senator Norris said about self-employed people and their pensions.  I know because I was that soldier.  I paid into a private pension when I was self-employed.  I can tell the House it is a bottomless pit.  Whatever entitlements one may have on the social welfare side are being eroded, so one is shovelling into two bottomless pits, to make a long story short.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ned O'Sullivan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2233"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2233&amp;amp;pid=NedOSullivan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is widely felt by people in the public service that the FEMPI measures which have impacted tremendously on their living standards over the last seven or eight years and on their pensions should be unwound.  Public sector pensions are considered to be a type of hidden crock of gold available to all public sector workers.  These people have paid all their working lives for everything and contributed massively to their pensions while trying to raise young families and so on.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, is no fool.  I am sure he will see through all of this rubbish and ensure the commission is properly chaired and produces a good report.</p></speech>

The Minister set out his views in that regard on Friday last at the Local Authorities Members Association, LAMA, conference, so I think everybody now knows where we are going in that regard.</p> <p>A few days after the UK Brexit vote I spoke about the possibility of a hard border being put in place.  I also issued a press statement on the matter.  Quite a number of people scoffed at that suggestion and said there was no possibility of that happening and that a deal would be done between Ireland and the UK in that regard.  This matter will be decided not by Ireland and the UK but the 26 remaining member countries of the EU.  There are a couple of issues of concern to me.  With the agreement of the Leader I would like the Minister for Defence to come to this House at his convenience to discuss the preparedness of the Defence Forces to man a border should that be required.  I am not saying this is what Ireland wants.  I also do not believe it is what the UK wants but there are other countries involved.  This matter may be taken out of our hands over the next number of months.  The uncertainty is so great that we must ensure we are prepared for every eventuality.</p> <p>I also ask that the Leader invite the Minister for Finance to this House to discuss the revenue implications of a hard border or soft border being imposed.  The movement of up to 30,000 people across the Border or the transportation of 1 million gallons of milk back and forth across the Border are issues that will have a massive impact on the Irish and UK economies.  We need to address this issue.  I compliment the Taoiseach on his looking at this issue in an all-Ireland capacity.  </p> <p>I ask the Leader to endeavour to have the Ministers for Defence and Finance come to the House to discuss those issues.</p></speech>

We are now days out from budget 2017.  I ask that following the budget announcement next week, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, brief this Chamber on the work of her Department and answer questions in that regard.</p> <p>I raise this issue in the context of previous budgets having ebbed away at supports for our cultural and arts communities.  Modest increases will not serve to repair our cultural landscape and years of consistent policy damage must be recognised in the forthcoming budget.  Only then can we facilitate the creation of a world class industry from the ground up.</p> <p>What is required is an immediate return of support for the Arts Council, investment in which directly impacts on employment.  Sinn F&eacute;in's alternative budget, announced this morning, commits to a &euro;10 million increase in Arts Council funding for 2017 and a &euro;500,000 increase in funding for Culture Ireland which supports Irish artists abroad, the benefits of which can be seen at festivals abroad, including Milwaukee.  Culture Ireland also supports our cultural tourism offering.</p> <p>Our film industry has endured disproportionate cuts of 50%.  Sinn F&eacute;in is committed to increasing funding for the Irish Film Board by way more than one third.  With sustained investment and resources Ireland can continue to attract big budget productions and also support the talent in our education system around the small and medium-sized production sector.</p> <p>Aside from all of this, a space must be created for our young people not only as an audience but as artists or future artists.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fintan Warfield:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2458"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We need a national youth arts strategy.

To respond to Senator Ardagh, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, who came to the House last week will appear before us again next week.  We have a voluntary mechanism for resolving industrial relations disputes.  The Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court have shown themselves to be highly effective in dispute resolution.  The issue with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is different and more precarious than other cases.  I hope all Senators will encourage members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to engage further as it is important that further talks take place.  We all acknowledge the work being done by garda&iacute;.  They should have their pay restored and conditions of service improved.  It is important, however, that they engage in talks.  I urge the Garda Representative Association to enter talks with the Minister who is available for engagement.</p> <p>Senator Conway-Walsh raised the alternative budget proposed by Sinn F&eacute;in.  I share her view that the tax system should be fair.  The middle income group, which has been squeezed most, should perhaps benefit most from the budget.  From my reading of the Sinn F&eacute;in proposals, this group would certainly not benefit much from them. </p></speech>

I join her in offering my sympathies to the families of the three cyclists who were killed, Donna Fox, Tim Ross and Daniel Roche.  Any life lost on our roads is a tragedy but it is particularly tragic when a young lad is killed while cycling to school.  We have a national cycling policy.  In light of the report from the Committee on Budgetary Oversight calling for climate change proofing, we must clearly address the issue of cycle safety.  I will be happy to have the Minister appear before the House.</p> <p>Senator Bacik, who also raised the issue of cycle safety, referred to a Private Members' Bill introduced by the Labour Party.  According to the information available to me, the relevant amendments are being finalised in the Office of the Attorney General.  They will then go before the Cabinet for approval, after which they will be tabled in the House for further debate on Report Stage.  I understand Report Stage is due to be taken by the end of October but I will revert to the Labour Party Senators on the matter.</p> <p>Senator Bacik also referred to developments in Aleppo and Syria.  I, too, encourage the Russians to engage.  They have an obligation and a duty to do so.  I note the decision by the Government of the United States to suspend talks with Russia.  All of us who are concerned about peace and the protection of life want a resolution to the war in Syria.  Having listened to the stories of some of the men and women of the Naval Service who returned from the Mediterranean last week, one cannot but view this matter as one of extreme urgency.  I will ask the Minister to come to the House.  Senator Bacik also called for a debate with the Minister for Education and Skills on the issue of higher education.  The Minister will be in the House next week for a debate on education.</p> <p>Senator Richmond raised the issue of Erasmus students at third level.  He can raise this issue with the Minister during the debate on education. </p> <p>Senators Gallagher, Lombard and Mac Lochlainn called for a derogation to be introduced in respect of the deadline for slurry spreading, which falls in ten days' time.  As the Senators noted, it is too late to provide a derogation on the day before the deadline.  If I am not mistaken, a derogation was applied several years ago.  I will raise the matter with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed.  This is an important issue because we had a large amount of rainfall over the summer and, as Senator Lombard correctly noted, crops are still being harvested on unsuitable ground.</p> <p>Senator Mulherin raised the farm assist scheme.  This is also a matter for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine who is willing to come to the House.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is just a matter of getting him to the House between the European Union, diaries and other events but he will come to the House in the next couple of weeks.</p><p>Senator Devine raised the important issue of the malaria drug.  As the Senator knows, any issue regarding medications, tetanus or injections received by members of our Defence Forces is taken by the medical officers of the Defence Forces.  Everything is done with the health and safety of those men and women who serve in mind.  The drug in question has been prescribed and my information is that all members of the Defence Forces are individually screened for their suitability and fitness.  There is no plan as yet to remove that drug from the list.  I will take the matter up with the Minister for Defence.  It is important that rather than us creating hysteria, we acknowledge that it is taken medically.  It is not a decision made by a member of the Government or by an administrative officer or by someone in the Civil Service.  It is by the medical officers of the Defence Forces.</p><p>With regard to Senator Colm Burke's contribution on commercial rates, he has raised a very important point on giving more power to local councils and local councillors.  I will bring the Minister, Deputy Coveney, into the House on this issue.  Senator Humphreys discussed the priorities of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, at that Department.  I would be happy for the Minister, Deputy Ross, to come to the House regarding that matter.  Senator Humphreys also raised the issue of cycle ways, which I have discussed already.</p><p>Senators Davitt and Craughwell both spoke on the conditions and service of members of local authorities.  I first want to compliment the Local Authorities Members Association for the very fine conference in Bantry at the weekend.  I am sure many of us attended the very positive LAMA event.  There was a great sense that reform and change are needed at local government level.  The local authority members who attended the event were concerned, not about pay and conditions, but about how they can better serve their communities.  That was the sense I got from the event.</p><p>I do not know where Senator Davitt is coming from with regard to his comments about the two Ministers, but they are the Ministers who are involved in the pension K class issue which was also raised by Senator Colm Burke.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, is the line Minister with responsibility for the role and functions of councillors.  Like Senator Craughwell, I very much hope the Minister will meet with the cross-party group which we set up in this House.  I thank the Senator for his remarks which were necessary.  For the majority of Senators who serve in this House, our constituents are the councillors, and I genuinely believe it is important that we work with one voice, in unison, not just about terms and conditions for councillors, but also how we can make local government better, and all that encompasses. </p><p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile raised the issue of the attack on Fr. Gary Donegan.  It is an appalling travesty that a reverend gentleman, who works so much to bring peace and reconciliation in the North, would be subject to this type of violence, for whatever reason.  I do not want to give it a title but I believe the attack is condemned by all in the House.  We wish him well and thank him for the work he and Fr. Aidan Troy have done.  Those of us who are interested in bringing peace to our island and in seeing our island united know that it cannot be done by this type of provocation.  It is only by working together and by bringing people together that we can achieve peace on our island.   I thank Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile for raising the matter.</p><p>Senator Swanick raised the very important issue of carbon monoxide poisoning.  It is a silent killer and is an issue we need to constantly raise, not just this week, which is carbon monoxide awareness week.  The Senator is correct when he spoke of people not realising the importance of having their boiler, the gas fire in their house or the boiler lights checked or whatever servicing is required.  I would be happy to have the Minister or the Ministers, because it does fall between two Departments, come to the House regarding that matter.</p><p>Senator Norris raised the matter of the self-employed.  However, he neglected to commend Senator Ray Butler who had a Private Members' Bill before the House before the summer.  I am pleased the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, is looking at the PRSI contribution of the self-employed.  I will come back to Senator Norris regarding that issue.</p><p>Senator Gavan spoke about the Bank of Ireland and the Palestinian solidarity campaign account.  I cannot give answers as to why Bank of Ireland has done this.  I know that bank accounts across parts of Europe have been closed also.  It is a matter for the bank to give its reasons.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I understand there was some correspondence with the group in early summer, based on what I read in newspapers and online.

I do not know who make the decision, but he or she needs to communicate the reasoning rather than leaving a vacuum.</p><p>Senator Leyden raised the very important issue of Brexit.  As he is aware, the Government has discussed the issue and planned for the eventuality of a Brexit vote which has, unfortunately, happened.  In the D&aacute;il today and during the weekend the Taoiseach outlined that this is a priority for the Government and every Department.  The Government has developed specific structures around Brexit.  For the information of the House, Enterprise Ireland, the IDA and Bord Bia are working closely with small Irish businesses to help to manage the many practical implications of Brexit.</p><p>A new Cabinet committee dedicated to Brexit and chaired by the Taoiseach has been established.  It will oversee the overarching Government response to Brexit and the Department of the Taoiseach will co-ordinate the cross-Government sectoral approach, with a new division led by a second Secretary General in the Department of the Taoiseach.  There will be a bigger and enhanced role for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on EU matters, including the transfer of staff from the Department of the Taoiseach to that Department.  More strength will be given to the relevant Government Departments, agencies and overseas missions to ensure they are on top of Brexit, along with ensuring that the North-South axis is not forgotten.</p><p>Senator Craughwell made a very important point about the hard border versus the soft border.  There was a very interesting article in the<i>Irish Examiner</i>today - I am not sure if the Senator read it.  It is a matter about which we need to be very clear.  We cannot allow a hard border to return.</p></speech>

I think I speak for all of us in the House when I say we do not want to have a hard border return.  It would be economically unsound, unwise and wrong for us as a country.  That is the overwhelming view of Members.</p> <p>Senator Mac Lochlainn referred to the Gaeltacht.  If he wants to give me the details later, I would be happy to have them sent to the Minister directly.  The Government is committed to coming to the House regarding the Department.  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh raised the matter last week.  The Minister is willing to come to the House; it is a matter of selecting dates.</p> <p>Senator Ned O'Sullivan raised the issue of public service pensions and budget kite flying.  It is important that we have a debate about the role of public servants and the manner in which, in some cases, they are being pilloried and viewed by some commentariats.  It is important that we have a debate on the role of public services, the way in which we can fund them and the work that is being done. </p> <p>It is clear that some Ministers will engage in kite flying.  I wish they did not because sometimes they scare people or create panic.  On other occasions, it gives people like Senator O'Sullivan an opportunity to fly kites.  In this case, it is an issue that should be debated.</p> <p>Senator Warfield raised the very important issue of the arts.  I was aware that the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, had not come before the House.  I will again take the points he raised.  We have a world-class industry and if one travels the world one finds the Irish diaspora is empowered by our music, song, dance and creative arts.  It is important that we have that debate.  I recently attended a screening of "The Young Offenders" which was filmed in Cork.  It was a fantastic film and a great advertisement for our film industry.  In particular, it wove in the strands of tourism, culture and our people.  The Senator's points are very well made and I would be happy to have the Minister come to the House.  Again, it is a matter of finding the time and a suitable date.  I will endeavour to have her come before the House.</p></speech>

It is important to clarify that no other companies are subject to this decision by the European Commission and there are no other impending state aid cases against Ireland.  As Commission Vestager has stated clearly, &ldquo;This decision does not call into question Ireland&rsquo;s general tax system or its corporate tax rate".</p> <p>The Government profoundly disagrees with the Commission&rsquo;s analysis in the Apple investigation and will challenge the decision before the European courts.  Our position throughout this process has been that the full amount of tax was paid in Ireland and no state aid was provided.  Ireland did not give favourable tax treatment to Apple.  Ireland does not do deals with taxpayers.  In September, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann passed a motion supporting the Government&rsquo;s decision to appeal the European Commission&rsquo;s decision.  </p> <p>The European Commission first wrote to Ireland in June 2013 asking for information on the practice of tax rulings in Ireland.  In particular, it requested information on any rulings granted in favour of Apple.  The Commission later formalised the process when it publicly announced a full investigation into the dealings between the State and Apple in June 2014, giving its preliminary view that there was state aid.  Ireland co-operated fully with the Commission&rsquo;s inquiries.  Over the course of the three-year investigation, detailed and comprehensive responses were provided to the Commission demonstrating that the appropriate amount of Irish tax was charged, no selective advantage was given and there was no state aid.</p> <p>In August 2016, the Commission made public certain details of its decision in a detailed press release.  The Commission has yet to publish the final decision, which is a technical and detailed legal document that has been addressed to the State.  Both Ireland and Apple are being given an opportunity to identify material within the decision which is subject to commercial confidentiality and which must therefore be redacted.  Ireland is offering every assistance to the Commission under this process.  However, it must be noted that the company also has the opportunity to exercise its rights in the matter.  The procedure mirrors that which was used for the cases against the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, where it took several months for the Commission to make a copy of the decisions publicly available.  This approach is also consistent with the process that was followed for the Commission&rsquo;s opening decision in the Apple case in 2014.  In order to be as transparent as possible and to allow for the appropriate public debate on the issue, I asked my Department to make an explanatory memorandum on the case available.  This was published on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p> <p>In September the Government authorised me to appeal the Commission decision to the European courts.  This is necessary to defend the integrity of our tax system, to provide tax certainty to business and to challenge the encroachment of EU state aid rules into the sovereign member state competence of taxation.  Given that we are now facing an important court process in which Ireland will articulate a robust challenge to the Commission&rsquo;s position, I am mindful of the need to avoid cutting across Ireland&rsquo;s legal case in my contribution here today.  That said, I feel it is important for this debate that I outline, in high-level terms, what I believe are the key persuasive arguments for taking an appeal.</p> <p>It is simply untrue that Ireland provided favourable treatment to Apple.  The chairman of the Revenue Commissioners has stated emphatically that there was no departure from the applicable Irish tax law by Revenue, that there was no preference shown in applying that law and that the full tax due was paid in accordance with the law.  It is very damaging for our reputation to be called into question on this.  It affects how Ireland could be treated by other jurisdictions, damages Ireland&rsquo;s credibility in the international tax debate and inhibits Ireland in pressing arguments that serve our national interest.</p> <p>A further concern is that the Commission is undermining the fundamental principle of international tax: that tax should be paid where the value is created.  Everyone knows that the iPhone and other well-known Apple products were developed in the US and not in Ireland.  Pascal Saint-Amans from the OECD made this very point when he visited Dublin last week.</p> <p>A central aspect of this case is that the companies concerned were not tax resident in Ireland.  Under Irish tax law, non-resident companies are chargeable to Irish corporation tax only on the profits attributable to their Irish branches.  This means that profits of such companies that are not generated by their Irish branches cannot be charged with Irish tax under Irish tax law.  Examples include profits from technology, design and marketing that are generated outside Ireland.  The US Treasury has expressed a concern that in such cases the recovery sum could be creditable against a company&rsquo;s US tax bill.  If so, the company&rsquo;s US tax liability would be reduced dollar for dollar by these recoveries in the event that the offshore earnings are repatriated or treated as repatriated as part of a possible US tax reform.  This would effectively constitute a transfer of revenue to the EU from the US Government and its taxpayers.  The US Treasury has described this outcome as "deeply troubling".</p> <p>The European Commission has stated that the sums to be recovered by Ireland would be reduced if other countries were to require Apple to pay more taxes or if the US authorities were to require Apple to pay larger amounts of money to its US parent company.  This points to a clear contradiction at the heart of the European Commission&rsquo;s decision.  While requiring Ireland to recover the tax sums, the Commission is also acknowledging that the sums may in fact be taxable in other jurisdictions. </p> <p>Taxation is a core member state competence, which is enshrined in EU tax treaties.  This decision encroaches on member state sovereignty in the area of tax, by extending competition rules into the tax area to an unprecedented and unjustified extent.  By doing this the Commission creates uncertainty for business and investment in the European economy, both in its novel interpretation of longstanding rules and their unfair retroactive application.</p> <p>It is important to emphasise that the bringing of appeal proceedings is not in any way an endorsement of aggressive tax planning arrangements, nor is it a defence of the extremely low effective tax rates that can be achieved under the broken international tax system.  The reaction to the European Commission&rsquo;s decision has, at times, painted an outdated and unfair caricature of Ireland&rsquo;s position on tax that is at odds with the evidence and overlooks our proven track record in recent years.  The facts show our constructive engagement at the international table, with early implementation of reforms ahead of many of our partner countries.</p> <p>Despite the decision, Ireland remains committed to international efforts to reform international tax rules to ensure the correct tax is paid by multinationals in the correct place.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Michael Noonan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=821"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=821&amp;amp;pid=MichaelNoonan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Our view remains that it is important that this is done in the appropriate way, moving forward in tandem with other countries on the basis of a global consensus.</p><p>On foot of the Commission&rsquo;s decision, Ireland is required to recover up to &euro;13 billion of alleged state aid from the company covering a ten-year period.  Notwithstanding the right of appeal, Ireland is legally obliged to recover that alleged state aid from Apple in the interim.  This may be placed in a ring-fenced escrow account pending the outcome of legal proceedings.</p><p>Some of the public debate on the case has focused on an attitude of "take the money and run".  The Government disagrees with that position.  The European Commission has stated that the sums to be recovered by Ireland would be reduced if other countries were to require Apple to pay more taxes or if the US authorities were to require Apple to pay larger amounts of money to its US parent company.  This means that the final figure is by no means certain and may be the subject of complex, drawn-out engagement with other countries for many years to come.  It should be clear that the Irish position all along has been that we have no right to this money based on Irish tax law.  Therefore, the ultimate entitlement of Ireland to this tax revenue in the face of competing claims from other jurisdictions is highly uncertain.  Furthermore, the figures remain subject to legal proceedings by Apple.  Regardless of any Irish appeal, if Apple was to be successful in its appeal, the full amount would have to be repaid to the company.</p><p>In conclusion, the Government is of the view that there was no breach of state aid rules in this case and that the legislative provisions were correctly applied.  By appealing the decision, the Government is taking the necessary course of action to vigorously defend the Irish position.  Ireland has done nothing wrong.  We have a proven track record in international tax reform and a strong commitment to meeting the best international standards.  I look forward to listening to Senators&rsquo; statements on this important issue.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to speak today on the European Commission&rsquo;s decision that Ireland provided unlawful state aid to Apple.  Fianna F&aacute;il supports the decision to appeal the decision.  Providing a competitive, consistent and certain tax policy is a key feature of Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness as a leading location for foreign direct investment.  The European Commission&rsquo;s unprecedented and deeply misleading &euro;13 billion decision on the Apple case is a direct challenge to that.  Approximately 700 US multinationals are located in Ireland, with some 187,000 people employed by foreign direct investment firms.  All are potentially affected by the decision&rsquo;s implications.</p> <p>Government hesitation has only worsened the impact.  The European Commission&rsquo;s judgment marks a decisive overreach of EU power into national tax matters.  Ireland must veto moves towards a common consolidated tax base and fight its corner to defend our national sovereignty and attractiveness for investment.  Additionally, we must continue to work to lead the way in progressing international efforts to curb tax avoidance.</p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il supports the decision to appeal the case for a number of reasons.  First, Ireland has done nothing wrong and is entitled to set a competitive tax regime to attract foreign direct investment.  The Revenue Commissioners fully applied Irish law as set out by the Oireachtas.  The rights of member states to set their own tax policy has been consistently upheld and affirmed in EU treaties.  There was no special treatment for Apple.</p> <p>Second, the decision is essentially a power grab by the European Commission.  It marks a move by the EU to unilaterally expand its power and use competition law on state aid to interfere with national tax matters.  The astounding figure is designed to soften the ground before the controversial common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB, measure is relaunched later this year.  This forms part of a broader agenda to set a common corporate tax rate across the EU and is being discussed at this weekend&rsquo;s Economic and Financial Affairs Council meeting in Bratislava.</p> <p>Third, retrospectively rewriting tax rules undermines tax certainty for all companies.  A core feature of our attractive tax package is certainty, which allows companies to plan for the future.  The European Commission&rsquo;s decision effectively retrospectively rewrites our tax rules over a 25-year period and threatens that key pillar.</p> <p>Fourth, Ireland is not the chief tax collector for companies based here.  The European Commission position is inconsistent as it claims Ireland is owed the &euro;13 billion but also that other countries are or could be due the money.  Ireland is not the international tax collector for all those companies based here.  Our legal responsibility is to implement Irish tax rules.  We have already taken the lead in implementing changes to our tax laws to combat aggressive tax planning.</p> <p>Despite negative internal and international criticism, Ireland has a strong, attractive corporate tax regime and has ensured we have led the way in addressing concerns on tax avoidance by big companies.  Fianna F&aacute;il strongly believes this should continue to be our priority while ensuring we uphold our ethical and international obligations.  Ireland&rsquo;s 12.5% corporate tax rate is one of the lowest in Europe and is an iconic feature of our overall tax package for businesses.  In addition, our research and development tax credit is best in its class.  The knowledge box 6.25% rate was the first globally to receive OECD approval.</p> <p>The global backlash against multinational corporations avoiding tax through aggressive planning has already prompted a significant shift in Irish taxation policy.  The Apple ruling refers to a historic taxation situation.  We have led the way in developing new methods to ensure companies pay their fair share and are deeply engaged in the OECD base erosion and profit shifting process, BEPS.  For example, the controversial &ldquo;double Irish&rdquo; was ended in 2014 to ensure shell companies could not avoid tax bills.  Stateless issues were addressed to ensure Irish companies could not avoid tax.  We have implemented country-by-country reporting and ensured the knowledge box was OECD approved, the first in the world to do so.</p> <p>Ireland will continue to fully engage with the OECD process and EU initiatives, such as the action plan for fair and effective taxation.  However, any EU measures effectively designed to standardise corporate tax rates must be fully resisted.  This weekend&rsquo;s discussion by Ministers of the Economic and Financial Affairs Council in Bratislava must be used to set down a firm marker that Ireland will not relinquish control of our domestic taxation policy.  It must also be used to engage with potential allies in this policy discussion in the EU, in particular with countries such as the Netherlands and Luxembourg.</p> <p>There are broader implications.  The European Commission&rsquo;s decision also exposes the serious geopolitical challenges Ireland faces in the immediate future.  Our successful economic model has drawn on foreign direct investment and our membership with the EU, as well as deep trading links with our historic closest partner, the UK.  Tensions between these parties are now increasingly evident.  Brexit represents a serious diplomatic challenge and the prospect of the UK ramping up competition for foreign direct investment is very real.  The EU has escalated efforts to introduce a common tax rate - for example, the CCCTB proposals are to be relaunched.  Meanwhile, the EU has launched a series of actions against US multinationals that puts pressure on our role as a leading location for foreign direct investment.  Any slide towards protectionism or a power grab by Europe would deal a serious blow to our geopolitical strategy.</p> <p>The botched response of the Government to the European Commission&rsquo;s findings exacerbated the impact of the decision.  Instead of moving swiftly to reassure the foreign direct investment community of our continued commitment, it publicly hesitated and fretted over this illusionary &euro;13 billion.  The Government needs to send out a strong, clear and unambiguous message that it will vigorously contest the European Commission ruling.  Our commitment to a fair 12.5% corporate tax regime must be re-affirmed as the cornerstone of our foreign direct investment policy.  Our membership of the EU remains a core belief of Fianna F&aacute;il but we must be willing to fight our own corner from within the European tent.  Ireland must veto any moves towards the CCCTB and fight its corner to defend our national sovereignty and attractiveness for investment.  Additionally, we must continue to work to lead the way in progressing international efforts to curb tax avoidance.  I thank the Minister for attending and I look forward to his response.</p></speech>

It has been over a month since the European Commission ruled in favour of the Irish people who pay their taxes and demanded that Apple do likewise.  Immediately, even before he had seen the decision, the Minister indicated that this State would appeal a decision to return a decade of unpaid tax deemed by the Commission to be due to the Irish people.  At the time, my colleagues, Deputies Pearse Doherty and Gerry Adams, urged the Minister not to do this and made very sound arguments in this regard.</p> <p>I come from an area where small and medium businesses are struggling.  After they have paid their tax demands, there is very little money left to expand or to make improvements and, in some cases, they do not even have a decent wage themselves.  Nothing in the Governments response gives any comfort to these people.  Indeed, what we got from the Minister was a sudden, overwhelming and false conversion to the importance of Irish sovereignty - this from the Government that went against the interest of its own people so as not to be embarrassed or have "defaulter" stamped on its forehead in front of European colleagues.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->People do not believe the Government line that all this came as a surprise to them.  Just like Brexit, this was coming down the tracks for a long time and the Government did what it always does, namely, wait until the last minute.</p><p>This Government was behind on many issues.  When my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, raised the issue of the double Irish he was told by the Minister that it was not our problem.  When he raised the issue of stateless companies he was told that he was a rabble rouser who could damage Ireland's reputation.  When I asked the Minister, at the National Economic Forum back in June, if he could quantify the loss to the State of tax avoidance by vulture funds he chose to ignore the question.  Likewise on this issue, the Government is fobbing off Sinn F&eacute;in.</p><p>This is a Government stuck in the 1990s when it comes to international tax.  It is being dragged, kicking and screaming, into the 21st century.  Some of the reaction to our alternative budget launched today is very similar - a repetition of the mantra that we in Sinn F&eacute;in do not get economics.  The public has been gifted the clearest example yet of who really does get economics.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in say that we should take the &euro;13 billion owed to us for the betterment of our people and to send out a clear message that while we welcome multinationals, we have a fair approach to taxation.  This is nothing to do with our 12.5% corporation tax rate.  This has been put out there as a red herring and the claim is that it is part of tax harmonisation but it is nothing of the kind.</p><p>Fine Gael states that we should not take it because it would expose it as complicit in a grubby deal that served the privileged few.  Now that we have had time to digest the fact that the Minister is going ahead and appealing this ruling, there are a couple of points I want to raise with him.  How much will the appeal cost?  Is there a bottomless pit of money from hard-working Irish citizens?  Why do we not just let Apple appeal, without the involvement of the Irish Government?  Who benefits from the decision to appeal?  So far, all we know is that William Fry has been engaged to advise the Government in setting up an escrow account.  The country certainly will not benefit but a tax servicing company will.</p><p>Listening to some people here one would believe that the idea that state aid and tax ever collide is something unprecedented, unheard of.  In fact, the Minister for Finance recently told my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, that Ireland had sought the opinion of the European Commission on 15 separate occasions regarding our tax policy in the last ten years.  The issues ranged from looking at a refund of social security contributions for seafarers to changes to the Irish film tax relief system.  In short, it is a normal, mundane thing for the European Commission to look at the state aid implications of what the Revenue Commissioners do.  </p><p>Once again, I ask that the Minister reconsider his decision to appeal and accept the tax money owed to the Irish people.  I am asking this on behalf of all the people who struggle to get by, yet manage to pay their taxes.  I am asking him because he knows that, globally, up to $240 billion are lost each year as a result of countries, like ours, facilitating tax avoidance.  His positive rhetoric on reforming tax law is belied by this Government's failure to clamp down on tax avoidance on a vast scale.  He must put an end to the tax secrecy which has facilitated tax cheating on a major scale and denied Irish people an economy that serves all its citizens and not just those in the golden circle.</p></speech>

She is peddling false propaganda.  The &euro;13 billion is not available to the Irish public.  If she were to read the Apple ruling and the 2014 ruling she would see that they were contradictory.  They mentioned the &euro;13 billion but said some of it could belong to the US.  Subsequent to that, the OECD has said that the majority of the money is liable to US tax.  Putting it out to the public that this &euro;13 billion is available is irresponsible, it is an untruth and it does not deal with the arguments at hand.</p> <p>The Senator spoke about taxpayers but Apple employs some 6,000 people in Cork.  They pay PAYE and PRSI like anyone else.  They are educating their children and paying their mortgages, a point she is completely overlooking.</p></speech>

The Senator spoke about sovereignty but as a sovereign nation we have to have control over our tax laws.  Apple was in compliance with the tax laws that were in place at the time in question.  The European Commission now states that the taxes in question may be due to other countries in Europe and the US.</p> <p>I question the timing of the European Commission's announcement, whether it is to do with the US elections or something else.  I question the fact that the decision has not been published.  We expect it to be a carbon copy of the June 2014 decision so nothing appears to have changed in the past two years.  There will be confidentiality issues but I ask for it to be published as quickly as possible.  We are a small, open economy and we have to be able to attract multinational companies in a global market.  We have a 12.5% corporation tax rate that is probably the most transparent corporation tax rate in the world.  France and other countries have a multitude of tax deals with particular corporations.  The difference between the profits and the taxable profits of a company in Ireland is very little.</p></speech>

This issue will come down to the question of selectivity and whether Apple was given selective treatment on a particular issue.  The answer is "No".  It was open to any company to avail of the same tax laws that were in operation at that particular moment in time.</p> <p>I worry about the fact that the common consolidated tax base, which has been mooted for several years, is coming up on the radar again.  I worry that it could be used as a Trojan Horse to get at our 12.5% rate.  I welcome the fact that the European Commission has stated that our 12.5% rate is not under attack but I would be vigilant on the common consolidated tax base because it is such a complicated and convoluted proposal that, while the 12.5% rate might remain, in practical terms it could be eroded.  </p> <p>I was watching the BBC on Sunday and saw Theresa May speaking at the Conservative Party conference about Brexit.  It is not in Britain's interest not to be part of the Single Market and it certainly is not in our interest.  I welcome the fact that the Taoiseach has today set up an all-Ireland dialogue on the matter.  Northern Ireland and the Republic have far more in common on this issue than they have differences.  We should work together on a cross-party basis and I ask all parties to engage because it is in the interests of all of us to protect our vital trade links, our common travel area and the open Border.</p> <p>I think the European Commission has got this wrong, though I accept there is a need for certainty in the way multinational companies are taxed worldwide.  That is happening with BEPS and, in respect of our own situation, the double Irish is no longer in place.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Kieran O'Donnell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2207"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2207&amp;amp;pid=KieranODonnell&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have the knowledge box, which is very beneficial.  We, as a country, cannot take responsibility for differences in tax laws worldwide.  We can only apply our own tax laws.  One could equally make the case that other countries should have changed their own tax laws.  I very much support the appeal in the Apple case.  Ireland needs certainty over how we tax companies.  The rate of 12.5% is sovereign.  With regard to the key issue of selectivity, it will be found that Apple was not given a selective agreement and that it was open to any company worldwide to apply for it in Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-10-04a.125" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1405" speakername="Alice Mary Higgins" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016100400002#PP00200"><p>A number of concerns have been raised today and I will not reiterate all of them.  I will build on the point of the last speaker.  He is correct in saying the arrangement between Ireland and Apple is not simply a matter between Ireland and Apple.  This is a key point.  The arrangement we hear of is likely not only to have deprived citizens in Ireland of much-needed resources but also citizens across Europe and the world.  The &euro;13 billion may not be directed to Ireland but it is, none the less, &euro;13 billion that was not paid in tax and revenue.</p> <p>Apple's use of a stateless entity, notionally located in Ireland, results in countries not only in Europe but also the Middle East, India and, to a lesser extent, Africa seeing the profits generated in their regions channelled away from their local tax authorities into Apple Sales International in Ireland.  Until the European Commission's ruling is publicly available &mdash; we may need to return to this issue at that time &mdash; it will not be possible to know how much the various countries in each of these regions have been deprived of.  While the bulk of the profit is likely to have been generated in Europe, even a relatively small amount in an African context has the potential to deprive some of the world&rsquo;s poorest countries and most vulnerable people of transformative and life-saving resources.  In 2011, for example, the entire health budget of Sierra Leone was just under &euro;25 million, a mere 0.21% of the &euro;13 billion that Apple is being asked to repay.  This money has a huge, transformative role to play in revenue. </p> <p>There are serious moral questions attached to this matter for our Government, whose aid programme is rightly lauded across the world as being among the best in the world, and whose recently updated foreign policy places human rights at its centre.  Moreover, Ireland played a key role in negotiating the sustainable development goals, SDGs, which are universal goals that should be applied in Ireland and all countries.  How, then, can we stand over past or future tax policies that could undermine the ability of developing countries to raise the revenue they need to deliver on SDGs or meet their human rights obligations?  If we continue on this path and do not accept the problems we have caused through these practices, irrespective of whether the arrangement was peculiar to Apple, we will risk damage, not only to the other countries affected but also to our international reputation.  That is why we need to embrace this issue strongly.  We need to accept there are tax justice issues we need to address and place this thinking at the centre of our response to the Apple tax issue. </p> <p>The Apple case is, of course, not a one-off; it is part of a damaging race to the bottom in which governments are competing across the world in providing multinationals with lower tax bills.  This is a recipe for disaster for tax-funded public services across the world.  Tax arrangements of both multinationals and governments must be brought into the open.  When deals are done behind closed doors, the general public loses out.  It is interesting that the Government proposes this very month to sign up to the provisional application of the comprehensive economic trade agreement, CETA, an agreement that will give corporations unprecedented access to and influence over the regulatory process and public policy-making, yet those corporations are still afforded extraordinary secrecy.</p> <p>Multinationals like Apple must be obliged to publish the country-by-country tax reports that they are already making to governments so that they can be subjected to public scrutiny.  To date, the Government has resisted calls to be a voice championing the "publish what you pay, country-by-country" tax report.  I ask that Ireland now take a lead on that.  Even if Ireland&rsquo;s tax policy is to be based on competing with other states on lower taxes, the very least it can and should do is insist on the highest level of transparency from multinationals operating in the State.  Public country-by-country reporting would be an important step in that direction, and it would restore some faith in Ireland's beleaguered reputation. </p> <p>The Committee of Public Accounts should also have a role in reviewing the use of previous rulings by multinational companies.  These rulings are not currently debated in the Oireachtas, nor are they subject to political oversight outside the office of the Minister for Finance.  I ask that the Minister support and facilitate greater oversight and a clear role for the Committee of Public Accounts in regard to these rulings. </p> <p>The Government has agreed in response to the Apple ruling that it will host a high-level tax conference before the end of this year.  I ask the Minister to assure us that there will be a strong tax justice element to the conference.  I also ask him to ensure that the independent review of Irish corporation tax policy, which is due to take place, be open to consultation with the public and the Oireachtas.  I recognise absolutely that the tax rate of 12.5% will not be part of that review.  That is fine but we would restore faith in a rate of 12.5% if it became an effective tax rate of 12.5% and if we took the lead in terms of transparency in other areas. </p> <p>I wish to point to the concerns raised over tax sovereignty.  It is important to note that while we are saying the European Commission has got it wrong and that we have a different position, we should note that the Commission also has a different position on the scope of the provisional application of the CETA because it believes this is entirely an EU competency.  It believes the European Commission has sole responsibility.  Ireland and other member states have a different view on this.  How will we reconcile these views?  Why would we sign up to the provisional application of the trade agreement when we have seen what this kind of difference in view or position leads to?  Will tax be the only area in which we care about sovereignty or will we be asserting sovereignty in other areas, such as public services, workers rights and environmental provision?  In that regard, are we going to wait until the court case in the European Court of Justice before we run ahead and sign on provisional application?</p></speech>

It was inevitable that an appeal would be launched, if only by Apple itself, and it was inconceivable that Ireland, as a sovereign nation with responsibility for its own tax affairs, would sit this one out given the absolute enormity of the matter in hand and the impact on this State of the decision and on our industrial policy and reputation, as already stated.  I sincerely hope that the State&rsquo;s case will be advanced in a better fashion than that evident from the confusion that seemed to characterise the Government&rsquo;s initial response to the Commission&rsquo;s decision.</p> <p>There are enormous issues at stake in the context of the Apple decision.  It is clear to all of us, including the Minister, that all the facts are still not available, and we may not know all of them for some years.  Important issues will arise in the context of the appeal hearings and the processes, which will provide us all with a better understanding of the rationale for the Commission&rsquo;s decision.  However, we, as a sovereign Parliament and sovereign Government of a member state of the European Union, need to assert very forcefully some important points.  It is the elected Government and Parliament of this Republic that get to set our tax policy.  Ireland is not, never was and never will be a tax haven, but neither will we be a tax collector or clearing house for taxes that may be owed to other states across the Union or anywhere else for that matter. </p> <p>The tax policies in this Republic should be applied to everyone equally and equitably, regardless of who one is or whom one represents.  As the share of capital enjoyed by working people and other citizens across the world diminishes, and as we see how the top 0.1% live and behave, tax justice is becoming an increasingly important principle.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerald Nash:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2281"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2281&amp;amp;pid=GeraldNash&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Tax justice is becoming an increasingly important principle, and Ireland and the EU have a major role to play in this regard to redress the balance.</p><p>I agree that all corporations must pay their fair share of tax generated and owed in Ireland.  I was a member of the Government and worked with the former Minister, Deputy Howlin, and others to end the so-called double Irish rule.  We had to put an end to the murky practice of profit shifting and running profits through brass plate companies.  We worked with the OECD to, in a sense, lead the way on those reforms.  The Commission has recognised the fact that the practice it investigated has been closed down.</p><p>The Minister will recall that we engaged in an intensive diplomatic effort and a lobbying offensive to explain this to other countries and existing businesses that are located here, and to make sure there was clarity about the intentions of the Irish Government around the ending of the so-called double Irish rule and certainty for investors.  Those of us who are interested in the creation of good, decent jobs know how important that is.  The pipeline for foreign direct investment is continuing apace.  We can take it from that that the reassurances that we provided to international investors in terms of Ireland's tax policy have reassured them that investing in Ireland is a safe option.</p><p>Some here are calling for the immediate allocation of &euro;13 billion that, as Senator O'Donnell said, we simply do not have and we might never see even a portion of.  The OECD said most of it belongs to the US, something of which we need to be mindful.  It is not clear, based on the fiscal rules under which we now operate, whether all or a portion of this money, if it became available to us, could be spent by us on housing and transport projects and health infrastructure that the State needs.  That alone is another good reason, if one was needed, for the current Government to heed Deputy Howlin's call for a relaxation of the fiscal straitjacket in order to allow us to spend more of our own resources on the critical infrastructure we as a society and economy need.</p><p>In terms of tax policy, I ask that the Minister reconsider the proposal made by my colleague, Deputy Burton, to have a standing commission on taxation.  Tax policies and initiatives that may have been established in the past or will be in the future, with very good intentions, may subsequently reveal significant loopholes that well-paid tax lawyers and accountants are only too happy and able to navigate around for their blue-chip clients.</p><p>We have a very static system which has very limited ways of responding to anomalies in the tax system outside of the cumbersome processes we apply to the annual Finance Bill.  A standing commission, similar to the Company Law Review Group, for example, in terms of how it approaches its work, would be a good model to allow us to identify and close loopholes before they do untold damage to our system, public confidence in it and tax schemes into the future.</p></speech>

I come from the local electoral area where the Apple facility in Cork is based.  It is a mixed area, in that a large section comprises local authority housing where at one time unemployment reached well over 50%.  It is an extremely important facility in Cork, in terms of the contribution it is making to the local economy.</p> <p>In real terms, about 18,000 jobs in Ireland are a result of Apple and all of the spin-off enterprises associated with it.  At an average salary of &euro;40,000, the contribution to the economy per annum is about &euro;720 million.  That shows the commitment Apple has given to Ireland.  It came to Cork in 1980, stayed there, continued to expand and grow its facility and provided jobs for Irish people.  Over 5,000 people now work in the facility in Cork, and there are plans to expand that to over 6,000.  It is a significant contributor to the national and local economy because it pays commercial rates and local taxes.  </p> <p>We seem to ignore the contribution companies make at a local level in terms of paying rates.  I produced a summary of the rate contributions of the ten largest companies in Cork.  Cork County Council collects &euro;118 million in rates, of which the top ten companies paid &euro;27 million.  In Cork city, out of &euro;61 million collected, the top ten companies paid &euro;9 million.  One of the local authorities in Dublin collected &euro;314 million in rates, of which the top ten companies paid &euro;77 million.  These companies are making significant contributions, not only to the national but also local economies.  The rates being collected contribute to providing local services, whether that involves ensuring local authorities can deliver amenities, housing and other things.  It is important that we recognise that fact.</p> <p>In addition to the employment Apple is providing in Ireland, it has also agreed to proceed with a &euro;850 million data centre in Athenry, which is another significant investment.  Apple has made a major contribution to this country.  There are 18,000 jobs in Ireland as a result of its investment.  </p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in opposed Ireland joining the European Union.  At the time, there were 1 million people working in the country.  There are now 2 million people in the country working, which is a result of our progressive policies in regard to attracting companies like Apple and making sure they received the necessary support to stay and provide jobs.  That is an extremely important point.  We must keep in mind the contribution these companies are making and will continue to make.  It is important that we appeal the decision.</p> <p>Unlike what my colleagues say, I believe that if the Irish Government did not join in this appeal Apple would have appealed it.  The required money would not have been available.  Apple will appeal the decision all the way.  Ireland has to appeal the decision because we must protect our sovereignty regarding making decisions on tax policy.  I fully support the Minister and Government in lodging the appeal.</p></speech>

I will not repeat the points my colleagues have made.</p><p>I have some questions for the Minister.  Was a special deal done between the State and Apple?  The chief financial executive of Apple said to US politicians: </p><blockquote>Since the early 1990s the government of Ireland has calculated Apple's taxable income in such a way as to produce an effective rate in the low single digits.  The rate has varied from year to year, but since 2003 has been 2% or less. </blockquote> <p>In 2009 and 2010 it paid less than 1% in tax and in 2011 it paid 0.05%.  The Minister has said the answer is &quot;No&quot;, so why did the chief financial executive say what he said?  It is simple question.  It seems very odd.  Was he having a bad day?  Was he on some kind of recreational drugs at that point?  </p><p>The Minister said, &quot;We have a proven track record in international tax reform and a strong commitment to meeting the best international standards.&quot;  Is the Minister having a laugh?  The world and its wife knows that we have been a haven regarding tax and tax avoidance for years.  The Apple tax deal is evidence of this.  The Minister does not have to take my word for it; that is what the chief financial executive of Apple had to say.</p></speech>

The laugh is the contribution of some Members opposite.  Senator Burke made a very good point.  This is about the economy, job creation, ensuring that we can bring people from abroad to work here and creating full employment.  Whatever Senators want to say about the Minister for Finance during his tenure in the Department, the one thing he has been driven by is rescuing our country, getting people back to work and creating the opportunity for all of us, no matter who we are, to have a decent and fair standard of living.  The laugh is not on the Government or Apple; rather, it is on those on the hard left who oppose everything.</p> <p>I will put this in context.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Apple has been good for Cork.

Let us put it in context.  Some 140,000 people are directly employed in more than 700 US firms in Ireland, which accounts for 74% of all IDA-supported employment.  US firms contribute &euro;3 billion to the Irish Exchequer in taxes and an additional &euro;13 billion in expenditure in the Irish economy in terms of payroll, goods and services.  Considering that US investment in 2015 accounted for 74% of all foreign direct investment in Ireland, it is important that we not only support but work with the US firms that form a critical part of Ireland's jobs, infrastructure and industries.  Those figures are coming from the US chamber of commerce, not from Government or from me.</p></speech>

The point that the Senator and some of those who oppose this are missing is that Apple, as Senator Burke rightly said, was going to appeal it anyway.  What we must do is ensure that we have sovereignty and reassert our primacy in terms of our corporation tax by appealing the ruling of the European courts.  First, the Commission has not published the full judgment.  Second, it is quite clear that if we do not appeal it, we would be saying that we have been involved in illegal activity, which is what the Senator is accusing us of doing.  We have not been.  We are trying, as we have been doing for a quarter of a century, and for once-----</p></speech>

The appeal is being prepared by the Office of the Attorney General.  She has got two months and ten days to prepare it and then it will be lodged.  The procedure in Europe is that there is the European ordinary court, if I might call it that, which will hear the appeal in the first instance, and then there is the European Court of Justice, which is the court of appeal.  Whoever loses will, I presume, appeal it in the ordinary court.  The process will go on for four years or so, or maybe longer.</p> <p>There are other issues which arise as well in the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.  If one looks at the European Convention on Human Rights, section 6 or section 7 lays down principles of law under which one cannot be the judge, jury and prosecutor in one's own case.  It seems to me that the competition Commission arrived at a decision in 2014, had a process which was supposed to be semi-judicial and arrived back at the same position again two years later.  Under the European Convention of Human Rights, it seems to me that process is not correct.</p> <p>One is not allowed to apply civil or criminal law retrospectively under the European Convention of Human Rights. and, yet in this case, criteria which were only agreed in 2010 were applied retrospectively.  The case being made is that Ireland is owed all of this tax.  In the decision itself, as a number of Senators have said, as well as saying that Ireland did not collect the required amount of tax from Apple and that there are a lot of arrears which are now the responsibility of the Irish authorities to collect, it goes on to say in the accompanying press statement that some of this may not be Ireland's tax at all and maybe it should be that of other European countries.  If Apple paid more tax or returned more income to the US, maybe it was US tax.  My view of law is fairly simple.  One cannot have it both ways.  If the Irish authorities are being required to collect arrears, then the Commission has decided that this money in arrears is appropriate to the Irish Exchequer.  I never signed on in Europe to be the tax collector for Austria or Spain, both of whom are suggesting now that some of the tax may be theirs for iPhones and iPads that were sold from their jurisdictions.  Much of this decision just does not make an awful lot of sense.  It is something that has to be appealed to ensure that we protect our position and our sovereignty.</p> <p>The wider issues are fairly straightforward as well.  Under the European treaties, tax matters and especially tax rates are a matter for sovereign Governments.  That is what the European treaties say, that is what we decided in 1972 and that is what is has remained after the various amendments to the treaties that have occurred.  Yet, now the suggestion is that the rules on state aid are superior to the treaties.  That is like saying that statutory rules, which we will promulgate here, are superior to the Irish Constitution.  There has to be a primacy in law where the treaties are primary and anything else is subsidiary to that.  The commission is turning the legal position on its head.  By the way, I am not proposing, or suggesting, that at this stage, we appeal to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.  However, I am saying that there are other flaws in the approach and we reserve our right to pursue them at a future date, if necessary.  In the meantime, we are going to appeal this decision in the interests of the people.</p> <p>At a meeting of ECOFIN that was extensively reported, the president of ECOFIN said that these were historic and legacy issues as far as Ireland was concerned.  He name checked both the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, and myself and said that the two of us were at the forefront of OECD tax reform.  As far as he was concerned, legacy issues should not be pursued, we should work forward when we reform tax law and that Ireland was at the forefront of the reforming movement on OECD.</p> <p>When the head of taxation at the OECD in Europe, a French socialist lawyer, Pascal Saint-Amans, visited Dublin the week before last, he made it very clear that, as far as he was concerned, if there was a tax liability it was to the US and not to Ireland.  The reason he formed that view is simple.  It is true to say that Apple paid very little tax and the figures that have been put forward by Commissioner Vestager are correct.  However, Apple paid its full tax liability for its Irish activities.  It is probably the biggest corporate tax payer in Ireland.  It did everything necessary in Ireland.  What is being charged is that we should have collected tax from Apple's profits in other jurisdictions.  In the ruling, the Commission makes no distinction between resident and non-resident companies.  Under Irish law, the Irish tax authorities have no liability to collect tax on non-resident companies.  That is for the jurisdiction in which they are resident.  That is one reason I think the European competition Commission is wrong in law.</p> <p>The position on US tax law is that while Apple paid a very low amount of tax, it has a very large tax liability.  However, the way US corporate tax works is that the liability only turns into tax to be paid when the profits are repatriated.  Then tax is paid at 35%.  The low percentage of tax that Apple paid is correct.  However, if one looks at what Apple's tax liability was, it is much larger than that.  The liability is to the US exchequer because it is in the US that economic activity principally occurs that gives rise to the profits that Apple make.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Michael Noonan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=821"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=821&amp;amp;pid=MichaelNoonan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If Members have an Apple iPhone they can see very small print engraved on the back of it - I had to get one of my children to read it for me because my eyes were not good enough - stating that it is designed in California and manufactured in China.  The economic activity, therefore, does not occur in Ireland but in the United States.  Under OECD principles the tax is due to the United States and under US tax law the tax is due in the US but not payable until Apple repatriates its profits.  That is the reason Pascal Saint-Amans of the OECD said that if this tax arrears is due anywhere it is due in the United States.  It is not due in Ireland, therefore why should the responsibility of collecting it rest on the Irish tax authorities?</p><p>I appreciate that the issue is very complex.
